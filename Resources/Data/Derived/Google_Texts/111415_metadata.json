Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is planning to run for president in 2016.\n\nCruz was born in Canada. He doesn't deny it. There's no dispute on the point.\n\nBut because his mother was born in the United States, the argument is that Cruz qualifies based on a number of immigration cases that have been litigated over the years and the thoughts of William Blackstone, an English judge and politician in the 1700s.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on how the words \"natural-born citizen\" would apply to someone who is president of the United States.\n\nAs everyone knows, President Barack Obama has been accused of failing to meet the natural-born test, whatever the test is. The main focus initially was on whether Obama was actually born in Hawaii or a foreign country.\n\nCritics initially ignored the fact that his mother, Ann Durham, was born in Wichita, Kan. Some so-called birthers, responding to the \"mother is all you need for citizenship\" claims, eventually suggested that she wasn't Obama's mother at all.\n\nI'm not going to rehash all those arguments here. You can find most of them on the Internet where there are plenty of folks still claiming that Obama lacks the constitutional qualification to be president.\n\nMy guess is that many ordinary citizens who questioned Obama's citizenship were unaware that having an American-born mother was considered all the qualification needed to meet the test, but Republicans supporting Cruz have been quick to cite all the case law in support of that argument.\n\nThe real question should be, does it really matter whether a president is a natural-born citizen of this country? Does that really mean a person is better qualified for the office, more loyal to the country or has a greater understanding of domestic affairs?\n\nAs for understanding what this country is really all about, I give you Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was denied the opportunity to run for president because he was born in Austria.\n\nSchwarzenegger became famous as a body builder, taking steroids on his way to becoming Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia seven times. Although his English was nearly unintelligible, Schwarzenegger through sure force of will turned himself into a major movie star.\n\nHe became a millionaire, married into the Kennedy family and successfully ran for governor of California as a Republican.\n\nHe also cheated on his wife with the family housekeeper, had a child with her and kept that fact secret for years. Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver were eventually divorced, he left politics after his second term as governor and has returned to the movies.\n\nIs there any greater example of living the American dream? Is there anyone more typically American than this guy?\n\nI don't know what kind of president he would have made, but my guess is that he wouldn't have been any worse than Richard Nixon, whose sanity may have been in question at times but never his birthright.\n\nThe leader of the most powerful nation in the history of the world needs to be a lot of things, but natural-born is not one of them as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSome of the finest Americans I've ever met were not born in this country. They left their native lands, families and homes behind, came here with no money, built businesses, raised families, fought in our wars and made an effort to understand our history, politics and culture.\n\nI've met a lot of people who were born here, on the other hand, who rarely, if ever, vote in elections, couldn't tell you the difference between Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt unless one of them was seated on a horse and believe every wacky email they receive about Obama or the Clintons.\n\nAs we all know, candidates for president undergo personal scrutiny in the news media that often offends the average American. Their marriages, their children, their sisters and brothers, their writings, their actions as college students, their religious beliefs and medical history are all fair game. And what the news media misses, their political opponents discover through opposition research.\n\nYet, their actual histories and records of public service are often ignored by voters in favor of negative TV commercials and social media attacks that exaggerate and distort, or simply lie about all of that.\n\nAfter it's all said and done, after the primary election battles, debates, commercials and news stories, the fact is we never know what kind of president a man, or woman, is going to be until that person takes office. And two of our greatest presidents, Teddy Roosevelt and Harry Truman, would likely never have been elected if sitting presidents had not died in office.\n\nTruman was considered a political machine hack who lacked the brains to run the nation. Roosevelt was viewed as too smart for his own good and too independent. He was a political maverick and reformer who was selected as vice president in an attempt to derail his political career.\n\nYet it's obvious that for many Americans, the idea of being a natural-born citizen of this country remains important. It's part of the Constitution, after all, folks say, and our Founding Fathers knew what they were doing.\n\nBack in the 18th century, these fellows were among the brightest men in the world. But they didn't give women the right to vote, they didn't end slavery and they had just fought a war to free themselves from the iron-fisted rule of an English king.\n\nThey were rightfully fearful that loyalists to a foreign country would attempt to subvert their hard-won freedom by installing a surrogate as president.\n\nToday, however, the natural-born American provision does nothing to ensure our national independence.\n\nAnd as every Illinois resident knows, a politician who is a natural-born American can be a crook, a liar, an egomaniac and incompetent and still get elected to office.\n\nBut it somehow makes people feel better to believe that America is better and the world a safer place with a natural-born citizen running things, even if that means he was born in a foreign country.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Does America need a natural-born president?", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Southtown", "description": "I was thinking of writing something blasting the outdated notion that a U.S. president should be a natural-born citizen when it occurred to me that the American people probably aren't ready for such a dramatic change in the Constitution.", "title": "Does America need a natural-born president?", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/opinion/ct-sta-kadner-president-st-0403-20150402-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-551e9e06/turbine/ct-sta-kadner-president-st-0403-20150402", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.18", "twitter": {"site": "@dailysouthtown", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Phil Kadner, U.S. Sen.
