The recent deaths of two Kansas City firefighters has served as a reminder of the heartache that families of first responders endure for their public service.

Two children of a local firefighter spoke with KMBC's Kisha Henry about what it is like to send their dad, Capt. Chris Wallace, off to work every day to Kansas City Fire Department's Station No. 29.

“As a child, he was always the hero, big guy, big red truck, hose,” Daniel Wallace, 17, said. “But as we got older and matured more, we could see that there's more risk he has to take than just being a hero.”

As Daniel Wallace, and his sister, Erin Wallace, 14, have grown older, they’ve seen more and more of their father's fellow firefighters die in the line of duty.

“It's kind of hard to talk about it at home because it's so close to our hearts, but we make sure we're praying for them every day,” Erin Wallace said.

“It's more real, the presence of the risk that he could just not come home one day,” Daniel Wallace said.

The siblings said during their father’s 30-year career, the fire department has become their family.

“I know what they're doing is the right thing, and they're helping people that need it,” Daniel Wallace said.

Daniel and Erin Wallace said they make sure to cherish every second they get with their dad.

“I don't really get to see him until that night, but I always make sure I give him a hug,” Erin Wallace said.

“Some people take it lightly and think if you're a firefighter, you're a macho man, you get all the ladies, all that, but you have to risk your life every day,” Daniel Wallace said. “These firefighters are making a big sacrifice to do it.”

Daniel and Erin Wallace said their father has inspired them to become public servants as well. Daniel Wallace is considering becoming a firefighter, and Erin Wallace knows she wants to help people, too.
