Billy C. Wirtz.\n\nWirtz never had a church, but he gathered a flock of followers for his First House of Polyester Worship, a spoof of TV preachers. Playing the keyboards with Jerry Lee Lewis gusto, he turned out a dozen albums of humorous and clever rockabilly and blues songs rooted in Southern redneck culture.\n\nThe album titles alone reveal a twisted sense of humor from \u201cSalvation Through Polyester\u201d(1982) through \u201cDeep Fried & Sanctified\u201d (1989) to \u201cBackslider\u2019s Tractor Pull\u201d (1990), \u201cConfessions of the Hillbilly Love God\u201d (1994) and \u201cBest of Wirtz: 15 years on the Road with a 77-inch Piano\u201d (2001).\n\nAmong his songs: \u201cWhat I Used To Do All Night Long Takes Me All Night Long to Do,\u201d \u201cThe Waffle House Fire,\u201d \u201cWWED (What Would Elvis Do),\u201d \u201cStairway to Freebird\u201d and-\u201cLookout! Grandma\u2019s Behind the Wheel.\u201d\n\nWirtz gained a Tampa following through frequent appearances at the annual Halloween Freaker\u2019s Ball at Skipper\u2019s Smokehouse and through airplay of his songs on community radio WMNF (88.5 FM).\n\nNow, after more than 30 years on the road, playing clubs, pubs and dives from Florida to New York and from the Carolinas to California, Wirtz says he settling down, dividing most of his performances between Tampa and Ocala. And he\u2019s still writing new comedy songs.\n\n\u201cAt 59, going up and down that road from Waffle House to Waffle House takes its toll,\u201d he says. I\u2019m battling a six millimeter kidney stone inside me as we speak. I\u2019ve got a few dates in California and the mid-Atlantic this year but I\u2019m wanting to make Tampa part of my base.\u201d\n\nHe has a regular gig on Thursday nights from 7 to 9 p.m. at Ella\u2019s Folk Art Caf\u00e9 in Seminole Heights and has joined WMNF (88.5 FM) as a host of Rev. Billy\u2019s Rhythm Revival (blues, gospel and rockabilly) from 2 to 4 p.m. on Fridays. He performed at the Ringside Caf\u00e9 in St. Petersburg last week and is scheduled again for Tuesday night and July 29. \u201cI do the full on old-school Rev. Billy at Ringside,\u201d he says, \u201cAt Ella\u2019s, I mix my stuff with some Ray Charles, Johnny Cash or Floyd Cramer. It\u2019s a challenge because I\u2019m playing for people who may have never heard of Rev. Billy.\u201d\n\nIn Ocala, he plays The Infinite Ale Works and The Braised Onion, a high-end food-and-jazz restaurant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming back from a crash and burn that took a toll on my health,\u201d says Wirtz. \u201cI was on and off pain pills for several years and got addicted.\u201d A lung infection in 2006 resulted in surgery and time off. In 2010, he slipped and blew out a knee.\n\n\u201cBeing a self-employed traveling musician, I was without health insurance until the Affordable Care Act was passed,\u201d he says.\n\nHe sought temporary treatments such as injections of chicken fat. \u201cIt didn\u2019t cure my knee but I got (excited) every time I passed a Kentucky Fried Chicken,\u201d he jokes. A Texas doctor that he met while performing on a blues cruise offered a free knee replacement, and in 2012 he got the operation. He also credits medical marijuana with getting him off narcotics and tobacco.\n\nErnie Locke, also a musician and co-owner of Ella\u2019s, says he has known Wirtz for years, going back to the 1980s when Locke was working at a used record store in Kansas City. \u201cWe\u2019re both music freaks and share a love of music history,\u201d says Wirtz.\n\n\u201cI think Rev. Billy is a treasure, and he deserves to be heard,\u201d says Locke. \u201cI was happy to get him in here on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nWirtz is more than just a comedy act. He calls himself \u201ca person of interest.\u201d He\u2019s been a special education teacher, a wrestling manager, a music critic and magazine columnist, a radio disc jockey and an author (check out \u201cRed Headed Geek: My Short and Painful Career as a Rasslin\u2019 Manager\u201d on Amazon).\n\nWirtz had a brief stint on World Championship Wrestling as a \u201cmanager\u201d for \u201cMedian\u201d Knight, the Nasty Boys, Gigolo Jimmy Backlund, and Diamond Dallas Paige and was the house musician for the WCW\u2019s Monday night telecasts. He says he learned \u201crassling may be fixed but it ain\u2019t fake.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the WMNF radio show, I try to educate and entertain,\u201d says Wirtz, who brings in music from his personal collection. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of rhythm and blues and gospel is my specialty. What a lot of people have heard is the second and third generation of songs. I want to play the originals going back to artists like Muddy Waters and Hank Ballard. I love sharing this music. Between playing at Ella\u2019s and WMNF, it\u2019s a dream come true for me\u201d", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Fri, 18 Jul 2014 10:00:06 -0400", "Description": "In 1977, an irreverent prankster named William McLean Wirths, a special education major at James Madison University, became an ordained minister via a mail order certificate from what he recalls was", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "In 1977, an irreverent prankster named William McLean Wirths, a special education major at James Madison University, became an ordained minister via a mail order certificate from what he recalls was", "title": "Rev.
