That means that in our service area there are tens of thousands of individuals who can\u2019t afford health insurance and will receive no assistance under the Affordable Care Act \u2026 We can provide those high-quality services at a reasonable cost.\u201d\n\nThe core mission of Planned Parenthood clinics across the country remains abortion services. As a result, controversy follows the clinics. That\u2019s why at least once a week, a pair of abortion protesters quietly stand outside the Jacksonville clinic, holding signs proclaiming their opposition.\n\nOn a recent morning, the signs read, \u201cPlanned Parenthood kills 900 babies daily.\u201d\n\nThe clinic staff goes on about its business, meeting whatever health-care needs that day\u2019s patients require.\n\n\u201cI understand that people are passionate about this issue and I respect their right to voice their belief in a lawful, peaceable way,\u201d said board chairwoman Kirsten Doolittle. \u201cOur goal \u2026 is to make sure that all women have access to excellent health care, so that they can lead happy and productive lives. \u201c\n\nEach affiliate determines exactly which abortion services and other services are available at individual clinics, based on provider availability and training in specific areas, available space and community needs, Fraley said.\n\nThe Jacksonville clinic, headquarters of the 25-county North Florida affiliate, offers medical abortions, which is the use of a pill to end early pregnancy up to nine weeks. The affiliate\u2019s other clinics in Gainesville and Tallahassee provide only abortion referrals.\n\nJacksonville has the abortion pill service because that clinic has both an ultrasound machine \u2014 purchased with a grant a few years ago \u2014 and physicians available in the community.\n\nBut Fraley and Doolittle want people to know the rest of the local Planned Parenthood story.\n\nThe Jacksonville clinic also provides annual physical exams, men\u2019s health care, vasectomies, breast exams, HPV vaccinations, HIV and STD testing, pregnancy testing and related services, pap smears, contraception, health-care services for the gay community and educational programs, among other things.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most people understand that our services include basic well care and education,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cOur community has several public health problems, not the least of which is Jacksonville\u2019s rate of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Planned Parenthood provides education and prevention programs throughout the community.\u201d\n\nSince recently relocating from Beach Boulevard, the clinic can accommodate far more patients at its new site, which has double the space. It now accepts Florida Blue insurance and is working to add other plans, she said, but uses donations to help keep costs down for the uninsured.\n\nA sampling of clinic fees are $50 to $60 plus any needed lab work for a \u201cproblem visit,\u201d $145 to $165 depending on age for a full panel of sexually transmitted disease testing and $100 to $200 \u2014 depending on age \u2014 for a well-woman exam, about half what a private physician charges, she said.\n\nBrad Straley is president of Jacksonville for Life, a group that according to its website works \u201cto help mothers, save babies and spread a culture of life in Jacksonville.\u201d He said he is unmoved by the push to expand the local Planned Parenthood affiliate\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s largest abortion provider can call themselves whatever they would like,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you do more abortions than anyone else in the entire world and the vast majority of your domestic business is abortion \u2026 you kill babies for a living.\u201d\n\nBut representatives of area health-care organizations said the community can only benefit from having more low-cost clinic options.\n\n\u201cEquitable access to preventive health-care services is absolutely essential to support, sustain and improve the health status of a community,\u201d said Nikole Helvey, interim CEO of the Health Planning Council of Northeast Florida.\n\nAn estimated 1 million Florida adults are not eligible for Medicaid and do not qualify for tax subsidies or premium assistance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, she said.\n\n\u201cThey remain completely without health coverage, and subsequently many live without access to even the most basic primary health care and preventive health services,\u201d she said. \u201cOrganizations such as Planned Parenthood are trusted and well-positioned entities in their local communities to offer and coordinate a variety of key primary and preventative health services.\u201d\n\nHealth care is especially critical for women in their childbearing years, whether they want children or not, said Jennifer Gornto, executive director of the Northeast Florida Healthy Start Coalition.\n\nBeth Reese Cravey: (904) 359-4109", "article_metadata": {"description": "The newly opened medical clinic on Jacksonville\u2019s Southside offers a wide range of services, including annual health exams, men\u2019s and women\u2019s health care, vasectomies and breast exams.The people who run the nonprofit clinic on Powers Avenue hope to provide a low-cost health-care option for the newly insured under the federal Affordable Health Care marketplace as well as people who fall between the cracks of qualifying for Medicaid and buying health insurance.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "Planned Parenthood of North Florida has moved into new quarters and is working to increase public awareness that it offers a range of health services.
