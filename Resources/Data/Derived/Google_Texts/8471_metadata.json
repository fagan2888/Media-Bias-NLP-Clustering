You would think we were in the 1950s\u201d before going on to push the party\u2019s legislative remedy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Democrats in Congress have developed legislation that would override the Supreme Court\u2019s wrong-headed decision. We want to get 100,000 signatures to show that there\u2019s public support for preserving women\u2019s basic health care rights,\u201d the email reads.\n\nThe Senate version of the bill, according to multiple media reports, will be cosponsored by Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Mark Udall of Colorado.\n\nMs. Murray and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid both joined the DCCC in pushing the sexism angle.\n\n\u201cYour health care decisions are not your boss\u2019s business. Since the Supreme Court decided it will not protect women\u2019s access to health care, I will,\u201d said Ms. Murray, who was first voted into the Senate in the 1992 \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d election.\n\nMr. Reid told reporters Tuesday that \u201cthe one thing we\u2019re going to do during this work period, sooner rather than later, is to ensure that women\u2019s lives are not determined by virtue of five white men.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what Mr. Reid can make happen on the Murray-Udall bill, its chances in the House appear slim. That chamber\u2019s leaders applauded the Hobby Lobby decision as a victory for religious freedom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats indicated Tuesday they plan to double down in their \"war on women\" theme and their attacks on the Supreme Court's decision in the Hobby Lobby religious-freedom case.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Democrats indicated Tuesday they plan to double down in their \u201cwar on women\u201d theme and their attacks on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby religious-freedom case.", "title": "Senate Democrats plan bill to reimpose Obamacare birth-control mandate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/8/senate-democrats-plan-bill-reimpose-obamacare-birt/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/10/41f82db6c9e772054b0f6a706700a2de.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/10/41f82db6c9e772054b0f6a706700a2de.jpg", "description": "Democrats indicated Tuesday they plan to double down in their \"war on women\" theme and their attacks on the Supreme Court's decision in the Hobby Lobby religious-freedom case.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate Democrats plan bill to reimpose Obamacare birth-control mandate"}, "Author": "Victor Morton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Social Issues, Supreme Court, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee"}, "article_summary": "That chamber\u2019s leaders applauded the Hobby Lobby decision as a victory for religious freedom.\nDemocrats indicated Tuesday they plan to double down in their \u201cwar on women\u201d theme and their attacks on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby religious-freedom case.\nWe want to get 100,000 signatures to show that there\u2019s public support for preserving women\u2019s basic health care rights,\u201d the email reads.\n\u201cYour health care decisions are not your boss\u2019s business.\nThe DCCC email expresses bewilderment that \u201cfive Supreme Court Justices \u2014 all of them men \u2014 decided that a corporation\u2019s beliefs can override a woman\u2019s access to contraceptive coverage."}
