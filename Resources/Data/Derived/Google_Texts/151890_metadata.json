In fact, he hadn\u2019t played in a month.\n\nHe flirted with returning to the lineup from an ankle injury a few days earlier, but he couldn\u2019t. Yet he was right on time when the Nuggets needed him against the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nFirst off, the Nuggets wouldn\u2019t have had any true point guards without him. And while they had gotten by with just one point guard in his absence, zero at the position would have been difficult to endure.\n\nBut there he was, starting after missing 14 games, and he was on fire early. Mudiay made his first three shots, scoring seven points, and that got the Nuggets off to a good start in what became a 95-92 victory at the Pepsi Center.\n\n\u201cIt felt good,\u201d said Mudiay of the ankle injury that had sidelined him since Dec. 11. \u201cI came back and played. That\u2019s the main thing: I just wanted to get out there again and see how I felt, and I felt pretty good.\u201d\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nThe game wasn\u2019t without its pitfalls.\n\nThe second quarter was rough again.\n\n\u201cSecond quarter, I felt we came out and played as individuals,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.\n\nThe Nuggets had scored just five points in the first 7:20 of the quarter and were outscored 21-2 in one span of 4 minutes, 37 seconds. The Hornets, who had been down by as many 13 points in the quarter, erased the entire deficit and took a six-point lead. The Nuggets saved themselves a deeper deficit by outscoring Charlotte 12-9 to end the quarter and go into halftime down just three.\n\nThe Nuggets settled into a better defensive posture in the third, holding the Hornets to just 31 percent from the field. And with a firm foothold, they settled in and just played in the fourth.\n\nMudiay, who had been mostly eliminated from finishing games before he got injured, was on the court in the fourth quarter and in the mix of the game.\n\nWith 9:26 left, Mudiay stole the ball from Jeremy Lamb, then sprinted out as the loose ball fell to the Nuggets. Mike Miller hit him on the break, and Mudiay finished with a dunk. It was the highlight of a 9-2 run gave the Nuggets enough separation to hold Charlotte off the rest of the way.\n\nPHOTOS: Here are the best action shots from the Nuggets win over Hornets\n\n\u201cIn the second half, we held that team to 36 points and 24 percent from the field,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI thought our defense was terrific.\u201d\n\nThe win snapped a four-game home losing streak and was exactly the way the Nuggets wanted to start off this season-long, eight-game homestand. Charlotte was struggling coming into the contest, and the Nuggets sent them to their seventh consecutive loss, but there have been no gimme games for the Nuggets this season. They\u2019ve had to earn each of their wins.\n\nAnd so they\u2019ll take it.\n\nMudiay finished the night with 11 points, six assists and four rebounds. Danilo Gallinari continued his aggressive play, scoring 27 points on 7-of-18 shooting.\n\n\u201cIt was an ugly win at the end, but I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cWe needed one. We needed this one to open up the homestand.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets beat Hornets in Emmanuel Mudiay\u2019s return", "title": "Nuggets beat Hornets in Emmanuel Mudiay\u2019s return", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/10/nuggets-beat-hornets-in-emmanuel-mudiays-return/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160110__bkn-mudiayp1.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160110__bkn-mudiayp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-10T20:32:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:06:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Yet he was right on time when the Nuggets needed him against the Charlotte Hornets.\n\u201cSecond quarter, I felt we came out and played as individuals,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.\nThe Nuggets settled into a better defensive posture in the third, holding the Hornets to just 31 percent from the field.\nFor at least one quarter Sunday night, Emmanuel Mudiay looked as though he had never left.\nThe Nuggets saved themselves a deeper deficit by outscoring Charlotte 12-9 to end the quarter and go into halftime down just three."}
