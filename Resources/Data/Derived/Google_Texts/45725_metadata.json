Jay Rockefeller Jay RockefellerLobbying world Overnight Tech: Senators place holds on FCC commissioner Overnight Tech: Senate panel to vote on Dem FCC commissioner MORE (D-W.Va.), the retiring chairman of the Commerce Committee, said in a statement. \"With the data of millions more at risk, Americans should start asking their senators and representatives why there are no basic protections in place to safeguard them.\u201d\n\nCongress has tried before, most recently in the wake of the Target hack. And Home Depot adds a newer dynamic to the mix.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be even more of an impact than Target in terms of impacting our members and consumers and credit unions,\u201d said the National Association of Federal Credit Union\u2019s Carrie Hunt, senior vice president of government affairs and general counsel.\n\nThe Target fallout pitted banks and credit unions against the retail industry, with each side pointing the finger at who should pick up the tab for replacing the millions of dollars it costs to replace consumer cards.\n\nThe blame game ended in a rare merging of political policy foes. Both industries, led by the Financial Services Roundtable and Retail Industry Leaders Association, collaborated to form an center for sharing information with each other, in order to protect against possible vulnerabilities.\n\nBut Congress still has a role to play. One popular proposed remedy, which was the subject of multiple lawmakers\u2019 bills, is the creation of a national standard for notifying people after their data my have been stolen.\n\nForty-seven states and the District of Columbia have enacted their own data breach notification laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but none exists at the federal level. Companies complain that leaves them with a dizzying maze of rules to deal with.\n\n\u201cThat creates unnecessary complexity and risk in terms of getting the notices out to people,\u201d said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president at the National Retail Federation, a major trade group.\n\nOther proposals would give the Federal Trade Commission more power to oversee how companies protect people\u2019s data, but industry groups have largely prickled at the notion of having the government set standards on evolving technology.\n\nThe Electronic Transaction Association (ETA), whose members include American Express, MasterCard and Visa, is cautious against new regulations, fearing that it would only add to state regulations and not be able to keep up with new technology.\n\n\u201cSelf-regulatory guidelines effectively ensure that consumer data is secure,\u201d said ETA spokeswoman Meghan M.
