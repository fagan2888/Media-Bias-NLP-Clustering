Earlier this year, agency officials cited rising pharmacy costs as one of the primary reasons why insurance rates were increasing so much for 2016.\n\nHMO premiums increased 7.2% for 2016, while rates for PPO, or preferred provider organization, plans went up even more at 10.8%, on average.\n\nApart from specialty drugs, the top-selling medications at CalPERS were acid-reflux pill Nexium, bipolar drug Abilify and asthma inhaler Advair. Painkiller Oxycontin rounded out the Top 10 with $16.4 million, according to claims data.\n\nCalPERS staff presented the latest data to the agency\u2019s Pension and Health Benefits committee Tuesday.\n\nKathy Donneson, chief of the agency\u2019s health plan administration division, said CalPERS is exploring different options for controlling prescription drug spending in order to minimize the impact on premiums.\n\nInterested in the stories shaping California?

CalPERS wants to \u201ckeep pharmacy trend from blowing through the roof as we look at\u201d future premiums.\n\nCommittee members noted, however, that some increases in prescription drug spending can save money in the long run by avoiding hospitalizations and other costly care later on. They asked staff to report back on any studies shedding light on that trade-off in spending.\n\nGilead Sciences Inc. has defended the value of its hepatitis C drugs like Sovaldi because they offer high cure rates and avoid the long-term medical expenses related to liver failure, cancer and transplants.\n\nThe agency's healthcare trends are closely watched across the country as a harbinger of what big employers and their workers might be facing.\n\nThe high prices of specialty medications have drawn the ire of lawmakers, health insurers and patients for months.\n\nTuesday, officials in the health insurance industry seized on the California data to press for more transparency from drugmakers on how they set their prices.\n\n\"We have seen national reports of spikes in drug pricing, and now we see the impact right here in California,\" said Charles Bacchi, chief executive of the California Assn. of Health Plans, an industry trade group. These increases are \"not sustainable for public employees \u2013 or really any healthcare consumer.\"\n\nAt CalPERS, rheumatoid arthritis drugs Enbrel and Humira topped the list of costliest specialty drugs for 2014. Together, CalPERS spent $91 million on the two medications, or nearly 5% of total drug spending.\n\nPrescription drug costs increased nearly 8% overall at CalPERS for 2014.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune\n\nALSO\n\nHiltzik: The myth of 'consumer-driven healthcare' comes to life again\n\nConsumer prices hold steady in November, but other inflation signs point toward Fed rate hike\n\nColumn: We've learned nothing from the subprime mortgage meltdown.
