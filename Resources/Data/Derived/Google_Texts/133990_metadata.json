The company has said it is banking on increasing diesel exports out of the U.S. by more than 25% over the next few years.\n\nMr. Klesse\u2019s concern stems from his vigorous approach to protecting market share. The U.S. position in the world fuel market turned on its head two years ago when the country become a net exporter of fuel. U.S. refiners have been making massive profits taking cheap U.S. and Canadian crude, refining it and then shipping their products world-wide.\n\nConsider this: As recently as May 2010, the U.S. imported an average of 873,000 barrels a day more fuel than it exported. But last week net fuel exports from the U.S. were 1.5 million barrels a day, on average, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank doesn\u2019t get CEO letters of protest very often, but still believes in the project, according to spokesman Phil Cogan. The Turkish refiner wants to use the borrowed funds to buy equipment and parts for the refinery from companies based in the U.S, he said. Valero may feel stung, but the bank expects the Istanbul deal pay off, with interest, while supporting 3,000 U.S. jobs.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Valero Energy Feels Stung Over Turkish Refinery Plan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/23/valero-energy-feels-stung-over-turkish-refinery-plan/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Valero Energy Feels Stung Over Turkish Refinery Plan", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Ben Lefebvre", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-23T20:16:42-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/23/valero-energy-feels-stung-over-turkish-refinery-plan/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-3301", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/23/valero-energy-feels-stung-over-turkish-refinery-plan/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "title": "Valero Energy Feels Stung Over Turkish Refinery Plan"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-3301", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-23T20:16:47-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Bloomberg News A tanker truck passes a Valero Energy Corp. refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas.\nThe Turkish refiner wants to use the borrowed funds to buy equipment and parts for the refinery from companies based in the U.S, he said.\nThe U.S. position in the world fuel market turned on its head two years ago when the country become a net exporter of fuel.\n\u201cThe new Turkish refinery will be a direct competitor of U.S. refineries in the global market,\u201d Mr. Klesse said in a letter provided to The Wall Street Journal.\nValero may feel stung, but the bank expects the Istanbul deal pay off, with interest, while supporting 3,000 U.S. jobs."}
