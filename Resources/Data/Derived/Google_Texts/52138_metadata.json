Jeb Bush has been one of those pushing the idea of teaching kids critical thinking rather than rote memorization; it\u2019s what they do in other industrialized countries, and it\u2019s why they\u2019re pulling ahead of us in test scores. Ironically, it\u2019s the current \u201cteaching to the test,\u201d rather than inculcating a reasoning process, that is causing our students to fare so comparatively poorly. They can pass a standardized exam, but they can\u2019t think on their feet.\n\nThe crowd that reliably rails about government overreach \u2014 the folks who view Obamacare as another example of Big Brother\u2019s sweaty embrace \u2014 have been thrown this new bone to gnaw on without, as usual, really knowing what it is they\u2019re protesting.\n\nThe reflexive opposition to Common Core has reached such an intensity that Gov. Bush, in an attempt to maintain his presidential viability, actually had to make a statement declaring that he would stack up his conservative credentials against anyone else in the field.\n\nEven Bush, who is a true movement conservative, knows that there is a point where rebelling against anything that happens to come out of the central government \u2014 just because it does \u2014 becomes absurd. Common Core is respected and has supporters on all sides of the political spectrum. The problem is that those who hate it tend to base their objections on visceral reactions, and they happen to be those who vote in Republican primaries.\n\nJeb is a smart guy; he\u2019ll figure out a way to thread this needle by 2016 if he wants to. In any case, the biggest problem he still faces at this point is his last name.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Common Core, Jeb Bush, education, standardized testing, Republican primaries, 2016, Obamacare, Big Brother, Chan Lowe", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "Common Core is an educational concept that isn\u2019t being fought over for its actual content; it\u2019s its symbolic value that\u2019s causing all the controversy. \u00a0 For years, former Gov....", "title": "Common Core controversy", "url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-11-20/news/sfl-common-core-controversy-20131120_1_common-core-chan-lowe-test-scores", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-528d2d6b/turbine/sfl-common-core-controversy-20131120-001/555/555x384", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 143455335716926}, "description": "Common Core is an educational concept that isn\u2019t being fought over for its actual content; it\u2019s its symbolic value that\u2019s causing all the controversy. \u00a0 For years, former Gov."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc213\"", "article_summary": "Common Core is an educational concept that isn\u2019t being fought over for its actual content; it\u2019s its symbolic value that\u2019s causing all the controversy.\nCommon Core is respected and has supporters on all sides of the political spectrum.\nThe reflexive opposition to Common Core has reached such an intensity that Gov.\nJeb is a smart guy; he\u2019ll figure out a way to thread this needle by 2016 if he wants to.\nIn any case, the biggest problem he still faces at this point is his last name."}
