Those include people applying for the first time as well as people submitting their annual applications to continue coverage.\n\nMitzi McFatrich, executive director of Kansas Advocates for Better Care, a group that lobbies on behalf of nursing home residents, said that backlog ultimately affects the quality of care patients receive because some facilities do not have the financial resources it takes to provide care for months on end without compensation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a lot of reports about how long the backlog is,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of one person who applied in September, had all the required information submitted by November and was still waiting to hear back in January. He was finally approved in February, but during that time he\u2019d been to four different nursing homes and four psychiatric facilities because nobody wanted to rack up the expense of caring for him for however many months it would take.\u201d\n\nMcFatrich said she has also heard reports of people calling KDHE to find out the status of their applications and being put on hold for as long as an hour and a half.\n\nKDHE spokeswoman Cassie Sparks attributed the backlog to three factors: a new automated application system that went live last year; an administrative move that shifted responsibility for processing Medicaid applications for elderly and disabled individuals to KDHE instead of the Department for Children and Families; and the federal government's open enrollment for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which she said increased Medicaid applications by 40 percent in November, December and January.\n\n\"KDHE is taking steps to improve wait times including adding staff and allowing additional time to return voicemails. Process improvements have also been made to address caller questions in a more timely manner,\" Sparks said.\n\nUnder the Medicaid program, nursing homes are entitled to receive retroactive payments for care they have provided while an application has been pending.\n\nBut McFatrich said she is also concerned about Medicaid beneficiaries who receive home and community based services \u2014 typically nonmedical services that enable elderly and disabled individuals who would otherwise qualify for long-term care to stay at home \u2014 because those providers are not entitled to retroactive payment.\n\n\u201cThose people are at risk of institutionalization because they\u2019re not going to get the help they need,\u201d she said.\n\nState Sen. Laura Kelly, D-Topeka, who serves on a committee that oversees the state Medicaid program, known as KanCare, said she has been hearing complaints about the backlog as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly hearing from nursing home folks, generally the family of somebody who is in a nursing home,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to reapply every year. So what\u2019s happening is they are getting dropped, and then they\u2019re having to go through extraordinary hoops to get back on. Providers have to decide whether to keep them in the nursing home or kick them out.\u201d\n\nShe said she expects the KanCare oversight committee to ask questions about the backlog and review the advance payment system at its next meeting April 18.\n\nIn its message to providers, KDHE said nursing homes and other long-term care facilities can apply for advance payments for patients whose applications have been pending longer than 60 days. It said priority will be given to smaller facilities, as opposed to large, corporate-owned facilities.\n\nKDHE said once a nursing home applies for advance payment on behalf of a patient, the agency will conduct a \"high-level triage\" within 15 days to determine his or her likelihood of becoming eligible.\n\nOnce a patient has been approved for advance payment, KDHE will authorize payments through one of the private insurance companies that manage the program.\n\nHowever, if the patient is later deemed to be ineligible, KDHE said, the nursing homes will be expected to refund the advance payments within 30 days, or else the balance will be deducted from future payments to that facility.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
