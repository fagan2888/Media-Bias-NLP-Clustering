But a budget that is being considered by state lawmakers does not include enough money to keep the trains running south of Portland, according to the report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Oregon's lack of dedicated, sustainable funding for rail investments is the number one challenge facing a viable rail system for both passenger and freight in Oregon. Without such funding, Oregon does not have revenue available for the required match for federal or private funds to improve rail service, nor the substantial revenue to maintain current infrastructure or operate services already in place,\" state lawmakers said in a report about their proposed budget, according to the paper.\n\nThe Cascades Line is one of nearly 30 state-supported Amtrak routes that have become popular with state lawmakers as a way to boost commuter rail service within their jurisdictions.\n\nAmtrak has said its state-supported routes were responsible for 14.7 million of its 30.9 million overall passengers in the 2014 fiscal year, which concluded at the end of September. The Cascades line carried 782,519 passengers during that period, according to the company.\n\nOfficials with the Oregon Transportation Department have said the Beaver State\u2019s portion of the Cascade line could be cut as early as this summer if state lawmakers do not appropriate enough money to cover its operations.\n\n\"ODOT would need to give Amtrak 90-day notice to stop service but this would not occur until the 2015 session has been completed,\u201d the department's government relations manager, Leah Craft, said, according to the report.\n\n\u201cShould the legislature adjourn without funding passenger rail, ODOT would proceed with stopping service but not until that point,\" she continued.\n\nSupporters of the Oregon Amtrak route argue that the state\u2019s portion of the line should be saved.\n\n\u201cAmazingly, Oregon is preparing to shut down its passenger rail service between Eugene and Portland in July or soon thereafter for lack of state funding,\u201d the Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocates says in a post on its website.\n\n\u201cThe Cascades Corridor south of Portland will be gone, and the only passenger train remaining on the line will be the long-haul Coast Starlight,\u201d the post continued. \u201cOregon\u2019s Amtrak Cascades service needs $10.4 million to continue operations for the coming two years. However, the Joint Ways and Means Committee has cut that figure to less than half. While $5 million may sound like enough to continue some service, it is not. That severe a budget shortfall leaves ODOT with only a shutdown scenario.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Service between Portland and Eugene, Ore., may be cut.", "description": "Service between Portland and Eugene, Ore., may be cut.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Service between Portland and Eugene, Ore., may be cut.", "title": "Amtrak route at risk", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/237839-amtrak-route-at-risk", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/amtrak.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/237839-amtrak-route-at-risk", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-03T11:58-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Amtrak, Cascades Line, State-supported routes,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T11:58:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/237839-amtrak-route-at-risk", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Service between Portland and Eugene, Ore., may be cut.", "card": "summary", "title": "Amtrak route at risk"}, "dcterms.title": "Amtrak route at risk"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4c8\"", "article_summary": "Supporters of the Oregon Amtrak route argue that the state\u2019s portion of the line should be saved.\nOregon state officials may be forced to cut Amtrak service between Portland and Eugene, the Salem Statesman Journal newspaper reports.\n\u201cOregon\u2019s Amtrak Cascades service needs $10.4 million to continue operations for the coming two years.\nThe Cascades Line is one of nearly 30 state-supported Amtrak routes that have become popular with state lawmakers as a way to boost commuter rail service within their jurisdictions.\nThe Cascades line carried 782,519 passengers during that period, according to the company."}
