Data scientists in Silicon Valley analyzed more than 100,000 presentations from corporate executives to identify the combination of vocal, verbal and visual variables that define a good talk. Beyond confirming best practices they found a forth variable they call \u201cVital,\u201d determined by how well the speaker communicates empathy. \u201cTo be seen as warm, you should acknowledge your audience\u2019s needs by verbally echoing them (e.g., \u201cLike you, I once\u2026\u201d) and by telling stories that convey your understanding of their needs,\u201d writes Matt Abrams, a lecturer at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business. The scientists at Quantified Communications, a company which makes an analytics platforms to evaluate corporate executives\u2019 communication skills also recommended that speakers \u201cmaintain an engaged posture by leaning forward.\u201d Speaking with your hands in your pockets is still a no-no.\n\nFire the jerks. Silicon Valley rewards the \u201caggressive, think-on-your-feet\u201d types\u2013who happen to be mostly male\u2013and that\u2019s a problem as far as solving the region\u2019s diversity problem, argues Minnie Ingersoll, co-founder of startup Shift, writes in Quartz. \u201cI want the business world to not just encourage women to \u2018lean in,\u2019 but create space for non-aggressive, soft-spoken people to succeed,\u201d she writes. Her solution: Start firing all the jerks who can make \u201cothers feel small, shut down constructive debates, and generally create miserable environments.\u201d A workplace that allows for \u201cvalue different viewpoints and work styles,\u201d will be better at attracting women than any bro-led startup that includes egg-freezing as a perk.\n\nCulture is not the culprit. As sure as night follows day, every time news breaks of a company in turmoil calls for cultural change follow. Actions speak louder than blurbs, argue Jay W. Lorsch and Emily McTeague in Harvard Business Review, who describe how executives at companies under pressure like Ford Motor Co. and Delta Air Lines Inc. used available tools, such as decision rights and performance management, to address particular business challenges. Organizational culture evolved as a result. \u201cOrganizations are complex systems with many ripple effects\u2014and reworking fundamental practices will inevitably lead to new values and behaviors,\u201d they write.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Big Data helps analyze and sharpen business communications; fire the jerks; stop blaming corporate culture for company turmoil.", "title": "Three Must-Read Stories: The Weekend Reader", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2016/04/08/three-must-read-stories-the-weekend-reader-12/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Three Must-Read Stories: The Weekend Reader", "description": "Big Data helps analyze and sharpen business communications; fire the jerks; stop blaming corporate culture for company turmoil.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Tom Loftus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CFO Journal.
