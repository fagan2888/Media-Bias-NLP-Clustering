Three people were arrested after they reportedly tried to steal a Logan County Sheriff’s office’s bait car Thursday afternoon.

According to the Sheriff’s office, at about 1 p.m., the department received an activation alert from its bait car system indicating that the car was moving. The car had been parked in the Green Oaks Addition near Simmons and Coltrane in south Logan County, due to several vehicles being stolen and burglarized in the area.

Deputies were able to remotely stop the car and make contact with three suspects, 38-year-old Martin Billings, 35-year-old Vanessa Garcia, and 37-year-old Joseph Nicholson. All three were charged with grand larceny of a motor vehicle.

The Sheriff’s office said it has been using GPS Trackers to attempt to make an impact in the number of stolen trailers, tractors, farm implements and automobiles for over two years. This system is made possible through small GPS tracking devices that can be secreted on a trailer, tractor or other agricultural implements, or can be permanently mounted in a vehicle.

These GPS devices send immediate messages to the Sheriff’s Office and to designated deputies and supervisors, so that the team can quickly respond to apprehend the thieves.
