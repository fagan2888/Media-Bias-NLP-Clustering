In a paper published today in the journal Science, researchers at MIT reveal that they were able to reactivate memories that could not otherwise be retrieved, using a technology known as optogenetics.\u201d\n\nYes! Does this mean we can reclaim our long-forgotten halcyon childhood days with a bit of a laser boost to the right neurons? Um, no, not today. But it\u2019s still fascinating. That MIT press release quoted above goes on to explain that the study explores the difference between how a memory is stored \u2014 in a group of brain cells called an engram \u2014 and how it is retrieved. It quotes Nobel Laureate Susumu Tonegawa, who leads the group that did the work, on the evolving concept of what a memory is, in our brains:\n\n\u201cWe are proposing a new concept, in which there is an engram cell ensemble pathway, or circuit, for each memory,\u201d he says. \u201cThis circuit encompasses multiple brain areas and the engram cell ensembles in these areas are connected specifically for a particular memory.\u201d\n\nWBUR\u2019s Rachel Paiste spoke with Dheeraj Roy, a grad student in Tonegawa\u2019s MIT lab who worked on the research. Their conversation, lightly edited:\n\nRP: So what did you find?\n\nDR: We wanted to look at mouse models of amnesia, for the simple reason that there\u2019s very little done today in the field. So we attempted to look at individual memory traces, which we refer to as engram cells, which are sparse populations in several brain regions \u2014 the one we worked with is the hippocampus, which is widely known to be involved in memory. And we looked at: Do these memory traces, which we see in normal mice, do they still persist in amnesic mouse models? And if so, is there any way that we can restore or bring back these memories?\n\nAnd this is actually stemming from a debate in the field: Neuroscientists weren\u2019t sure, when a mouse or a rat or a human can\u2019t remember a memory, is it because the memories are no longer stored or is it because for some reason they can no longer be accessed? So our study really started with that goal: Can we try to tease apart storage problems, where the memory is gone, or retrieval problems, where the memory is there but just needs to be retrieved somehow?\n\nSo our findings, I think for the first time, tell us that in certain models of amnesia, memories do persist and, very importantly, at levels similar to what we see in control mice. And that\u2019s actually what was most exciting for us: not just that memories persist \u2014 that\u2019s been known for a while \u2014 but the fact that we can bring back memories to equivalent levels as control animals is very unexpected.\n\nSo the first thing I thought of here, knowing more about pop culture than brain science, is \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\u201d As far as retrieval of memories, is this something that could somehow become used for humans?\n\nI think it will take more research and is years in the future. But if I had to describe how I think this work could be extended, the first thing that comes to mind is the mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 and in the future, human patients suffering from any sort of memory loss.\n\nI think the first thing we have to do is make a system analogous to what we have with optogenetics, which is light control of neurons, to bring back memories. Could we use something like Deep Brain Stimulation, which is already being used for Parkinson\u2019s disease successfully, in human patients, as well as more recently in Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\nSo we think that studying the relationship between Deep Brain Stimulation and our specific memory activation in mouse models could give us insight into how this could be extended. If we could come up with a strategy that uses currently available techniques in the clinic, such as Deep Brain Stimulation, that would be fantastic and I think the implications would be amazing.\n\nSo what might this mean for people with Alzheimer\u2019s or amnesia or PTSD, a few years down the road?\n\nThere are several types of amnesia, so it\u2019s very important for us to first establish that in our model, we were able to find memories persisting. So that would be our first step: In the future, in humans, can we find out in what types of amnesia the memories persist? And once we do, it would be important to find a strategy to bring them back permanently \u2014 whether it be memories for a few years or for a decade. Whether amnesia is from PTSD or a stressful event or natural memory loss with aging \u2014 memory makes us who we are, and being able to bring it back is where I think the research is taking us. This is the first step but one of many.\n\nDid you look at various types of amnesia?\n\nWe started with the most famous type of amnesia, which is this protein synthesis-inhibition-based amnesia. And it\u2019s important to keep in mind that it\u2019s been used in neuroscience for decades. So we wanted to use the most dominant model to try to get an understanding of what happens in this type of amnesia. In the future, we\u2019re looking at expanding this to applying it to the mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 where, I think scientists would agree, it is possible that memories do persist but no one has ever looked at single memory traces and how technology such as ours may be applied.\n\nI know this would need research that hasn\u2019t happened yet, but does this mean that every memory you\u2019ve ever had may be hiding somewhere in the dark corners of your mind, waiting to be retrieved?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a fascinating question. I wish I could say yes. The way I think of the brain is that memories that are important to us \u2014 time with family, a birthday, an eventful day at work, an awards ceremony \u2014 these are the sort of memories that, if I had to speculate, would be the most robustly persisting, or would last the longest. I\u2019m not very sure about a day in the park or other memories that weren\u2019t as eventful. But it may be in the future that our technology could be applied to both, to tease apart which ones do persist.\n\nWhat is most exciting to you about these findings?\n\nTo be honest, when we started this experiment, we actually thought that in amnesia, memories do not persist. Like all the other researchers, we thought they were just erased somehow. So the fact that we could unexpectedly be in the lab one day and shine the light in these amnesic mice and get memory retrieval \u2014 I still remember that day, and will for the rest of my life and career in research. It was just amazing to see something so unexpected happen, even though our professors and the other scientists in our building would never have guessed that were possible. That gets me excited and keeps me going.\n\nAnd if you ever lose that memory, you know it can come back, with just a little bit of light!", "article_metadata": {"description": "MIT researchers working in mice with amnesia report that they were able to restore memories that had been lost, suggesting that forgetting can happen not because the memory is gone but because it cannot be retrieved.
