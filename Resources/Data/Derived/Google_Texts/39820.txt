Saving lives doesn't have to be depressing, but dancing behind the wheel may not be the safest mood-picker-upper.

Life-saving paramedics face a gauntlet of bloody domestic disputes, limp corpses post-overdose, and a host of behind-the-scenes health woes that normal people would much rather avoid. It turns out they also like to vogue.

The Internet was graced with the presence of one EMT driver on May 6, who happened to tune in to the radio right as a song, which he’s apparently rather fond of, came on. Dangerously, the unnamed EMT driver takes his hands off the wheel, mid-traffic, to swing his hands, arms, and head to the music. (Meanwhile, a guy waiting on a new heart was probably in the back, praying for death.)

We don’t know who this EMT is or where he’s from (though he mentions the radio station 97.1, a popular hip-hop and pop station in the New York tri-state area). All we know is he likes to vogue, and he’s probably the happiest EMT on the job right now. And given the long, erratic hours many paramedics work, coupled with the mediocre pay for doing a hero’s work, there could be worse people to save your life than someone with a little too much rhythm.

One disclaimer, however: Distracted driving is dangerous. In 2012, an estimated 421,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver. We respect your dance moves, nameless EMT, but stay safe out there.
