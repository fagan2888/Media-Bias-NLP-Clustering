Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan, saying he wants to \u201cdismantle Medicare\u201d and private insurance and that he would turn over \u201cyour and my health insurance to governors.\u201d Not exactly.\n\nSanders calls for replacing the current health insurance system with a new \u201csingle-payer\u201d system in which everyone has insurance paid through taxes. And a federal board would approve individual states\u2019 universal insurance plans, with the power to take over if a state refused to participate or didn\u2019t meet certain standards.\n\nThe Clinton camp is free to question Sanders\u2019 plan and its structure \u2014 and whether it\u2019s a good idea or politically or practically feasible. But comments by both Hillary Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea, suggest people would lose health insurance under Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan \u2014 when such a plan is designed to cover everyone, going beyond what the Affordable Care Act is expected to do. The ACA is expected to leave 27 million uninsured in coming years, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.\n\nOn Jan. 12, Chelsea Clinton said in a stump speech in New Hampshire: \u201cSen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, dismantle private insurance. \u2026 I worry that if we give Republicans Democratic permission to do that, we\u2019ll go back to an era \u2014 before we had the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that will strip millions and millions and millions of people of their health insurance.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cdismantle\u201d claim reminds us of Democrats\u2019 past \u201cend Medicare\u201d claims directed at Republicans. Just as Republicans didn\u2019t call for an \u201cend\u201d to Medicare altogether \u2014 they called for replacing the current system with a new insurance program for future seniors \u2014 Sanders hasn\u2019t called for dismantling all forms of insurance without a replacement plan.\n\nThe day before, on Jan. 11, Hillary Clinton said at a campaign stop in Iowa that Sanders\u2019 plan would \u201ctake Medicare and Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act health-care insurance and private employer health insurance and he would take that all together and send health insurance to the states, turning over your and my health insurance to governors.\u201d Sanders has proposed having the states implement the single-payer plan, but Clinton gives the impression that governors would be free to do whatever they wanted. That\u2019s not the case.\n\nFor his part, Sanders has glossed over the fact that his plan would replace all forms of current insurance with a new system \u2014 one he calls \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d but would actually be a new insurance system administered largely, if not entirely, by the states. The Washington Post Fact Checker gave Sanders two Pinocchios in November for saying: \u201cI helped write the Affordable Care Act. So I don\u2019t want somebody suggesting I\u2019m trying to dismantle legislation that I helped write.\u201d\n\nBut the ACA would no longer exist under what Sanders has proposed.\n\nSanders\u2019 Plan\n\nSanders has not released a formal plan as a presidential candidate. But he has introduced single-payer legislation, most recently the American Health Security Act of 2013, and his campaign points to that legislation in responding to the Clinton camp attacks.\n\nThe bill, which was referred to committee and never came to a vote, calls for a single-payer, universal coverage system that would be administered by the states and regulated by an American Health Security Standards Board. Medicare, Medicaid and other government health programs, as well as the current private insurance system, would in fact be eliminated, because everyone would get the same health insurance, paid for with tax money, rather than individually through premiums. The bill calls for tax credits and premium subsidies that would have gone to state residents under the ACA instead going to a new trust fund.\n\nThe Health Security Standards Board would be charged with overseeing implementation of the law, including setting benefit levels and state/federal funding levels.\n\nEach state would submit a proposal to the board for a \u201chealth security program\u201d that would cover all residents, and states would be allowed to join together to create regional plans. The board could approve or reject the plans. And if a state refused to participate, the bill says, the board \u201cshall develop a plan for a State health security program in such State.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton camp\u2019s implication that Sanders\u2019 plan would turn over health insurance to the states to do whatever they wished is wrong. There are mechanisms in the law to control the state plans, and take over for a state that doesn\u2019t develop such a plan, or develops one that\u2019s considered subpar by the board.\n\nThe legislation spells out \u201cconsequences of failure to comply\u201d saying that if a state plan doesn\u2019t meet the board\u2019s requirements \u201cthe Board shall provide notice to the State of such failure and that unless corrective action is taken within a period specified by the Board, the Board shall place the State health security program (or specific portions of such program) in receivership under the jurisdiction of the Board.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton worried that \u201cmillions and millions and millions\u201d would lose their health insurance. But Sanders\u2019 bill includes provisions to stop that from happening.\n\nHow well that would work is of course an open question. Under the ACA, the federal government has stepped in to run most of what were supposed to be state-based insurance marketplaces, and 19 states haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid under the law. But Sanders\u2019 plan is different \u2014 a governor\u2019s actions wouldn\u2019t affect some of the states\u2019 residents; they would affect all of them.\n\n\u201cUltimately it\u2019s hard to imagine governors undermining insurance \u2013 for everyone \u2014 literally from CEOs to janitors,\u201d Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us in a phone interview.\n\nWhat would be more likely is that governors would allow the federal government to administer their programs, he said. But there are plenty of unknowns about how a single-payer system would be implemented.\n\n\u201cA single-payer plan has never come very close to passing,\u201d Levitt said, \u201cso a lot of the details about how it would actually work have never been worked out.\u201d\n\nIt would be a major change from the current insurance system in the country. \u201cIt would change everyone\u2019s coverage from what they have today to a new state-sponsored insurance plan. And it would shift the financing dramatically from the premiums that individuals and employers pay today to a tax-based system,\u201d Levitt said.\n\nWhen we contacted the Clinton camp, the campaign raised the question of what states\u2019 refusal to participate would do to the financing mechanisms or level of taxation of Sanders\u2019 plan. The 2013 bill calls for a federal contribution for all states of 86 percent on a weighted-average, and for that federal contribution to be no less than 81 percent and no more than 91 percent.\n\nIf a state failed to participate \u2014 or didn\u2019t develop an adequate plan \u2014 the federal government would have to make up the funding difference in some way. We asked the Sanders campaign how such a potential shortfall would be covered under his plan, and we did not receive a response.\n\nIn her Iowa campaign stop, Hillary Clinton called Sanders\u2019 plan a \u201crisky deal,\u201d saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe number one we should be starting over. We had enough of a fight to get to the Affordable Care Act. So I don\u2019t want to rip it up and start over.\u201d\n\nShe is entitled to that opinion. But her campaign has given misleading statements on what exactly Sanders has proposed, leaving the impression that he would cede control to governors and \u201cdismantle\u201d insurance coverage altogether.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Sanders calls for replacing the current health insurance system with a new \u201csingle-payer\u201d system in which everyone has insurance paid through taxes.\nIn her Iowa campaign stop, Hillary Clinton called Sanders\u2019 plan a \u201crisky deal,\u201d saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe number one we should be starting over.\nThe Clinton camp is free to question Sanders\u2019 plan and its structure \u2014 and whether it\u2019s a good idea or politically or practically feasible.\nBut Sanders\u2019 plan is different \u2014 a governor\u2019s actions wouldn\u2019t affect some of the states\u2019 residents; they would affect all of them.\n\u201cIt would change everyone\u2019s coverage from what they have today to a new state-sponsored insurance plan."}
