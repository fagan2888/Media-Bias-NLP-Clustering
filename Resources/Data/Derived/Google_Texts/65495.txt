FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) â€” Former teen idol David Cassidy has agreed to give up his driver's license until 2021 in his latest legal troubles.

Cassidy pleaded no contest Monday to reckless driving and other charges stemming from a September hit-and-run in Broward County. Along with giving up his license, Cassidy agreed to spend two years on probation.

Witnesses identified Cassidy as the driver of a vehicle that sideswiped a delivery truck.

The 65-year-old singer's attorney, Jason Forman, tells the Sun Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1pYfrui ) that Cassidy "made a business decision to resolve his misdemeanor offenses."

Cassidy has had DUI arrests in Florida, New York and California since 2010. If Cassidy violates the new probation, he faces more than two years in prison.

Last year, Cassidy auctioned his Fort Lauderdale mansion as part of bankruptcy and divorce proceedings.
