Defenseman Jack Johnson\u2019s harmless shot from the offensive blue line caromed off the skate of Avalanche forward Cody McLeod. McLeod was trying to block the puck with his foot but instead deflected it toward the net, and the change in direction fooled goalie Calvin Pickard.\n\nThere were no Blue Jackets near McLeod to make a play on the puck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. I should have just let Calvin have it. I should have let him see the puck,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d\n\nPickard, who was making his second consecutive start on the heels of Thursday\u2019s shutout win over New Jersey, said the puck came off Johnson\u2019s stick and made a strange bounce before hitting McLeod.\n\n\u201cJust an unlucky bounce at an unlucky time,\u201d Pickard said. \u201cWe deserved a better result. I thought we had the puck a lot more and more scoring chances. It\u2019s frustrating. I thought we did a lot of great things.\u201d\n\nThe Avs were outshooting Columbus 27-15 midway through the third period and finished with a 30-21 advantage.\n\n\u201cWe were really sharp tonight, except for maybe that first shift where they scored that first goal,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cOther than that, we were impeccable in our end. I thought we deserved more than that. But, hey, that\u2019s the way this game is. You\u2019re going to win some you don\u2019t deserve to win, and sometimes you\u2019re going to lose some that you deserve (to win). Tonight is an example.\u201d\n\nColumbus scored on its first shift, and Colorado tied it 6:02 into the second period. The equalizer came off a give-and-go play by linemates Chris Wagner and Jarome Iginla. Wagner made a drop pass to Iginla on the rush and drove to the net. En route, Iginla put the puck in his path and Wagner tapped it past rookie goalie Joonas Korpisalo.\n\nColumbus\u2019 first goal came 58 seconds into the game when Avs defensemen Nikita Zadorov and Nick Holden seemed like spectators. Zadorov played too loose on Ryan Murray, and Holden lost his man in front. Murray made a behind-the-net feed to Brandon Dubinsky for a one-timer from the doorstep.\n\n\u201cLike I said, other than the first shift, I thought we played really well defensively,\u201d Roy said.\n\nAvalanche top-line center Nathan MacKinnon was held without a shot and had two giveaways in 19:10. Linemate Matt Duchene had a team-high six shots on his 25th birthday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Avalanche falls short to Columbus Blue Jackets in 2-1 loss", "title": "Colorado Avalanche falls short to Columbus Blue Jackets in 2-1 loss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/colorado-avalanche-falls-short-to-columbus-blue-jackets-in-2-1-loss/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__Colorado-Avalanche-blue-jacketsp1.jpg", "height": 465}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__Colorado-Avalanche-blue-jacketsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T19:42:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:04:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I should have let him see the puck,\u201d McLeod said.\nDefenseman Jack Johnson\u2019s harmless shot from the offensive blue line caromed off the skate of Avalanche forward Cody McLeod.\nThe Blue Jackets got the game-winning goal with 1:07 remaining in regulation, preventing overtime and a point for the visitors.\nThere were no Blue Jackets near McLeod to make a play on the puck.\nBut the Columbus Blue Jackets made their 21st shot count late in the third period to emerge with a 2-1 victory at Nationwide Arena and deny Colorado at least a well-deserved point."}
