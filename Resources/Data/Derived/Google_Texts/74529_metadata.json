The Affordable Care Act is revamping payment systems away from fee-for-service to financial incentives to keep people healthy and out of hospitals.\n\nThere is an emphasis on creating more community-based care that is not only improving patient outcomes but lowering the cost of medicine. There is more coordination of care through electronic records to end unnecessary treatment.\n\nWhat it means for patients and physicians is relying on evidence-based standards that in many ways is a return to basics \u2014 ensuring that asthma patients get the right medication and comply with doctors\u2019 orders, or better monitoring of seniors with congestive heart failure to keep them from cycling in and out of emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cThrough the application of these basic principles, we will be optimizing the health as well as health outcomes for every individual,\u2019\u2019 Stanton said. \u201cRight now it\u2019s so dependent on income, job, what kind of education you have. We don\u2019t need to have it that way.\n\n\u201cThose that are slipping through the net are in the greatest need,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI need us to have a transformation.\u201d\n\nStanton has served in key positions at many hospitals and universities, including the University of Maryland and Children\u2019s Hospital in Michigan.\n\nShe served as a health consultant to the World Bank, lived in Bangladesh for five years and conducted research and treated women and children in the slums of Dhaka, the capital. A Roman Catholic, Stanton said her faith was not a condition of employment.\n\n\u201cHer extensive and diverse background reflects her innate desire to improve the lives of others through her medical training and abilities,\u2019\u2019 said Robert C. Garrett, president and CEO of Hackensack University Health Network.\n\nStanton noted that Hackensack University Medical Center and its affiliates are already moving toward newer care models. The hospital has 60,000 people and 800 providers in Accountable Care Organizations.\n\nThe ACO is a system in which payments to physicians and hospitals are tied to quality measures and reductions in the total cost of care for that patient population resulting in financial reward to providers if goals are met.\n\nAdditionally, Stanton and other school officials and professors will revamp curriculum plans. Instead of having two years of classwork and two years of clinical work, students will have hands-on experience in their first year of school, Stanton said.\n\nThe school will follow the trend of medical schools moving away from dissections of cadavers to learning from 3-D images and dissection of organs, she said.\n\nEmail: layton@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A founding dean has been selected to usher in a new medical school at the former site of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. in Clifton and Nutley, a major step for the launch of New Jersey's first private medical school in 50 years, officials announced Wednesday.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "MARY JO LAYTON", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/education/future-medical-school-has-dean-1.1516811", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.1517114!/fileImage/httpImage/dean2-jpg.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A founding dean has been selected to usher in a new medical school at the former site of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. in Clifton and Nutley, a major step for the launch of New Jersey's first private medical school in 50 years, officials announced Wednesday."}, "title": "Future North Jersey medical school gets dean", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "MARY JO LAYTON", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Future North Jersey medical school gets dean"}, "article_summary": "Instead of having two years of classwork and two years of clinical work, students will have hands-on experience in their first year of school, Stanton said.\nStanton was welcomed Wednesday by dozens of officials from Seton Hall University and the parent company of Hackensack University Medical Center, organizations that are creating a medical school at the former Hoffmann-La Roche pharmaceutical site in Nutley and Clifton.\nStanton noted that Hackensack University Medical Center and its affiliates are already moving toward newer care models.\n\u201cThrough the application of these basic principles, we will be optimizing the health as well as health outcomes for every individual,\u2019\u2019 Stanton said.\nThe school will follow the trend of medical schools moving away from dissections of cadavers to learning from 3-D images and dissection of organs, she said."}
