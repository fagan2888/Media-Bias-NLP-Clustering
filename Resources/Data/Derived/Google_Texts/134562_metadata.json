Samples were shared. There was also fashion show to showcase TomboyX clothing . Daughters of mentors, staff and companies said a few words. And later, a guy played banjo while the sponsors were thanked by the men of MergeLane. The presentation kept the crowd entertained and cheering. And Sue Heilbronner, Mergelane\u2019s co-founder and CEO, faced her fears.\n\n\u201cI feel proud of myself today,\u201d said Sue Heilbronner, Mergelane\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \u201cJust being here many of you know required me to take a few giant leaps to directly face my fear. And in some cases, my loathing that if I started MergeLane, I would be labeled for the rest of my career a female entrepreneur, or a female investor.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s okay with that now. Because she\u2019s also brought a spotlight to eight women-led start ups that may not have gone much further without a force like MergeLane, which counts Seth Levine of the Foundry Group (and honorary Man of MergeLane); Lucy Sanders, CEO and co-founder of National Center for Women & Information Technology; and many, many others as mentors.\n\nAnd from the first week MergeLane launched its mentor program back in February, the eight companies have come a long way. The 5-minute pitches were nearly perfect. Some already have revenues. Others have raised seed funding.\n\nA quick roundup:\n\nMapistry has figured out how to help contractors and builders who need to figure out storm-water permitting and government regulations. Instead of spending five days on the process, Mapistry\u2019s software can do it in an hour, according to Allie Janoch, Mapistry\u2019s CEO and co-founder. Mapistry has already been selling to customers and in its first month, generated $20,000 in revenue. Next month, she expects $40,000. And storm water is just the beginning.\n\nElizabeth Sopher, a co-founder of The QuickZip Sheet Co., summed up her product in four words: The fitted sheet 2.0. Before MergeLane started, Sopher and co-founder Caroline Portis were already selling the crib sheets, which zip off for easy cleaning. Sales were mostly online. Fast-forward 12 weeks and QuickZip is now working with BabiesRUs, Walmart and Wayfair. Sopher said she projects sales to reach $1.7 million this year, from $400,000 last year. The goal is to expand into sheets for adults. \u201cFitted sheets are reviled,\u201d she said. \u201cWe grab our customers on day one.\u201d\n\nIdaciti wants to make financial data usable to everyone \u2014 a hard pitch when the actual task is pretty snoozeworthy. But Idaciti co-founders Emily Huang and Christine Tan tag teamed for the pitch and kept it moving. \u201cWe are the dream team to solve this problem,\u201d Tan said. They had ditched their earlier pitch of how Idaciti helps tell a story of financial data. Rather, they focused on an example: drilling into the details of Twitter\u2019s acquisitions \u2014 buried in footnote 8 on page 84. Needing to know the important bits in a financial report is what Idaciti can spit out fast and help financial analysts, researchers and others get to the facts they need faster.\n\nTomboyX, a lifestyle and women\u2019s clothing brand for finding inspiration from men\u2019s clothing, had fun with its pitch by starting with a fashion show. Fran Dunaway, its co-founder and CEO, even poked fun at the tech industry: \u201cWomen\u2019s apparel is a $187 billion market, which by the way is more than four times the entire global SaaS market,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a little tidbit I like to call sassy.\u201d The company honed in on the lifestyle appeal as women everywhere posted pictures of themselves in TomboyX clothes. And the goal is to expand beyond into more lines. \u201cWe hit a home run and tripled our revenue in six months,\u201d she said. Customers, on average, spend $94 per order.\n\nThen there was ZaZa, the healthy dessert maker started by Elisabeth Saucier. \u201cI believe the world would be a much better place if only we could eat desert at any time of the day without any of the guilt,\u201d she started. Enter Zaza, which is all about creamy, sweet treats that are Paleo, vegan, gluten free, dairy free and soy free. Saucier, a chef, created the desserts because her children had allergies. And then all her friends wanted some. And Whole Foods. Last year, ZaZa had $170,000 in revenues and anticipates hitting $650,000 this year and $2 million in 2016. Everyone in the MergeLane audience on Friday got a taste. But for seconds, you had to find Saucier after the show.\n\nThe pitch from Intelligent Eyes, a company from Berkeley, Calif., also made a lot more sense then the pitch from February. Led by Debbie Taylor, its founder and CEO, Intelligent Eyes is another software as a service company. But you know all those clinical trials the healthcare industry does? Intelligent Eyes helps those guys see if they are getting good results, following protocol and staying on budget. Making decisions mid-trial can actually save money, speed up the trial and get drugs to the patients faster. Beta testers \u201care eager,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nSugarwish also clarified its pitch: A gift that lets recipients literally pick their favorite candy. Pure happiness! \u201cAt Sugarwish, we know that\u2019s the whole point of giving a gift is to deliver that feeling. To make someone feel happy,\u201d said Elisabeth Vezzani, co-founder and CEO of the Denver company. Quite impressive were other stats Vezzani shared on how they know Sugarwish makes people happy: 15 percent of recipients sent one to someone else. Last year, sales were $170,000 and shipped 9,000 gifts and never had a return. Sugarwish is also expanding into the $54 billion corporate gift market. One of its first customers in the three weeks since it launched? Google.\n\nAnd lastly, Havenly, which started out with a bang pre-Mergelane (it had revenues!) also ended its 12 weeks with big news: It received $1.5 million in seed funding. The company created a portal connecting interior designers with people who are either clueless about how to decorate a room or just don\u2019t have time or the money to hire someone. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this for thousands of people across the United States,\u201d said Lee Mayer, Havenly\u2019s co-founder and CEO. Customers pay $185 for the service and suggestions and get a discount on products if they choose to move forward. Typical post order? On average, $1,000, she said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "accelerator,Boulder,Demo Day,MergeLane,startups", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "MergeLane knows how to have fun at its first-ever Demo Day | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/24/mergelane-knows-how-to-have-fun-at-its-first-ever-demo-day/16929/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/MergeLane-banner.jpg?fit=495%2C343", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "MergeLane knows how to have fun at its first-ever Demo Day", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/24/mergelane-knows-how-to-have-fun-at-its-first-ever-demo-day/16929/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/MergeLane-banner.jpg?fit=495%2C343", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Female-friendly business accelerator MergeLane hosts Demo Day with entertaining pitches and interludes."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5150\"", "article_summary": "Before MergeLane started, Sopher and co-founder Caroline Portis were already selling the crib sheets, which zip off for easy cleaning.\nAnd in some cases, my loathing that if I started MergeLane, I would be labeled for the rest of my career a female entrepreneur, or a female investor.\u201dShe\u2019s okay with that now.\nMergeLane, the Boulder female-friendly business accelerator, approached its first graduation day with flair at Friday\u2019s sold-out event at St Julien.\nWhen you kick off your Demo Day with a box of candy, you know this isn\u2019t going to be a typical business-pitch event.\nAnd from the first week MergeLane launched its mentor program back in February, the eight companies have come a long way."}
