GOP's Obamacare fears come true\n\nLiberals wanted a national enrollment system under Obamacare.\n\nThey might just get it.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRight now, 36 states rely on HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange, to enroll people in health coverage. At least two more states are opting in next year, with a few others likely to follow. Only two states are trying to get out.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely the opposite of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s original intent: 50 exchanges run by 50 states.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Steve Scalise to push GOP leaders on Obamacare alternative)\n\nThe federal option was supposed to be a limited and temporary fallback. But a shift to a bigger, more permanent Washington-controlled system is instead underway \u2014 without preparation, funding or even public discussion about what a national exchange covering millions of Americans means for the future of U.S. health care. It\u2019s coming about because intransigent Republicans shunned state exchanges, and ambitious Democrats bungled them.\n\nRepublicans had warned all along that President Barack Obama\u2019s health law would lead to greater Washington control. \u201cThis was all predictable,\u201d said Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), a physician who sees growing federal control of the health system hurting patients. \u201cOur friends on the other side didn\u2019t listen.\u201d\n\nTevi Troy, a health expert who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised Mitt Romney in 2012, says the country needs to stop and discuss the consolidation. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of, in a way, stumbling into this situation,\u201d he said of the increasing reliance on the federal portal.\n\nHealthCare.gov is more than a computerized sign-up sheet. It\u2019s a marketplace, where people get health coverage through private insurers, for care from private doctors. It\u2019s not a single, nationalized Canadian- or British-style program. Even within the federal model, each state has its own insurance pool and state officials still regulate health plans.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Nevada latest state to scrap its Obamacare exchange)\n\nThe state-exchange option gave governors and legislatures more leeway to tailor the market to suit local conditions and demands. But the states encountered political and technical obstacles, leading to investigations, recriminations, disputes with contractors and hundreds of millions of wasted dollars.\n\n\u201cWhile [the administration] spent an inordinate amount of time and energy and money encouraging states to run and own their own exchanges, I think that that has kind of shifted,\u201d said Jon Kingsdale, a prominent consultant who helped build the original Massachusetts exchange under then-Gov. Romney. \u201cHow long can you push a boulder uphill?\u201d\n\nHealthCare.gov was originally conceived as a just-in-case alternative that would kick in if a state could not or would not build its own health reform enrollment system. The law didn\u2019t even set aside money to build the federal site, let alone operate it indefinitely. Even when red states shunned a role in running Obamacare and a handful of blue states also turned to Washington, the federal system was still seen as a short-term bridge to a state-based system.\n\nNot anymore. After its fiasco of a start, HealthCare.gov is working. No one is pushing states with successful programs, like California and New York, to switch. But there are only a few of those. Most of the other states are in HealthCare.gov. And they\u2018re staying put rather than start their own exchange.\n\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare)\n\n\u201cWhy would any governor or legislature in their right mind step forward at this point and say maybe\u2026that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d wondered John McDonough, a former aide to Sen. Ted Kennedy who worked on health reform in both Washington and Massachusetts.\n\nIn theory, states can still tap into virtually unlimited funding to create exchanges. But a number of state officials say the administration has signaled that it doesn\u2019t want to keep pouring millions into broken state systems. A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees Obamacare exchanges, said only that states should choose whatever path \u201cthey believe best meets the needs of their consumers and insurance market.\u201d\n\n\u201cCMS is committed to working closely with states to support efforts to ensure that all consumers will have access to quality, affordable, health coverage in 2015,\u201d spokesman Aaron Albright said.\n\n( See all of POLITICO's Obamacare coverage)\n\nRepublicans, who contributed to the growing power of HealthCare.gov by not supporting state-run exchanges, want federal investigations into why some states failed.\n\n\u201cWhile many of these states are simply moving to the federal exchange as a convenient method of alleviating the problems with their own exchanges, it is a short-sighted solution,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cNothing is more important right now than for Congress to find out what went wrong and why.\u201d\n\nNevada in mid-May became the latest to scrap its system and opt into HealthCare.gov. A few days earlier, Oregon had bailed on its $250 million exchange. Massachusetts is still trying to salvage its exchange, but it\u2019s also laying the groundwork to join HealthCare.gov.\n\nHawaii and Minnesota both insist they are moving ahead with their underperforming exchanges; skeptics predict they\u2019ll have to jettison them and join the federal system sooner rather than later. And some small states with high-performing exchanges may have trouble keeping them over the long haul as federal financial support ends.\n\nConnecticut\u2019s exchange performed so well that Maryland wants to buy it and graft it onto its own broken one, but even the director of Connecticut\u2019s exchange, Kevin Counihan, doubts that all the small states will be viable. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some consolidation there, some going to the federal exchange,\u201d he predicted. \u201cWe don\u2019t need 50 of these. And having this really functional federal exchange is really very, very desirable.\u201d\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Liberals might get a version of the national enrollment system they wanted.", "title": "GOP's Obamacare fears come true", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/republicans-obamacare-states-healthcare-gov-107290.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/05/31/140531_obama_sebelius_mathews_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,States,Republicans,HealthCare.Gov,Affordable Care Act,Orrin Hatch", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Liberals might get a version of the national enrollment system they wanted.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a2f\"", "article_summary": "GOP's Obamacare fears come trueLiberals wanted a national enrollment system under Obamacare.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be some consolidation there, some going to the federal exchange,\u201d he predicted.\nIt\u2019s coming about because intransigent Republicans shunned state exchanges, and ambitious Democrats bungled them.\nAnd having this really functional federal exchange is really very, very desirable.\u201dFollow @politico\nA shift to a bigger, more permanent Washington-controlled health system is underway."}
