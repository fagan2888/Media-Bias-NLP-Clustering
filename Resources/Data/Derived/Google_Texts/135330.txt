The rain didn't stop the hundreds who made a stop in downtown Meridian, for the annual Soule' Steam Festival.

The festival held at the historic Soule' Steam Feed Works highlights one of the turning points in American History, that being steam and the technology that followed. Those in attendance got to see real steam engines and how they worked, along with a variety of other jobs of that time period.

"We're trying to show the history of industry," Festival Volunteer Linda Allred said. "How industry once was a horse and plow. Then we worked up to a steam engine, electricity, and then factory. We've come so far and people don't realize how far we've come in such a short period of time."

The festival also featured the last steam engine built. The Spee-D-Twin.
