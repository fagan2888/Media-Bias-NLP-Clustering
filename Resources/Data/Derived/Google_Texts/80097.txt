If Americans cared more about soccer, we might be more familiar with the corruption and bribery scandals within FIFA, the organization that holds the World Cup. Upon the opening of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, John Oliver educated his audience about the “cartoonishly evil” association on Sunday night, which seemingly abuses its power to make countries spend money they don’t have as it shields itself from taxes, creates loopholes in laws, employs its own warped justice system, and encourages poor labor practices.

“FIFA is just appalling,” Oliver declared. But here’s the twisted truth: “I’m still so excited about the World Cup next week, and it’s very hard to justify how I can get so much joy from an organization that’s caused so much pain.”

The world turns a blind eye to FIFA’s dealings because, Oliver explains, soccer is a religion.
