And proved how dumb racism is,\u201d Clinton said at the private memorial service.\n\nTall and majestic, Angelou added heft to her spoken words with a deep and sonorous voice, describing herself as a poet in love with \u201cthe music of language.\u201d She recited the most popular presidential inaugural poem in history, \u201cOn the Pulse of Morning,\u201d when Clinton opened his first term in 1993. She inspired many and became a mentor to Winfrey before she became a talk show host.\n\nClinton remembered that voice, and how Angelou chose not to speak for five years after she was raped by her mother\u2019s boyfriend as a child.\n\n\u201cShe was without a voice for five years and then she developed he greatest voice on the planet. God loaned her His voice,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cShe had the voice of God. And he decided he wanted it back for a while.\u201d\n\nClinton compared Angelou to a firefly, who would light up at the most unexpected time, illuminating \u201csomething right before your nose you\u2019ve been overlooking something in your mind you\u2019ve been burying. Something in your heart you were afraid to face.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Angelou\u2019s grandson Elliott Jones welcomed the audience by telling them they were celebrating \u201can amazing life - a life well-lived.\u201d Jones then read a passage from his grandmother\u2019s poem, \u201cStill I Rise.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like moons and like suns. With the certainty of tides. Just like hopes springing high. Still I\u2019ll rise.\u201d\n\nBorn into poverty and segregation, Angelou rose to become an accomplished actress, singer, dancer and writer. Although she never graduated from college, she taught for more than 30 years at the private North Carolina university, where she was regularly addressed as Dr. Angelou out of respect for all the honorary degrees she received.\n\nHer magnetism also drew her into friendships with famous figures from Malcolm X and Nelson Mandela to Clinton and Winfrey\n\nAngelou was born Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis and raised in Stamps, Arkansas, and San Francisco. Her life included writing poetry by age 9, giving birth as a single mother by 17, and becoming San Francisco\u2019s first black streetcar conductor. She also once danced at a strip joint, shared the stage with comic Phyllis Diller and garnered career advice from singer Billie Holiday. She wrote music and plays, received an Emmy nomination for her acting in the 1970s TV miniseries \u201cRoots\u201d and danced with Alvin Ailey.\n\nAngelou once worked as a coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and lived for years in Egypt and Ghana, where she met Mandela. In 1968, she was helping the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. organize the Poor People\u2019s March in Memphis, Tennessee, where the civil rights leader was slain on Angelou\u2019s 40th birthday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Jeffrey Collins contributed to this report from Columbia, South Carolina.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton remembered poet, orator and sage Maya Angelou as a woman who seemed to have lived five lifetimes in one, with a sweeping experience that defined modern America.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton remembered poet, orator and sage Maya Angelou as a woman who seemed to have lived five lifetimes in one, with a sweeping experience that defined modern America.", "title": "Bill Clinton at Maya Angelou\u2019s memorial service: She \u2018proved how dumb racism is\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/7/private-memorial-service-set-for-poet-maya-angelou/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/07/bc6982bd427b6416560f6a706700f303.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/07/bc6982bd427b6416560f6a706700f303.jpg", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton remembered poet, orator and sage Maya Angelou as a woman who seemed to have lived five lifetimes in one, with a sweeping experience that defined modern America.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill Clinton at Maya Angelou\u2019s memorial service: She \u2018prov"}, "Author": "Emery P.
