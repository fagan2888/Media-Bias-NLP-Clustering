An Adams County sheriff’s deputy was shot Friday afternoon in northwest Denver while trying to apprehend a suspect who may be linked to a triple homicide earlier this week, authorities said.

Sgt. Aaron Pataluna, a spokesman for the Adams County Sheriff’s Office, confirmed that one of the department’s deputies was wounded in the shooting.

Denver police, who were helping to investigate the shooting, said the deputy’s injuries were not life-threatening. The deputy, who was in fair condition at Denver Health Medical Center, is not being identified at this time. No other officers were reported injured.

Denver police Cmdr. Matt Murray, the department’s chief of staff, said at a news conference that a man and a woman were taken into custody.

The Adams County Sheriff’s Office said the man in custody was Furmen Lee Leyba, 30, the same man sought earlier in the week in the triple homicide .

Police set up a perimeter from West 38th Avenue to 40th Avenue between Zuni and Clay streets. Schools in the area were briefly locked out.

Neighbors said they saw several police officers near a house in the area before they heard a volley of shots fired. One woman said she saw dozens of police and sheriff’s officers in the area. She said she was on her porch when she heard four shots.

“We heard gunshots and cars and screaming and shouting and sirens,” the woman said. “We heard it all.”

Pataluna said the deputy was attempting to contact the suspect when the shooting occurred.

Early Wednesday, authorities found three male shooting victims, whose ages were not released, dead in a house on Cragmore Street in an unincorporated part of Adams County.

A man arrested in connection with the triple homicide made a court appearance on Friday. Gabriel Flores, 41, did not have an attorney during his first appearance.
