The following year, concerns peaked again at 17 percent after the 2005 London train and bus bombings.\n\nThough the December survey reflected another spike, the number of Americans worried about terrorism today remains far below the 46 percent who said terrorism was the nation\u2019s most pressing issue after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe Gallup survey also found that Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to name terrorism as the nation\u2019s top issue.\n\nNearly one-fourth\u201424 percent\u2014of Republicans reported that terrorism is the greatest concern, compared with 9 percent of Democrats and 15 percent of independents.\n\nAmericans also pointed to the nation\u2019s government and leadership as a concern, with 13 percent calling it the U.S.\u2019s most pressing issue.\n\nWorry over crime involving guns also rose from 3 percent in November to 7 percent in December, though the spike mirrors October\u2019s percentage.\n\nThe number of Americans concerned about the economy shrank to 9 percent, marking the lowest point since 2007, before the stock market crash and ensuing recession.\n\nGallup surveyed 824 adults through landline and cell phones Dec. 2-6. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About one in six Americans believe terrorism is the most pressing problem.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "About one in six Americans believe terrorism is the most pressing problem.", "title": "Poll Finds Terrorism Top Issue in US Following Deadly Attacks", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151214_TerrorismPoll_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-15T14:55:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NPHODb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "About one in six Americans believe terrorism is the most pressing problem.", "title": "Poll Finds Terrorism Top Issue in US Following Deadly Attacks", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151214_TerrorismPoll_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-12-14T14:43:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-15T14:55:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gallup, San Bernardino, Islamic State, ISIS, terrorism, 9/11"}, "article_summary": "Americans on edge following the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., view terrorism as the biggest issue facing the nation, according to a new Gallup poll.\nThe Gallup survey also found that Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to name terrorism as the nation\u2019s top issue.\nThough the December survey reflected another spike, the number of Americans worried about terrorism today remains far below the 46 percent who said terrorism was the nation\u2019s most pressing issue after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nThe percentage of Americans who contend terrorism is the nation\u2019s primary concern is at its highest in a decade, since bombings in London, according to the poll released Monday.\nAmericans have not been this worried about terrorism since 2004, when 19 percent labeled it as the greatest concern after the Madrid train bombings."}
