CHICAGO (AP) — Lady Gaga and Vince Vaughn made plunges into the icy waters of Chicago’s Lake Michigan at a fundraiser for the Special Olympics.

Special Olympics Chicago President Casey Hogan said Sunday that Gaga did the plunge with more than 4,500 other participants. Hogan says the singer’s appearance was “a very nice surprise.”

Gaga recently announced her engagement to “Chicago Fire” actor Taylor Kinney. Photos show her and a bare-chested Kinney going into the water together.

Vaughn also made the plunge. The native of the Chicago suburb Lake Forest was dressed in his Chicago Blackhawks jersey and jeans. The actor went in up to his knees, then eased himself down backward in the water.

Last year comedian Jimmy Fallon jumped in wearing a suit and tie, and helped raise more than $1 million.

The air temperature was a frigid 20 degrees at the time of the plunge, according to the National Weather Service.
