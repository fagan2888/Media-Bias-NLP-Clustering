Students and staff are adopting more energy-conscious practices. Composting and recycling are standard across school sites. And the district is exploring the possibility of powering newly constructed buildings with solar energy.\n\n\u201cThe district has been a leader in its efforts to create a more healthy and sustainable community,\u201d said Alex Von Feldt, program director at Acterra, a Palo Alto-based nonprofit dedicated to greening institutions throughout Silicon Valley.\n\nSince the 1990s, members of the district\u2019s Sustainable Schools Committee have committed themselves to making Palo Alto\u2019s campuses more energy efficient. But the district implemented its green efforts on a much larger scale in 2011 when it forged partnerships with Acterra and energy conservation company Cenergistic.\n\nLast year, the Environmental Protection Agency recognized the district as an ENERGY STAR, Top Performer.\n\n\u201cI actually believe that climate change is a terrible threat to civilization, and so it is important to go as far as we can in reducing energy,\u201d said Walt Hays, chair of the district\u2019s Sustainable Schools Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s been really encouraging to me to see how the district has become more positive as time has gone on in their response.\u201d\n\nActerra has helped the district remove 5,500 square feet of grass and install 6,500 plants indigenous to the Bay Area. The plants, which stem from Acterra\u2019s nursery, demand much less water; don\u2019t require fertilizer and herbicides; and don\u2019t involve gas-powered maintenance, such as mowing, blowing and hedging.\n\nTwo $10,000 annual grants from the Morgan Family Foundation \u2014 matched by the district \u2014 have helped fund the landscaping endeavor.\n\nActerra enlisted the help of hundreds of Palo Alto\u2019s elementary school students to help with garden installations.\n\n\u201cThere are many areas where lawns are installed but are not used by children,\u201d Von Feldt said. \u201cIt is these areas that we would like to target more to reduce water use \u2026 and provide a healthy urban ecology for all our wildlife.\u2019\u2019\n\nSince entering a four-year program with Cenergistic, the district has seen a drastic reduction in energy consumption and expenses.\n\n\u201cWe tried to do it on our own as many districts do, but the wealth of experience and expert resources Cenergistic brings to the partnership are undeniably advantageous,\u201d said Rebecca Navarro, the district\u2019s energy specialist.\n\nBetween October 2011 and September 2013, the district saw a 10-percent reduction in electricity use, a 23-percent reduction in natural gas use and a six-percent reduction in water use \u2014 a total of $686,000 in savings. Cenergistic estimated the district avoided about 1,900 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to removing 339 cars from the road for a year.\n\nThe partnership is behavior-based, which means schools around the district have had to adjust personal practices. Those changes include switching off lights in unoccupied areas; turning off all computers and other office equipment nightly; responding promptly to water leaks; and maintaining moderate thermostat set points.\n\nMost of the initial financial savings have gone to pay Cenergistic. The district agreed to pay the company $300,000 per year for four years. But starting in 2015, Cenergistic will offer continued support at no charge as long as the district adheres to the program guidelines.\n\n\u201cIf we spend less money for utilities, that means that money can be used elsewhere,\u201d said Cathy Mak, the district\u2019s chief business official. \u201cSo I would say the majority of the savings are going back to classrooms.\u201d\n\nWaste reduction also figures prominently in the district\u2019s savings.\n\nIn 2010, the district instituted composting across school sites and maximized accessibility by clustering compost bins with waste and recycling bins. Last year, the Sustainable Schools Committee worked with the Student Nutrition Services Department to switch all plastic containers to compostable containers.\n\nBy integrating composting \u2014 which costs 10 percent less than garbage service \u2014 and limiting costly garbage pickups by diverting more paper and plastics to recycling bins, the district has saved about $20,000 a month, according to data from GreenWaste of Palo Alto, the city\u2019s waste collection company.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Acterra,Ben Custer,Benjamin Custer,carbon footprint,Cenergistic,Education,energy,energy saving,Environment,green,Palo Alto,palo alto schools,Palo Alto Unified School District,PAUSD,recycling,schools,sustainability,waste reduction,Politics & Gov,Science & Tech,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia", "description": "The school district is uprooting sprinkler-reliant lawns, implementing composting and recycling and adopting more energy conscious habits in its push to reduce\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc665\"", "article_summary": "Last year, the Sustainable Schools Committee worked with the Student Nutrition Services Department to switch all plastic containers to compostable containers.\nSince the 1990s, members of the district\u2019s Sustainable Schools Committee have committed themselves to making Palo Alto\u2019s campuses more energy efficient.\nPalo Alto\u2019s schools are trading in sprinkler-reliant lawns for native plants accustomed to natural cycles of rainfall.\nIn 2010, the district instituted composting across school sites and maximized accessibility by clustering compost bins with waste and recycling bins.\nActerra enlisted the help of hundreds of Palo Alto\u2019s elementary school students to help with garden installations."}
