OKLAHOMA CITY -- For the second time in just a few months, police responded to the robbery of a Circle K in northwest Oklahoma City.

According to police, early Wednesday morning, one suspect walked into the Circle K store, located on N.W. 23rd and Western, with what looked like a BB gun. He then took the entire register.

The man took off out the back door of the convenience store carrying the register. Luckily, it was empty so he didn't get away with much.

The robbery happened around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday. Since then, officers have swarmed the area.

Police used K-9 units as well as their helicopter, Air One, to look for the suspect. Wednesday morning, police said they have arrested three people in connection to the crime. Art Ladd, Stacey Hemphill, and Tawana King, were apprehended at a northwest Oklahoma City home.

This is the second time the convenience store has been hit this summer. Back on May 29, a gunman wearing a stocking over his head came into the store and demanded cash before running off into a nearby neighborhood.
