Maine is one of 23 states not planning on expanding Medicaid this year.\n\n[See also: Maine hospital lowers costs by design]\n\nThe Alfond Center for Health, a part of MaineGeneral Health, is located in Augusta, Maine, a rural area of the state that has historically had a relatively high Medicaid population and a large number of hospital charity care patients. Michael Koziol, senior vice president and CFO of MaineGeneral, anticipates a combination of higher Medicare reimbursement cuts this year along with no Medicaid expansion makes a for a difficult, uncertain road ahead for many Maine hospitals.\n\n\u201cIn fiscal year 2013 we had $39 million in charity care. Without the expansion, we expect that trend to continue, so it\u2019ll grow at least another $2.5 million in 2014,\u201d said Koziol. \u201cSome reimbursement is better than none at all, with some patients now covered on some form of insurance [due to the new healthcare law], but without [Medicaid] expansion, we just anticipate free care going up.\u201d\n\nDespite the unfortunate Medicaid situation, Chuck Hays, president and CEO of MaineGeneral, said that in many other ways MaineGeneral is faring well heading into the new year.\n\n[See also: Maine community deliberates proposed hospital merger]\n\nFor instance, Hays said MaineGeneral has consistently seen avoidable 30-day readmission rates for certain conditions, like pneumonia and heart failure, fall below 13.8 percent, the cutoff point that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has mandated hospitals not exceed or else receive reimbursement penalties. The new readmission rules took effect in October 2013.\n\n\u201cWe have been below the national average, so even though CMS has mandated fines, it doesn\u2019t affect us,\u201d Hays said.\n\nWhen it comes to hospital and physician alignment, an issue many U.S. hospitals are dealing with as the healthcare industry evolves, Hays said MaineGeneral has \"great relationships\" with its medical staff and physicians, whether they are employed by the hospital or work in an independent practice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine either way. Whether physicians want to be in private practice or employed \u2013 we try not to push one model or the other,\u201d said Hays. \u201cTypically, as we\u2019ve been recruiting physicians [to the new Alfond Center for Health], we find they want to be employed even though we\u2019d be more than happy if they wanted to open a private practice. It\u2019s just not economically feasible right now for most.\u201d\n\nHays doesn\u2019t see many independent private practices staying afloat in the current economic climate, particularly as the payer mix continues to change.\n\n\u201cAdministrative costs for an independent practice are crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cMany can\u2019t afford all the red tape and compliance.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if MaineGeneral plans to incorporate any new regional partnerships or joint ventures with other hospitals or health systems this year, Hays said MaineGeneral is constantly assessing the market, but don\u2019t anticipate anything in the immediate future.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of great relationships with hospitals affiliated with Maine Health and other nearby hospitals, and we are always evaluating our situation and how we can keep our population healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cUnlike urban areas, we tend to not be fighting for business in this area. It\u2019s not as competitive.\u201d\n\n[See also: Maine budget proposal to pay hospitals for old Medicaid bills]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/mainegeneral-execs-talk-financial-issues-maine-heading-2014", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Hospitals in the state of Maine are bracing for an uncertain future in 2014.
