That\u2019s the real issue here, and one that all too often gets deflected by the conversation about unaccompanied minor children.\u201d\n\nPerry identified his decision to deploy 1,000 National Guard troops to his state\u2019s border as an effort to make his citizens \u201cfeel that at least the leadership in the state of Texas is doing something to try to make their community safer.\u201d\n\nWhen Candy Crowley questioned Perry\u2019s 3,000 homicide figure, the Texas governor stuck to his assertions and reiterated his responsibility to keep his citizens safe by deploying the National Guardsmen to the border.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do what we have to do to keep our citizens safe,\u201d Perry said. \u201cAnd let me go back to those numbers. You know, what are the number of \u2014 I do stand by them, by the way \u2014 but what are the number of homicides acceptable to those individuals? How many sexual assaults do we have to have before the president of the United States and Washington, D.C., acts to keep our citizens safe?\u201d\n\nThe Texas governor suggested that securing the border is particularly \u201cwhat the American people want\u201d out of the federal government.\n\n\u201c[Americans would] like to see a president who leads this country and says, \u2018You know what, we do have a problem on our southern border. We\u2019re going to deal with it,'\u201d explained Perry. \u201cAnd the president refuses to lead on this, from my perspective.\u201d\n\nThe former Republican presidential candidate also refuted the idea that his calling of the National Guardsmen to the border is part of a potential run for president in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t got anything to do with anything other than the American citizens [that] expect Washington to respect the Constitution and secure the border, one of the things that\u2019s actually enumerated in the Constitution,\u201d Perry told Crowley. \u201cWe\u2019d like for them to do their duty.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives passed two bills to address the border crisis Friday before Congress went on recess, but President Obama is now insisting that he will \u201cact alone\u201d to fix the problem. Such lone action will undoubtedly fuel House Republicans as they plan to pursue a lawsuit against Obama for his overuse of executive power.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Texas Governor Rick Perry joined CNN's Candy Crowley on \"State of the Union\" Sunday to discuss the immigration crisis at the nation's southern border and express his disapproval of President Obama's inaction on the issue.", "title": "Rick Perry cites homicides, sexual assaults committed by illegal...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/08/perry-600x323.jpg", "height": 323}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/03/rick-perry-cites-homicides-sexual-assaults-committed-illegal-immigrants-reason-secure-border/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "rick-perry-texas-border", "published_time": "2014-08-03T11:49:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-03T11:49:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5ac\"", "article_summary": "Perry specifically pointed to the \u201csubstantial crimes\u201d committed by individuals crossing into the country illegally as cause for great concern.\n\u201cI wish the president would respect that desire of Texans and the citizens of this country to secure the border.\n\u201cThese individuals are responsible for over 3,000 homicides and almost 8,000 sexual assaults,\u201d continued Perry.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do what we have to do to keep our citizens safe,\u201d Perry said.\n\u201c[Americans would] like to see a president who leads this country and says, \u2018You know what, we do have a problem on our southern border."}
