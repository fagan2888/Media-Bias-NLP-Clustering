We really were.\u201d\n\nA week before their title shot, Plummer and a bunch of his teammates gathered to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers upset Peyton Manning\u2019s top-seeded Colts 21-18 at Indianapolis, giving the Broncos home-field advantage in the AFC championship game.\n\n\u201cAfter we beat the Patriots (in the divisional round), we were hanging out watching the Steelers play the Colts,\u201d Plummer recalled. \u201cWhen the Steelers upset them, it saved us from going to Indy, where the Colts had hammered us in the playoffs the previous two years. We were pumped.\u201d\n\nBut the Broncos were quickly deflated on championship Sunday. With an estimated 8,000 Steelers fans waving their black-and-gold \u201cTerrible Towels\u201d at Invesco Field at Mile High, Pittsburgh destroyed the Broncos 34-17. Plummer, who had played so well as the Broncos rolled to a 13-3 regular-season record, could not rally his team after it fell behind 24-3 by halftime. The freewheeling, fun-loving Plummer was smothered by Pittsburgh\u2019s defense. He went 18-for-30 for 223 yards with two lost fumbles and two interceptions. He threw one pass underhanded.\n\n\u201cShocked? I think a little bit, to some degree,\u201d Plummer said. \u201cI look back on it, and I think that we really didn\u2019t play in many close games and didn\u2019t have to make comebacks. I think those close games can build character for a team. That might have helped us.\u201d\n\nThe loss, and Plummer\u2019s erratic performance, pushed his precarious relationship with coach Mike Shanahan over the edge. In the spring, Shanahan chose Vanderbilt quarterback Jay Cutler with the Broncos\u2019 first pick in the draft. During the 2006 season, Shanahan benched Plummer in favor of the rookie.\n\n\u201cThe 2005 season was a fun season, but it was also a high-stress season,\u201d recalled Plummer. \u201cI thought the winning would make everything a bit easier, but it seemed like there was more stress every time we won.\u201d\n\nPlummer was not fond of the hype that came with the NFL, and with the championship game week in particular.\n\n\u201cI just liked to play the game of football,\u201d Plummer said. \u201cThere was all of this stuff that you don\u2019t like to deal with. On that Thursday before the game, we had to get dressed up and go downtown for a press conference where we answered the same dumb questions. Me? I just wanted to get it over with and go out and play football.\u201d\n\nAfter being traded to Tampa Bay, Plummer retired in March 2007 before ever playing a down for the Buccaneers. He turned down the $5.3 million he would have made playing in 2007.\n\nEight years after the love-hate game, football is still in his blood. He worked eight games as a college football analyst for the Pac-12 Network this past fall. He will be watching Sunday when Manning\u2019s Broncos host New England and quarterback Tom Brady in the AFC championship game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fun game to watch,\u201d Plummer said. \u201cWe have two traditional drop-back quarterbacks who can chuck it around with as much accuracy as anybody who\u2019s ever played.\u201d\n\nPlummer was only 32 when he retired, so he marvels that Manning, at age 37, is shooting for another Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Plummer said. \u201cI can\u2019t fathom some of the things he does. He approaches the game so that he\u2019s always prepared; he always plays to the best of his ability and puts his best effort forward. It\u2019s really remarkable, and it\u2019s fun to watch.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former Broncos QB Jake Plummer recalls his AFC championship game", "title": "Former Broncos QB Jake Plummer recalls his AFC championship game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/18/former-broncos-qb-jake-plummer-recalls-his-afc-championship-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__20140119_C5_SP19FBNJAKEp1.jpg", "height": 561}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__20140119_C5_SP19FBNJAKEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-18T18:56:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T07:25:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0512\"", "article_summary": "He will be watching Sunday when Manning\u2019s Broncos host New England and quarterback Tom Brady in the AFC championship game.\nEight years later, the 2005 season\u2019s AFC championship game remains a love-hate memory for Jake Plummer, the last quarterback to lead the Broncos into that contest.\n\u201cAfter we beat the Patriots (in the divisional round), we were hanging out watching the Steelers play the Colts,\u201d Plummer recalled.\nDuring the 2006 season, Shanahan benched Plummer in favor of the rookie.\n\u201cThe 2005 season was a fun season, but it was also a high-stress season,\u201d recalled Plummer."}
