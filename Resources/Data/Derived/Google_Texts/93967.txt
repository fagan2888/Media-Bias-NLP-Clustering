Vermont Business Magazine New York residents pay the most for basic health insurance and Vermont is second, but has the highest monthly premium at $469 a month, compared with New Mexico, which has the lowest monthly premium at $181 a month. New Mexico pays the least for basic health insurance, according to a new study released today by leading personal finance website GOBankingRates.com. The study compared silver plans ― the most popular plan according to the Department of Health and Human Services ― offered through the national or state-level insurance exchanges administered through the Affordable Care Act.

The lowest-cost silver plans for each state were ranked based on the favorability of the following cost factors:

The plan's monthly premium

The deductible

The emergency care copay

The copay for care from a primary physician

"Higher insurance costs in many states are tied to high costs of living or being in rural areas," said Elyssa Kirkham, the lead GOBankingRates reporter on the study. "Where costs of living are high, like New York or Vermont, care is also likely to be more expensive, a cost which insurers pass to enrollees through higher premiums."

"Competition is another key factor of health insurance costs," said Kirkham. "In rural states like Wyoming and Oklahoma, fewer residents means a smaller health insurance market with fewer options, where insurers can charge more without losing customers. Of course, subsidies can offset these costs, but this form of assistance also varies widely from state to state," she said.

2. Vermont

Vermont's cheapest silver option, the Silver CDHP Plan from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont, has the highest monthly premium of any state, charging $469 a month, or $5,628 a year in premiums. The yearly cost on this plan is estimated at $7,317 on average by Vermont's exchange site and up to $11,377 in a "bad year" with many health expenses.

These high costs are offset somewhat by a low deductible of just $1,425, one of the lowest of the silver plans included in this ranking. The policyholder is still responsible for some costs once the deductible is met, however, such as a 25 percent co-insurance on emergency care and a 10 percent co-insurance charge for visits to a primary care physician. Vermont's health insurance exchange, Vermont Health Connect, added a comparison tool to its website in December 2015 that allows shoppers to compare out-of-pocket costs and premiums on different plans.

Additional insights:

The state with the highest monthly premium is Vermont, at $469 a month, compared with New Mexico, which has the lowest monthly premium at $181 a month.

Primary doctor copays vary widely by state. West Virginia and Indiana have no copays, but Californians' copays are the highest ― $250.

Deductible costs range from $1,300 in North Dakota to $6,850 in South Carolina, which is more than five times the price.

Despite New Mexico's low costs, many residents have encountered difficulties in January 2016 getting their health coverage due to a high volume of December 2015 health insurance applications still being processed.
