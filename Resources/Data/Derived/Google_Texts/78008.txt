VALLEY VIEW, Ohio- Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio answered questions from Ohio voters at Yours Truly in Valley View on Friday.

During the town hall, the U.S. Senator from Florida talked about small businesses, military veterans and Obamacare. He also explained the history of ISIS and his plan for dealing with the radical group.

"The only way that ISIS can ultimately be defeated is by Sunnis themselves on the ground. They have to be defeated on the ground," Rubio said. "They are not just a terrorist group, they are an armed insurgency."

He said we have to cut off funding and recruiting to ISIS.

"We need to undertake, through our special operations, the best in the world, high-profile humiliating defeats. Go into their camps, capture their leaders, film it, publicize it online and show the world that these guys are not only not invincible, but they can be beaten," Rubio said.

There were a few light-hearted moments during the town hall. Rubio chanted "O-H-I-O" with supporters and said he was a fan of Ohio State coach Urban Meyer, who also lead the University of Florida to two BCS Championships.

"I thought he was excellent. I love his ideas on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear program to ensure safety for our country and Israel," Hunter Goldberg said following Rubio's appearance.
