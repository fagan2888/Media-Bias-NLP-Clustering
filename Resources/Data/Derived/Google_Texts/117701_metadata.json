(AP) \u2014 Michael Schuckers doesn\u2019t consider himself a die-hard hockey fan, yet all he seems to think about in his spare time is that frozen rubber disk and what happens to it in every moment of every NHL game.\n\nThat\u2019s to be expected for someone in the vanguard of hockey analytics. Schuckers, a statistics professor at St. Lawrence University, has been crunching hockey numbers in his office for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, a lot of academics would dabble with the stuff but wouldn\u2019t do it a lot because it was not really rewarded in academia,\u201d said Schuckers, whose first paper was a chart on the NFL draft that placed a value on each player picked as a guide for possible trades. \u201cAt that time, it was a very, very small community of folks who were doing it. Now, probably half the teams in the NHL have somebody on staff doing this.\u201d\n\nHockey is following the lead of baseball and basketball, the forerunners in the expansion of advanced statistics in sports. Just over a year ago, the NHL began offering enhanced statistics on its website, NHL.com.\n\nFor front offices and fans alike, the simple stuff (goals for and against, power-play goals, assists, saves, et cetera) simply isn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more and more data becoming available, and it\u2019s being accepted more and more in the industry,\u201d said Brian Macdonald, director of hockey analytics for the Florida Panthers. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more acceptable to use data to make a decision. It\u2019s something that we would like to be a priority in our organization, both on the hockey side and the business side.\u201d\n\nCorsi and Fenwick, formulas to figure out time of possession in hockey, paved the way in hockey analytics. They\u2019re very similar and flawed because they treat all events as equal \u2014 a hit in the neutral zone, a blocked shot, a scoring chance on a breakaway, from the blue line or from in front of the net, and so on.\n\nMore complex analytics have followed, and the sky seems to be the limit going forward. Analytics data will be used in player personnel decisions, trades, evaluating coaches, matchups, line combinations and in pro and amateur scouting.\n\nSchuckers, who combined with St. Lawrence women\u2019s hockey coach Chris Wells to create Statistical Sports Consulting, won second prize three years ago at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference with his Total Hockey Rating (THoR). It was a joint project with Jim Curro, a student writing his senior thesis.\n\nTHoR is a two-way player rating that accounts for every on-ice action event for every player. The score of the game and where players\u2019 shifts start also are accounted for. Each event is assessed a value according to the chance that it leads to a goal. THoR also uses a statistical model to determine the value of each player\u2019s contribution to the overall outcomes that occur while they are on the ice.\n\nEach play from the NHL\u2019s Real Time Scoring System (RTSS) is evaluated for its likelihood to lead to a goal in the ensuing 20 seconds. Ratings account for a player\u2019s impact after adjusting for the quality of teammates, quality of competition, zone starts, score effects, et cetera. The metric is Wins Above Replacement (WAR) relative to position.\n\nTo be certain, this is not yet rocket science. RTSS is known to be skewed with inconsistencies in the recording of events from rink to rink, though THoR accounts for this in its calculations.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of things that aren\u2019t there,\u201d Schuckers said. \u201cThey\u2019re not recording passes. They\u2019re not recording, necessarily, where the puck is at any given moment. But hits, shots, they do try to get that right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hockey analytics a good match for NY statistics professor", "author": "John Kekis", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hockey analytics a good match for NY statistics professor", "title": "Hockey analytics a good match for NY statistics professor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/05/hockey_analytics_a_good_match_for_ny_statistics_professor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/hockey-analytics.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hockey analytics a good match for NY statistics professor", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/hockey-analytics.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Hockey analytics a good match for NY statistics professor", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Hockey analytics a good match for NY statistics professor", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s to be expected for someone in the vanguard of hockey analytics.\nSchuckers, a statistics professor at St. Lawrence University, has been crunching hockey numbers in his office for more than a decade.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more and more data becoming available, and it\u2019s being accepted more and more in the industry,\u201d said Brian Macdonald, director of hockey analytics for the Florida Panthers.\nIt\u2019s something that we would like to be a priority in our organization, both on the hockey side and the business side.\u201dCorsi and Fenwick, formulas to figure out time of possession in hockey, paved the way in hockey analytics.\nAnalytics data will be used in player personnel decisions, trades, evaluating coaches, matchups, line combinations and in pro and amateur scouting."}
