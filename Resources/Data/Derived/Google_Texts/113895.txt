PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh Steelers are heading to Denver but are worried about quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.

Roethlisberger injured his right shoulder in the third quarter of Saturday night’s wild-card win over Cincinnati. He returned to lead a game-winning drive, but will be evaluated this week. Wide receiver Antonio Brown is also recovering from a concussion.

The Steelers beat the Broncos 34-27 on Dec. 20, rallying from a 17-point deficit. Denver quarterback Peyton Manning missed that game with an injury. He is expected to start next Sunday.

Pittsburgh has won just two of its past eight visits to Denver, including a 29-23 overtime loss to the Broncos five years ago.
