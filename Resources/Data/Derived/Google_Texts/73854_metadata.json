I believe that evolutionary psychology explains away altruism and debunks love, and that brain chemistry undermines the illusion of free will and personhood.\n\nI also believe that a spiritual reality hovering over, in and through me calls me to love, trust and hear the voice of my creator.\n\nIt seems to me that there is an offstage and an onstage quality to my existence. I live onstage, but I sense another crew working offstage. Sometimes I hear their voices \u201csinging\u201d in a way that\u2019s as eerily beautiful as the offstage chorus in an opera.\n\nMy youngest grandchildren Lucy (5) and Jack (3) are still comfortable with this paradoxical way of seeing reality.\n\nMost grownups don\u2019t have the transparent humility to deal with the fact that unknowing is OK. But Lucy and Jack seem to accept that something may never have happened but can still be true.\n\nFor instance they take Bible stories we read at face value, and yet I see a flicker in their eyes that tells me that they already know the stories are not true in the same way boiling water is true and can be tested\u2014it\u2019s hot!\n\nIt's like that mind-bending discovery from quantum mechanics that tiny objects like electrons can actually be in two places at once and act simultaneously like a particle and a wave.\n\nMaybe my grandchildren will embrace quantum theory, and won't look for ways to make the irrational rational by hiding behind words like \u201cmystery\u201d in order to sustain their faith in science or God.\n\nOr maybe they'll embrace apophatic theology, the theology of not knowing.\n\nAtheists in the Bible Belt: A survival guide\n\nBut it's not the easiest thing to do.\n\nOur brains are not highly evolved enough to reconcile our hunger for both absolute certainty and transcendent, inexplicable experiences.\n\nNor can I reconcile these ideas: \u201cI know that the only thing that exists is this material universe,\u201d and \u201cI know that my redeemer liveth.\u201d\n\nDepending on the day you ask me, both statements seem true. And I don't think I'm alone in that.\n\nBehold, the six types of atheists\n\nWe\u2019re all in the closet, so to speak. We barely come out to ourselves and never completely to others. I have met people who claim a label - evangelical or atheist - until you really get to know them.\n\nThen, things get more complicated.\n\nMany of us, even the devout, have many more questions than answers about God and religion.\n\nIn other words, people just like me: atheists who pray and eloquent preachers who secretly harbor doubts.\n\nI believe that we\u2019re all of at least two minds. We play a role and define that role as \u201cme\u201d because labels and membership in a tribe make the world feel a little safer.\n\nWhen I was raising my children, I pretended to be grownup daddy. But alone with my thoughts, I was still just me. I\u2019m older now, and some younger people may think I know something.\n\nI do: I know how much I can never know.\n\nMany Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Christians inherited their faith because of where they were born. If you are an atheist, you hold those beliefs because of a book or two you read, or who your parents were and the century in which you were born.\n\nDon\u2019t delude yourself: There are no ultimate reasons for anything, just circumstances.\n\nIf you want to be sure you have \"the truth\" about yourself and our universe, then prepare to go mad. Or prepare to turn off your brain and cling to some form or other of fundamentalism, whether religious or secular.\n\nYou will always be more than one person. You will always embody contradiction.\n\nYou\u2014like some sort of quantum mechanicals physics experiment\u2014will always be in two places at once.\n\nFrank Schaeffer is a writer.
