When Mike took over the case, it was three years after the murder, and at the time there was little hope that my husband's tragic death would ever have the justice that deserved.\n\nWhen Mike first came to see the family, he assured my daughter, Heather, that he would do whatever he could in his power to find her father's killer. Mike worked tirelessly on the case until the day came when in his heart, he knew who was responsible for Pat's murder. I believe that without Mike's hard work and dedication to the case, it would not have been solved and we never would have brought the family and my husband justice.\n\nWith Mike Lukas as sheriff, Portage County would not only have the person best qualified but would also have the most caring and dedicated sheriff they would ever need or want.\n\nAnna Zemke,\n\nStevens Point\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1nurzK6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lukas reassured our family and brought a killer to justice.", "og": {"site_name": "Stevens Point Journal Media", "description": "Lukas reassured our family and brought a killer to justice.", "title": "Letter: Lukas solved my husband's murder", "url": "http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/opinion/2014/08/07/letter-lukas-solved-husbands-murder/13668473/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/stevenspointjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lukas reassured our family and brought a killer to justice.", "title": "Letter: Lukas solved my husband's murder", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04c246d7be1854cdbd6f060cecbc4d2da878b907/c=0-0-858-858&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/StevensPoint/2014/08/06/zemke.jpg", "creator": "@StevensPointJRL", "site": "@StevensPointJRL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884242174", "fb": {"app_id": 116784471723374}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Stevens Point Journal Media file photo)Buy PhotoEDITOR: I met Mike Lukas under the most tragic circumstances.\nWith Mike Lukas as sheriff, Portage County would not only have the person best qualified but would also have the most caring and dedicated sheriff they would ever need or want.\nMike worked tirelessly on the case until the day came when in his heart, he knew who was responsible for Pat's murder.\nLukas reassured our family and brought a killer to justice.\nBuy Photo Heather Zemke, left, leaves the courtroom in Aug. 2011 after Michael Haydon was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the killing of her father Pat Zemke in 2003."}
