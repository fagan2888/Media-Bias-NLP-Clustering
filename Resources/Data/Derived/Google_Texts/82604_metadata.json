Creative Commons\n\nEuropean regulators this month approved a biologically similar version of an antibody-based drug for treating rheumatoid arthritis, in a move with global implications.\n\nThe decision opens the way for pharmaceutical companies looking to produce so-called \u201cbiosimilar\u201d drugs for the treatment of complex diseases, effectively mimicking patented drugs worth billions of dollars. Analysts expect to see greater competition in the market for such biotechnology drugs, making treatment more widely available for patients around the world.\n\n\"Today's announcement is confirmation that Inflectra has met the very rigorous quality, safety and efficacy requirements that have been established by the EMA, and provides the next step toward Inflectra being approved for use in Europe,\" Stan Bukofzer, Hospira's corporate vice president and chief medical officer, told reporters.\n\nAlthough such biologic drugs have greatly improved the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, among other conditions, they have also drained the healthcare budgets of many countries, according to Richard Davies, another representative of the copycat manufacturer. \"In a time when there is mounting pressure on health care budgets worldwide, Inflectra provides an opportunity to increase patient access to more affordable biologic therapy while maintaining high quality standards,\" said Davies.\n\nThe drug treats rheumatoid arthritis by targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha, a protein that helps cause the painful inflammation that plagues suffers of the condition, in addition to causing inflammatory bowel disease and plaque psoriasis. The drug's safety, efficacy, and tolerability were proven following a Phase III randomized, controlled clinical trial. Nearly three-quarters (73.4 percent) of patients who received the drug experienced a greater than 20 percent improvement in symptoms after 30 weeks using the injections or infusions. The drug was also shown to be as safe as its progenitor, Remicade.\n\nDrug manufacturer Celltrion, of South Korea, plans to seek regulatory approval for Inflectra later this year in Japan and in the United States by 2015. Following the recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in June, the manufacturer will use U.S.-based Hospira to market the drug. Hospira said the new copycat drug would be distributed throughout Europe \u201cat the earliest opportunity, taking into account any relevant patent protection.\u201d\n\nEssentially, the drug is a biosimilar copycat of Remicade, which is produced by Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co. The drug is delivered by injection or infusion and, unlike drugs in pill form, has enjoyed a greater protection from generic copycat versions. However, European regulators on Tuesday made clear they\u2019re receptive to greater competition.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "remicade, inflectra, rheumatoid arthritis, biosimilar drug", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "European regulators made an important decision Tuesday on the future of biologically similar drugs for the treatment of complex diseases by approving Inflectra.", "title": "EU Approves Inflectra, First 'Biosimilar' Antibody Drug, For Rheumatoid Arthritis", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/eu-approves-inflectra-rheumatoid-arthritis-first-biosimilar-antibody-drug-clears-path-greater-256269", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/european-regulators-approve-first-copycat-version-antibody-drug.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "European regulators made an important decision Tuesday on the future of biologically similar drugs for the treatment of complex diseases by approving Inflectra.", "title": "EU Approves Inflectra, First 'Biosimilar' Antibody Drug, For Rheumatoid Arthritis", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/eu-approves-inflectra-rheumatoid-arthritis-first-biosimilar-antibody-drug-clears-path-greater-256269", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/european-regulators-approve-first-copycat-version-antibody-drug.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/european-regulators-approve-first-copycat-version-antibody-drug.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2013-09-10T16:23:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-10T16:23:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "European regulators made an important decision Tuesday on the future of biologically similar drugs for the treatment of complex diseases by approving Inflectra."}, "article_summary": "European regulatory authorities on Tuesday approved the first \"biosimilar\" version of the rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, clearing the way for greater competition from copycats.\nHowever, European regulators on Tuesday made clear they\u2019re receptive to greater competition.\nAnalysts expect to see greater competition in the market for such biotechnology drugs, making treatment more widely available for patients around the world.\nHospira said the new copycat drug would be distributed throughout Europe \u201cat the earliest opportunity, taking into account any relevant patent protection.\u201dEssentially, the drug is a biosimilar copycat of Remicade, which is produced by Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co.\nThe decision opens the way for pharmaceutical companies looking to produce so-called \u201cbiosimilar\u201d drugs for the treatment of complex diseases, effectively mimicking patented drugs worth billions of dollars."}
