Lisa says that she feels \u201cstuck and depressed\u201d. She thinks that Bill needs to make more money, like bartending on weekends. She feels that the pressure is on her to make money.\n\nSuze asks Bill if Lisa always blames him. \u201cBill, why don\u2019t you make more money? Why don\u2019t you spend less money?\u201d Bill says, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely \u2018why don\u2019t you make more money?'\u201d He says that she keeps pushing the \u201cMake More Money\u201d button.\n\nDebt Consumer Debt $3,760.00 Mortgage Debt $333,389.00 Total Debt $337,149.00 Savings Liquid $28,000.00 Current Home Value $490,000.00 Investments $17,000.00 Retirement $9,678.00 Total Assets $544,678.00\n\nSuze tells them that they\u2019re retirement is \u201cbad\u201d, which they acknowledge, of course. Their problem is that Lisa\u2019s whole salary goes to paying for their house and Bill\u2019s money all goes to his business. So they borrow from credit cards to pay themselves.\n\nLisa says that she\u2019s willing to cut down on all other expenses, but wants to keep the house. This is my 1st time to see someone resist Suze so openly in the 9 months that I\u2019ve recapped the show. Suze tells Lisa that she doesn\u2019t want to change anything.\n\nCan i Afford It?\n\nSuze denies Mark a $50,000 basement rec room for the kids & a \u201cman cave\u201d for the adults, to entertain. Suze points out to him that the man cave is his, and not have anything to do with his wife. Suze also denies Lisa 2 Cher concert tickets that cost $1,000, because of her credit card debt.\n\nCallers who go on the show get \u201cApproved\u201d or \u201cDenied\u201d shirts.\n\nsuzeorman.com\n\nsuze.CNBC.com\n\nSuze\u2018s on Facebook and Twitter: @suzeormanshow\n\nThat\u2019s our recap of The Suze Orman Show today, 3/15/14.
