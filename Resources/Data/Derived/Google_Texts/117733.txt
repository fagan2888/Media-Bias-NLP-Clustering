Indianapolis — Badgers junior forward Sam Dekker has nearly 75,000 Twitter followers, but his account lost its verified status overnight. That's because his handle changed from @samdek1 to @dekker.

The weird thing is, he says he didn't do it.

I guess my Twitter handle changed.... — Sam Dekker (@dekker) April 4, 2015 “@UWMadison: @dekker Wow— but no blue checkmark??” I honestly didn't change it haha — Sam Dekker (@dekker) April 4, 2015 Everyone, the person using @samdek1 is not me. My handle got changed last night. Sorry for the mix up. — Sam Dekker (@dekker) April 4, 2015

Dekker's handle change isn't getting as much traction as Green Bay Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb's tweet from Friday night. The Packers star was drafted in 2011, but he played his college ball at Kentucky.

Cobb made it clear where his allegiance lies.
