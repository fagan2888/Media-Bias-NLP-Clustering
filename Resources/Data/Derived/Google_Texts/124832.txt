Ben Carson declared to NBC’s Chris Jansing that he is being scrutinized and attacked now because he is a threat to secular progressives.

In an interview that aired on Meet the Press this morning, Jansing pressed Carson on how a new WSJ report raises questions about his claim that he sheltered white students after a riot. No one has come forward to corroborate that, but Carson aked, “Why would they know about that unless they were one of the students?”

He admitted getting a detail wrong in his West Point story, but said on the question of his violent past that his brother has no interest in corroborating him by talking to the media.

Jansing asked Carson if he just didn’t expect this level of vetting. Carson said it’s worse for him than anyone else he’s seen. Jansing challenged him on how Democrats have been challenged––especially President Obama with his birth certificate––but Carson said his case is unique.

When asked why he thinks he’s getting the brunt of attacks, Carson said, “I’m a threat… to the progressive, the secular progressive movement in this country.”
