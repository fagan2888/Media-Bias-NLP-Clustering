Former University of Notre Dame basketball coach Digger Phelps has publicly decried the plan, saying when kids aren\u2019t challenged, they\u2019ll be satisfied earning Ds. And a member of the school board who strongly opposes it, says he\u2019s gotten dozens of emails and phone calls from community members who support him.\n\nBut, South Bend coaches The Tribune interviewed last week say the change is needed because students who don\u2019t meet the current 2.0 grade point average requirement \u2014 which is more stringent than the Indiana High School Athletic Association\u2019s eligibility requirement \u2014 are falling through the cracks when they\u2019re forbidden to participate.\n\nMilt Lee, an intermediate center baseball and football coach in South Bend, who also has two kids of his own in the district, supports the proposed changes to the athletic eligibility policy.\n\nEvery season, he said, he has to inform at least one student that because of his grades, he can\u2019t play.\n\nAs a coach, Lee, who also is executive director of the Food Bank of Northern Indiana, said, \u201cYou get tired of seeing the same type of kid losing out on opportunities. He\u2019s at a stage in his life when maybe he hasn\u2019t quite figured things out. Maybe he\u2019s moved three times. \u2026 It\u2019s just discouraging to see that happen when you know if that kid had an opportunity to be around a team, that type of family, things could change for him.\u201d\n\nThe proposed policy for middle school athletics follows IHSAA standards, which require student athletes to pass 70 percent of their classes.\n\nThe policy for high school athletes would be more stringent than IHSAA\u2019s, but less restrictive than South Bend\u2019s current policy, which requires a 2.0 GPA.\n\nAnd students who don\u2019t meet the district\u2019s requirements (but still qualify via IHSAA guidelines) would be able to participate in sports if they take part in tutoring opportunities provided by the district and show improvement in their grades.\n\nBoth Penn and Mishawaka high schools follow the IHSAA academic eligibility guidelines. If the policy changes are implemented when the board votes on the matter on Monday evening, South Bend\u2019s standards would still be higher.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a perception out there that we\u2019re lowering the standards,\u201d board Secretary Stan Wruble said last week, \u201cbut we\u2019re absolutely requiring two things\u201d of students, he said, that they \u201cattend study tables and improve their grades.\u201d\n\nThe policy change, said Wruble, who is also on a new athletic committee that recommended the changes, is needed not to make South Bend athletic teams more competitive, but to save kids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for those borderline athletes we might otherwise lose to the streets,\u201d he said.\n\nJoe Szajko, a math teacher and head football coach at Clay High School, said more than 80 students signed up for football last spring. But when grades came out, he learned that 31 were academically ineligible. Statistically, he said, those students will not come back and try out again.\n\n\u201cWe lose them,\u201d Szajko said. And once we lose them, it\u2019s hard to pull them back because they get involved with other things.\u201d\n\nThe current 2.0 policy, he said, is a great concept in theory. But, year after year, it excludes kids who he believes could have benefited from being on the team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re advocating this because we think we\u2019ve got a bunch of kids that just can\u2019t make it\u201d academically, he said of the policy revisions. \u201cNo, we\u2019re advocating it because we\u2019ve got a lot of kids who are searching to be part of something. I just think every kid needs to have a chance to be part of the team.\u201d\n\nThe history\n\nSouth Bend\u2019s current policy, which was phased in between 2009 and 2012, mandates a 2.0 GPA for student-athletes in grades six through 12.\n\nThat initiative was spearheaded by former board member Roger Parent, along with a committee of coaches and administrators.\n\nParent has spoken out against the proposed changes, which, he says, dilute the intention of the current policy that is to create higher expectations for all students.\n\nThe policy in place now was also supported by former Superintendent James Kapsa after many modifications to phase it in slowly and amid a commitment on Kapsa\u2019s part to establish study tables. The district got a huge boost in 2010 when it received a four-year federal grant worth $205,000 each year to run after-school study tables for all students at Riley and Washington high schools. Clay and Adams also had after-school tutoring programs.\n\nAnd though the federal grant ran out after the 2013-14 school year, study tables for athletes have continued at each of the district\u2019s four high schools, a spokeswoman said.\n\nOpposing voices\n\nChris Matthys, a former South Bend teacher and athletic director who was involved in crafting the current 2.0 policy said he has a lot of questions about the proposed policy.\n\n\u201cWhat GPA are you talking about? Current? Cumulative? Previous grading period? \u2026 And all that grade standard does is trigger (participation in) study tables. What if they (athletes) don\u2019t go to study tables for one week? Can they go the next week and (be eligible to) play?\u201d\n\nMatthys, who teaches in Michigan now, said he agrees with Parent that kids will generally live up to adult expectations for their academic performance. But, he said, it takes a lot of work, commitment and resources to make that happen.\n\n\u201cThe (proposed) policy has no teeth to it from a practical standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s little data out there saying kids are dropping out of school because they can\u2019t play in sports.\u201d\n\nJennifer Chokey, a 2014 Riley High School graduate and two-sport athlete, said she\u2019d like to see the athletic eligibility policy remain as is.\n\nThough she said her GPA never dropped below a 2.0 in high school, the current policy was never stressed by her coaches. So, she fears that if the standards are lowered, there likely will be even less emphasis on athletes\u2019 academic achievement.\n\nChokey is now a college student and tutor at the Kroc Center. \u201cI want my students to want to learn and want to crave knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cI want every one of those kids to want the most in life because I can already see their potential.\u201d\n\nOne school board member, Bill Sniadecki, has vocalized his opposition to the policy change since it was first introduced two weeks ago.\n\nAfter he wrote a Viewpoint that was published in The Tribune on July 24, Sniadecki said he received dozens of emails and phone calls from community members saying they agree with him, that it\u2019s a disservice to students to lower GPA standards for athletes.\n\nBut since then, he\u2019s come up with a compromise, which he says he\u2019ll present at Monday\u2019s board meeting.\n\nHe\u2019d like the 2.0 GPA requirement to be maintained for all student-athletes, but he likes the idea of allowing those whose grades slip below that \u2014 but who still meet the IHSAA guidelines \u2014 to attend study tables, show improvement in their grades and still be able to participate in sports.\n\nSzajko, the Clay High School coach, said of the current policy, \u201cStandards are good. But there\u2019s also got to be that level of forgiveness built in where we\u2019re going to give you a chance and provide the support needed.\u201d\n\nThere are also an indeterminate number of students who don\u2019t even bother trying out for sports in South Bend, Szajko said, because they know they don\u2019t meet the 2.0 GPA requirement.\n\n\u201cBut if you tell a kid, \u2018(if) you can pass by IHSAA standards, you can play, but you have to go to study table,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201c it creates a culture where a kid says, \u2018you know what? I might be able to make it.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "Coaches say changes are needed", "title": "South Bend school board to vote on athletic policy revisions Monday", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/education/south-bend-school-board-to-vote-on-athletic-policy-revisions/article_21bbbad9-c25f-5c0b-8add-c558b1785ed2.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/75/e755e4d4-3449-11e4-886e-001a4bcf6878/5408885db39e4.image.jpg?resize=760%2C480", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sbtribune", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/75/e755e4d4-3449-11e4-886e-001a4bcf6878/5408885db39e4.image.jpg?resize=760%2C480", "description": "Coaches say changes are needed", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "South Bend school board to vote on athletic policy revisions Monday"}, "description": "Coaches say changes are needed", "Published Date": "2015-08-02T05:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "keywords": "#loc,south bend schools,athletic policiy,education,local,featured", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/292274944144605"}, "news_keywords": "#loc,south bend schools,athletic policiy,education,local,featured"}, "article_summary": "SOUTH BEND \u2014 A proposed policy change by the South Bend Community School Corp. to relax eligibility requirements for student athletes has drawn a firestorm of criticism since it was introduced two weeks ago.\nThe policy for high school athletes would be more stringent than IHSAA\u2019s, but less restrictive than South Bend\u2019s current policy, which requires a 2.0 GPA.\nThe South Bend Common Council unanimously passed a resolution asking the district to put the brakes on the proposal.\nThough she said her GPA never dropped below a 2.0 in high school, the current policy was never stressed by her coaches.\nSzajko, the Clay High School coach, said of the current policy, \u201cStandards are good."}
