EDITOR: Portage County, at the recommendation of the county executive, recently engaged the services of a consultant to conduct a salary study for Portage County employees. The goal is to improve the wages of county employees and make county wages more competitive in the marketplace.

The consultant was to determine the wages of comparable positions and prepare a new wage plan for county employees. The study’s recommended wage plan was released earlier this year.

If implemented, the new wage plan will bring huge wage increases to many higher-up county employees and pennies to others.

For example, the county executive would receive an $18,000 increase, her assistant $10,000. This is all very scientific and based on comparables. Ask yourself, who are the comparables? In the case of the county executive position, it’s much bigger and wealthier counties, for example, Waukesha County. Should Portage County’s executive make the same as the Waukesha County executive? I think not.

I was told that at several county leaders meetings, the county executive boasted of the $500,000 she carved out of the budget process to bring fairer, family-sustaining wages to county employees. But the proposed wage plan gives a majority of the wage increases to already highly paid county employees. If there was any real interest in bringing a better living wage to the rank and file, the majority of the $500,000 would be going to them, not the county’s fat cats.

One more question: Where did the $500,000 that the county executive boasted about come from? The simple answer is from cutting county department budgets, thereby reducing service to county residents.

Patty Dreier and her accomplices should be ashamed.
