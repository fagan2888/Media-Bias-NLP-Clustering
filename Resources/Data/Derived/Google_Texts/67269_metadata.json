Only this is a new kind of business conference with a special Colorado theme: legal weed.\n\nAfter Colorado voters legalized marijuana in 2012, more states and cities are considering a similar path for themselves. At the same time, the cannabis market is looking less like a music festival and more like a Silicon Valley confab \u2014 upscale, data-driven and focused on investors.\n\nVendors and potential financiers at last month\u2019s Marijuana Investor Summit here in the Mile High City say the current market for legal cannabis is more than $3 billion in the 23 states that have already legalized the drug for medicinal or recreational use. Expanding that market, they say, will require not just drug reform legislation, but also a consistent infusion of capital at a time when the marijuana economy still exists in a legal gray area \u2014 one where the drug is permitted in some states, but still outlawed at the federal level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time, but it\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d said Chris Rentner of Akouba Credit, a Chicago small business lender exploring the possibility of working with marijuana businesses. \u201cFor people that think everyone is a stoner lying on the sidewalk passed out, it\u2019s going to take time for them to get comfortable with it. But there\u2019s too much money in it. We just need to figure out the risk associated with it, but if we can find a way where it makes sense legally, then why wouldn\u2019t we try to be in this market?\u201d\n\nIf Akouba jumps into the marijuana market, the company would be trying to address one of the biggest obstacles to the industry\u2019s growth: access to financial services. Because marijuana is still prohibited under federal law, cannabis grow houses and dispensaries have trouble finding traditional banking partners, leaving much of their business to be conducted in cash.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legalized pot is worth $3 billion across 23 states, and that number will only grow with drug reform legislation", "title": "Colorado is the next Silicon Valley: Why the legalized marijuana industry is flourishing", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Legalized pot is worth $3 billion across 23 states, and that number will only grow with drug reform legislation", "title": "Colorado is the next Silicon Valley: Why the legalized marijuana industry is flourishing", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/15/colorado_is_the_next_silicon_valley_why_the_legalized_marijuana_industry_is_flourishing_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/girl_holding_weed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Legalized pot is worth $3 billion across 23 states, and that number will only grow with drug reform legislation", "title": "Colorado is the next Silicon Valley: Why the legalized marijuana industry is flourishing", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/girl_holding_weed.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Drugs, marijuana, Pot, weed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After Colorado voters legalized marijuana in 2012, more states and cities are considering a similar path for themselves.\nAt the same time, the cannabis market is looking less like a music festival and more like a Silicon Valley confab \u2014 upscale, data-driven and focused on investors.\nOnly this is a new kind of business conference with a special Colorado theme: legal weed.\nBecause marijuana is still prohibited under federal law, cannabis grow houses and dispensaries have trouble finding traditional banking partners, leaving much of their business to be conducted in cash.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time, but it\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d said Chris Rentner of Akouba Credit, a Chicago small business lender exploring the possibility of working with marijuana businesses."}
