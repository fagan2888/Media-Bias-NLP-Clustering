Though Bassem Youssef has been willing to face torture and even death for the right to mock Egypt’s leadership, something has caused network MBC-Misr to back away from the revolutionary weekly satirical news program, “Al Bernamag.”

Youssef, dubbed the Egyptian Jon Stewart, would not tell reporters the nature of the threats he’s received or who they are from, but it’s rumored that the pressure originated from Egypt’s ruler, ex-military official Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, or from the Saudi government. The AP reports:

“I want to give it to you, but I cannot,” he said with a grin, bringing a roar of laughter from his staff on stage with him and journalists. The phrase was used by el-Sissi in a recent interview and was widely mocked on social media because in Egyptian Arabic it has a sexual connotation. He also declined to comment when asked if the pressure came from the Saudi government, which has been among the main backers of el-Sissi. “I’m not a revolutionary and I’m not a warrior. I was expressing my views once a week. The present climate in Egypt is not suitable for a political satire program,” Youssef told reporters. “I’m tired of struggling and fearing and worrying about my safety and that of my family.”
