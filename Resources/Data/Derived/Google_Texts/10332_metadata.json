A newly released audit from Tennessee Comptroller Justin Wilson says Obamacare might have forced Robertson County officials to choose between raising taxes and breaking the law.\n\nLast year, county commissioners transferred $632,500 from the General Debt Service Fund to the General Purpose School Fund to comply with Obamacare, according to Wilson\u2019s audit.\n\nCounty officials needed the money to pay for health insurance for part-time employees working 30 hours a week or more, such as bus drivers and substitute teachers, said County Commissioner Ervin Brown.\n\nThe General Debt Service Fund exists to pay county debt, while money from the General Purpose School Fund pays to keep the schools running, Brown said.\n\n\u201cBased on existing opinions of the state attorney general and case law, the transfer noted is illegal,\u201d John Dunn, a spokesman for Wilson, said in an email to Watchdog.org.\n\nAccording to the Tennessee Attorney General\u2019s Office, if a taxpayer pays taxes for a specific purpose, any other use of that money is against the law.\n\nBut the fund switch has not raised any ruckus in the county north of Nashville, and Wilson\u2019s audit said nothing about the county facing any legal consequences for transferring the money.\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge, no one has requested an attorney general\u2019s opinion in this specific situation, so we are not waiting on anything further from the attorney general\u2019s office,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nRepresentatives from the office of Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery did not respond to requests for comment. Robertson County school officials were unavailable for comment Friday and Monday, as was county Finance Director Jody Stewart.\n\nRELATED \u2014 Tennessee leans on federal money\n\nCounty commissioners were well aware they were operating in iffy territory, telling auditors they \u201cdecided it prudent to accept an audit finding instead of burdening taxpayers with tax increases the following year.\u201d\n\nLast year, county commissioners charged a property tax of $2.96 per $100 of assessed value; 85 cents went into the county\u2019s General Debt Service Fund while $1.07 went into the General Purpose School Fund, according to the county\u2019s website.\n\nWithout the transfer, commissioners would have had to raise taxes another 2 cents per $100 of assessed value, according to the audit.\n\nCommissioners have since raised property taxes to $3.085 per $100 of assessed value for fiscal 2016, said Brown, who added that he \u201cwas an adamant opponent of the tax increase.\u201d\n\nBrown, the only one of 24 commissioners reached who would speak on the record about the audit, called what happened \u201can oversight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should have pre-planned for this and we didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think anybody was trying to do anything nefarious,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nFollow Chris on his professional Facebook page at Chris Butler Writer Journalist", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A newly released audit from Tennessee Comptroller Justin Wilson though, says Obamacare forced Robertson County officials to choose between raising taxes and doing something that\u2019s likely illegal.", "title": "Obamacare hangs Tennessee county on horns of legal dilemma - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/ObamaCareUncle-Sam.png", "updated_time": "2015-11-09T14:37:03+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/246142/tennessee-31/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Ervin Brown,Justin Wilson,ObamaCare,Robertson County Tennessee", "published_time": "2015-11-09T14:35:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-09T14:37:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A newly released audit from Tennessee Comptroller Justin Wilson though, says Obamacare forced Robertson County officials to choose between raising taxes and doing something that\u2019s likely illegal.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/ObamaCareUncle-Sam.png"}, "title": "Obamacare hangs Tennessee county on horns of legal dilemma - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A newly released audit from Tennessee Comptroller Justin Wilson though, says Obamacare forced Robertson County officials to choose between raising taxes and doing something that\u2019s likely illegal."}, "article_summary": "Last year, county commissioners transferred $632,500 from the General Debt Service Fund to the General Purpose School Fund to comply with Obamacare, according to Wilson\u2019s audit.\nRobertson County school officials were unavailable for comment Friday and Monday, as was county Finance Director Jody Stewart.\nRepresentatives from the office of Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe General Debt Service Fund exists to pay county debt, while money from the General Purpose School Fund pays to keep the schools running, Brown said.\nA newly released audit from Tennessee Comptroller Justin Wilson says Obamacare might have forced Robertson County officials to choose between raising taxes and breaking the law."}
