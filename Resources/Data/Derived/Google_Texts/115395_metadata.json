Now one of the largest Medicaid managed care plans in the Chicago area, CountyCare had nearly 180,000 members as of May, according to the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, which oversees Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted that this issue is resolved and coverage is protected for those we serve who put their faith in a system that truly works,\u201d Sandra Bruce, CEO of Chicago-based Presence Health, the largest Catholic hospital network in Illinois, said in a statement. \u201cWe hope that the focus now turns to enhancing coverage and care, rather than leaving those in need without an alternative.\u201d\n\nREFORM BATTLE FAR FROM OVER\n\nAvalere Health, a Washington, D.C.-based consultancy that analyzes the Affordable Care Act, said that while the ruling preserves tax credits, the battle over federal health care reform is far from over. In fact, it's likely to \u201creignite\u201d as part of the 2016 presidential race, Elizabeth Carpenter, director of Avalere, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cCongress is still likely to consider repeal of the medical device tax and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, as well as changes to the employer mandate and the Cadillac Tax,\" Carpenter said in the statement.\n\nThe public exchanges need to focus on boosting enrollment and attracting younger, healthier enrollees to ensure a variety of affordable plans, Avalere Senior Vice President Caroline Pearson said in the statement.\n\nSCOTUS Ruling", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160526_01:37:35", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "title": "Obamacare Supreme Court ruling cautiously applauded by Illinois groups", "taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150625/NEWS03/150629875/AR/0/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-ruling-applauded-in-Illinois.jpg", "taxo_People": "Sandra Bruce", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "summary": "Even as Illinois hospitals, insurers and associations welcome today's decision, they note that the federal health care reform fight is far from over.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Even as Illinois hospitals, insurers and associations welcome today's decision, they note that the federal health care reform fight is far from over.", "title": "Among health care groups, muted applause for Obamacare ruling", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150625/NEWS03/150629875/among-health-care-groups-muted-applause-for-obamacare-ruling", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150625/NEWS03/150629875/AR/0/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-ruling-applauded-in-Illinois.jpg", "type": "article"}, "published_at": "2015-6-25", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/150629875", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Presence Health", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150625/NEWS03/150629875/AR/0/Obamacare-Supreme-Court-ruling-applauded-in-Illinois.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare Supreme Court ruling cautiously applauded by Illinois groups"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31aa\"", "article_summary": "But many also caution that the battle to preserve pieces of federal health care reform, commonly referred to as Obamacare, isn't over.\nIn Illinois hospitals, insurers and health care associations applauded the U.S. Supreme Court's decision today to uphold subsidies that consumers use to buy plans on the health insurance exchanges.\nThe council sponsored Land of Lincoln Health, a new type of insurer made possible under the Affordable Care Act that offers plans on the Illinois health insurance exchange.\nCook County Health, one of the largest public health systems in the nation, launched CountyCare under the ACA.\n\u201cThese Illinoisans now receive more than $49 million a month in subsidies (nearly $600 million on an annualized basis).\""}
