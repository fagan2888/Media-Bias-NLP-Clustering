A shade structure is planned for the exterior.\n\nThe building, which still has to be approved by the full City Council, is the final phase of an improvement project that has included parking, a picnic area and restrooms.\n\nThe equestrian area is located on the east side of Fortuna Mountain in the 5,800-acre park, near Mast Boulevard and state Route 52. It includes four 12- by 12-foot horse corrals for public use, trails and room for 47 cars and 15 vehicles with horse trailers.\n\nCouncilman Scott Sherman, who represents the area, said the project is needed because the Visitors Center \u2014 on the opposite side of the park \u2014 has reached capacity.\n\n\u201cThe equestrian center is getting used more and more,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cYou go by there on a weekend and the parking lots are packed and people are all over the place \u2014 and there\u2019s no shade and no real facilities, per se, for the people out there.\u201d\n\nThe estimated time of completion is not set, and depends on when actual construction is funded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SAN DIEGO -- A plan to build a 5,000-square-foot administration building at the Mission Trails Regional Park Equestrian Center was advanced Wednesday by the San Diego City Council's Infrastructure Committee.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FOX5 San Diego - San Diego News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | KSWB", "description": "SAN DIEGO \u2014 A plan to build a 5,000-square-foot administration building at the Mission Trails Regional Park Equestrian Center was advanced Wednesday by the San Diego City Council\u2019s Infr\u2026", "title": "Plan for admin building at Mission Trails park advances", "url": "http://fox5sandiego.com/2014/03/05/plan-for-admin-building-at-mission-trails-park-advances/", "image": "http://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/mission-trails.jpg?w=300", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/mission-trails.jpg?w=240", "site": "@fox5sandiego", "card": "summary", "creator": "@fox5sandiego"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Get the latest San Diego news, breaking news, weather, traffic, sports, entertainment and video from fox5sandiego.com.
