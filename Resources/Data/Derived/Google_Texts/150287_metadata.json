The new North Carolina Law bars people from using public restrooms that do not align with the gender on their birth certificate. Proponents of the law say it protects privacy but critics describe it as a thinly veiled attack on transgender people.\n\nUpon being asked how this new law would be enforced, a spokesman at the Raleigh Police Department said, \u201cThat\u2019s a very interesting question. We don\u2019t have police officers sitting at public bathrooms all day long.\u201d\n\nSusan Danielsen, a spokeswoman for the local police department said, \u201cWe would respond if we received a complaint. It\u2019s not like we would be standing guard at bathrooms.\u201d\n\nAt the Wilmington Police Department, spokeswoman Linda Rawley said the law struck her as strange. \u201cSo that means people have to go to the bathroom with birth certificates? Yeah, that was curious to me.\u201d\n\nAt the Asheville Police Department, spokeswoman Christina Hallingse noted, \u201cWe\u2019re not checking birth certificates. We just don\u2019t have the police power to be able to do that in bathrooms.\u201d\n\nSince the law was enacted on March 23, 2016, police departments across the state have been working to determine how they will enforce it. In addition to restricting bathroom use, it bans anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation. \u201cOur staff, particularly our attorney\u2019s office, is trying to figure out what it all means,\u201d says Damien Graham, another spokesman for the Raleigh Police Department. \u201cWe haven\u2019t mobilized our police force in any kind of different way. We\u2019re still digesting.\u201d\n\nPublic universities like Western Carolina University and the University of North Carolina are also assessing the law to determine how it will affect university policies, spokespeople from both universities said.\n\nCan police patrol public restrooms? Can they demand birth certificates, or some other form of identification, from those accused of violations? In the law, \u201cthese are all completely open questions,\u201d says Cathryn Oakley, senior legislative counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group.\n\n\u201cThe bill was passed by the state legislature in less than 10 hours and then signed by the governor that very same night with very little debate and it\u2019s incredibly poorly drafted, leading to all kinds of consequences. The lack of enforcement guidance in the legislation also suggests it\u2019s not motivated by solving a real problem,\u201d Oakley says. \u201cIf it was, they would have spent more time understanding and actually addressing a problem. Instead they passed a law that is a political statement.\u201d\n\nSome police departments were still checking with their attorneys this week to determine whether they could arrest an individual who used the wrong bathroom.\n\nBut even before police officers are called to the scene, there may be room for mishap. Without law enforcement on guard, it will likely be up to bathroom patrons to report a problem if they see someone enter the room who does not appear to belong there.\n\nOne of the many issues with this sort of law is that looks can be deceiving. Hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery allow many transgender women to look like biological women. How will an officer or bathroom patron know that the person does not belong in that particular restroom? And if a transgender woman is forced to use a male public restroom, it could present an even bigger safety issue as well as a bigger issue for officers to deal with.\n\nNorth Carolina is the first state to pass a law restricting bathroom use by transgender people, but lawmakers are considering similar bills in several other states, including South Carolina, where a Republican state senator has introduced a so-called \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d\n\nMississippi\u2019s governor also enacted a law that allows businesses to deny service to gay customers on religious objections, prompting New York Governor, Andrew M. Cuomo to ban nonessential state travel there. The backlash has been greater in North Carolina, where PayPal announced it was canceling a $3.6 million investment. More than 120 business leaders around the country have signed a letter objecting to the state\u2019s new law.\n\n\u201cIt is catastrophic to the business community and public perception of North Carolina,\u201d said state Republican Rodney Moore, a Democrat who voted against the measure. \u201cThere is absolutely no way to enforce this law, as it relates to the enforcement of the bathroom provisions. It is an utterly ridiculous law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no enforcement provisions or penalties in HB2. Its purpose is to restore common sense bathroom and shower management policy in public buildings, not to pick out people to punish,\u201d Republican Dan Bishop, a co-sponsor of the legislation wrote in a statement.\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean people won\u2019t be affected,\u201d Oakley, of The Human Rights Campaign says, \u201cSome transgender people in the state have stopped using public restrooms altogether. They\u2019re terrified, and that\u2019s enough to keep them away even if it means enduring physical discomfort. The law really puts a fine point on this concern that you are not safe in a bathroom.\u201d\n\nSource: We Asked Cops How They Plan to Enforce North Carolina\u2019s Bathroom Law\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Consuella Pachico", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "The North Carolina legislature obviously did not think about how their new Bathroom Law would be enforced.
