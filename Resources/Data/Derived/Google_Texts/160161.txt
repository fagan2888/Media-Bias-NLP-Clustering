Pope Francis asks forgiveness for priests' sexual abuse

Speaking on Vatican Radio on Friday, Pope Francis asked forgiveness from victims of Catholic priests' sexual abuse. The comments are being called the strongest condemnation yet of the Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandal. Pope Francis addressed the issue after being criticized for not dedicating enough attention to the problem, saying, "the church is aware of this damage, it is personal, moral damage carried out by men of the church, and we will not take one step backward with regards to how we will deal with this problem."
