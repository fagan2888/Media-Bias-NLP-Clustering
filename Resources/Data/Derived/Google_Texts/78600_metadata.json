The Inspector General also faulted the State Department\u2019s handling of electronic records and communications beyond Clinton\u2019s tenure.\u201cLongstanding, systemic weaknesses related to electronic records and communications have existed within the Office of the Secretary that go well beyond the tenure of any one Secretary of State,\u201d the report, which was delivered to Congress Wednesday, said.Clinton used private e-mail to send or receive about 60,000 messages from 2009 to 2013. She and her aides said about half were work-related and turned over to the State Department. They have said the rest, which they deemed personal, were destroyed. Clinton added that she used the system as a matter of convenience, but said that in hindsight she should have used a government system.The Inspector General\u2019s report adds to Clinton\u2019s political woes as she\u2019s trying to wrap up the Democratic presidential nomination and campaign against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who\u2019s used the e-mail controversy as part of his line of attack. Clinton faces a separate FBI investigation and a conservative watchdog group has sued for access to her messages.As these events take her campaign off-course, Trump could surge ahead in polls, which would dramatically affect the country\u2019s health insurance landscape. Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a legislative action that has already been achieved with the current Congress \u2013 and replace it with a national market in which insurers may sell across state lines.Clinton, meanwhile, has been supportive of the program and says she will advocate a $250 per month cap on out-of-pocket drug expenses \u2013 a provision that would have to be offered by health insurers.She has also criticized major health insurance mergers, such as those between Anthem and Cigna, and Humana and Aetna.The two blockbuster deals comprise nearly $100 billion and could potentially undermine competition in the health insurance space \u2013 and thus go against one of the major tenets of the Affordable Care Act, Clinton has maintained.With a more competitive election between Clinton and Trump, the eventual fate of the healthcare legislation remains in the balance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/obamacare-at-risk-as-state-department-audit-finds-clinton-email-use-violated-rules-32433.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_obamacare_000050812562_Small.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "A huge blow for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign could derail her promises to beef up the country\u2019s national health insurance program", "title": "Obamacare at risk as State Department audit finds Clinton e-mail use violated rules"}, "twitter": {"description": "A huge blow for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign could derail her promises to beef up the country\u2019s national health insurance program", "title": "Obamacare at risk as State Department audit finds Clinton e-mail us ...", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/obamacare-at-risk-as-state-department-audit-finds-clinton-email-use-violated-rules-32433.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_obamacare_000050812562_Small.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A huge blow for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign could derail her promises to beef up the country\u2019s national health insurance program"}, "article_summary": "She and her aides said about half were work-related and turned over to the State Department.\nClinton faces a separate FBI investigation and a conservative watchdog group has sued for access to her messages.As these events take her campaign off-course, Trump could surge ahead in polls, which would dramatically affect the country\u2019s health insurance landscape.\nThey have said the rest, which they deemed personal, were destroyed.\nby Billy House and Laura Litvan, Bloomberg with Insurance Business AmericaA huge blow for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton could derail her promises to beef up the country\u2019s national health insurance program.A State Department audit found Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail system while she was secretary of state violated State Department rules, according to the agency\u2019s Inspector General.The audit by the State Department\u2019s independent investigator found no evidence that she requested guidance or approval to conduct official business via personal e-mail on a private server -- and concluded the agency likely wouldn\u2019t have granted the request.\nThe Inspector General also faulted the State Department\u2019s handling of electronic records and communications beyond Clinton\u2019s tenure.\u201cLongstanding, systemic weaknesses related to electronic records and communications have existed within the Office of the Secretary that go well beyond the tenure of any one Secretary of State,\u201d the report, which was delivered to Congress Wednesday, said.Clinton used private e-mail to send or receive about 60,000 messages from 2009 to 2013."}
