A Long Beach, Calif., man held a one-person protest this week, saying he was denied health care even though he signed up for health insurance through Covered CA, the state’s Obamacare insurance exchange.

Ponzlov said he bought a plan, but was not in system when he went to see a cardiologist today. Says he needs surgery in about a month. — Andrew Edwards (@AndrewEdwardsCA) January 4, 2014

Ponzlov said he's not opposed to the Affordable Care Act in principle, but is very disappointed in its execution. — Andrew Edwards (@AndrewEdwardsCA) January 4, 2014

He’s not alone there.

Ponzlov: "I'm not a glitch, I'm a human being." — Andrew Edwards (@AndrewEdwardsCA) January 4, 2014
