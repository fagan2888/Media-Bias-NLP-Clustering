Bloomberg News\n\nAngela Ahrendts, the high-profile boss of Burberry, has just left the FTSE 100\u2032s most exclusive club.\n\nThe announcement early this morning that she\u2019s leaving the fashion house and heading to Apple, where she\u2019ll head the retail and online stores business, leaves the U.K.\u2019s index of leading companies with just two women in the top executive role.\n\nThat looks like something of a backward step.\n\nIn 2012, the index of top U.K. companies boasted five female chief executives, but the exits of FTSE darling Marjorie Scardino from Pearson and Cynthia Carroll from Anglo American that year left just three. Now it\u2019s two: Imperial Tobacco boss Alison Cooper and EasyJet\u2019s Carolyn McCall. A boost will likely come in December when Royal Mail, whose chief executive is Moya Greene, is eligible to be included in the index.\n\nIt\u2019s two-and-a-half years since Evan Mervyn Davies, a life peer in the U.K., pushed for more women at the top of FTSE companies and called for 25% of board to comprise female members by 2015. His focus was at board level, where he suggested that female representation be increased. \u201cWomen are successful at university and in their early careers, but attrition rates increase as they progress through an organisation. When women are so under-represented on corporate boards, companies are missing out, as they are unable to draw from the widest possible range of talent.\u201d\n\nVince Cable, the business secretary, said earlier this month that 19% of the FTSE 100\u2019s board directors are now female, up almost two percentage points from May this year, and a huge rise from 12.5% in 2011. But the breakdown between executive and non-executive directors was telling: 23.8% of non-executive directors were female, up from 15.6% in February 20122, and 6.1% of executive directors were women, up from 5.5% in 2011. It means that despite a huge focus on parachuting women into top board positions, only marginal improvements are being made in ensuring women are appointed to top executive roles.\n\nRecruitment firm Robert Hall found in May that the average FTSE 100 CEO is a 53 year old male accountant.\n\nPerhaps Ms. Ahrendts herself offers clues to the disparity.\n\nIn an interview last year, Ms. Ahrendts, who has three teenage children, talked about the balance of managing a tough work schedule with family life. She limits working outside normal hours to one day a week, and ensures she\u2019s home by Friday nights from business trips. But in other telling details, she admitted that her working day starts at 4.35 a.m, admitted that women can\u2019t do it all, and said \u201cbalance is a really big word for me\u201d.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t just one that exists at chief executive level. Earlier this month, Martin Gilbert, chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, said he didn\u2019t understand why there were not more female chief financial officers in the FTSE 100 \u201cgiven the 50% intake into chartered accountant training courses.\u201d\n\nHelena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment and founder of the 30% Club, which aims for board to comprise one third women, told sister title Financial News earlier this month: \u201cThe work that the 30% Club is doing is very much focused on the executive director as well as non-executive director [positions]. In discussions of what has not yet been achieved, we cannot just wave a magic wand. We do have to be patient before we see gender balance.\u201d\n\nWhile her daily schedule might give clues to the tricky balancing act, her career record gives insight into why that gender balance is worth being patient for. In a wide-ranging profile of Ahrendts with WSJ magazine in 2010, Paul Charron, a senior adviser at Warburg Pincus who was chairman and CEO of Liz Claiborne when Ahrendts was hired as a top merchandising executive there in 1998, said: \u201cPeople want to work for her because she\u2019s completely unadorned and she has a life.\u201d\n\nLinda Wachner, the tough, unsentimental CEO who ran Warnaco when Ahrendts worked there in the \u201980s, echoed the sentiment: \u201cShe was one of the few people who knew not to take things personally. She never flinched, never whined, never shirked. She was a class act, and I can\u2019t say that about too many people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Angela Ahrendts, the high-profile boss of Burberry, has just left the FTSE 100's most exclusive club.", "title": "FTSE 100 Takes Fresh Step Back as Ahrendts Heads for Apple", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/10/15/ftse-100-takes-fresh-step-back-as-ahrendts-heads-for-apple/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZH270_1015bu_G_20131015054658.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "FTSE 100 Takes Fresh Step Back as Ahrendts Heads for Apple", "description": "Angela Ahrendts, the high-profile boss of Burberry, has just left the FTSE 100's most exclusive club.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Phillipa Leighton-Jones", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Angela Ahrendts, the high-profile boss of Burberry, has just left the FTSE 100's most exclusive club.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-15T09:53:15-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/10/15/ftse-100-takes-fresh-step-back-as-ahrendts-heads-for-apple/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-9968", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Angela Ahrendts, the high-profile boss of Burberry, has just left the FTSE 100's most exclusive club.", "title": "FTSE 100 Takes Fresh Step Back as Ahrendts Heads for Apple", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/10/15/ftse-100-takes-fresh-step-back-as-ahrendts-heads-for-apple/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZH270_1015bu_G_20131015054658.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-9968", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-15T11:17:19-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca198\"", "article_summary": "A boost will likely come in December when Royal Mail, whose chief executive is Moya Greene, is eligible to be included in the index.\nAngela Ahrendts, chief executive officer of Burberry Group Plc, speaks as she holds an Apple Inc. iPad at the 2011 World Business Forum in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2011.\nThe issue isn\u2019t just one that exists at chief executive level.\nBloomberg NewsAngela Ahrendts, the high-profile boss of Burberry, has just left the FTSE 100\u2032s most exclusive club.\nRecruitment firm Robert Hall found in May that the average FTSE 100 CEO is a 53 year old male accountant."}
