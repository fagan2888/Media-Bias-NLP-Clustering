Courts throughout the country are consistently finding that dancers need to be paid for the work they do and appropriately classified as employees,\u201d said Mari Newman, a lawyer handling the case for the Grand Junction dancers.\n\nThe ruling came Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit brought by current and former dancers at Rick\u2019s Cabaret in midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe lawsuit charged that the strippers were denied wages and required to pay a variety of fees to the club.\n\nThe lawsuit mirrors one now in U.S. District Court in Denver filed by dancers at Fantasy Gentlemen\u2019s Club in Grand Junction.\n\nA decision in favor of dancers outside Colorado would have little impact on the Grand Junction suit, though judges handling similar cases could weigh a ruling as they consider a case, said Karen Steinhauser, a former prosecutor who is now in private practice and teaches at the University of Denver.\n\nShe is not involved in the Grand Junction case.\n\nThe owner of the Fantasy, Kevin Eardley, said he knows of similar rulings in favor of dancers in other states.\n\n\u201cThey seem to be coming up all the time. If we need to restructure we can put them on as employees. That can be done and we can make our money back in other ways,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nEardley has not yet hired a lawyer to handle the case, filed on July 30.\n\nThe dancers at Fantasy Gentlemen\u2019s Club aren\u2019t paid anything by the club. Instead, they must pay to work there, according to the suit filed by four of the club dancers, Jessica Mason, Michelle Cross, Allison Stebbing and Jamie Tencza.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Strippers win NY suit similar to one against Grand Junction club", "title": "Strippers win NY suit similar to one against Grand Junction club", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/11/strippers-win-ny-suit-similar-to-one-against-grand-junction-club/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T11:31:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-11T11:31:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The lawsuit mirrors one now in U.S. District Court in Denver filed by dancers at Fantasy Gentlemen\u2019s Club in Grand Junction.\nInstead, they must pay to work there, according to the suit filed by four of the club dancers, Jessica Mason, Michelle Cross, Allison Stebbing and Jamie Tencza.\nShe is not involved in the Grand Junction case.\nCourts throughout the country are consistently finding that dancers need to be paid for the work they do and appropriately classified as employees,\u201d said Mari Newman, a lawyer handling the case for the Grand Junction dancers.\nThe dancers at Fantasy Gentlemen\u2019s Club aren\u2019t paid anything by the club."}
