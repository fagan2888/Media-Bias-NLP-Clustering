And how you feel about that may tell you everything you need to know about your politics.\n\nHere\u2019s the history: After fighting unsuccessfully to get a bank charter last decade, the biggest of big-box stores pivoted to a backdoor strategy, using partnerships with prepaid card issuers to offer bank-like services piecemeal.\n\nNow, one such deal, with Green Dot, has enabled Walmart to offer its often low-income and downwardly-mobile customers a basic checking account, outfoxing the big banks that have tried but failed to figure out how to profitably enter that market.\n\nRest assured, it\u2019s a gigantic one\u2014around 10 million \u201cunbanked\u201d Americans and growing. Not only does Walmart think it\u2019s sitting on a gold mine. It needs that added cash. After food stamp usage hit record-breaking numbers in 2013, Congress tried to pare back the benefit. Although a regulatory loophole allowed all but a few states to evade tighter eligibility requirements, the moves still hurt Walmart\u2019s bottom line.\n\nGet the picture? Walmart, a gigantic corporation with powerful lobbying interests, needs Americans on food stamps to spend their public assistance money in their stores. To lock them in as customers\u2014and draw in more Americans who rely on government aid\u2014Walmart wants to be their bank, too.\n\nThe political implications are clear\u2014but the battle lines about to form are likely to defy party lines.\n\nFor traditional pro-business Republicans, this one\u2019s a slam dunk. By \u201coffering a service no one else has deigned to,\u201d as the right-leaning commentator Walter Russell Mead put it, Walmart is proving itself to be \u201ca force for good,\u201d not the \u201cvery image of the evils of corporate America\u201d that its enemies like to present.\n\nPro-bank conservatives face a predictable foe in the anti-corporate left. At The Wall Street Journal, James Taranto ridicules The Huffington Post for raising alarms about Walmart\u2019s motives, despite the \u201cgreat free-market success\u201d that\u2019s underway.\n\nFor pro-corporate Democrats, however, Walmart\u2019s new business model fits right in with the Obama and Clinton agenda, wherein government benefits and subsidies expand at the bottom and the top of the economic pyramid. For a New Democrat, financial services profiting from people on social services is the ultimate in public-private partnerships.\n\nAs the master idea behind Obamacare has it, America\u2019s least fortunate can only be saved from injustice by the combined efforts of big business and big government.\n\nThe anti-corruption wing of the party, represented by insurgent leftists like Zephyr Teachout, knows there\u2019s something more than fishy about this arrangement. Tea Party conservatives, meanwhile, have been busily drawing the same conclusions.\n\nUnlike the coastal populists of the old-school left, of course, heartland populists on the right see themselves reflected in Walmart\u2019s customer base. But even more so, they identify themselves with the customers and proprietors of the small-town small businesses Walmart\u2019s inexorable growth destroys.\n\nWalmart\u2019s expansion into banking makes the company more of a villain in this regard, not less. If there\u2019s one financial institution a Tea Partier loves, it\u2019s the independent local bank, with its strong balance sheet, modest reach, and its willingness to conduct business on the basis of personal trust, not Human Resources policies and corporate compliance.\n\nIn short, the new, informal Bank of Walmart augurs an unprecedented concentration and commingling of corporate, financial, and regulatory affairs. And it does so by pulling the whole banking system toward making a permanent revenue stream out of America\u2019s dependent class.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Walmart, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201410010945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The giant retailer is realizing its dream of getting into the banking business, which should terrify populists of all stripes.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The People Vs. the Bank of Walmart", "tags": "entity:company/walmart,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The People Vs. the Bank of Walmart\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/01/the-people-vs-the-bank-of-walmart.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/01/the-people-vs-the-bank-of-walmart/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47071890.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/01/the-people-vs-the-bank-of-walmart\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-01T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"James Poulos\",\"tags\":[\"walmart\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Walmart, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "James Poulos", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-01T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/james-pouloshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/01/the-people-vs-the-bank-of-walmart", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The giant retailer is realizing its dream of getting into the banking business, which should terrify populists of all stripes.", "title": "The People Vs. the Bank of Walmart", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/01/the-people-vs-the-bank-of-walmart.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/01/the-people-vs-the-bank-of-walmart/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1412156714934.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/james-poulos", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "In short, the new, informal Bank of Walmart augurs an unprecedented concentration and commingling of corporate, financial, and regulatory affairs.\nFor a New Democrat, financial services profiting from people on social services is the ultimate in public-private partnerships.\nWalmart is finally getting into the financial services industry.\nAs the master idea behind Obamacare has it, America\u2019s least fortunate can only be saved from injustice by the combined efforts of big business and big government.\nTo lock them in as customers\u2014and draw in more Americans who rely on government aid\u2014Walmart wants to be their bank, too."}
