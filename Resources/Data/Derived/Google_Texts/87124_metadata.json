Sources told Reuters that the address belongs to Lyft\u2019s chief technology officer, Chris Lambert.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUber disclosed the breach in February and filed suit in San Francisco in an effort to uncover the hacker. A U.S. magistrate judge has approved a subpoena of Comcast records sought by Uber, saying that such a request was \u201creasonably likely\u201d to identify the \u201cbad actor\u201d behind the breach.\n\nA Lyft spokesman said Monday that the company had investigated the matter internally and found that \u201cthere is no evidence that any Lyft employee, including [Lambert], downloaded the Uber driver information or database, or had anything to do with Uber\u2019s May 2014 data breach.\"\n\nAccording to court documents, Uber found that someone had used a digital security key that the company had inadvertently published on a public development page to download the company\u2019s driver database.\n\nUber combed through the IP addresses of every visitor to the page during the time the key was posted and determined that \"the Comcast IP address is the only IP address that accessed the \u2026 post that Uber has not eliminated\" from suspicion.\n\nThe company has declined to say what led them to believe the Comcast address will lead them to the identity of the hacker.\n\nSources told Reuters that the company researched the address and found that it appeared in other Internet postings associated with Lambert and that the address is assigned to his name.\n\nComcast has appealed the subpoena, which would command it to turn over the unnamed subscriber\u2019s identity, payment information and information connecting the subscriber to the development page where the key was posted.\n\nLawyers for the subscriber have insisted that because the key was posted publicly, just visiting the page was not an indication of guilt.\n\nThey also stress that the hack originated from an entirely different IP address.\n\nLyft also noted that Uber itself posted the security code used in the breach.\n\n\"Uber allowed login credentials for their driver database to be publicly accessible for months before and after the breach,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nLyft and Uber compete fiercely for both drivers and customers. Lyft is valued at $2.5 billion, compared to Uber\u2019s $51 billion valuation.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lyft and Uber compete fiercely for both drivers and customers.", "description": "Lyft and Uber compete fiercely for both drivers and customers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lyft and Uber compete fiercely for both drivers and customers.", "title": "Uber investigates Lyft exec in database hack", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/256343-uber-investigates-lyft-exec-in-database-hack", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/uber_082015gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/256343-uber-investigates-lyft-exec-in-database-hack", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-08T10:34-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Katie Bo Williams", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-08T10:34:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/256343-uber-investigates-lyft-exec-in-database-hack", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lyft and Uber compete fiercely for both drivers and customers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Uber investigates Lyft exec in database hack"}, "dcterms.title": "Uber investigates Lyft exec in database hack"}, "article_summary": "They also stress that the hack originated from an entirely different IP address.\nUber is investigating whether there is a connection between the hacker behind a major data breach at the driving service and Lyft, Uber\u2019s chief rival, Reuters reports.\nCourt papers claim an unidentified person using a Comcast IP address used a security key to improperly download 50,000 drivers\u2019 names and license numbers in 2014.\nLyft and Uber compete fiercely for both drivers and customers.\nThe company has declined to say what led them to believe the Comcast address will lead them to the identity of the hacker."}
