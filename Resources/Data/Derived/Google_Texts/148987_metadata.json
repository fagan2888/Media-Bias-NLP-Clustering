It isn\u2019t even the fact that they use robots to help bring together all the pieces that make up an iPhone. It\u2019s that their robots are now performing more and more human-like functions.\n\nIn the past, it\u2019s always been people that put the finishing touches on the popular devices. Well, that\u2019s all about to change.\n\nFoxconn parent company Hon Hai is set to deploy an army of 10,000 assembly-line robots to help meet the demands of producing the highly anticipated iPhone 6. Hon Hai CEO Terry Gou revealed in a recent shareholder meeting that Apple would be the very first customer of Foxconn\u2019s latest robots.\n\nRelated: Millennials vs. Robots\u2014Who Will Win the Jobs?\n\n\u201cRobots are going to enhance and speed up the manufacturing process,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, CEO of market research firm Creative Strategies. \u201cThe really big issue here is that the demand for the iPhone continues to grow. It\u2019s grown every quarter since it came out.\u201d\n\nFrom a business standpoint, it makes sense. \u201cWhen you are dealing with creating millions of smart phones per month, efficiency is critical,\u201d said Bajarin in an interview. \u201cRobotics gives you that level of efficiency, which in the end, is very important for the bottom line.\u201d\n\nThroughout its various factories in China, Foxconn employs more than 1.2 million workers. They have reportedly hired an additional 100,000 workers in China\u2014yes, human ones, to work alongside the robots.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if sometime in the next five years, robots will even take care of the final touches,\u201d said Bajarin.\n\nRelated: Robots Take Caregiving to a Whole New Level\n\nSome analysts see this trend toward robotics transforming labor markets globally. Marshall Brain, founder of How Stuff Works and author of Robotic Nation, says the push towards automation is happening much faster than people realize. \u201cWithin a couple of decades,\u201d said Brain in an interview, \u201cthere won\u2019t be a single job that robots can\u2019t do better than humans.\u201d\n\nBut phasing out human labor altogether is easier said than done. Foxconn\u2019s original commitment to implement 1 million robots by 2014 has hit its fair share of roadblocks. By 2011, the company had reportedly rolled out 10,000 robots to work in their Jincheng, Shanxi Province factory, but several production line workers complained that the machines were incapable of doing the most basic human tasks.\n\nKnown as \u201cFoxbots,\u201d the machines were part of a larger effort to help offset increasing labor costs. Hon Hai\u2019s 2013 financial report stated, in part, \"To remain cost competitive, we have been continuously controlling manufacturing overhead to attain better operating leverage and improving efficiency and yield rate through automation using robot arms and industrial engineering methods like production cell management.\"\n\nThe shift to automation will undoubtedly lead to substantial productivity gains for companies, but as that happens, jobs will be increasingly at risk.\n\nRelated: The Rise of Robots and the Decline of Jobs is Here\n\n\u201cWe have been dealing with robots on manufacturing lines for almost 50 years, said Bajarin. \u201cThe fact that they are getting faster, smarter, and able to do more intricate tasks is a concern in the sense\u2014as it was 50 years ago\u2014that it impacts job creation.\u201d\n\nLarry Summers, former U.S. Treasury secretary during the Clinton Administration and former head of Obama\u2019s National Economic Council, predicts technology will have a profound effect on the average employee. \u201cWe are seeing less and less opportunity for what average people\u2014people lacking in certain skills\u2014are going to be able to do,\u201d said Summers in May at the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that innovation always makes more employment\u2026There is nothing in the logic of the market or human experience to suggest that it must necessarily be so that there will be jobs for all at acceptable wages, no matter how technology evolves.\u201d\n\nJob-killing technology is hardly new. From 2000 to 2010, over a million secretary jobs were eliminated from the U.S. labor market as answering machines and computers replaced them at lower costs. But robots could put the trend into overdrive. Now, people may not have to worry about their job going to someone overseas, but to something right down the street.\n\nSLIDESHOW: Cooks, Waiters and Busboys\u20147 Robots in the Workplace\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a big process of automating all of the warehouses in the United States. It used to be you had people running around picking stuff out of warehouses and putting them in warehouses,\u201d said Brain in an interview. \u201cThat whole process is going to be pretty much completely automated within the next couple of years. No one really pays attention to it because warehouses aren\u2019t in places we normally go. But that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nProducing some of Apple\u2019s products is already an almost completely automated system. In 2013, the company began producing its Mac Pro at the Flextronics Americas factory in Northwest Austin. They may get to engrave \u201cMade in USA\u201d on their products, but some argue it does more harm than good. \u201cIt\u2019s located in Texas, which makes everybody feel good,\u201d said Brain, \u201cbut it\u2019s not providing any jobs.\u201d\n\nIt makes geography, and the debate about outsourcing jobs, almost entirely insignificant. \u201cIf robots are taking more and more of the manufacturing jobs,\u201d said Bajarin, \u201cit actually doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s here or in Asia.\u201d\n\nBrain predicts the trend is heading in this direction globally\u2014and beyond low-skill factory work.\n\nRelated: The Robot Revolution Rips Up Our Social Contract\n\nIndeed, Foxconn isn\u2019t just in the business of putting labels on chicken soup cans. They recently manufactured a robot in Japan that might serve as more of a companion at home than as a coworker on the assembly line. Designed by French robotics company Aldebaran, it\u2019s a semi-humanoid robot named \u201cPepper,\u201d who is reportedly equipped with some social skills, too. In a twist worthy of the movie \u201cShe,\u201d where a man falls in love with a computer generated \u201cfriend,\u201d Pepper has an \u201cemotion engine\u201d that can reportedly understand human emotion, interpret it, and react accordingly.\n\nJapanese telecom giant SoftBank commissioned the construction of Pepper, and plans to sell what they refer to as \u201cthe newest member of the SoftBank crew\u201d in Japan next February. The price tag for your newest 1.2 meter tall little friend? Just under $2,000.\n\nSoftBank was built on the philosophy of \u2018Information Revolution \u2013 Happiness for everyone.\u2019 \u201cTo realize our vision,\u201d said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son in a statement, \u201cWe have made a new entry into the robot business with the aim of developing affectionate robots that make people smile.\u201d\n\nOf course, many doubt workers will be smiling when those robots take their jobs.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Foxconn parent company Hon Hai is set to deploy 10,000 assembly-line robots to help meet the demands of producing the iPhone 6, which is expected to be released in September.", "title": "Introducing the iPhone 6, Made in China by a Robot", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/09/Introducing-iPhone-6-Made-China-Robot", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01142013_robots_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/09/Introducing-iPhone-6-Made-China-Robot", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01142013_robots_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Foxconn parent company Hon Hai is set to deploy 10,000 assembly-line robots to help meet the demands of producing the iPhone 6, which is expected to be released in September.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It isn\u2019t even the fact that they use robots to help bring together all the pieces that make up an iPhone.\nDesigned by French robotics company Aldebaran, it\u2019s a semi-humanoid robot named \u201cPepper,\u201d who is reportedly equipped with some social skills, too.\n\u201cRobots are going to enhance and speed up the manufacturing process,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, CEO of market research firm Creative Strategies.\nRelated: The Robot Revolution Rips Up Our Social ContractIndeed, Foxconn isn\u2019t just in the business of putting labels on chicken soup cans.\nFoxconn parent company Hon Hai is set to deploy an army of 10,000 assembly-line robots to help meet the demands of producing the highly anticipated iPhone 6."}
