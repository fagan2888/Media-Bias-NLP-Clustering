(Starting at the 8:20 mark.)\n\nBut the OLA report issued last week seems to have a narrower scope than Nobles said would be the case when he testified before the Legislative Audit Commission.\n\n\u201cIn Spring 2014, the Legislative Audit Commission directed the Office of the Legislative Auditor to evaluate MNsure. . . . Our report focuses mainly on MNsure\u2019s first year of enrollment, and we recommend changes in the governance of both the agency and its enrollment system,\u201d the cover letter stated. (emphasis added).\n\nHowever, the OLA\u2019s Joel Alter, a program evaluator and project manager for the report, disputes Breitbart News\u2019s characterization that the scope of the final report was narrowed substantively.\n\n\u201cOur report focused on the period through the first year of enrollment, not just the first year of enrollment,\u201d OLA\u2019s Alter told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cChapter 2 is largely devoted to the development of the exchange, including things like the period when MNobtained federal grants, conducted planning, entered into contracts to build the exchange, and sought statutory authority for the exchange. Chapter 6 also discusses pre-launch preparations (e.g., for the call center). We didn\u2019t narrow the period we examined; we only excluded the second enrollment period, as we always intended,\u201d Alter said.\n\nNobles also told the commission in April he intended to obtain Todd-Malmlov\u2019s testimony: (Starting at the 9:45 mark.)\n\nThe Legislative Oversight Committee for MNsure is meeting [this morning] \u2026 they\u2019ve asked me to be there as soon as I can get there because, as I think you know from an account in the Star-Tribune they requested the presence of certain people, namely the former executive director [April Todd-Malmlov] and the Commissioner of Human Services and it\u2019s my understanding that neither of those people will appear. We have methods of obtaining testimony from people. In fact I have already obtained considerable testimony from the Commissioner of Human Services and do intend to obtain testimony from the former executive director which I understand the Oversight Committee is having difficulty obtaining.\n\nBut Nobles did not secure Todd-Malmlov\u2019s testimony. It was a remarkable omission since Todd-Malmlov, who resigned under fire in December 2013, remained a resident of Minnesota for more than four months from April 2014 to September 2014, when she moved to the Washington, D.C. area for a new job. The OLA says it wanted to interview her, but it did not use its full array of legal tools to secure her testimony.\n\n\u201cWhen Ms. Todd-Malmlov failed to comply with our subpoena, we did not pursue other legal actions to compel her testimony,\u201d Alter told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cWe sought her testimony partly as a matter of fairness\u2014to hear her perspective on MNsure\u2019s development and the problems that arose. We interviewed numerous others about these issues. We would have preferred having testimony from Ms. Todd-Malmlov, given her central role in MNsure\u2019s early history, but our evaluation report did not hinge on a single person\u2019s testimony,\u201d Alter added.\n\nWhen pressed on why the OLA did not push harder, Alter cited the desire to avoid a \u201cprotracted legal battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe decided that if she did not wish to comply with our subpoena, we did not wish to engage in a protracted legal battle,\u201d Alter told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cMs. Todd-Malmlov,\u201d he added, \u201cwas no longer a state employee and Minnesota resident at the time we issued our subpoena, so there were some questions about whether the subpoena could be legally enforced.\u201d\n\nAs for Gruber, the OLA has acknowledged that his projections played a \u201ckey part\u201d in the Minnesota State Legislature\u2019s passage of the law authorizing the establishment of MNsure.\n\n\u201cIn early 2013, the Gruber-Gorman enrollment projections played a key part in \u2018fiscal notes\u2019 developed for legislation to establish Minnesota\u2019s exchange,\u201d OLA \u2018s Alter told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cFiscal notes,\u201d Alter explained, \u201crepresent an executive branch agency\u2019s estimate of the likely expenditure and revenue impact of proposed legislation; exchange staff prepared the fiscal notes. Later in 2013, MNsure developed revised its enrollment projections, partly using the Gruber-Gorman estimates.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s projections played a similar role in the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), though in a less direct way.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office used an economic modeling tool largely based on the proprietary Gruber Microsimulation Model in preparing its cost estimates for Congress. Critics say that Gruber\u2019s 2009 contract with the Department of Health and Human Services was apparently for the purpose of helping the Obama administration to write the bill in such a way so as to trick the Congressional Budget Office to give it a positive economic modeling review.\n\nThe OLA\u2019s Alter told Breitbart News it is too early to discard Gruber\u2019s projections.\n\n\u201c[T]he report says that because the projections were for 2016, it is \u2018premature to fully assess their accuracy.\u2019 We discuss how the most recent data (from 2014) compare with the 2016 projections, but we did not think it was appropriate to draw conclusions yet about the accuracy of these projections,\u201d Alter said.\n\nBut State Representative Davids is not buying that argument. As he wrote to Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson in November:\n\nAs you may know, the State engaged Dr. Gruber through a single source contract to provide modeling and analysis for the development of the State insurance exchange (a/k/a MNsure). The contract and subsequent amendment specify that Dr. Gruber was to deliver an updated final report to the State by October 30, 2012. . . The updated final report, written with Bela Gorman, provided the State with enrollment projections and other analysis of the exchange through 2016. These projections were used to justify assertions that the exchange would be financially stable and self-sufficient. Recently, in the face of lower-than-expected commercial enrollment, MNsure informed the public that it has abandoned Dr. Gruber\u2019s projections.\n\nBreitbart News has obtained a copy of Dr. Gruber\u2019s contract with the state of Minnesota as well as the invoices he submitted to receive payment on that contract. His original contract, in the amount of $229,000, was amended by adding an additional $100,000 for his services. All told, Gruber received $329,000 for his work, which resulted in two \u201cGruber-Gorman\u201d reports: the first completed in April 2012, and the second completed in February 2013.\n\n(Note: Gruber\u2019s contract was paid by a $1 million grant Minnesota obtained from the federal government in early 2011. The Department of Health and Human Services eventually issued similar $1 million grants to each of 49 states, including Minnesota, citing the 2010 Affordable Care Act as the authorizing legislation.)\n\nBreitbart News provided an expert in state contracting procedures with copies of both documents.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the Minnesota contract and Jonathan Gruber\u2019s bills, I find that both Minnesota and Gruber were lax in their conduct and responsibilities,\u201d the expert told Breitbart News after examining those documents.\n\n\u201cGruber did not present \u2018itemized bills\u2019 as required by the contract, and Minnesota accepted his invoices that did not conform to their contractual requirements,\u201d the state contracting expert said.\n\n\u201cGruber\u2019s invoices were missing itemized deliverables, dates of work actually performed, whether he used subcontractors, which work he or the subs performed, hours worked, hours billed, and verification of work actually performed,\u201d the state contracting expert added.\n\n\u201cEssentially,\u201d the expert noted, \u201cGruber just says, \u2018Here, I did this \u2013 send me a bunch of cash.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added.)\n\n\u201cMost notably,\u201d the expert concluded, \u201chis third invoice has no correlation at all to the contractual Deliverable C that he is being paid for.\u201d\n\nThe expert also stated that \u201cGruber\u2019s invoices were not authentically signed; all signatures were identical. It appears that Gruber used a rubber stamp.\u201d\n\nBut this was not a line of inquiry the OLA chose to follow.\n\n\u201cFor our February 2015 evaluation report, we did not examine the former MNsure executive director\u2019s [April Todd-Malmlov] review of invoices submitted by Dr. Gruber,\u201d Alter told Breitbart News. \u201cIssues regarding contract compliance and billing are typically examined in our office\u2019s financial audits, not its evaluations,\u201d Alter added.\n\n\u201cOur office\u2019s financial audit staff have, in fact, reviewed the Gruber expenditures. In their judgment, the invoices aligned with the deliverables required by the Gruber contract,\u201d Alter said. Yet, the OLA did not speak to Gruber. \u201cWe did not attempt to interview Dr. Gruber,\u201d Alter told Breitbart News.\n\nSince the disastrous launch of MNsure, Todd-Malmlov has taken a job as senior vice president at Avalere Health, which is located in Washington, D.C. Presumably, she is currently a resident of either Maryland, Virginia, or the District of Columbia.\n\nAccording to press reports, controversy surrounding a two week vacation Todd-Malmlov took to Costa Rica in December 2013 with James Golden \u2014 then the State Medicare Director at the Minnesota Department of Human Services \u2014 played a role in her decision to resign as executive director of MNsure that month. In their professional capacity, Todd-Malmlov and Golden frequently interacted during the lead up to and launch of MNsure.\n\nAs the Minneapolis Star Tribune first reported in December 2013:\n\nThe outrage over Todd-Malmlov intensified following revelations that she and state Medicaid director James Golden took a nearly two-week tropical vacation late last month, even as the program was swamped with problems. According to Star Tribune records, the two live together and have worked closely on the implementation of the new exchange.\n\nIn September, 2014\u2014the same time Todd-Malmlov joined Avalere Health\u2014Golden resigned from his job in Minnesota, and was named director of the Division of Managed Care Plans for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a key division of the federal government\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services. According to Linked-In, this division is located in the Baltimore, Maryland area.\n\nThe OLA report noted that when it tried to hear her testimony, the \u201cconditions\u201d Todd-Malmlov\u2019s politically connected Minneapolis attorney, Marshall Tanick, imposed \u201cfor an interview with the former director were not acceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrimarily,\u201d the report explained, \u201cher attorney said the former director would only cooperate if the Office of the Legislative Auditor paid all expenses she incurred by cooperating, including her attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d\n\nA search of Federal Election Commission records shows that Tanick was a generous contributor to Democratic Sen. Mark Dayton in 2003. Dayton is now governor of Minnesota. Tanick also contributed to the presidential campaigns of John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nTodd-Malmlov became MNsure\u2019s first executive director shortly after the enabling legislation was signed into law by Governor Dayton in March 2013.\n\nTodd-Malmlov had served, since February 2011, as the exchange director for the \u201cunder development but not-yet legislatively authorized or named\u201d state health exchange, operating first as an employee of the Department of Commerce, and subsequently under the direction of the Commissioner for Management and Budget since February 2011.\n\nThe MNsure Board \u201cassumed its statutory authorities and responsibilities\u201d on August 21, 2013, according to the OLA report. It was at that time that Todd-Malmlov began reporting exclusively to the MNsure Board, and no longer to the Commissioner of Management and Budget.\n\nThe MNsure Board apparently never formally reviewed Todd-Malmlov\u2019s qualifications to serve in the executive director\u2019s position. Neither did it explore whether Todd-Malmlov, whose entire career to that point was as a health care economist, had the proper skills and experience to supervise the launch of a highly technical website.\n\nFor her part, Todd-Malmlov never explained to the OLA the level of managerial oversight the MNsure Board exercised over her as executive director because she steadfastly avoided interaction with the OLA investigative team from the beginning of its evaluation.\n\n\u201cIn the early months of the evaluation, we didn\u2019t know Ms. Todd-Malmlov\u2019s status\u2013whether she had taken a post-MNsure job, and whether she was still in MN,\u201d the OLA\u2019s Alter told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Alter continued, \u201cat one point before we issued the subpoena, we tried to find a current address for her and the address we found was outside of Minnesota. (This was prior to her DC job.) So, I don\u2019t know exactly where Ms. Todd-Malmlov lived in the months prior to taking the DC job.\u201d\n\nBut as the December 2013 article in the Star Tribune confirmed, it was public knowledge at the time that Ms. Todd-Malmlov was living with Minnesota\u2019s Medicaid Director James Golden, a state employee. The OLA apparently did not consider asking Golden where Todd-Malmlov might be found.\n\n\u201cWe did not serve a subpoena until Ms. Todd-Malmlov had taken her DC job,\u201d Alter told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cA subpoena is a last resort, and we made other efforts to seek her cooperation before sending her a subpoena. We didn\u2019t know she would take a job out-of-state, and we intended to interview her after we had a more complete understanding of the exchange\u2019s development and history,\u201d Alter added.\n\n\u201cWhen we learned that Ms. Todd-Malmlov had taken the Avalere job, we knew where to reach her\u2013which, as I indicated above\u2013we did not know for sure during Summer 2014. By the time she took the Avalere job, we felt we knew the exchange\u2019s history well enough to ask the right questions\u2013so we sent the subpoena and specified a date and time for a phone conversation,\u201d Alter said.\n\nIt is clear, however, that subsequent to sending Todd-Malmlov the subpoena, the OLA did not put on a full court press to compel her to comply with it and provide what would certainly have been critical testimony about the selling and launch of MNsure in Minnesota.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minnesota Investigation Never Bothered to Ask Jonathan Gruber to Provide Contract Details", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Minnesota Investigation Never Bothered to Ask Jonathan Gruber to Provide Contract Details", "title": "Minnesota Investigation Never Bothered to Ask Jonathan Gruber to Provide Contract Details - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-02-22T07:29:42-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/22/minnesota-investigation-never-bothered-to-ask-jonathan-gruber-to-provide-contract-details/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Minnesota Investigation Never Bothered to Ask Jonathan Gruber to Provide Contract Details", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "title": "Minnesota Investigation Never Bothered to Ask Jonathan Gruber to Provide Contract Details - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "April Todd-Malmlov, Governor Mark Dayton, Jonathan Gruber, Minnesota Legislative Auditor Jim Nobles, Minnesota State Representative Greg Davids, MNsure,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-02-22T06:37:53-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T07:29:42-07:00", "tag": "MNsure", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1d2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe did not attempt to interview Dr. Gruber,\u201d Alter told Breitbart News.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cIn its first year of operations, MNsure\u2019s failures outweighed its achievements,\u201d the OLA report concluded.\nSince the disastrous launch of MNsure, Todd-Malmlov has taken a job as senior vice president at Avalere Health, which is located in Washington, D.C.\nAll told, Gruber received $329,000 for his work, which resulted in two \u201cGruber-Gorman\u201d reports: the first completed in April 2012, and the second completed in February 2013.\nBut the OLA report issued last week seems to have a narrower scope than Nobles said would be the case when he testified before the Legislative Audit Commission."}
