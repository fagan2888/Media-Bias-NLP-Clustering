Whether a person tends to tweet in the first-person singular (\u201cI\u201d) or plural (\u201cwe\u201d) also can be revealing, and so can the intensity of emotion contained in the tweets.\n\n\u201cLanguage encodes who we are, how we think and what we feel,\u201d Karolina Sylwester and Matthew Purver wrote in a study published this week in the journal PLOS ONE. \u201cEven in a noisy Twitter data set, patterns of language use are consistent with findings obtained through classical psychology methods.\u201d\n\nThose methods usually involve surveys, and survey-takers sometimes give answers that are more socially acceptable than honest. Even though only about 14% of American adults are on Twitter, their tweets have the advantage of being more candid, Sylwester and Purver wrote.\n\nThe pair, both members of the Cognitive Science Research Group at Queen Mary University of London, rounded up all of the Twitter users who were following the @GOP, @HouseGOP, @Senate_GOPs, @TheDemocrats, @HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems accounts. They removed anyone who followed feeds from both sides of the aisle, leaving 316,590 presumed Republicans and 363,348 Democrats.\n\nFrom that pool, they randomly selected 17,000 people from each party. After eliminating users who didn\u2019t make their tweets public, who hadn\u2019t tweeted recently or who didn\u2019t tweet very often, they were able to analyze 466,386 tweets by 5,386 Republicans and 457,372 tweets by 5,373 Democrats.\n\nInstead of focusing on the words people used most, they examined the most \u201cdifferentiating\u201d words \u2014 that is, words that were embraced by one group and largely ignored by the other.\n\nFor Republicans, the researchers found, these words fell into several broad categories \u2014 religion (\u201cGod,\u201d \u201cpsalm\u201d), national identity (including \u201cAmerica,\u201d \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cborder\u201d), in-group identity (the word stem \u201cconserv\u201d and the acronyms TCOT for \u201ctop conservative on Twitter\u201d and RINO for \u201cRepublican in name only\"), government and law (including \u201clie,\u201d \u201cvote,\u201d \u201cimpeach\u201d and \u201cdefund\u201d), and political opponents (\u201cObama,\u201d \u201cReid\u201d and \u201cPelosi\u201d).\n\nThe differentiating words used by Democrats didn\u2019t have these political and patriotic overtones. Instead, they focused on cultural items that were big deals when the tweets were collected in June 2014 (including \u201cWorld Cup\u201d and \u201cArsenal\") as well as words the study authors described as \u201cmore emotionally expressive\u201d (such as \u201clove\u201d and \u201cfeel,\u201d the word stems \u201chappi\u201d and \u201camaz,\u201d and four-letter words that start with \u201cF\u201d and \u201cS\u201d).\n\nThe analysis revealed that certain words were more likely to be tweeted by conservatives and others were more likely to be tweeted by liberals. For instance, Republicans were 3.36 times more likely than Democrats to say \u201cObamacare\u201d and 1.40 more likely to tweet about \u201cGod.\u201d On the flip side, Democrats were 6.51 times more likely to type \u201cbirther\u201d and 3.7 times more likely to tweet about \u201cBridgegate.\u201d\n\nThese trends had predictive value. A \u201cone unit increase\u201d in the use of swear words increased the odds that the Twitter user was a Democrat by 20%. The same increase in the use of religious words increased the odds that the user was a Republican by 15%, according to the study.\n\n\u201cThese results suggest that language used on Twitter does, indeed, reflect individual differences between liberals and conservatives,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nSylwester and Purver also noticed that the presumed Democrats \u201ctend to use first-person singular pronouns more often than Republican followers, which we interpret as their greater desire for emphasizing uniqueness.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also found that the typical Republican account had more followers (about 219) than the typical Democratic account (about 201). In addition, Republicans mentioned other people\u2019s Twitter handles at a higher rate than Democrats. However, Democrats tended to follow more accounts on Twitter (about 78) than Republicans (about 52).\n\nThe pair from London hinted that their efforts to mine Americans\u2019 political expressions on Twitter have just gotten started.\n\n\u201cIt would be exciting to investigate how the language of Democrats and Republicans on Twitter changes over time in the context of the 2016 U.S. election,\u201d they wrote.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan and \"like\" Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Your Twitter feed says more about your political views than you think, study says", "Description": "You can get a pretty good idea of whether an American\u00a0is\u00a0liberal or conservative just by looking at his or her Twitter feed, new research shows.
