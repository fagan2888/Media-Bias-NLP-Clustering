At the time, that refusal was described as \u201cthe first known rebellion against Guantanamo\u2019s force-feeding policy.\u201d The nurse\u2019s commander has called for an internal inquiry into the incident.\n\nIn response to the ongoing investigation, the nation\u2019s largest nursing organization is now taking a public stance against requiring nurses to participate in force feedings. \u201cIt is incumbent on all leadership to recognize the code of ethics under which nurses and other professionals must practice,\u201d the president of the American Nurses Association (ANA), Pamela Cipriano, said at a press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nThe ANA is also publicizing the private letter that the group, which represents 3.1 million registered nurses across the country, sent to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel last month. In that letter, the nurses\u2019 association argues that \u201cethics and human rights issues emerge in health care settings where individuals are unable to assert their rights,\u201d like prisons.\n\nIn general, health professionals believe that competent patients should be allowed to refuse medical intervention, even if that intervention would save their own lives. ANA\u2019s official Code Of Ethics stipulates that nurses should be able to make their own independent judgment about these issues.\n\nThe ANA\u2019s stance refocuses the spotlight on what has been an extremely controversial practice within Guantanamo Bay during prisoners\u2019 18-month-long hunger strike. Detainees there have described the process of being force-fed through a tube as \u201cpainful.\u201d One prisoner said it feels like having a razor blade shoved down your throat. Top Democrat lawmakers have called for an end to the practice, which they say may be considered a form of torture.\n\nOther professional medical organizations \u2014 including the American Medical Association and the World Medical Association \u2014 have also publicly opposed force-feeding, and have written letters to President Obama asking him to end the practice. Physicians for Human Rights in particular has been forcefully critical of the practice, saying that it\u2019s \u201cinhuman and degrading.\u201d And last year, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial by three doctors arguing that force-feeding is incompatible with informed consent, and \u201cactions violating medical ethics, taken on behalf of the government, devalue medical ethics for all physicians.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s treatment of prisoners conflicts with medical ethics in other ways, too. Because doctors are not allowed to end a patient\u2019s life against their will, major medical associations have refused to participate in the executions of death row inmates \u2014 something that\u2019s left U.S. officials scrambling to figure out how to find other, potentially less qualified, people to administer lethal injections.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Top medical groups say that health professionals shouldn't be punished for carrying out their ethical obligations to their patients.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Top medical groups say that health professionals shouldn't be punished for carrying out their ethical obligations to their patients.", "title": "Nurses Say They Shouldn\u2019t Have To Help Force-Feed Prisoners", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/20/3594776/nurses-force-feeding/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP914411499919.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Top medical groups say that health professionals shouldn't be punished for carrying out their ethical obligations to their patients.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP914411499919-321x214.jpg", "title": "Nurses Say They Shouldn\u2019t Have To Help Force-Feed Prisoners", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP914411499919.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP914411499919.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-20T09:03:49+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb51\"", "article_summary": "ANA\u2019s official Code Of Ethics stipulates that nurses should be able to make their own independent judgment about these issues.\nIn that letter, the nurses\u2019 association argues that \u201cethics and human rights issues emerge in health care settings where individuals are unable to assert their rights,\u201d like prisons.\nThe ANA\u2019s stance refocuses the spotlight on what has been an extremely controversial practice within Guantanamo Bay during prisoners\u2019 18-month-long hunger strike.\nOther professional medical organizations \u2014 including the American Medical Association and the World Medical Association \u2014 have also publicly opposed force-feeding, and have written letters to President Obama asking him to end the practice.\nTop Democrat lawmakers have called for an end to the practice, which they say may be considered a form of torture."}
