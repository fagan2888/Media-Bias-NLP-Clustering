It creates the depth of services and scale that is required to manage the health of distinct populations of patients and better positions us to provide the most appropriate care, in the most appropriate setting at the lowest possible cost.\"\n\nThe FTC's administrative complaint said the merger would create a dominant provider of general acute care inpatient services sold to commercial health plans in a four-county region of south-central Pennsylvania. The merged health system would control 64% of this market, which the FTC said would lead to increased healthcare costs and reduced quality of care for more than 500,000 regional residents.\n\nHershey is a 551-bed, not-for-profit healthcare system in Dauphin County. It also owns the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute and the Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital. Hershey's total revenues in FY2014 were $1.39 billion.\n\nPinnacle is a not-for-profit three hospital system also in Dauphin County, which operates three acute care hospitals: Harrisburg Hospital, Community General Osteopathic and West Shore Hospital with a combined total of 610 beds. Pinnacle had total revenues in fiscal year 2015 of $1.07 billion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Federal Trade Commission's administrative complaint says the merger would create a dominant provider of general acute care inpatient services sold to commercial health plans in a four-county region of south-central Pennsylvania.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "business, finance, leadership, revenue", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "It also owns the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute and the Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital.\nFTC Rejects Another Health System M&AThe Federal Trade Commission's administrative complaint says the merger would create a dominant provider of general acute care inpatient services sold to commercial health plans in a four-county region of south-central Pennsylvania.\nThe merged health system would control 64% of this market, which the FTC said would lead to increased healthcare costs and reduced quality of care for more than 500,000 regional residents.\n\"We firmly believe that the integration of PinnacleHealth and Penn State Hershey serves the best interests of patients and the entire central Pennsylvania community,\" the two systems said.\nPinnacle is a not-for-profit three hospital system also in Dauphin County, which operates three acute care hospitals: Harrisburg Hospital, Community General Osteopathic and West Shore Hospital with a combined total of 610 beds."}
