In a petition addressed to the U.S. Supreme Court (who will soon hear two cases where employers are denying their employees coverage because they don't personally support contraception), the nuns wrote, \"We want to make clear that the sin is not a person using birth control. The sin is denying women the right and the means to plan their families.\" Well, that's awesome.\n\nMost Popular\n\nSister Donna Quinn, the head of NCAN, told ReligionDispatches.org that \"it isn't 'faith and freedom' when reproductive autonomy isn't extended by the Catholic Church to women.\" She added, \"It isn't freedom when a woman can be held hostage by the owner of a business.\" The petition (which is extremely close to reaching its goal of 5,000 signatures) also had this to say about religious freedom: \"We know that religious freedom means that each person has the right to exercise their own religious beliefs; religious freedom cannot mean that an individual or a corporation gets to impose their religious beliefs on their employees.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the two cases, Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood v. Sebelius, next week. Both involve for-profit companies refusing to provide their employees with mandated coverage because the companies' Christian owners do not believe in birth control. If that sounds stupid and terrible to you, that's because it is.\n\nThe NCAN nuns, though, are amazing. Bravo to Sister Donna and her cohorts for taking a brave and positive stand on this issue.\n\nRELATED:\n\nTop 8 Ways Young Women Benefit From Obamacare\n\nValerie Jarrett: \"All Insurance Plans Are Required to Cover Contraception\n\n3 Major Challenges to the Birth Control Mandate Explained\n\nFollow Eliza on Twitter.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/14/29/120x120/53a0f4feefa30_-_cos-01-nuns-smn.jpg", "description": "The National Coalition of American Nuns has announced their support for women's right to birth-control access through Obamacare.", "title": "National Coalition of American Nuns Announces Support for Contraception Access via Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "description": "\"The sin is denying women the right and the means to plan their families.\"", "title": "American Nuns Announce Their Support for Obamacare Contraception Access", "url": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/celebrity/news/nuns-announce-support-for-obamacare", "image": {"url": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/14/25/53a0f4ff1ad9b_-_cos-01-nuns-de.jpg", "width": 720, "identifier": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/14/25/53a0f4ff1ad9b_-_cos-01-nuns-de.jpg", "height": 609}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/14/25/53a0f4ff1ad9b_-_cos-01-nuns-de.jpg"}, "title": "American Nuns Announce Their Support for Obamacare Contraception Access", "description": "\"The sin is denying women the right and the means to plan their families.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Cosmopolitan"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-20T10:52:00-04:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "American Nuns Announce Their Support for Obamacare Contraception Access", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951817550, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteCosmo&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "keywords": "birth control, nuns, national coalition of american nuns, contraception, obamacare", "sailthru.tags": "Sex & Relationships, birth control,contraception,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "section": "Sex & Relationships", "published_time": "2014-03-20 02:52:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-14 16:03:58"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/14/29/640x541/53a0f4ff1ad9b_-_cos-01-nuns-de.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde300\"", "article_summary": "The petition (which is extremely close to reaching its goal of 5,000 signatures) also had this to say about religious freedom: \"We know that religious freedom means that each person has the right to exercise their own religious beliefs; religious freedom cannot mean that an individual or a corporation gets to impose their religious beliefs on their employees.\"\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowThe National Coalition of American Nuns recently came out in support of the Affordable Care Act's provision for contraception coverage.\nShe added, \"It isn't freedom when a woman can be held hostage by the owner of a business.\"\nBoth involve for-profit companies refusing to provide their employees with mandated coverage because the companies' Christian owners do not believe in birth control.\nRELATED:Top 8 Ways Young Women Benefit From ObamacareValerie Jarrett: \"All Insurance Plans Are Required to Cover Contraception3 Major Challenges to the Birth Control Mandate ExplainedFollow Eliza on Twitter."}
