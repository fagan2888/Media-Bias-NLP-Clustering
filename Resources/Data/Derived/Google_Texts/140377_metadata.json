The police chief has learned that they applied the punishment to Dana, who was very nearly caught for stealing the Trophy of Truth in Week Eight. (You may recall that Dana is one in a set of triplets and the police have only identified one of them, Elliot. They can\u2019t tell the other two apart.) This punishment drives the recipient insane. In Logiton, everything that an insane person believes is false. But criminals in Logiton always lie, which means they will only say things that directly contradict their beliefs. So, for example, Dana might believe that 2+2=5 (because he is insane) and so say \u201c2 plus 2 is not 5\u2033 (because he is a liar). Armed with this knowledge, the police round up the two remaining unidentified triplets, Dana and Chris. They are seated in the interrogation room on the left and right sides of a table. The police record the following testimony:\n\nLeft: I am insane.\n\nRight: No, my sibling is not.\n\nLeft: I don\u2019t believe what my sibling is saying!\n\nSome important things to know: Sane people in Logiton only believe true things, and Chris is either sane or may have gone insane since the last interrogation, in which Chris was proved to be a criminal (of a different crime). Finally, there\u2019s no requirement that anyone in Logiton has to have a belief either way about everything. In other words, just because someone doesn\u2019t believe a statement doesn\u2019t mean that person believes the opposite of that statement. That person might simply not believe either the statement or its opposite.\n\nWhich of the two triplets is Dana, the purloiner of the Trophy of Truth?\n\nTree-angle | Junior Varsity\n\nThe Logiton Civic Planning Commission is going to wall off one corner of the village green to create a public park in the shape of an isosceles right triangle. The highlight of this park will be four newly-planted silverbell trees. In order to thrive to maturity, each tree needs a circle of radius six meters surrounding its trunk that does not extend outside the park and that does not overlap the similar circle surrounding any other tree.\n\nWhat is the minimum length of one wall of the park?\n\nSee answers to last week\u2019s puzzles below.

The rows of Casey\u2019s grid Word Block turn out to be words: CARET, CATER, CRATE, REACT and TRACE. The largest number of identical letters Casey can get on the diagonal is four, which implies a radius of 25/16 in Marble Jam.\n\nThat leaves only Cubic Conundrum, which turns out to have no solutions at all.\n\nFor extended solutions, go here.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Try your hand at this week's Wall Street Journal math puzzle.", "title": "Varsity Math: Week 20", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/2016/01/29/varsity-math-week-20/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MH031_MATH_P_20160126110005.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Life", "article.headline": "Varsity Math: Week 20", "description": "Try your hand at this week's Wall Street Journal math puzzle.", "article_section": "Life", "author": "Kathryn Lurie", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "WSJ Puzzles Blog", "page.subsection": "WSJ Puzzles", "article.summary": "Try your hand at this week's Wall Street Journal math puzzle.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2016-01-30T00:49:52-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/2016/01/29/varsity-math-week-20/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PUZZLEB-2490", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Life", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Try your hand at this week's Wall Street Journal math puzzle.", "title": "Varsity Math: Week 20", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/2016/01/29/varsity-math-week-20/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MH031_MATH_P_20160126110005.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "WSJ Puzzles", "article.id": "BL-PUZZLEB-2490", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-02-01T16:29:06-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Luci Guti\u00e9rrezThe team is busy in the town of Logiton this week, helping the police as well as civic planners.\nArmed with this knowledge, the police round up the two remaining unidentified triplets, Dana and Chris.\nThe police chief has learned that they applied the punishment to Dana, who was very nearly caught for stealing the Trophy of Truth in Week Eight.\nIn Logiton, everything that an insane person believes is false.\nIn other words, just because someone doesn\u2019t believe a statement doesn\u2019t mean that person believes the opposite of that statement."}
