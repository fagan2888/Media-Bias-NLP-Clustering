Military spokesperson Andriy Lysenko said no Ukrainian troops were killed or injured in the attacks.\n\nWednesday\u2019s attacks underscored the fragility of the truce, which was signed Feb. 12 in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.\n\n\u201cSeparatists continue to shell Ukrainian positions in brutal violation of the cease-fire agreement,\u201d Ukrainian military spokesman Anatoliy Stelmakh said Thursday.\n\nA previous cease-fire, signed Sept. 5, 2014, collapsed earlier this year. While the current cease-fire has largely stalled the conflict\u2019s escalation, it got off to a rocky start.\n\nDays after the deal went into effect on Feb. 15, pro-Russian separatists sacked the eastern Ukrainian town of Debaltseve, a strategic railway hub then held by Ukrainian troops.\n\nSeparatists eventually took the town, forcing roughly 2,000 Ukrainian troops into a chaotic retreat.\n\nWhile the intensity of the fighting has declined since the Debaltseve siege, attacks occur daily along the 500-kilometer-long front line in the Donbas.\n\nThe heaviest fighting since the Debaltseve siege has taken place in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk and in areas outside the industrial port city Mariupol on the Sea of Azov.\n\nHug acknowledged the number of cease-fire violations was troubling, but pointed to the increasing prevalence of small arms attacks over artillery strikes as evidence that both sides were at least nominally adhering to the cease-fire by limiting their use of heavy weapons.\n\n\u201cIn general it is positive that most of the fighting is conducted by small arms fire, indicating most heavy weapons have been withdrawn,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to the continued fighting, another lingering quesion is whether both sides actually withdrew their heavy weapons from the front lines or stashed them in nearby factories and coal mines where they remain hidden from inspectors but are still quickly available.\n\nWhen asked if Ukrainian forces had withdrawn heavy weapons according to the cease-fire terms, Lysenko said: \u201cThe main task for us is to not miss a probable attack by the enemy and to adequately respond to any enemy attack. The situation with monitoring the other side is quite problematic.\u201d\n\nBoth Ukrainian and separatist forces have interfered with the free movement of OSCE monitors looking for hidden heavy weapons in the conflict zone, Hug said, adding that he had already discussed the issue with Ukrainian officials.\n\n\u201cAll sides need to know that the weapons have not only been withdrawn, but remain withdrawn,\u201d Hug said. \u201cMore needs to be done to verify the weapons stay off the front lines. And the OSCE mission needs freedom of movement.\u201d\n\nThe OSCE currently has 460 monitors from 42 participating countries deployed to 10 locations throughout Ukraine to monitor the execution of the cease-fire.\n\nLast year OSCE monitors began using drones, which independent military contractors provided, to monitor the Ukraine-Russia border for arms shipments and troop movements from Russia into Ukraine.\n\nWhile the OSCE has appealed to member nations for the use of satellite and drone surveillance technology to monitor the cease-fire, Hug said there is no substitute for teams on the ground.\n\n\u201cThese technologies will help but we need unhindered ground access,\u201d Hug said. \u201cA satellite cannot look into a factory, and a drone cannot look into a coal mine.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s wave of attacks follows U.S. and NATO statements this week condemning Moscow for continuing to arm the separatists in violation of the cease-fire.\n\nAt a hearing before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 10, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland accused Russia of violating the cease-fire by sending weapons across the border into Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm new transfers of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery, and rocket equipment over the border to the separatists in eastern Ukraine,\u201d Nuland said.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied providing material support or weapons to the separatists and has accused Kyiv of violating the truce.\n\n\u201cFull implementation of the Minsk agreements is essentially being blocked by the Kyiv authorities,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said March 10, according to Voice of America.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the conflict in Ukraine has killed more than 6,000 civilians and military personnel and displaced more than 1 million people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Ukraine cease-fire goes into its second month, international monitors say the fragile truce is still holding.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As the Ukraine cease-fire goes into its second month, international monitors say the fragile truce is still holding.", "title": "International Monitors: Ukraine Cease-Fire 'On Thin Ice'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/dpaphotostwo306697.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:29:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ByMd77"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As the Ukraine cease-fire goes into its second month, international monitors say the fragile truce is still holding.", "title": "International Monitors: Ukraine Cease-Fire 'On Thin Ice'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/dpaphotostwo306697.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-03-12T23:11:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:29:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Donbas, OSCE, drones"}, "article_summary": "KYIV, Ukraine\u2014As the Ukraine cease-fire goes into its second month, international monitors say the fragile truce is still holding despite daily fighting and growing distrust on both sides about pledges to pull heavy weapons from the front lines.\n\u201cSeparatists continue to shell Ukrainian positions in brutal violation of the cease-fire agreement,\u201d Ukrainian military spokesman Anatoliy Stelmakh said Thursday.\nUkraine said pro-Russian separatists violated the cease-fire 50 times in a 24-hour period beginning Wednesday in a wave of attacks across the country\u2019s eastern territories.\nAnd the OSCE mission needs freedom of movement.\u201dThe OSCE currently has 460 monitors from 42 participating countries deployed to 10 locations throughout Ukraine to monitor the execution of the cease-fire.\n\u201cIn general it is positive that most of the fighting is conducted by small arms fire, indicating most heavy weapons have been withdrawn,\u201d he said."}
