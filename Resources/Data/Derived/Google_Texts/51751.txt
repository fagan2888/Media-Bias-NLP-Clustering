Areas in Reno County are covered in ice after a winter storm, leaving thousands without power and damage across county.

The Reno County Emergency Management Office says the ice storm lead to several power outages and damaged trees.

Most every tree in Hutchinson is coated with ice, many trees were damaged with limbs falling on cars, homes and sidewalks.

"It was like the largest thunderclap you have ever heard, the windows shook," said Mike Ruzich, who was assessing the damage a large tree did to his home.

Estimated restore time varied in Reno County, some residents tell KAKE News that they do not expect power restored for two weeks.

"Be cautious, when you are driving. If you don't have to be out, don't be out, if you see any line that is down, consider it to be energized and stay away from it," said Reno County Emergency Manager Todd Strain.

Strain says that many of the county roads could be slick and dangerous, especially south and west of Hutchinson.

There have been no reported injuries in Reno County because of the ice storm.
