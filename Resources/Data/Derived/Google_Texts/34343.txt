Re: “The pope, the saint and the climate,” June 18 E.J. Dionne Jr. column.

I’m a big fan of Pope Francis. Last week on the pope’s public day, I and my family of 11 were among the 75,000 gathered in St. Peter’s Square to receive his message and blessing. It was a mystical morning to be so near to this pope. I believe he is special and transformational on issues of faith, social values and morals. He is a pope for all people.

But, in his encyclical on climate change, it is just the pope’s opinion. It is no different than yours or mine. He may be right or wrong that climate change is caused by man. There is science both ways. The papal “infallibility” only applies to matters of faith and dogma. Of course environmentalists jump on his every word to gain a prestigious ally to support their position as if it was a gospel message.

I respect the pope’s opinion since he is a man of science [he is a former chemist], and it should be evaluated among many others. Climate change is not settled science.

My wife and I are very glad that Pope Francis has made it clear that climate change is real, immediate and human-driven to something like a billion Catholics. We can take effective action, individually, in groups, as businesses, utilities and governments. My wife and I did, installing both solar thermal and solar electric systems on our home and driving solar-powered electric cars. The economics were great, given available tax credits.

The sooner we all take action, the better, for the economy as well as environment. For our children and their children.
