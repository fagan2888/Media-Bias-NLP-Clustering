Ernst, Braley clash over EPA\n\nDAVENPORT, Iowa \u2014 Republican Joni Ernst defended her call to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency during an Iowa Senate race debate here Saturday night, saying states should lead the way on ending pollution.\n\nShe also said she would not vote to end a program that allows young undocumented immigrants to remain in the country, and expressed openness to unspecified campaign finance reforms.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGetting rid of the EPA is one of several positions Ernst staked out prior to the Republican primary in this critical and extremely tight Senate race. Facing a slew of attack ads by her Democratic opponent, Bruce Braley, Ernst is now trying to reassure general election voters that her stances are reasonable.\n\n( Full 2014 election results)\n\n\u201cI do believe our states know best how to protect their natural resources,\u201d the state senator said. \u201cI believe this can be done at the state level, rather than at a national level with the federal EPA.\u201d\n\nThe hourlong debate, sponsored by the local NBC affiliate and the Quad-City Times, was held before a live audience of about 600 on the campus of St. Ambrose University.\n\nThere was scant mention in the debate of social issues such as abortion and contraception, and many of the exchanges, including on entitlements and the minimum wage, were nearly identical to the candidates\u2019 first debate two weeks ago. But there was fresh back-and-forth on outside money, guns, immigration and Obamacare.\n\nThe Des Moines Register published a fresh poll just before the face-off showing a tied race, with Ernst at 47 percent and Braley at 46 percent \u2014 a 5-point move in the Democrat\u2019s direction since last month. The closeness underscores that this may be the truest toss-up Senate race in the country.\n\n( See more from POLITICO\u2019s Polling Center)\n\nBraley, a four-term congressman, saw an opening to attack on environmental issues. \u201cSound bites have consequences,\u201d he said several times. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want anyone making sure the air we breathe is clean and the water we drink is pure.\u201d\n\nErnst said states could work together to protect the environment, and that \u201cthere are other regulatory agencies that can step in\u201d at the federal level if the EPA is killed.\n\n\u201cThe reason a Republican president created the EPA is because states couldn\u2019t prevent big polluters from destroying our planet,\u201d Braley shot back. \u201cWhen President [Richard] Nixon created it, there were rivers on fire.\u201d\n\nWhen Braley said \u201csound bites have consequences,\u201d his mantra of the night, Ernst fired back by recalling that Braley mocked Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley as a farmer without a law degree during a closed-door fundraiser with trial lawyers that was caught on camera. Her supporters in the crowd cheered.\n\nOn immigration, Ernst said she would not vote to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program essentially prevents the deportation of many people who were brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children. Ernst said that while she opposes amnesty, she recognizes the children covered by the program were not brought to the U.S. of their own accord.\n\n( POLITICO\u2019s 2014 race ratings)\n\n\u201cWe are a country of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws,\u201d she said.\n\nErnst repeatedly linked Braley with President Barack Obama, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and their \u201cfailed record in D.C.\u201d Braley called Ernst an extremist on a host of issues and said she\u2019s in the pocket of the conservative billionaire Koch brothers.\n\nBraley defended himself from attack ads being run by the National Rifle Association by noting that he\u2019s never met former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a major gun-control advocate being vilified by the NRA. Republicans responded by pointing out that they both spoke at the same No Labels conference in 2010.\n\nErnst defended the support she\u2019s receiving from David and Charles Koch by saying that she has never signed any pledge and has promised the brothers nothing. Braley responded by noting that she\u2019s a signed a no-new-taxes pledge.\n\n\u201cYou attended two secret Koch brother donor meetings in California,\u201d he said. \u201cYou called them wonderful at that meeting \u2026 The Kochs have seven different organizations attacking me right now.\u201d\n\nTo a remarkable degree, ads by outside groups such as ones backed by the Kochs shaped the nature of the questions from both local voters and the local reporters moderating the debate.\n\nWhen Braley called for banning dark political money, Ernst responded that she and her allies are getting outspent by Braley, environmentalist Tom Steyer\u2019s super PAC and the Harry Reid-backed Senate Majority PAC.\n\nBut she also expressed openness to unspecified changes in campaign finance laws.\n\n\u201cYes, and there are probably reforms that could be made, but again I am being outspent by these very organizations,\u201d she said. \u201cHere he is calling for reform, and yet we\u2019re being tremendously outspent.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates took a hard line on the fight against the Islamic State militant group, but Ernst disagreed with Braley that Congress should be called back into session for more briefings and votes on the matter.\n\nErnst acknowledged that she was reluctant about arming Syrian rebels a year ago, something she now supports, but also criticized Braley for not responding more forcefully earlier this year when the Iraqi city of Mosul fell to the militants.\n\n\u201cI was not as confident a year ago \u2026 but we have had a year to carefully vet those moderate rebels,\u201d she said. \u201cIs there 100 percent assurance? No, there is not.\u201d\n\nBraley said he remains \u201cvery concerned about the vetting process\u201d for giving weapons to rebels in Syria.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think we should go back into session and get an updated classified briefing on what\u2019s happened since we made that vote,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pair also clashed on guns. Braley advocated for background checks. He said the Second Amendment requires a balancing act between giving people gun rights and protecting everyone else.\n\n\u201cSen. Ernst doesn\u2019t think you should even need to go through a permit process to carry a concealed weapon and should be able to carry guns in churches and bars,\u201d he said.\n\nErnst said she is horrified by gun violence but is focused on improving the mental health care system.\n\n\u201cWe need to enforce the gun control laws that we have on the books right now,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Obamacare, a voter sent a question in to Ernst asking if he would lose his coverage if she and her fellow Republicans successfully repealed the health care law.\n\n\u201cEvery Iowan has a right to affordable health care,\u201d she said, going on to add that \u201cObamacare is not the answer.\u201d\n\nBraley talked about how bad things were before the law went into effect.\n\n\u201cI agree\u201d with Ernst on every Iowan having the right to health care, \u201cand yet 47 million Americans didn\u2019t have health insurance coverage before the Affordable Care Act was passed,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The two Iowa candidates remain locked in one of the nation's tightest Senate races.", "title": "Ernst, Braley clash over EPA", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/joni-ernst-bruce-braley-clash-over-epa-in-debate-111810.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/12/141011_joni_ernst_bruce_braley_gty_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Joni Ernst,Iowa,Senate,2014 Elections,Bruce Braley,EPA", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The two Iowa candidates remain locked in one of the nation's tightest Senate races.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc311\"", "article_summary": "Facing a slew of attack ads by her Democratic opponent, Bruce Braley, Ernst is now trying to reassure general election voters that her stances are reasonable.\nErnst, Braley clash over EPADAVENPORT, Iowa \u2014 Republican Joni Ernst defended her call to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency during an Iowa Senate race debate here Saturday night, saying states should lead the way on ending pollution.\nErnst said she is horrified by gun violence but is focused on improving the mental health care system.\nStory Continued BelowGetting rid of the EPA is one of several positions Ernst staked out prior to the Republican primary in this critical and extremely tight Senate race.\nErnst repeatedly linked Braley with President Barack Obama, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and their \u201cfailed record in D.C.\u201d Braley called Ernst an extremist on a host of issues and said she\u2019s in the pocket of the conservative billionaire Koch brothers."}
