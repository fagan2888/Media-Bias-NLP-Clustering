The clunky website got off to a horrendous start, the \u201cfixes\u201d didn\u2019t work, Kathleen Sebelius got raked over the coals (\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me!\u201d) at a House hearing, and not enough young people are signing up.\n\nThe solution? The White House has created an \u201cACA Bracket\u201d (Get it? Huh? Get it?) site where young folks can go and vote for their favorite GIFs and then head on over to HealthCare.gov and get signed up.\n\nHow bad is this website? The word \u201cdoomed\u201d comes to mind, as in \u201cIf this is the best our government can do, we are doomed.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a dancing duck proclaiming \u201cI\u2019m so excited\u201d about free birth control, a cat in a tux with a disco-glitter background telling you about rebates, and Michelle Obama \u201craisin\u2019 the roof\u201d with some woman in mom jeans. Horrifying, absolutely horrifying. (And I\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Shining.\u201d Twice.)\n\nThere are a couple of takeaways here. First, Millennials, it is clear that the White House thinks you are stupid. You could not possibly read a thoughtfully written piece on what the ACA has to offer you. Nope, your attention span is too short, and the only thing you\u2019ll pay attention to is pictures of cats.\n\nSecond, the White House is desperate. Not only does this website look like it was designed by a 5th-grader, it practically screams, \u201cHelp! Sign up! We\u2019re dying over here!\u201d\n\nFinally, the White House is hoping you won\u2019t notice a few things. Like, a thoughtful young woman is reduced to a dancing duck over free birth control. Or that \u201ctwerking\u201d is the best selling point for the ACA. Or that the entire website reeks of frantic distress.\n\nYup, Millennials: the White House thinks you\u2019re stupid. Show them you\u2019re not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act has seen more than it's share of disasters.
