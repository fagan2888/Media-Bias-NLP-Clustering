The loss of those sales will jeopardize our growth as a company and hinder our ability to retain and expand our staff.\n\nThe NBCC states that it has a strategic goal to \u201cincrease business development and growth via procurement, capital access and international trade.\u201d I have personally led trade missions to West Africa comprised solely of African-American-owned businesses. In order to facilitate the international business, small- and medium-sized enterprises must have some type of financial assistance. If the NBCC truly wants to fulfill its goal of increasing international trade for NBCC members, it should support the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n\nIn the last fiscal year, Ex-Im supported more than $2 billion in minority and women-owned business exports. Nearly one out of five of the bank\u2019s transactions during this time supported businesses like mine. If the Black Chamber wants to argue these numbers should be higher still, I might agree; but acting as if the bank simply ignores minority entrepreneurs or fails to provide information about the work it does in our communities is unfair and incorrect.\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank has authorized more financing to minority and women-owned businesses in the last six years than in the 16 years before \u2014 the result of tough congressional oversight and a commitment to ensuring that all potential American exporters have equal access to the bank. The bank has broad bipartisan support. Two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 including both African-American senators \u2014 are on record supporting the bank and most analysts believe it would pass the House with a supermajority of over 300 votes.\n\nI urge our leaders to bring this pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-diversity program to a vote.\n\nFrom Cherod Webber, president and CEO, Innovative Global Supply LLC, Columbia, S.C.\n\nSolving student loan crisis is crucial", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Export-Import Bank a boon for black small businesses", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Export-Import Bank a boon for black small businesses", "url": "http://thehill.com/opinion/letters/258289-export-import-bank-a-boon-for-black-small-businesses", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Cherod Webber, president and CEO, Innovative Global Supply LLC", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/opinion/letters/258289-export-import-bank-a-boon-for-black-small-businesses", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-27T17:57-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Dickson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-27T17:57:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/opinion/letters/258289-export-import-bank-a-boon-for-black-small-businesses", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Export-Import Bank a boon for black small businesses"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8641\"", "article_summary": "If the National Black Chamber of Commerce is looking for an African-American-owned business that has flourished thanks to the Export-Import Bank (\u201cBlack Chamber: Ex-Im has done nothing for us,\u201d Oct. 7), it should have called me.\nIn order to facilitate the international business, small- and medium-sized enterprises must have some type of financial assistance.\nIf the NBCC truly wants to fulfill its goal of increasing international trade for NBCC members, it should support the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\nNearly one out of five of the bank\u2019s transactions during this time supported businesses like mine.\nIn the last fiscal year, Ex-Im supported more than $2 billion in minority and women-owned business exports."}
