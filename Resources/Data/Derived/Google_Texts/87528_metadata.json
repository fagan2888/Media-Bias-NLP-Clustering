The traditional thought is that good leaders \u2014 whether they are CEOs, politicians or principals \u2014 are supposed to be honest, authentic and transparent.\n\nPlayer utilities Popout\n\nShare download This story is based on a radio interview. Listen to the full interview. PRI.org\n\nBut history tells us otherwise. According to Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and author of \"Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time,\u201d the average person lies at least twice a day. He says that the truth about good leaders is that they are often really good liars.\n\n\u201cWhat makes individuals successful is often times the opposite of what people have been told to do,\u201d Pfeffer says. \u201cWhile we\u2019re told to be modest and honest, and to take care of others and not self-promote, when you actually look at what produces leadership success, at least success as defined as career advancement and achieving a high salary, it\u2019s pretty much the opposite of that.\u201d\n\nSome of the greatest and most successful leaders in the history of business and politics have not always told the truth, Pfeffer says.\n\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln, in order to settle the Civil War, was not completely honest about where the Southern delegation was,\u201d he says. \u201cJames Clapper, the director of national intelligence, when asked about whether or not national intelligence agencies were intercepting communications from American citizens, didn\u2019t tell the truth, as we learned from Edward Snowden. And, by the way, Mr. Clapper still has his job.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the business sector, Pfeffer points to Apple founder Steve Jobs, who often employed the \u201creality distortion field\u201d \u2014 a tactic used to convince people of things that they themselves do not believe or are not consistent with reality in order to achieve a goal.\n\nThere are plenty of recent examples. Take this statement about the Affordable Care Act that President Barack Obama made back in July 2009:\n\n\"Under our proposal, if you like your doctor, you keep your doctor. If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance. Period. End of story.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an example that\u2019s not dissimilar to the Lincoln example \u2014 sometimes in order to get a proposal accepted, you can\u2019t necessarily tell everything quite accurately,\u201d says Pfeffer. \u201cLincoln wanted to settle the Civil War, so he had to make up some lies about the Southern delegation and what the Southerners were willing to accept. When Obama wants to sell healthcare for everyone, he has to probably distort a little bit about some of the specifics of that healthcare plan.\u201d\n\nUS leaders at the beginning of the century also lied. Perhaps most famously is this 2003 statement from President George W. Bush:\n\n\"Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks, to build and keep weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nNot so much. But, Pfeffer argues, not all cases of dishonesty are equal.\n\n\u201cIn both [the Bush] case and the Obama case, one of the questions is not does a statement, after the fact, turn out to be inaccurate, but whether or not someone knows the statement is incorrect at the moment they\u2019re making it,\u201d says Pfeffer. \u201cThere are some people who believe that George Bush actually believed, at the moment he was making that statement, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and that it was only in hindsight that they learned they didn\u2019t. A lie is telling something you know not to be true at the moment that you say it.\u201d\n\nOne lie has come to galvanize the auto industry in recent days: Just last week, Volkswagen admitted to altering sensors in their cars in order to cheat on emissions tests.\n\n\u201cLying in the auto industry has a long and glorious, or inglorious depending on your prospective, history and tradition,\u201d Pfeffer says. \u201cOne of the interesting questions you ought to ask is why has this gone on and why has this persisted over 40 or 50 years? Let me suggest that one of the answers is because we do not criminalize that behavior. Yes, VW will pay I don\u2019t know how many multiple billions of dollars ... but I will guarantee you, with almost no fear of contradiction, that no executive will go to jail.\u201d\n\nThis story first aired as an interview on PRI's The Takeaway, a public radio program that invites you to be part of the American conversation.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "description": "Good leaders are supposed to be honest and full of integrity, right?
