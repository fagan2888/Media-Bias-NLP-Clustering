The beer made its debut on the eve of the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia, a four-day Catholic conference on the family.\n\nAnd if that isn\u2019t hoppy or yeasty or pope-y enough for you, there is \u201cHoly Wooder\u201d beer from the Philadelphia Brewing Co. The company promises Holy Wooder will \u201ccleanse your soul and set you on the path to righteousness.\u201d\n\nWord has it that Philadelphia Brewing Co. sent a half-keg o\u2019 Holy Wooder to St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, where Francis was treated to a choral welcome Saturday (Sept. 26) afternoon.\n\nREAD: For sex abuse victims in Philly, pope\u2019s visit means a difficult week\n\nMarlene Schmitt, who tends the long wooden bar at South Philadelphia Tap Room, a joint in the city\u2019s Newbold neighborhood, said the bar began offering the two beers Friday morning.\n\n\u201cDuring happy hour it\u2019s half-off local beers, so we have a lot of those,\u201d she said.\n\nSchmitt characterized Holy Wooder as a \u201cBelgian-style Tripel\u201d and YOPO as a \u201choppy pale ale.\u201d Like the pope, both beers are here for a short time only.\n\nAll told, there are eight beers to celebrate the pope\u2019s Philly visit. One South Philadelphia watering hole, The POPE: Pub on Passyunk East, held a tasting of all eight before Francis\u2019 arrival.\n\nAt the Tap Room, Chris Sheehan, 30, tried the Holy Wooder for the first time Friday. He is not a Catholic, but that didn\u2019t deter him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing about (the papal beers),\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the intention of trying one, but I saw it was on tap so I did.\u201d\n\nSheehan pronounced Holy Wooder \u201cdelicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have a new brew and this one is just associated with the weekend,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s just possible Francis will sample some of the beer. He is spending the night at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary and earlier in life worked as a bar bouncer.\n\nYS/MG END HANKINS-WINSTON", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Culture, beer, Catholic, Christian, papal visit, Philadelphia, Pope Francis", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (RNS) Raising a glass (or eight) of special papal beers brewed to last only a little longer than Pope Francis' visit here.", "title": "On tap at Philly\u2019s joints, papal brews", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/26/know-say-pass-popal-brew-philly/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/beer1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/26/know-say-pass-popal-brew-philly/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/26/know-say-pass-popal-brew-philly/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (RNS) Raising a glass (or eight) of special papal beers brewed to last only a little longer than Pope Francis' visit here."}, "article_summary": "And if that isn\u2019t hoppy or yeasty or pope-y enough for you, there is \u201cHoly Wooder\u201d beer from the Philadelphia Brewing Co.\nAt the Tap Room, Chris Sheehan, 30, tried the Holy Wooder for the first time Friday.\nSchmitt characterized Holy Wooder as a \u201cBelgian-style Tripel\u201d and YOPO as a \u201choppy pale ale.\u201d Like the pope, both beers are here for a short time only.\nOne South Philadelphia watering hole, The POPE: Pub on Passyunk East, held a tasting of all eight before Francis\u2019 arrival.\n\u201cYOPO\u201d beer is made by the Cape May Brewing Co., a microbrewery in southern New Jersey."}
