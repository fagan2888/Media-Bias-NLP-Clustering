The following is an overview of each, with model legislation linked at each step. Get the bills, contact your state legislators and senators, and urge them to introduce today!\n\n1. REJECT THE EXCHANGES.\n\nStates were \u201cgiven an option\u201d \u2013 run the exchange, partner with the feds on running it, or leave it to DC to figure out. It doesn\u2019t matter what \u201ccards we were dealt\u201d \u2013 as some governors are saying. Running an unconstitutional program for the feds is just plain wrong. And the first \u2013 and easiest \u2013 thing for states to do is to just say no.\n\nShifting the burden for health insurance exchanges to the feds effectively sabotages the implementation of Obamacare.\n\nThe federal government needs states to be complicit to pull this off. Otherwise, these decisions on who was creating exchange wouldn\u2019t even have been included in the first place. The fact of the matter is that DC doesn\u2019t have the resources or the manpower to run these exchanges in every state. Some analysts are saying that they only have the capacity to do so in 30-40 states, and any more than that will lead towards a collapse of the system.\n\nSo far, 36 states have rejected the creation of an exchange. But, most of these actions were done by an action of a Governor, and not legislatively. While this is a strong first step and will have significant effect in the long run, these Gubernatorial actions are highly susceptible to a quick change. An opinion, an election \u2013 can bring in a new attitude or a new governor willing to take the opposite.\n\nRight now? Contact your state representative to introduce a bill banning it, even if your governor has already approved or denied the exchange. Make a state exchange illegal with a veto-proof majority and you\u2019ve just made your DC-loving governor \u2013 or a future one- irrelevant.

REJECT THE MEDICAID EXPANSION.\n\nDuring the Obamacare case before the Supreme Court, Rob Natelson and his colleagues at the Independence Institute argued that the law\u2019s provisions forcing the states to expand Medicaid were unconstitutional. Neither the Constitution nor case law, they pointed out, permits the federal government to use federal spending programs to coerce the states. Seven of the nine justices agreed with them, essentially adopting the arguments advanced in their brief.\n\nAs a result, the states may consider freely whether or not to accept additional federal funds for the Medicaid expansion. Accepting federal funds might seem to bring the states short-term fiscal benefits. But the fiscal risks of doing so are very great\u2014perhaps eventual bankruptcy. Financial and practical matters aside, helping the federal government run an unconstitutional program by participating in it on a state level is just plain wrong.\n\nGet model legislation for your state HERE (.pdf)\n\n3. BLOCK IRS\u2019S ILLEGAL TAXES.\n\nThe 36 states that have refused to establish Exchanges can actually block the IRS\u2019s illegal ObamaCare taxes legislatively by suspending the licenses of insurers that accept the illegal subsidies. Since no insurer would then accept one, not a single employer in the state could be hit with the employer-mandate penalties those subsidies trigger.\n\nLegislators in Ohio and Missouri have previously considered legislation based on the American Legislative Exchange Council\u2019s \u201cHealth Care Freedom Act 2.0\u201d model legislation.\n\n4. PROHIBIT THE STATE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE FROM INVESTIGATING OR ENFORCING ANY ALLEGED VIOLATION OF FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS MANDATED BY OBAMACARE.\n\nThe provision prohibiting state insurance commissioners from investigating or enforcing violations of federally mandated health insurance requirements will prove particularly problematic for the feds. Insurance commissioners serve as the enforcement arm for insurance regulation in the states. The federal government has no enforcement arm. It assumed the state insurance commissioners would enforce all of the provisions of the ACA. So, when people have issues with their mandated coverage, they will have to call the feds. At this point, it remains unclear who they will even call should states ban their own Insurance Commissioners from carrying out this essential task. Issues the state insurance commissioner would not address include prohibiting a denial of insurance for preexisting conditions, requiring dependent coverage for children up to age 26, and proscribing lifetime or yearly dollar limits on coverage of essential health benefits.\n\n\u201cDisputes over these mandates arise under federal, not state law,\u201d said Georgia State Rep. Jason Spencer, who sponsored a bill to take this step in 2013. \u201cThe federal Department of Health and Human Services can be expected to seek to commandeer the machinery of Georgia\u2019s commissioner of insurance to enforce them or to investigate alleged violations because at present there is no federal health insurance agency and Congress is not likely to create one given the substantial opposition to Obamacare. Under HB707, the feds won\u2019t be able to do that. They\u2019ll have to figure out how to do it themselves.\u201d\n\nMODEL LEGISLATION HERE (.pdf)\n\n5. COMPLETED THE FIRST FOUR? CONTACT US FOR STEP FIVE!\n\nThe first three steps are actually sub-steps of a larger first step forward. As James Madison made clear in Federalist #46, when a number of states work together to create a \u201crefusal to cooperate with officers of the Union,\u201d it will create \u201cobstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Federal government needs the cooperation and support from the states to carry out its act. In few places is this more obvious than with Obamacare. The first three steps will, at very least, cripple the implementation of the federal act should they be carried out in a significant number of states. Should that not be enough to pull the rug out from under the Act and bring it to its much-needed demise, there are further steps that can \u2013 and should \u2013 be taken on a state level to ensure that end result.\n\nTHE LEGAL BASIS\n\nThese provisions stand on solid legal ground under the \u201canti-commandeering doctrine.\u201d This rests primarily on four SCOTUS cases: Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842), New York v. US (1992), Printz v. US (1997) and National Federation of Businesses v. Sebelius. (2012) The Printz case serves the cornerstone. Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia asserted that commandeering is incompatible would the constitutional system.\n\n\u201cWe held in New York that Congress cannot compel the States to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Today we hold that Congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the States\u2019 officers directly. The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States\u2019 officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether policy making is involved, and no case by case weighing of the burdens or benefits is necessary; such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\u201cTHE APPROACH IS ON SOUND LEGAL FOOTING\u201d\n\n-Mercer University law professor David Oedel, part of the legal team that represented Georgia in its challenge to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn short, if the federal government passes a law or regulatory scheme, the states don\u2019t have to help them carry it out. The only question that remains: will you pressure your state to take the right course?\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare can still be stopped.
