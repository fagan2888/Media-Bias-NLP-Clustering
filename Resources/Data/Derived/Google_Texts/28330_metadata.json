Equipped with an early type of color film, Kahn\u2019s photographers journeyed to the jungles of the Amazon and Sub-Saharan Africa. They recorded the final years of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, as well as daily life in Ireland, Norway and the United States. By 1931, when Kahn was forced to halt the project due to financial troubles, he had amassed some 72,000 autochromes, which he boldly christened \u201cLes Archives de la plan\u00e8te.\u201d\n\nIronically, the most famous images from Kahn\u2019s collection were taken in the streets and squares around his Paris home. They depict a city whose characters \u2014 merchants, soldiers, grandes dames and dandies in stovepipe hats \u2014 recall the paintings of Manet and Caillebotte; and whose signs and streets may be recognized from the photographs of Eug\u00e8ne Atget or Charles Marville. And yet, in their original form or with digital color enhancements, the Kahn autochromes are uniquely mesmerizing, for they bring lucid color to the period between the fall of Realist painting and the rise of color film that sometimes seems, to the modern observer, to have existed in black-and-white.\n\nBut the color is only part of their charm. Why did these photos go viral while the tribes of the Amazon or the villages of Ireland remain curiosities? Because of the city, of course. Paris in these images is at once familiar and foreign, a combination that enthralled the millions who saw these images when they circulated on blogs and social media last winter.\n\nThey demonstrated the extent to which old photographs of cities, like cat videos, have gained unforeseen popularity on the Internet. Once relegated to municipal archives, libraries and postcard collections, vintage urban photos have given rise to thriving online communities where enthusiasts celebrate a wide range of scenes. They offer the evidence of a history lesson and the beauty of a museum piece, and like an old top 40 hit, provoke a peculiar sense of yearning \u2013 a paradox of warmth and loss \u2013 that is at once highly personal and shared by thousands.\n\nOn the Facebook page \u201cOld Images of New York,\u201d Todd Berkun posts black-and-white photographs of the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and street scenes that include bocce players and clam peddlers.\n\nIn September, \u201cOld Images of New York\u201d (inspired by an eponymous page for the city of Philadelphia) had some 17,000 fans; now it is quickly approaching 200,000, which puts it a rung below news outlets like Salon (312K fans) and Bloomberg News (387K). But in terms of interaction \u2014 in Facebook lingo, the number of people \u201ctalking about this,\u201d which factors in likes, comments and shares \u2014 Berkun\u2019s stats regularly eclipse those of Salon, Bloomberg, the Atlantic, Slate, Vanity Fair and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn brief, the site exerts a magnetic pull over its fans. Postcard-style images, like this anonymous 1931 photo of rainy trolley tracks glistening beneath the lights of Times Square, tend to perform the best. But Berkun tries to cultivate a balance of the iconic and the unknown. Alongside landmarks, he\u2019ll throw up a shot of Satchel Paige at Yankee Stadium, or a \u201940s streetscape from the Tenderloin. The term \u201cold\u201d allows him great leeway. The 1984 Thanksgiving Day Parade, captured on black-and-white film, seemed old enough for his audience, as do regular photographs of the twin towers.\n\nBerkun has no background in photography. At his day job, he sells ink and toner online. But he has rapidly become something of an expert on the shutterbugs of old New York. The site frequently features Berenice Abbott (\u201ca legend,\u201d says Berkun), whose \u201cChanging New York\u201d series was commissioned by the WPA, and other well-known mid-century photographers, such as Ewing Galloway and the Life magazine staffers Margaret Bourke-White and Alfred Eisenstaedt. Still others, like P.L. Sperr and Eugene Armbruster, remain largely anonymous, so Berkun researches and writes short profiles of them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new Facebook trend is all about catching a glimpse of the past", "title": "Our old-timey addiction: Why we can\u2019t get enough of century-old images", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new Facebook trend is all about catching a glimpse of the past", "title": "Our old-timey addiction: Why we can\u2019t get enough of century-old images", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/14/our_old_timey_addiction_why_we_cant_get_enough_of_century_old_images/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/vintage_photo_dream_city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new Facebook trend is all about catching a glimpse of the past", "title": "Our old-timey addiction: Why we can\u2019t get enough of century-old images", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/vintage_photo_dream_city.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Albert Kahn, Dream City, Editor's Picks, Facebook, millennials, New York City, Photography", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8256\"", "article_summary": "Equipped with an early type of color film, Kahn\u2019s photographers journeyed to the jungles of the Amazon and Sub-Saharan Africa.\nThey demonstrated the extent to which old photographs of cities, like cat videos, have gained unforeseen popularity on the Internet.\nOn the Facebook page \u201cOld Images of New York,\u201d Todd Berkun posts black-and-white photographs of the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and street scenes that include bocce players and clam peddlers.\nParis in these images is at once familiar and foreign, a combination that enthralled the millions who saw these images when they circulated on blogs and social media last winter.\nPostcard-style images, like this anonymous 1931 photo of rainy trolley tracks glistening beneath the lights of Times Square, tend to perform the best."}
