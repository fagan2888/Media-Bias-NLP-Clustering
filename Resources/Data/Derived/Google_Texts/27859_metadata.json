But one of the nurseries is hoping to push that timeline forward.\n\n\n\nEven with licenses awarded, families waiting for low-THC marijuana could have to hold off until as late as September of next year. Under state deadlines, the growers must begin cultivation in 75 days and have a finished product 210 days after that. But Susan Driscoll of Alpha Foliage says they\u2019re hoping to expedite the process\u2014perhaps having cannabis ready sometime between April and June.\n\n\u201cWe will need to get permission from the Department of Health to begin cultivation,\u201d Driscoll says, \u201cand then of course there\u2019s a growth cycle for cannabis, so that can be anywhere from three to four months.\u201d\n\nDriscoll\u2019s nursery will sell the finished product through a subsidiary called Surterra Therapeutics. The company is planning stores in Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville and Tallahassee. But the path ahead may not be completely clear. The Department\u2019s licensing decisions can still be challenged in court, and with four of the five winning nurseries playing a major role in drafting the rules, that\u2019s not out of the question.\n\nBut regulated industries attorney Richard Blau says with two legal challenges already, it\u2019s not very likely.\n\n\u201cFrom everything that\u2019s been done, and all the information that\u2019s been released, it looks like the process that was ultimately agreed upon\u2014after judicial review, after rewriting\u2014has been followed properly,\u201d Blau says. \u201cSo in that sense I would hope that there wouldn\u2019t be any more legal challenges.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Department officials are confident their process will stand up to scrutiny if it comes to that. Driscoll says her operation is keeping its focus on the finish line.\n\n\u201cWell you know Surterra we\u2019re going to be the positive, glass is half full company,\" Driscoll says.\n\n\"So we think this is a great step today for the state of Florida and the patients, and like I said, we\u2019re going to work as quickly as possible to get the authority to cultivate, and then the authority to extract the product and then to distribute the product,\" she says. \"So we\u2019re thinking positive and we\u2019re pushing forward.\u201d\n\nDriscoll says her nursery has already begun construction on a facility to house the plants. They hope to begin planting before the end of the year.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Although the Department of Health has awarded licenses to grow cannabis, patients could still be waiting more than nine months for treatment.\u00a0 But one of", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/new-licensees-getting-work-marijuana-crops", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201511/457254665.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Although the Department of Health has awarded licenses to grow cannabis, patients could still be waiting more than nine months for treatment.\u00a0 But one of", "title": "New Licensees Getting To Work On Marijuana Crops"}, "story_id": 457254638, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Nick Evans", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "New Licensees Getting To Work On Marijuana Crops"}, "nid": 12789, "datePublished": "2015-11-25", "keywords": "medical marijauna, medical pot, medical marijuana nurseries", "wordCount": 524, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Even with licenses awarded, families waiting for low-THC marijuana could have to hold off until as late as September of next year.\nUnder state deadlines, the growers must begin cultivation in 75 days and have a finished product 210 days after that.\nAlthough the Department of Health has awarded licenses to grow cannabis, patients could still be waiting more than nine months for treatment.\nBut Susan Driscoll of Alpha Foliage says they\u2019re hoping to expedite the process\u2014perhaps having cannabis ready sometime between April and June.\n\"So we\u2019re thinking positive and we\u2019re pushing forward.\u201dDriscoll says her nursery has already begun construction on a facility to house the plants."}
