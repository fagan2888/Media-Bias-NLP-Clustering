It expects an increase of about 1 percent, which would be the lowest increase since 2010.\n\nIn some parts of the country such as the Pacific Coast, the hike in electricity prices in 2014 was much lower than the national average at 1.3 percent \u2013 while in New England, it was a whopping 9.9 percent.\n\nThe increase is due mostly to the electricity industry\u2019s major upgrades to its systems, especially to its transmission and distribution infrastructure. Higher wholesale power prices also contributed to the rise in retail prices as electricity providers pass the cost along to consumers.\n\nOther reasons include new requirements to generate electricity from renewable energy sources as dictated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nRelated: 8 Things That Will Get Cheaper in 2015\n\nThe EPA\u2019s proposed carbon rule and power plant regulations, for instance, will likely increase the cost of electricity and natural gas by nearly $300 million between 2012 and 2020, according to a study conducted by Energy Ventures Analysis and released in November.\n\nFor a typical U.S. household\u2019s annual electricity and natural gas bill, that increase will equal roughly $680, or 35 percent \u2013 and it will rise every year after as EPA regulations tighten.\n\nDespite such a gloomy outlook, it\u2019s not all bad news. Retail electricity prices have historically risen at a lower rate than inflation and the real price of electricity is actually lower than it was before 1995, the EIA says.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Your electricity bill is at the highest it\u2019s been in six years \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to go even higher this year.", "title": "Why Your Electricity Bill Keeps Going Up", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/17/Why-Your-Electricity-Bill-Keeps-Going", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Light-switch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/17/Why-Your-Electricity-Bill-Keeps-Going", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Light-switch.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Your electricity bill is at the highest it\u2019s been in six years \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to go even higher this year.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6f2d\"", "article_summary": "Retail electricity prices have historically risen at a lower rate than inflation and the real price of electricity is actually lower than it was before 1995, the EIA says.\nHigher wholesale power prices also contributed to the rise in retail prices as electricity providers pass the cost along to consumers.\nYour electricity bill is the highest it\u2019s been since 2008 \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to rise again this year.\nOther reasons include new requirements to generate electricity from renewable energy sources as dictated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe increase is due mostly to the electricity industry\u2019s major upgrades to its systems, especially to its transmission and distribution infrastructure."}
