The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act generally lets insurers limit coverage for screenings that the panel doesn\u2019t back. The law currently requires them to adhere to guidelines calling for women ages 40 and older to have mammograms every one to two years.\n\nThe panel is attempting to weigh the benefits and harms of screening for breast cancer. Because the disease becomes more common as women get older, the screening is most helpful for those over 50, the panel said.\n\nYounger women are significantly more likely to experience a false positive result and undergo additional procedures including biopsies to rule out a cancer that isn\u2019t present, said Michael LeFevre, the task force\u2019s past chairman. Others get treatment for conditions that would never harm them. The data show that mammograms would prevent 4 deaths for every 10,000 women ages 40 to 49 who undergo screening for a decade.\n\n\u201cThis is the best balance of benefits and harms,\u201d said LeFevre, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Medicine. \u201cBreast cancer is an uncommon disease for women in their 40s.\u201d The independent panel weighs medical evidence only, not costs.\n\nUnnecessary Treatment\n\nFalse positives, where women undergo additional procedures to rule out a suspicious finding on mammography, occur in 1,212 of every 10,000 women age 40 to 49, according to a report by the panel. About one in five women diagnosed based on mammography get treatment for a cancer that otherwise would have gone undetected or never caused health problems, according to the report.\n\nThe proposal is open for public comment through May 18, after which the task force will make a final recommendation.\n\n\u201cBecause USPSTF recommendations are often used by insurance companies and government programs to determine coverage, we are concerned that women and their health care providers will be deterred from screening that might be appropriate,\u201d said Judith Salerno, president of the Susan G. Komen breast cancer foundation. \u201cWorse yet, the recommendations may cause women under 50 to delay paying attention to their breast health and breast cancer risk.\u201d\n\nBenefits and Risks\n\nThe new guidelines overstate the harms of screening and understate the benefits, said Barbara Monsees, chairwoman of the American College of Radiology\u2019s Breast Imaging Commission. She said the guidelines could reduce coverage for the screening and discourage doctors from recommending mammograms.\n\nBecause the guidelines could affect insurance coverage, women who don\u2019t have the means to afford mammograms will be particularly affected, Monsees said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to unduly affect women who don\u2019t have the same sort of income and that\u2019s a very unfortunate consequence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to discourage screening.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s proposal is the same as the recommendation it made in 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was working its way through Congress. That recommendation proved so controversial that a provision of the Affordable Care Act effectively told insurers to ignore it. That provision doesn\u2019t apply to subsequent recommendations from the task force, which means insurers won\u2019t have to ignore the new proposal if it becomes final.\n\nCongress Reacts\n\nThe proposal drew immediate criticism on Monday from two senior Democrats in the House of Representatives.\n\nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, of Florida, said the recommendations would be \u201ca significant step in the wrong direction.\u201d \u201cAs a young breast cancer survivor, I strongly believe we need more, not less, preventive services,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said in an e-mailed statement.\n\n\u201cThe real issue is that far too few women receive mammograms at all,\u201d said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies. \u201cMammography is not perfect, but right now it is the best method we have to detect and treat breast cancer,\u201d said DeLauro, in an emailed statement.\n\nThe findings conflict with a recommendation from the American Cancer Society for annual mammograms starting at age 40, though the group is reviewing its recommendations, said Richard Wender, the group\u2019s chief cancer control officer.\n\nOutweighing Harms\n\nThe American Cancer Society thinks that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms at 40, and that women should discuss with doctors whether to undergo mammograms, he said. Most commercial insurers currently pay for annual mammograms, and the cancer group thinks that coverage should continue, he said.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood that commercial payers in any substantial number would withdraw funding is slight,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019d have a real backlash from their insured constituents.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc., Anthem Inc. and Aetna Inc., the nation\u2019s biggest insurers, currently cover mammograms for women 40 and up. Spokeswomen for Anthem and Aetna said the companies would review the task force\u2019s guidelines and decide whether to make any changes.\n\n\u201cBecause the recommendations are draft, nothing has changed as far as access to mammograms or other preventive services that insurers are required to cover with no cost sharing,\u201d the U.S. Health and Human Services Department said in a statement.\n\nThe panel said that women ages 40 to 49 should discuss with their doctors whether to get the screening, and gave the test a grade of C, meaning doctors should provide the service for selected patients based on individual circumstances. Women from 50 to 74 should get a mammogram every other year, according to the doctor panel, which gave that guideline a B rating. Insurers are required to cover screenings that have an A or B rating from the task force.\n\n\u201cWe are helping fewer women, and we are harming more, but the benefits still outweigh the risks by a small amount,\u201d said LeFevre, the past chairman of the task force. That\u2019s why the group recommended that women in their 40s make a decision about screening independently with their doctors. \u201cWe want women to have this knowledge.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer and Michelle Fay Cortez", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-20/mammogram-recommendation-threatens-to-reignite-screening-battle", "title": "Mammogram Proposal Threatens to Reignite Screening Battle", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "description": "A decision from a panel of U.S. doctors and health experts threatens to reignite the debate over how much breast cancer screening is appropriate, potentially opening the door for insurers to stop covering some mammograms."}, "parsely-author": "Zachary Tracer and Michelle Fay Cortez", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Cancer,Health,Women", "news_keywords": "Cancer,Health,Women", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-20/mammogram-recommendation-threatens-to-reignite-screening-battle", "parsely-title": "Mammogram Proposal Threatens to Reignite Screening Battle", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-20T21:00:00.004Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A decision from a panel of U.S. doctors and health experts threatens to reignite the debate over how much breast cancer screening is appropriate, potentially opening the door for insurers to stop covering some mammograms.", "parsely-tags": "Cancer,Health,Women,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-04-20T21:00:00.004Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-20/mammogram-recommendation-threatens-to-reignite-screening-battle", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "A decision from a panel of U.S. doctors and health experts threatens to reignite the debate over how much breast cancer screening is appropriate, potentially opening the door for insurers to stop covering some mammograms.", "title": "Mammogram Proposal Threatens to Reignite Screening Battle"}, "fb": {"status": "A decision from a panel of U.S. doctors and health experts threatens to reignite the debate over how much breast cancer screening is appropriate, potentially opening the door for insurers to stop covering some mammograms."}, "parsely-post-id": "NN3ZRS6KLVRQ01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc981f\"", "article_summary": "The panel is attempting to weigh the benefits and harms of screening for breast cancer.\nA decision from a panel of U.S. doctors and health experts threatens to reignite the debate over how much breast cancer screening is appropriate, potentially opening the door for insurers to stop covering some mammograms.\n\u201cBreast cancer is an uncommon disease for women in their 40s.\u201d The independent panel weighs medical evidence only, not costs.\n\u201cMammography is not perfect, but right now it is the best method we have to detect and treat breast cancer,\u201d said DeLauro, in an emailed statement.\nBecause the disease becomes more common as women get older, the screening is most helpful for those over 50, the panel said."}
