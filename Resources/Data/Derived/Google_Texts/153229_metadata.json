Peter Shumlin\u2019s chief of health care reform testified Wednesday in the House and challenged the veracity of a VTDigger story that said the state has been unhappy with its current Vermont Health Connect contractor and is negotiating with another company.\n\nLawrence Miller, the chief of health care reform, told lawmakers the state\u2019s former implementation expert on the exchange was not a \u201ctop official\u201d and that any frustration he expressed in emails was a normal part of negotiations.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that our procurement and contract management processes are by design adversarial,\u201d Miller told the House Health Care Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to get the best damn deal for Vermont in every case, and in so doing, there is friction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is also a need for a highly collaborative environment in performing that work,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are not in conflict. These are a normal aspect of the dynamic tension that you see in project management.\u201d\n\nVTDigger reported Sunday that Justin Tease, who left his job at the Department of Vermont Health Access on April 1, was hesitant to sign a reference for OptumInsight Inc., the lead contractor on Vermont Health Connect.\n\nIn a Feb. 16 email cited in Sunday\u2019s story, Tease wrote: \u201cI disagree with, \u2018Optum has successfully delivered on contractual obligations in a quality manner, by the identified due date, and within the agreed-upon budget.\u2019 There\u2019s a nuance of reality that is lost by this sentence.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Miller read the dictionary definition of \u201cnuance\u201d to the committee and said, \u201cI think that to say that a vendor who has put what they have on the table, I don\u2019t think global frustration is an appropriate expression.\u201d\n\nIn another email sent about a half-hour after the other Feb. 16 email, which is not included in the Sunday article, Tease said: \u201cNo way I\u2019m signing this. \u2026 Let\u2019s see what Lawrence says.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptum\u2019s performance came under similar scrutiny in April 2015, after Shumlin said the company \u201chas not only delivered earlier on all the challenges they\u2019ve been facing and tech they\u2019ve been developing, but they\u2019ve also done it for less money in every case.\u201d\n\nPublic records obtained from Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, a staunch critic of the Shumlin administration, revealed that the majority of work orders that Optum completed at the time were over budget, by more than $150,000 total.\n\nLawmakers are still considering how much money to devote to an independent review of Vermont Health Connect and whether to continue the power of the Department of Vermont Health Access, which oversees Vermont Health Connect, to make emergency rules.\n\nThe Legislature gave the department the power to make emergency rules in 2014 in order to comply with the Affordable Care Act and implement Vermont Health Connect. The power allows the department to bypass certain public notice procedures, among other things.\n\nThe emergency authority was scheduled to expire June 30. But the House inserted language into the budget bill, H.875, to extend the Agency of Human Services\u2019 authority to make emergency rules through June 30, 2017.\n\nThe Senate then took the language out of the budget bill. In conference committee, the House is now proposing to extend emergency rule-making powers through June 30, 2017, \u201cbut only in the event that new federal guidance or regulations require Vermont\u201d to change rules.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, MVP Health Care and Vermont Legal Aid all oppose the original extension. The Department of Vermont Health Access supports extending its power.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think they need it anymore,\u201d said Cory Gustafson, a lobbyist for Blue Cross. \u201cThe exchange has been around since 2014. We think that the public process that\u2019s part of full rule-making is productive, transparent and appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe department said in a statement: \u201cWhile this authority is rarely used, it is critical in ensuring that DVHA\u2019s administrative rules are in compliance with federal regulation,\u201d and without the authority, the department would be at \u201cunnecessary risk for state and federal audits and financial penalties for lack of compliance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "blue cross blue shield of vermont, health insurance, lawrence miller, optum, peter shumlin, vermont health connect, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to get the best damn deal for Vermont in every case, and in so doing, there is friction,\u201d said Lawrence Miller, the chief of health care reform for Gov.
