Not the U.S. military and certainly not President Obama\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize. Free trade trumps all. It improves countries, empowers people in other countries to create businesses and jobs, improves businesses in the U.S., and encourages freedom and liberty. The Arab Spring started when a Tunisian businessman self-immolated in 2010 because he wasn\u2019t allowed to sell his goods. It could even be argued the USSR fell in 1991 because of its expanded trade relations with the U.S. President Ronald Reagan certainly believed expanded trade was worth it because of the reforms done by then Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. From the June 1, 1988 Moscow summit:\n\nThe two sides reconfirmed their strong support for the expansion of mutually beneficial trade and economic relations and noted recent activity in this area. They reiterated their belief that commercially viable joint ventures complying with the laws and regulations of both countries could play a role in the further development of commercial relations. They welcomed the results of the meeting of the Joint U.S.-USSR Commercial Commission in April and noted with satisfaction that working groups had been created under the Commission to further the establishment of better conditions under which mutually advantageous trade can develop. Taking note of the 1974 Joint Statement and Protocol amending the Long-Term Agreement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to Facilitate Economic, Industrial and Technical Cooperation issued at the conclusion of the Joint Commercial Commission, they agreed that the Commission should continue to meet to build upon the forward momentum which has been generated.\n\nFree trade and free markets are even causing China to become more liberalized. Reason Magazine did a feature in 2011 on what the underground market and free trade has done to Wenzhou. Businessmen and private citizens took over road construction, banks, and more. Wenzhou has been able to avoid being dominated by the communists because of their location. It\u2019s a fantastic story on why free markets and free trade are awesome (emphasis mine):\n\nIn southern China, things look rather different. The Chinese say that in this region \u201cthe mountains are high and the emperor is far away\u201d\u2014in other words, the government isn\u2019t paying much attention. Companies are mainly small or medium-sized enterprises, government services are slight, and laws are routinely ignored\u2026The Wenzhounese have a reputation for both an uncanny sense of business and an almost pathological disregard for the government\u2026The Wenzhounese government received directives from Beijing but found that without accompanying support they lacked resources to run the economy by diktat. Fortunately, a central government that wasn\u2019t offering much support also wasn\u2019t paying much attention. So private citizens quietly took over many of the services that elsewhere are either provided or heavily regulated by the state. Local authorities, lacking other options, didn\u2019t try to stop them. The most important development in those early days was the city\u2019s flourishing underground financial system, which according to the local branch of the People\u2019s Bank of China (China\u2019s central bank) currently is used by 89 percent of Wenzhounese private citizens and 57 percent of local companies.\n\nThis is why the Trans Pacific Partnership is a massive headache. It ought to be a no brainer for free marketers to support: a free trade agreement involving 12 nations, with opposition coming from unions, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The devil is in the details and the lack of details is a big red flag. There\u2019s no transparency and TPP certainly seems to be more than \u201cjust\u201d trade. National Review is skeptical on TPP because of its secrecy:\n\nThe Obama administration, self-proclaimed epitome of openness and transparency, has conducted TPP negotiations largely in secret, with members of Congress permitted to review documents only in person in the office of the U.S. trade representative, without staff. Most of what the public knows about the negotiations has come through a series of releases from WikiLeaks. The level of secrecy here might be appropriate to missile-defense negotiations; it is excessive for a trade deal, especially one involving mostly free and open societies. The Obama administration has promised that the environmental aspects of the deal will be \u201cfully enforceable in the core of the TPP agreement, on equal footing with the economic obligations our trading partners take on.\u201d We can expect the same to be true of the labor and human-rights aspects of the deal \u2014 just as we can expect the Obama administration\u2019s policies in these areas to be as daft and dangerous as the White House\u2019s attitude toward environmental questions. And there surely will be a substantial bill for so-called trade-adjustment assistance, which purports to be a program for workers who are negatively affected by new trade deals but is in reality more of a political slush fund.\n\nNational Review also wants TPP to get a hearing in Congress because of the importance of trade and increased investment. Cato has a similar take with Daniel Ikenson pointing out Congress could always just vote it down.\n\nCongress and the public will have the opportunity to scrutinize the TPP for 60 days before the agreement is signed, up to another 135 days during the \u201cReporting and Mock Markup\u201d period, and up to another 90 days during the \u201cCongressional Consideration and Implementation\u201d period.\n\nIt\u2019s a good point to make, but not a good selling point. Ikenson\u2019s better argument is pointing out how the only way to know what\u2019s actually IN TPP is to pass Trade Promotion Authority and Trade Adjustment Assistance. But the big problem is whether Congress is willing to take the time to actually look at what\u2019s in the agreement. It isn\u2019t like Congress ever, ever had issues with reading bills before passing them (Obamacare).\n\nRepublican presidential candidates are certainly split on TPA/TAA. Rand Paul is against it:\n\nI\u2019m hesitant to give blanket authority on stuff we haven\u2019t seen. I\u2019m not saying there wouldn\u2019t be a time I could be for it, if I\u2019d seen the trade agreement, and it\u2019s fine. I still might vote for the trade agreement, but I hate giving up power. We give up so much power from Congress to the presidency, and with them being so secretive on the treaty, it just concerns me what\u2019s in the treaty.\n\nTed Cruz is in favor, and completely disagrees with Paul\u2019s interpretation of TPA:\n\nUnder the Constitution, there are two ways to make binding law: (1) through a treaty, ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, or (2) through legislation passed by a majority of both Houses of Congress. TPA employs the second constitutional path, as trade bills always have done. It has long been recognized that the Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause applies to trade bills, requiring the House of Representatives\u2019 involvement.\n\nBoth know what\u2019s in TPP because they\u2019ve looked at the text. Both are publicly saying they haven\u2019t decided on whether it\u2019s worth approving. It\u2019s a pretty smart strategy because there\u2019s no point in tipping hands. But both Paul and Cruz note the negotiations are still going on. This is a big problem. There\u2019s no reason to fast track TPP if the final language isn\u2019t finished. It\u2019d be like declaring victory in the Iran negotiations when nothing has been agreed to.\n\nOh\u2026wait\u2026\n\nThe reality is it should be simpler to reach free trade agreements with other nations. America should be able to call Japan and say, \u201cWe want to trade freely with you,\u201d with Japan replying, \u201cOkay sure!\u201d or \u201cNo, we want tariffs.\u201d The same with Taiwan, Australia, Brunei, Malaysia, New Zealand, or any of the other countries involved in TPP. The secrecy about it is disturbing. It\u2019s frustrating and lends itself to conspiracy theories which may or may not be true. The conservative/libertarian support of TPP makes sense because it\u2019s free trade and the concern about China\u2019s involvement in the region. The conservative/libertarian opposition to it makes sense because of the possibility it could hurt more than help. TPP is a big mess. The only way to actually solve the problem is to wait until negotiations are done before deciding whether to sign it. The alternative is to make free trade agreements with all the other nations to avoid the TPP headache, which may actually be the best way to go about it.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "TPP is still an awful mess", "title": "Free trade is America\u2019s best weapon", "url": "http://hotair.com/tpp-is-still-an-awful-mess/2015/06/14/free-trade-is-americas-best-weapon/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-14T15:01:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-14T19:22:28+00:00"}, "keywords": "Congress, free trade, Obama, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, tpp,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc74d\"", "article_summary": "Free trade is America\u2019s best weaponposted at 11:01 am on June 14, 2015 by Taylor MillardFree trade is America\u2019s greatest weapon.\nFree trade and free markets are even causing China to become more liberalized.\nIt\u2019s a fantastic story on why free markets and free trade are awesome (emphasis mine):In southern China, things look rather different.\nReason Magazine did a feature in 2011 on what the underground market and free trade has done to Wenzhou.\nThe conservative/libertarian support of TPP makes sense because it\u2019s free trade and the concern about China\u2019s involvement in the region."}
