SARASOTA â€” Andrew LeRoux, the Sarasota Scullers athlete that competed at the junior world championships last summer, started the 2015 season with a gold medal at the Southern Sprints Indoor Regatta in Melbourne, Florida.

The Pine View School junior defeated a field of 103 competitors in the mens heavyweight division, completing 2,000 meters on a rowing machine in 6:06.60. The next rower, Derek Martin, of South Orlando, was 15 seconds behind him, clocking in at 6:21.90. This is the second consecutive year that LeRoux has won his division in the sprint event. He took gold in 2014 with a time of 6:19.10, several months before he was named to the United States junior national team.

LeRoux's win earned him a free ticket to the C.R.A.S.H.-B. Sprints competition this March in Boston. The event is considered the largest indoor regatta in the world.
