But as our population ages, so too do our physicians. More than half of the surgeons who cover emergency rooms are over 50. And although they are some of the most productive physicians, they are being overloaded and overstressed, and are beginning to burn out. Many are retiring early; others are dramatically reducing their patient loads. Recent surveys suggest up to 60 percent of physicians are preparing to do one or the other within two years.\u201d\n\nAre you prepping for hard times ahead? Make sure \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown\u201d by Dr. Lee Hieb is part of your survival library.\n\nYet, the problems evident today, she says, represent the tip of the iceberg headed for the kind of medical care to which Americans have become accustomed.\n\n\u201cThe one certainty? Things will be getting much worse because the current system is unsustainable \u2013 either in manpower or in dollars and cents,\u201d she explains.\n\nHieb doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time in her book explaining how Obamacare will lead to this tipping point. Instead, \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown\u201d is written to prepare Americans to make it through the coming crisis \u2013 from insurance issues, getting the most from your doctor\u2019s visits, how to avoid unhealthy foods and toxins that can make you sick and stockpiling the most important medical supplies for yourself and your family.\n\nThe one place to which Hieb argues Americans should not look for medical help is the government.\n\n\u201cAs the current medical system collapses of its own internal inconsistencies, people who have been conditioned to look to government for solutions will predictably look to the federal government for help,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd government being government will never ignore the chance of using a crisis to further its agenda of power and growth. But let\u2019s look around us. How has government done in the fields of education, banking, the post office or the DMV?\u201d\n\nShe answers her own question: \u201cSingle-source medical care is lousy. The longer such a system exists, the worse it becomes. By the time the Berlin Wall fell and we could peek into the world of Soviet medicine, for example, 57 percent of Soviet hospitals had no hot water, and 36 percent had no running water at all. There were dead cats lying in the hallways, and a legion of babies were exposed to HIV because needles were reused without sterilization.\u201d\n\nOne of the first signs of collapse of the medical system, Hieb says, will be hospital closings. And that is already happening, as WND previously reported.\n\nIn 2013, 18 acute-care hospitals across the United States shut their doors in 2013. In 2014, at least 12 more hospitals closed in rural areas alone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The signs are everywhere of an imminent \u201ccatastrophic collapse\u201d of the U.S. health-care system that will leave Americans clamoring for medical attention, medical supplies and hospital care, says the former president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
