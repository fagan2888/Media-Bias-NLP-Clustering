Hundreds of sweaty and out of breath people gathered in Meridian Saturday morning.

Meridian High School played host to MPSD's “Race for the Future” which was a 5K race, a two mile walk and a kid's fun run. The winner of the 5K race was Johnny Trotter who had a time of 18:38. Trotter says he's been a member of the cross country team for one year, but he has run track and field since he was in sixth grade.

"This one had a lot of hills so I had to use a lot of my endurance. My coach came up on me last minute so I had to push myself, so it was a good race, we had good competition, and we did it for a good cause,” Trotter says.

The race was focused on dropout prevention.
