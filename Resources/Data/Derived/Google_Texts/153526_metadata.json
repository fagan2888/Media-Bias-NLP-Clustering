Mindfulness meditation has been linked to lower emotional and chemical stress levels; the ability to ease depression and anxiety; and reduced arthritis pain, asthma, risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, and cardiovascular disease. But with respect to that last one, just being mindful may be enough to reap heart-healthy benefits.\n\nA new study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine found a significant association between something called dispositional mindfulness and improved scores on four of the seven indicators of cardiovascular health. According to the American Heart Association, those indicators relate to blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, height, weight, and waist circumference, plus eating and exercise habits. This is the first study to ever consider these factors in regards to heart health.\n\n\u201cMostly [mindfulness has] been looked at for mental health and pain management, but increasingly they are being looked at for cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and blood pressure,\u201d said Dr. Eric Loucks, lead study author and assistant professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health at Brown University, in a press release.\n\nLoucks and his team asked 382 participants to rate on a six-point scale, ranging from \"almost always\" to \"almost never,\" 15 statements from the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), including \u201cI find it difficult to stay focused on what\u2019s happening in the present\u201d and \u201cI tend not to notice feelings of physical tension or discomfort until they really grab my attention.\u201d While doing this, participants also took heart-related tests to gauge the aforementioned indicators.\n\nThe results? Participants who scored high on the MAAS had an 83 percent greater prevalence of cardiovascular health compared to those who scored lower. There were especially major differences when factoring for body mass index, physical activity, glucose, and smoking. Loucks suggested being more mindful of, and managing, the various cravings that undermine health, from sugary foods to cigarettes, as leading to improved cardiovascular health. Loucks\u2019 next steps are to test whether improving mindfulness can increase cardiovascular health indicators and if the effects are long lasting.\n\nWhat\u2019s really cool about mindfulness is that it can be done simply, everyday. It doesn\u2019t require seminars, or long hours, or yoga even (though that\u2019s a super-healthy option to consider). Mindfulness is whatever you want it to be, whatever way works best for you. It\u2019s not one-size fits all, but rather it can be an individualized approach based on, say, personality, so that people feel comfortable with their practice.\n\nDr. Ann S. Williams, research assistant professor at Frances Payne Bolton\u2019s School of Nursing, says that drinking tea is a very simple way to practice mindfulness. \u201cA person sipping tea in the usual way may be aware of holding the cup, smelling the aroma before the first sip, and the taste of the first sip,\u201d she said. \u201cThe experience of drinking the rest of the tea may blend into one single experience that has to do with noticing the decreasing amount of tea in the cup.\u201d\n\nNot your, ahem, cup of tea? Consider apps like Calm and Headspace. These apps allow users to follow guided meditations for however long they want, be it five or 10 minutes, or more. Headspace in particular challenges users to take 10 minutes each day in order to unlock additional meditations that benefit everything from anxiety to sleep.\n\nSource: Loucks E, Britton W, Howe C, Eaton C, Buka S.
