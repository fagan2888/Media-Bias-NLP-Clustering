On December 18, at Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s urging, 150 House Republicans voted to double down on the politics of surrender.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nYesterday, we thought we had two parties, Republicans and Democrats, but now we see that we have only one, the Repubocrat Party, the party of No Shame.\n\nIn the upcoming 2016 election, you can vote for the candidate of your choice, and it won\u2019t matter. Government growth is on autopilot and the expansion of an imperial federal government will continue, whether we elect Democrats or Republicans.\n\nRepublicans will talk about smaller government, but no one is fooled: they won\u2019t actually DO anything about it.\n\nRepublicans will talk about border security, sanctuary cities, and five million visa overstays, but they won\u2019t DO anything to alter the status quo.\n\nRepublicans will talk about reining in an out-of-control EPA, but they won\u2019t pass any funding controls to change EPA behavior.\n\nThe Repubocrats\u2019 federal budget abandons every promise made to Republican voters. Against criticism, they chant, \u201cObama made me do it!\u201d while cowardly refusing to send Obama any bill worthy of his disdain.\n\nFolks, the zombies are not on television, they are in Washington, D.C., and they meet at the Capitol Hill Club and call themselves \u201cRealists.\u201d They are now celebrating their singular 2015 accomplishment: they avoided a government shutdown! Instead, they chose a shoot down: they have killed the spirit of accountability and hollowed out the meaning of representative government.\n\nThe Republican majority in the House and Senate chose to surrender control of the budget to the Obama White House, producing a gargantuan spending plan that makes Nancy Pelosi smile.\n\nThe $1.1 trillion Obama-Ryan budget will result in another deficit of over $400 billion dollars, with expenditures and grant programs for every special interest group lined up at the federal trough.\n\nThe 2009-page bill was unveiled at 2:00 AM on Wednesday morning and then adopted by roll call vote only two days later. How many members read it? THAT kind of cynical chicanery was supposed to end.\n\nIt continues almost all of the subsidies and slush funds of the prior budget, like the 30% solar energy investment tax credit, tax breaks for race horses and film productions, while dropping over 150 restrictions on spending that were in the House-passed budget resolution.\n\nDropped from the bill at White House insistence was the ban on funding of Planned Parenthood, a prohibition of EPA\u2019s unconstitutional expansion of carbon emission rules never authorized by Congress, and a rollback of Obama\u2019s takeover of local zoning under an illegal expansion of the Fair Housing Act.\n\nNot a single one of Obama\u2019s several unconstitutional executive actions was defunded.\n\nThe bill expands the number of low-wage workers brought into the country as guest workers, guest workers who never go home because no one is enforcing the visa expiration dates.\n\nThe bill also expands the number of Muslim immigrants and refugees to nearly 300,000 annually.\n\nIt allows DHS to tap into a $1.6 billion \u201crefugee resettlement\u201d pot to house and then \u201cresettle\u201d the tens of thousands of \u201cUnaccompanied Children\u201d crossing our southwest border.\n\nThey brag about a 2-year delay in the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on employer-sponsored health care plans, when it should have been repealed outright, not delayed. And, of course, there is no rollback of Obamacare itself. That will have to wait\u2026and wait\u2026.and wait.\n\nIf you listen carefully and decode the Beltway rhetoric, the apology offered by Republican leaders amounts to a confessional:\n\nFulfilling commitments to K-street lobbyists is more important than keeping promises to the voters who elected us. Voters have preferences, but lobbyists have checkbooks. If you expect us to repeal slush funds and illegal regulatory mandates for the sake of principle, you\u2019re living in a different world.\n\nFolks, talk of a third political party is pass\u00e9. America doesn\u2019t need a third party, it needs a second party, one with a pulse and a backbone. A brain would be nice, too.\n\nRush Limbaugh got it dead right when he said after the new budget was unveiled, \u201cWe don\u2019t even need a Republican Party if they\u2019re gonna do this. Just disband the Republican party.\u201d\n\nIt has become painfully obvious that the only thing that will change the Republican Party\u2019s direction is the forced retirement of a few dozen \u201cparty leaders\u201d \u2014 beginning, yes, with Speaker Paul Ryan. The GOP establishment didn\u2019t learn the lesson with Eric Cantor\u2019s defeat in 2014, so in 2016, we need to \u201cgo big.\u201d Purge the leadership or disband the thing and build something new from scratch.\n\nPaul Ryan wants his weekends free? Fine, let\u2019s give him all 365 days free.\n\nRyan says, quite literally, \u201cI inherited a mess; next year will be different. Trust me on that.\u201d Sure, \u201ctrust me,\u201d and I have a bridge in the Mohave Desert you can have at a bargain price.\n\nAs for myself, I left the GOP two months ago and am now an independent. But, to paraphrase our elected dictator, I have a phone and a pen and a political action committee, \u201cTEAM AMERICA PAC.\u201d I will try to raise a million dollars to help take out some of the 150 Republicans who betrayed our country by rubber stamping a plan for accelerating our slide into socialism, bankruptcy and chaos.\n\nThere is work to be done. Conservatives and constitutionalists must find and support good candidates to replace the current congressional leadership \u2014 in Republican primaries where that is possible, or as independent challengers where necessary.\n\nTo those who warn that this will lead to loss of the House majority, there is an easy answer. What difference does it make?\n\nWe can do better; we must do better.
