That means students must pass 36 reading tests that take 30 minutes each to complete during the spring semester, in addition to other formative and summative assessments that already take place during the school year.\n\n\u2018At least two of these kids are actually reading on grade level,\u2019 said Tavares, who is administering portfolio assessments to about half of the kids in her class \u2013 the other half have already demonstrated proficiency. \u2018But they\u2019re not good test takers. They\u2019re stressed out. They\u2019re distracted. They\u2019re exhausted.\u2019\n\n\u2018Some of my students are so tired of these exams, they aren\u2019t even reading the passages anymore. They\u2019re just circling answers and immediately handing the tests back to me,\u2019 she said.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8efc\"", "article_summary": "With portfolio assessments, students must demonstrate mastery of the state\u2019s 12 reading standards by successfully passing three tests of reading comprehension for each standard.\nThey\u2019re exhausted.\u2019\u2018Some of my students are so tired of these exams, they aren\u2019t even reading the passages anymore.\nSo districts like Charlotte-Mecklenberg and Wake decided to begin administering portfolio assessments in the spring semester to all third graders who hadn\u2019t already scored proficient in reading on their BOGs [Beginning of Grade tests].\nThey\u2019re just circling answers and immediately handing the tests back to me,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\u2018At least two of these kids are actually reading on grade level,\u2019 said Tavares, who is administering portfolio assessments to about half of the kids in her class \u2013 the other half have already demonstrated proficiency."}
