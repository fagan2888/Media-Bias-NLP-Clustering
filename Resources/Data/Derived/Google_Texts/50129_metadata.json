We kick off this series today:\n\nFrederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research, HSBC, Hong Kong:\n\nInvestors are in a cheery mood. After all the turmoil of the past year, the hope is that 2014 is shaping up to be better: Tapering is out of the bag, stronger growth in the West should give a nice lift to Asian exports and China seems to be getting serious about reform.\n\nAlas, we\u2019ve been here before: For the past three years, markets expected faster growth than Asia delivered. Could it happen again?\n\nPossibly. Risks are finely balanced. With the region\u2019s growth already near a decade low, an even bigger slip-up \u2013 as many feared over the course of 2013 \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear to be in the cards. On the other hand, a sharp pick-up also appears unlikely. More likely is that Asia will continue to deliver steady but disappointing growth in 2014.\n\nMy main themes for 2014:\n\n\u2013Inflation \u2013 or the lack thereof. A striking feature over the past two years, and one likely to become more pronounced in 2014, is the collapse in nominal GDP growth. While investors usually pin their attention on consumer inflation, which mostly has remained within central banks\u2019 comfort ranges, broader price pressures have fallen rapidly. Excess capacity in some economies, along with sub-trend growth in most, is largely to blame.\n\nThis raises two problems. The first is that profit growth suffers. Over the past several years, margins have been squeezed amid slowing productivity gains. Capital spending could thus take a hit, curtailing GDP growth further even if, over the longer term, restrained investment should help restore corporate profitability. The second problem is financial: Slowing nominal GDP growth impairs the debt-servicing capacity of governments, households and companies alike. With leverage increasing sharply in recent years and growth still dependent on a further increase in debt, the risks are evident.\n\n\u2013Higher interest rates. Weaker cash flow and higher debt expose emerging Asia to a possible spike in funding costs. Markets have taken the Fed tapering decision well so far, buying the region more time to get its house in order before the actual tightening begins. The biggest risk to Asia is if unexpectedly strong U.S. economic performance forces the Fed to act more aggressively. Then, higher interest rates would not be offset, as optimists argue, by faster shipments: Right now, rates matter more to Asia than exports.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all about the Fed. In China, interest rates have continued to climb in recent months, reflecting officials\u2019 desire to restrain the build-up in debt. Even if the climb in market rates exaggerates the general rise in funding costs to some extent \u2014 not least because credit is shifting back to banks and away from more costly shadow financing \u2014 the process could present a headwind to more speculative parts of the economy. In India and Indonesia, too, officials may need to tweak rates higher if stubborn price pressures in the former, and the trade deficit in the latter, don\u2019t show swift improvement.\n\n\u2013The role of Japan will prove critical in all of this. With the risk of higher interest rates posing challenges for the leverage cycle in emerging Asia, liquidity injected by the Japanese central bank should have a stabilizing effect. Expectations of surging capital flows to emerging Asia ran high after the BOJ\u2019s surprise announcement last April that it would double its monetary base within two years. But between taper jitters and a soaring equity market at home, Japanese investors ultimately stayed quiet.\n\nThat likely will change during 2014, with Japanese banks already moving to expand market share in many ASEAN economies and foreign direct investment by Japanese manufacturers rising briskly. That could go a long way toward cushioning the region against higher dollar rates. But here, too, questions remain: An early disappointment with Abenomics could lead Japanese firms to scotch expansion plans, while BOJ liquidity may not be sufficient to offset another sharp jump in U.S. dollar funding costs. It\u2019s a fine balance for emerging Asia.\n\n\u2013Politics, and the impact on the reform agenda. Slower economic growth, declining productivity growth and rising financial risks point to the need for far-reaching structural reforms to put Asia\u2019s economies on a more sustainable path. This requires political determination. In India, Indonesia, and Thailand, however, looming elections may sap the appetite for reform. In Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, governments will need to reassure investors that hard choices will be tackled.\n\nChina, at last, has rolled out an impressive agenda and appears determined to press on. But this raises another risk: Not only does it take time for reforms to yield results, but their implementation can at first prove disruptive to growth. Cutting back on subsidies, scaling back excessive investment, raising the cost of funding and putting public financing on a sounder footing may initially retard growth before launching the economy toward a brighter future.\n\nIn short, 2014 may be the year when difficult decisions are finally taken. But don\u2019t expect growth to surge ahead just yet.\n\n\u2013Compiled by Michael S.
