My sunday column is about the way the dearth of mental health services ends up propelling people with psychiatric disorders into prisons and jails, so that today many more mentally ill people are behind bars than in psychiatric hospitals. This column arose out of my earlier invitation to readers to suggest topics that we in journalism should cover more aggressively in 2014. I suggested that one of these is mental health issues, which I wrote about generally last month, and this is a follow-up. Iâ€™d welcome your thoughts on this.
