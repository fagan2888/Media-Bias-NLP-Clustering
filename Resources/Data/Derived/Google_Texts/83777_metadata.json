After a lengthy break, lawmakers in the Illinois House are back in session today and, with the primary behind them, after 10 months of not having a budget, upon facing a human services crisis and threats of higher ed closures and repeated credit rating downgrades, lawmakers are finally prepared to \u2026 take up fantasy sports betting.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTo be fair, also on the list for action today: banning drones that could deliver prison contraband.\n\nAccording to the AP, there is a long list of potential legislation for committee action on the docket, but solving the budget crisis is not among them.\n\nAP: \u201cThe Illinois House returns to action Monday with a long list of legislation slated for committee hearings \u2014 but none about the unsettled budget that should have taken effect last July. Bills up for consideration include regulation of daily fantasy sports betting and easing access to police video under the Freedom of Information Act. There is a bill requiring warning labels on medicinal marijuana to provide buyers information about side effects of marijuana use. Other legislation would criminalize cyberbullying by parents, ban drone flights when they could potentially deliver prison contraband. A little over eight weeks remains in the scheduled spring session, and Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the Legislature remain deadlocked on spending priorities and how to close a massive deficit.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Ya0BeN\n\nTHEY\u2019RE BAAAAAACK -- \u201cStatehouse Insider: Nice to see you again, let's have a chat,\" by State Journal-Register\u2019s Doug Finke: \u201cBoth the House and Senate will be back in Springfield this week after taking some time off to rest up from the furious pace of the first couple of months of 2016. The Senate is coming back from a two-week break, while the House will return from a month off that\u2019s been the subject of a fair amount of criticism from Gov. Bruce Rauner and Republicans in the legislature.\u201d http://bit.ly/233Zy71\n\nSome of the latest issues to come to light:\n\nSTATE\u2019S ARMORED CAR \u2018FOUL-UP\u2019 RAISES SECURITY, MONEY ISSUES -- \u201cIll. budget mess implicates safety with armored-pickup halt,\u201d by AP's John O'Connor: \"After four months hauling cash from Illinois driver\u2019s facilities without payment from the state, an armored-truck company walked last fall, leaving the job to police officers who work for the secretary of state. Montreal-based GardaWorld's trucks started rolling again after the state paid the overdue $79,000 amid a record budget standoff. But that only covered work through last Friday, so almost as quickly as the mess was resolved, the state could find itself in the same predicament again. While the state's 10-month deadlock has forced deep spending cuts on human services and education programs, the armored car foul-up has raised security and efficiency implications for the state's handling of many thousands of dollars.\u201d http://bit.ly/1PPYYgi\n\nNO MONEY TO PAY FOR BIG CHANGES AT DCFS -- \u201cTroubled DCFS outlines major overhaul, but budget crisis could hurt plans,\" by Chicago Tribune's Duaa Eldeib: \"In an ambitious effort to repair Illinois' beleaguered child welfare system, state officials have laid out a wide-ranging reform plan that includes extensive worker retraining, expanded access to mental health services and a substantial reduction in the number of juvenile wards in residential treatment centers. The plan by the state Department of Children and Family Services comes at the behest of a federal judge and a court-appointed panel of experts who concluded that an urgent, sweeping transformation of the embattled agency is necessary \u2014 an effort the state\u2019s lingering budget stalemate could undermine, even with a court order protecting the agency's funding.\u201d http://trib.in/1PQ24Rr\n\nSPEAKER SPOX ACCUSES RAUNER OF HAVING \u2018IMAGINARY FRIENDS\u2019 -- \u201cBernard Schoenburg: Rauner: 'Dozens' of businesses on way, if only,\u201d State Journal-Register: \u201cGov. Bruce Rauner apparently knows of a bunch of companies ready to come to Illinois, if only the majority party in the General Assembly would give him some of what he wants. 'I\u2019ve been traveling the nation, lookin\u2019 for companies to come,' Republican Rauner said last week at the AutoZone distribution center in Danville. \u2018I\u2019ve got dozens of \u2019em ready to come. They said, \u2018Governor, can you change the regulations and get the government so it stops running these deficits and is actually workin\u2019 for the people of this state? If you could do that, I\u2019ll come.\u2019 \u2026\n\nQuestions about recruiting trips -- \u201cRauner often speaks ill of the big city\u2019s political pull, though he has a couple of condos in a building there. He also lives in the Executive Mansion in Springfield, and his Winnetka home remains his voting address. \u2018He seems to be talking about recruiting trips,\u2019 said Madigan spokesman STEVE BROWN, of the governor\u2019s Danville comments. \u2018I\u2019m not aware of any of those, are you? That sounds like another instance of the governor and his imaginary friends at work.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1RWl6gv\n\nKEEP PEOPLE IN DARK, MAKE MONEY -- \u201cIllinois Late License Plate Fees Near $5M Without Reminders,\u201d NBC Chicago: \u201cThanks to the cash-strapped state\u2019s decision to stop mailing renewal reminders, Illinois motorists have paid nearly $5 million this year for failing to renew vehicle license plates on time, more than double the amount collected in the same three-month span last year. Fines reached $1.9 million in March alone, according to the latest figures provided to The Associated Press on Friday by the secretary of state's office. In March 2015, the state collected just more than $818,000 in fines.\u201d http://bit.ly/25Fv8GM\n\nRAUNER, RAHM TARGETS IN CTU WALKOUT -- \u201cCTU ends one-day strike with downtown rally,\" by Catalyst Chicago: \u201cThousands of Chicago Teachers Union members took to the streets today for a one-day strike that sought to connect the financial troubles at Chicago Public Schools with the broader impacts of the state-wide budget impasse on low-income families, particularly in regards to higher education. The strike \u2014 which CPS officials have asked a state labor board to declare illegal \u2014 effectively shut down the school system, forcing parents to find alternative care for their children for the second Friday in a row. A week ago the cash-strapped district cancelled school in order to furlough workers and save money.\" http://bit.ly/1pYsYkW\n\nRAUNER CALLS WALKOUT \u2018HEIGHT OF ARROGANCE\u2019 -- Chicago Tribune: \u201cRauner \u2014 a primary target of hours of protests throughout the city \u2014 denounced the CTU's strike as the 'height of arrogance.' CPS and CTU agree on a need for help from Springfield. But so far there has been no consensus, publicly anyway, on legislation that would increase funding to the district. The dispute is less about whether to spend more money on education \u2014 Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Rauner and state lawmakers generally agree that schools should be better funded \u2014 than it is about how to achieve a funding increase.\u201d http://trib.in/1SLX0lq\n\nWelcome to the POLITICO Illinois Playbook.

Rep. Dwight Kay said the goal is to treat medical marijuana like other prescription drugs that warn patients about possible adverse effects. His bill, which is up for a House committee vote Monday, doesn't specify what warnings should be on the products, leaving it to the state health department to decide. But Kay said he would like to see warnings about how marijuana can cause drowsiness and impaired driving, and that it can affect pregnancies.\u201d http://bit.ly/239It81\n\nMEDICAL POT TRIUMPH -- \u201cMarijuana extract reduced seizures in kids with epilepsy: study,\u201d by Chicago Tribune\u2019s Robert McCoppin: \u201cA marijuana extract significantly reduced seizures in severely epileptic children, according to a landmark study conducted in part at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Supporters said the results greatly improve the chances for the drug, called Epidiolex, to win eventual approval by federal regulators for prescription use to treat Dravet syndrome, a debilitating type of epilepsy that strikes in early childhood. The drug would be the first derived from the marijuana plant to win such approval \u2026\n\n100 days without a seizure: \u201cIn the case of one patient in the trial at Lurie, 5-year-old Caleb Yunk, the disease has not been as severe but caused chronic seizures that led to difficulties with skills such as running, jumping and balancing \u2026 In the trial, Caleb swallowed about 3 milligrams of a strawberry-flavored syrup twice a day. Once he started treatment, his parents said, the Milwaukee-area boy went 100 days without a seizure, and those he did have lasted less than half as long. Because Caleb's seizures can be triggered by overheating, his parents had kept him indoors on hot days but on the drug, he showed enough progress to go swimming with his friends.\u201d http://trib.in/1PQcDE1\n\nCITY\n\nHOW THE MAYOR SPENDS HIS TIME -- \u201cRahm\u2019s meeting skeds show juggling act in, out of City Hall,\u201d by Chicago Sun-Times' Fran Spielman: \u201cIn the three-week run-up to his stunning selection of a new police superintendent, Mayor Rahm Emanuel juggled Chicago\u2019s pension, policing and school funding crises with a heavy dose of image building. Mayoral schedules, released in response to a Freedom of Information request by the Chicago Sun-Times, show the daily balancing act that factors into how the mayor chooses to spend his time, whom he spends that time with and even the restaurants where he chooses to dine with \u2018a friend,\u2019 as the records put it.\"\n\nWhere Rahm dines, with \u2018a friend\u2019: \u201cLunches, dinners and drinks \u2018with a friend\u2019 were held at an array of restaurants that included Cochon Volant, Chicago Cut, Vivo, Coco Pazzo, Picolo Sogno Due, Beatrix, Swift and Sons, The Gage, Cherry Circle at the Chicago Athletic Club, the Standard Club, and at the Allium Bar at the Four Seasons Hotel. In an apparent attempt to rehabilitate Emanuel\u2019s public image, the three-week schedule is sprinkled with loads of media interviews and meetings with unidentified reporters labeled \u2018OTR\u2019 or off the record.\u201dhttp://bit.ly/1qifRf8\n\nBESIDES NOT OWNING A CAR? -- \u201cHow to get out of a ticket in Chicago,\u201d by Time Out Chicago\u2019s Clayton Guse: \u201cOwning a car in Chicago can be a pretty expensive luxury. Between the cost of a city sticker, high gas prices and annual maintenance to fix the damage that comes with winter, driving in Chicago can cost an arm and a leg. When you tack on hundreds of dollars in parking and red light camera tickets, you're probably better off selling your vehicle.\" http://bit.ly/1RyH4UP\n\nCHICAGO\u2019S CRISIS OF VIOLENCE\n\nCHICAGO JUMP IN KILLINGS \u2018EXTREME\u2019 COMPARED TO OTHER CITIES -- \u201cChicago\u2019s staggering rise in gun violence and killings,\u201d by Washington Post's Mark Berman: Violence is occurring at levels unseen for years. In the first quarter of 2016, 141 people were killed, up from 82 last year ... shootings surged to 677 from 359 a year earlier \u2026 The department says most of the increase in violence stems from gang members using illegally acquired guns and is largely geographically clustered around the city\u2019s southern and western portions. (The city has also reported spikes in other crime categories across the board, including sexual assaults, robberies, batteries and thefts.) ...\n\nOther cities not as extreme; NYC murders down -- \u201cThis year is on track to far outpace the city\u2019s number of killings in 2015, which is a particularly worrisome fact considering that Chicago had more murders that year than any other city in the United States, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Other large cities that saw increases in killings last year have not seen jumps as extreme as Chicago\u2019s this year. The Los Angeles Police Department said that as of last week, there had been 67 homicides, up from 54 last year. Philadelphia said it had 63 homicide victims through Thursday, up from 62 a year ago. In New York, police reported a decrease \u2014 60 murders as of March 20, down from 75 a year earlier.\u201d http://wapo.st/1ZXTCah\n\nDID SELFIE VIDEO RECORD MAN\u2019S OWN SHOOTING? -- \u201cDoes a Video Glimpse Into Chicago\u2019s Year of Violence?\" by New York Times' Monica Davey: \u201cAs the video begins, a man in a baseball cap and sweatshirt is on a street, moving in a circle as he talks into a camera he seems to be holding. Suddenly the sounds of pops, one after the next, interrupt. The camera flips to different views, then lands face up, pointed to the sky, as a gunman steps into clear view, still shooting. It is a jarring, disturbing, highly cinematic video, and the police are trying to determine whether it really is what it looks like: a selfie video that inadvertently recorded the man\u2019s own shooting. Since it emerged Thursday night, the video has taken off on social media.\" http://nyti.ms/1SLUuvM\n\nTHOSE WHO TAUGHT CHICAGO\u2019S FINEST -- \u201cWATCHDOGS: 2 Koschman cops led training while under investigation,\u201d by Chicago Sun-Times' Tim Novak and Chris Fusco: \u201cSgt. Samuel Cirone is fighting a one-year suspension from the Chicago Police Department over his role in the creation of a bogus police report that shielded former Mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s nephew from criminal charges in the death of David Koschman. Lt. Denis P. Walsh \u2014 who was once accused of sexually assaulting a gas station clerk in Michigan and ended up pleading guilty to lesser charges \u2014 admitted stashing Koschman case files at his Northwest Side bungalow.

As word of the incidents spread via social media, neighbors called the violence \u2018horrifying\u2019 and \u2018out of control\u2019 and expressed fear for how much worse things might get during the warmer summer months.\u201d http://dnain.fo/1UCiLaP\n\nNATION\n\n2 OF 5 FEMALE MANAGERS DON\u2019T SEE ROOM TO GROW IN THEIR JOBS -- \u201cBest places to work for women,\u201d by Crain's Cassi Walker Burke and Sabrina Gasulla: \"A new survey commissioned by Crain's and executive women's group the Chicago Network reveals a startling statistic: Of the 1,000-plus women who took the survey, 42 percent voluntarily left positions within the past five years because they didn\u2019t feel recognized and didn\u2019t see opportunities for advancement.

Labor organizers say they're planning another day of strikes and protests exclusively targeting McDonald's stores in dozens of cities on April 14, following similar demonstrations outside a variety of fast-food restaurants a year ago. The move is intended to build on a campaign to lift wages and revitalize union enrollment by spotlighting working conditions at the world's biggest hamburger chain. Already, a wave of demonstrations that began in New York City in late 2012 has made low pay a major political issue and helped spur the passage of higher local minimum wages around the country.\" http://trib.in/1UOzgRA\n\nTRUMP\u2019s NATO VETO -- \u201cDonald Trump Defends Proposals to Deconstruct U.S. Military Treaty With Europe,\" by Wall Street Journal's Reid J.

The Republican presidential front-runner offered his critique of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as part of a broadside against Texas Sen.

And although this fact has been the subject of some public-spirited anxiety, it has generally not troubled political scientists too much, because it seemed as if non-voters had more or less the same view of the parties as voters did. Stretch the electorate to two-thirds of those eligible, or three-quarters, or make voting mandatory, and it has long seemed that the votes would be distributed in roughly equivalent proportions: about half the vote for Democrats, half for Republicans, with some variability reserved for the shape of current events.\u201d http://bit.ly/239ITva\n\nTRUMP\u2019s \u2018REVEALING\u2019 WAPO INTERVIEW -- \u201cIn a revealing interview, Trump predicts a \u2018massive recession\u2019 but intends to eliminate the national debt in 8 years,\u201d by The Washington Post's Bob Woodward and Robert Costa: \"Donald Trump said in an interview that economic conditions are so perilous that the country is headed for a \u2018very massive recession\u2019 and that 'it\u2019s a terrible time right now' to invest in the stock market, embracing a distinctly gloomy view of the economy that counters mainstream economic forecasts. The New York billionaire dismissed concern that his comments \u2014 which are exceedingly unusual, if not unprecedented, for a major party front-runner \u2014 could potentially affect financial markets. 'I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them,' said Trump, who has misfired on such predictions in the past.

There were eye rolls, titters and some laughter \u2013 though not the good kind. Palin bombed Friday night. Four days before the pivotal Wisconsin primary, she was a surrogate for Donald J. Trump at the annual fish-fry fundraiser for the Milwaukee GOP, attended by 750 Republicans. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who polls suggest could crush Trump on Tuesday, was there, as was Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Both were well-received, especially Cruz, with his Constitution-thumping sermon and a joke that it was \u201cnot fair to train wrecks\u201d to compare Trump to one.\" http://bit.ly/1S0yPgb\n\nGOP \u2018SIDESHOW\u2019 -- \u201cThe Republicans\u2019 Gay Freakout,\" by The New York Times' Frank Bruni: \"Our infrastructure is inexcusable, much of our public education is miserable and one of our leading presidential candidates is a know-nothing, say-anything egomaniac who yanks harder every day at the tattered fabric of civil discourse and fundamental decency in this country.

Without support from Illinois policymakers for the Next Generation Energy Plan to close this gap, two plants \u2013 Clinton and Quad Cities \u2013 could be forced to close, jeopardizing thousands of jobs along with many other economic and environmental benefits.
