Instead, Riley broke up the play, tipping the ball with his left hand at the eight-yard line before securing it under his arm as he fell to the ground.\n\nIt was the second interception of the day for the Redskins, following one by free safety Dashon Goldson roughly nine minutes earlier. Goldson returned that interception for a touchdown, cementing a performance for a defense that, early on, appeared to be headed for a long afternoon.\n\nSEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Kirk Cousins\u2019 big day sends message in Redskins\u2019 victory over Saints\n\n\u201cKind of what our Achilles\u2019 heel was we missed a couple tackles,\u201d Goldson said, following the Redskins\u2018 47-14 victory. \u201cWe missed a tackle to cause a big run. \u2026 We just started playing sound football after that. We limited our missed tackles. We were on point with our game plan, and we just stuck to it.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins had allowed 372 yards a game, the 12th-most in the league, but held the Saints to 350 yards on Sunday. Much changed after a 60-yard touchdown reception by New Orleans wide receiver Brandin Cooks with 10:52 remaining in the second quarter: The Saints had gained 160 yards once Cooks crossed the goal line, an average of 14.6 yards per play, but were held to 190 yards, or 4.3 yards per play, after the touchdown.\n\nWashington also stopped the Saints on seven of 11 third-down attempts, six of which occurred after the touchdown, and both fourth-down tries, including a fourth-and-1 that ended New Orleans\u2019 first possession of the second half.\n\nSEE ALSO: SNYDER: Big gains, huge strides made against porous Saints defense\n\nBoosting the early production was not only the touchdown pass, but also a 70-yard gain by running back Mark Ingram on New Orleans\u2019 third play from scrimmage \u2014 one in which Ingram shed a tackle by Goldson, then took off down the right sideline before being forced out of bounds at the Redskins\u2018 five-yard line by cornerback Will Blackmon.\n\n\u201cWe got out of a couple of gaps, and we were soft on some of the coverages,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cAt the end of the day, football is about blocking and tackling. If you can do those things really well, I think you have a good chance, and I think we came out in the second half and on both sides of the ball, we were able to do that.\u201d\n\nBrees, who entered having thrown for more than 300 yards in seven of nine games, was held to 209 yards on Sunday. The Redskins have yet to allow a quarterback to surpass the 300-yard mark this season \u2014 and that includes the New England Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady, who threw for 299 yards a week ago.\n\nThat, Blackmon said, gave the defense confidence that Brees wouldn\u2019t be able to bring his team back in the second half, despite the Redskins holding just a two-possession lead, 27-14, at halftime. Washington didn\u2019t truly pull away until 11 seconds remained in the third quarter, when it increased its lead to 37-14; Goldson\u2019s interception followed on the Saints\u2018 next series, and on the subsequent drive, New Orleans failed to convert a fourth-and-2 from its own 22-yard line.\n\nTo keep New Orleans\u2019 passing attack off balance, the Redskins incorporated a variety of disguises and changed their coverages late \u2014 moves that, on occasion, had players hurrying from one location to another just before the snap. Brees said the Saints were prepared for the Redskins\u2018 wrinkles, but one they couldn\u2019t be ready for was the return of cornerback DeAngelo Hall, who took the field for the first time since Week 3 but did so as a safety.\n\n\u201cAny time you can give a guy like Drew Brees multiple disguises and multiple things thrown at him, you know, it makes it a little difficult,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter who was out there.\u201d\n\nRiley struggled against the Patriots \u2014 particularly in coverage, with an 18-yard touchdown reception by running back Brandon Bolden unfolding after Brady called a timeout specifically because he noticed the inside linebacker would not be able to stop the play.\n\nSunday was different. The early lead meant nothing to the Saints, but the Redskins\u2018 task will be to make sure the 33 unanswered points do.\n\n\u201cNobody got down on each other,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe kept each other in high spirits. \u2018OK, you\u2019ll make it next time. We know it.\u2019 Everybody did a good job of making that play next time when it came, and we finished the game up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Redskins appeared poised to allow the Saints' offense plenty of yards on Sunday, but they tightened up and didn't allow a single point after the Saints tied the score early in the second quarter.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Redskins appeared poised to allow the Saints\u2019 offense plenty of yards on Sunday, but they tightened up and didn\u2019t allow a single point after the Saints tied the score early in the second quarter.", "title": "Redskins\u2019 defense buckles down after early struggles against Saints", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/15/redskins-defense-buckles-down-saints/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/15/AP_86544604379.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/15/AP_86544604379.jpg", "description": "The Redskins appeared poised to allow the Saints' offense plenty of yards on Sunday, but they tightened up and didn't allow a single point after the Saints tied the score early in the second quarter.", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins\u2019 defense buckles down after early struggles against Sai"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, New Orleans Saints, Perry Riley, Washington Redskins"}, "article_summary": "The early lead meant nothing to the Saints, but the Redskins\u2018 task will be to make sure the 33 unanswered points do.\nGoldson returned that interception for a touchdown, cementing a performance for a defense that, early on, appeared to be headed for a long afternoon.\nIt was the second interception of the day for the Redskins, following one by free safety Dashon Goldson roughly nine minutes earlier.\nSEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Kirk Cousins\u2019 big day sends message in Redskins\u2019 victory over Saints\u201cKind of what our Achilles\u2019 heel was we missed a couple tackles,\u201d Goldson said, following the Redskins\u2018 47-14 victory.\nFacing first-and-10 from the Washington Redskins\u2018 33-yard line with 5:45 remaining, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees intended to find tight end Ben Watson down the left sideline with a pass that could have taken him into the end zone."}
