A business executive who has lost every political race she has entered \u2014 and who was booted out of Hewlett-Packard \u2014 Fiorina rose to national prominence early in 2016 race with a strong showing in the first of 1,000 GOP debates.\n\nFiorina is a conventional conservative, meaning she and Cruz share a lot in common. Among Fiorina\u2019s more notable positions are her thoughts on abortion (against it), public education (privatize it), the Affordable Care Act (repeal it), the minimum wage (get rid of it), and the California drought, which she blames on \u201coverzealous environmentalists.\u201d\n\nBut there is one issue where she stands apart from Cruz. Unlike her buddy Cruz \u2014 who insists climate change science is \u201cpartisan dogma and ideology\u201d \u2014 Fiorina has acknowledged the scientific consensus. She\u2019s admitted in interviews, \u201cscientists tell us that global warming is real and man-made.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t get too excited that Fiorina wants to do something about it. \u201cI believe if you\u2019re going to go to science, you need to read the fine print,\u201d Fiorina said last year. \u201cAnd here\u2019s what the scientists say: A single nation acting alone can make no difference at all. The only answer to this problem, according to the scientists, is a three-decade global effort, coordinated and costing trillions of dollars. Are you kidding? It\u2019ll never happen.\u201d\n\nIn other words, why bother? We can see why Ted likes her.\n\nCruz\u2019s announcement begs the question: Why is he even talking about a running mate? Cruz\u2019s only chance at winning the nomination at this point is if Donald Trump turns out to be a talking donut with a wig on top. The National Review speculates that Cruz wants to distract from Trump\u2019s five-primary win on Tuesday, which isn\u2019t a bad guess. And Fiorna is indeed a woman, something none of the other GOP presidential hopefuls can boast and what Cruz might consider valuable in trolling Hillary Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fiorinacruz.jpg?w=50", "sailthru.author": "Katie Herzog", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "Cruz hopes for a campaign miracle by bringing on a failed politician.", "title": "Climate denier Cruz taps token believer Fiorina as running mate", "url": "http://grist.org/news/climate-denier-cruz-taps-token-believer-fiorina-as-running-mate/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fiorinacruz.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fiorinacruz.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "grist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-27 16:40:14", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "Climate denier Cruz taps token believer Fiorina as running mate", "msapplication-tooltip": "We're an online news organization that uses humor to interpret green issues & inspire environmental action.", "p": {"domain_verify": "c293daabda398bd8ceee45abea0b3201"}, "fb": {"app_id": 548917378618963}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://grist.org/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/330e84b0272aae748d059cd70e3f8f8d?s=16", "application-name": "Grist", "sailthru.tags": "article, news, politics, katie-herzog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/grist.org", "published_time": "2016-04-27T20:40:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T20:40:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/katie.herzog"}, "sailthru.description": "Cruz hopes for a campaign miracle by bringing on a failed politician.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fiorinacruz.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Cruz hopes for a campaign miracle by bringing on a failed politician."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a63\"", "article_summary": "The National Review speculates that Cruz wants to distract from Trump\u2019s five-primary win on Tuesday, which isn\u2019t a bad guess.\nUnlike her buddy Cruz \u2014 who insists climate change science is \u201cpartisan dogma and ideology\u201d \u2014 Fiorina has acknowledged the scientific consensus.\nTed Cruz, Texan presidential hopeful and Grandpa Munster lookalike, attempted to bring his faltering campaign back to life on Wednesday by making a big announcement: He\u2019s tapping Carly Fiorina as his running mate.\nAnd Fiorna is indeed a woman, something none of the other GOP presidential hopefuls can boast and what Cruz might consider valuable in trolling Hillary Clinton.\nShe\u2019s admitted in interviews, \u201cscientists tell us that global warming is real and man-made.\u201dBut don\u2019t get too excited that Fiorina wants to do something about it."}
