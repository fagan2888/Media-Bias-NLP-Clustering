South Carolina candidates for state and local office must sign a similar pledge.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThus far, four candidates have signed the pledge and filed for South Carolina\u2019s February 20, 2016 Republican Primary.\u201d It named Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson as candidates who have already agreed to the pledge. The party also said that it expects Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham to do so within the next week.\n\nThe announcement came on the same day that Monmouth University released a poll of South Carolina voters that found Trump far ahead of all his competitors with 30 percent of the vote.\n\nThe billionaire former reality television star celebrated by tweaking Graham on Twitter over his comparatively weak showing.\n\nRelated: Big Surprise \u2013 Hispanic Voters Can\u2019t Stand Donald Trump\n\nCongrats @LindseyGrahamSC. You just got 4 points in your home state of SC\u2014far better than zero nationally. You\u2019re only 26 pts behind me. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015\n\n(For his part, Graham replied with a full-scale verbal assault on Trump\u2019s policies in a CNN interview, calling him, among other things, a \u201ccomplete idiot\u201d on Middle East policy, and adding a promise: \u201cCome to South Carolina and I'll beat his brains out.\u201d)\n\nThe thing is, it\u2019s not really clear how effective a measure like the South Carolina GOP\u2019s move will be in actually getting Trump to promise loyalty to the GOP.\n\nIn the first presidential debate, moderated by hosts from Republican-friendly Fox News, the very first question asked of the candidates was whether the candidates would promise not to run on a third-party ticket if they lost the primary. It was a naked assault on Trump, who was the only man (they were all men) on the stage who 1) had flirted with the possibility and 2) could hope to pull it off.\n\nTrump adamantly refused, the effort fizzled, and the billionaire went on to score ever-larger victories in early polls.\n\nRelated: Bush Warns that Trump\u2019s \u2018Unrealistic\u2019 Wall Will Cost Billions\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s not at all clear how binding such a pledge will be on candidates who sign it. Despite the South Carolina GOP\u2019s assertion that the document amounts to a \u201cpledge to not run as a third party candidate,\u201d the wording is really quite squishy in its reference to something candidates \u201cgenerally believe\u201d and \u201cintend\u201d at the time they file the form.\n\nTrump also has the option of a write-in candidacy. His massive name-recognition, current popularity and ability to command media coverage offer him the ability to defy the state party in a way none of his competitors could even consider.\n\nTrump has until the end of September to make a decision about whether or not to sign the South Carolina filing form. But Trump isn\u2019t a man given to lengthy consideration of his options. It seems safe to expect an answer to the implied question from the South Carolina GOP in the very near future.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The ongoing effort by members of the Republican Party to get Donald Trump to swear off the possibility of a third party run for president if he fails to secure the GOP nomination got serious on Tuesday, when the state party apparatus in the key early voting state South Carolina confirmed it had made participation in its primary election contingent on candidates promising to support the Party and its eventual nominee.", "title": "South Carolina GOP Puts Trump in the Crosshairs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/26/South-Carolina-GOP-Puts-Trump-Crosshairs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-juryduty_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/26/South-Carolina-GOP-Puts-Trump-Crosshairs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-juryduty_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The ongoing effort by members of the Republican Party to get Donald Trump to swear off the possibility of a third party run for president if he fails to secure the GOP nomination got serious on Tuesday, when the state party apparatus in the key early voting state South Carolina confirmed it had made participation in its primary election contingent on candidates promising to support the Party and its eventual nominee.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f19\"", "article_summary": "It seems safe to expect an answer to the implied question from the South Carolina GOP in the very near future.\nScott Walker, Texas Sen.
