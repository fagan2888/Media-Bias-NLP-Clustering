And she didn\u2019t need a bicycle, either.\n\n\u201cThat was our transportation when we were kids \u2026 our horses,\u201d Sharlot \u2014 now Sharlot Martinez \u2014 said recently in Arapahoe Park\u2019s barn area.\n\nYears later her father, Clyde England, was a thoroughbred trainer on the Arizona fair circuit. Sharlot occasionally joined him at Yavapai Downs and worked as a \u201cpony girl.\u201d\n\nIn that role, Sharlot was entrusted to ride on her horse next to the about-to-race thoroughbred and jockey in the post parade and warm-up. Several times she helped jockey O.A. Martinez and his horse get to the gate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we got to know each other and started talking,\u201d Sharlot said.\n\nSharlot had been married and divorced, and eventually managed a heavy equipment rental company for 20 years, first in Safford and then, after transferring in 2000, in Phoenix. She and Martinez became reacquainted in Phoenix, where O.A. rode at Turf Paradise for much of the year. Sharlot \u201cponied\u201d only on the weekends, whether on the fair circuit or at Turf Paradise. They became a couple in 2002.\n\n\u201cHe was leaving every summer, and I was getting tired of being left behind,\u201d Sharlot said, laughing. \u201cI had the racing in my blood and I felt like I was missing something.\u201d\n\nThey were married in 2007.\n\nSharlot quit her job in 2008, and after the Turf Paradise meeting ended, she went with O.A. on the circuit.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, at Turf Paradise, O.A.\u2019s jockey career came to an abrupt end.\n\n\u201cHorse flipped in the gate, got me, and I broke my back,\u201d O.A., 50, said matter-of-factly. \u201cI wanted to ride, but the doctor who took care of me said: \u2018Don\u2019t even take a chance. It\u2019s in a bad spot. You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re not paralyzed.\u2019 \u201c\n\nO.A. became a trainer and gradually added to both his reputation and his family stable. Sharlot, the daughter and sister of trainers, was heavily involved from the start. At this Arapahoe Park meeting, Sharlot is listed as the trainer of record for most of the roughly 30 horses in the Martinez barn, O.A. a handful, and the work is collaborative.\n\n\u201cWe do it all together,\u201d O.A. said. \u201cThey all know we\u2019re together over here.\u201d\n\nBased on earnings of the horses, Sharlot until recently was the leading trainer at the Arapahoe Park thoroughbred meeting. Then she had a run of relatively limited entries compared to her major competitors. After Sunday\u2019s races, she was fourth, with $201,765. Her horses had 17 wins, 15 seconds and 11 thirds in 68 starts. Veterans Kenneth Gleason ($238,769), Temple Rushton ($225,775) and Tyrone Gleason ($216,064) were ahead of her.\n\nEquibase, the record-keeping authority in the sport, and the Eclipse Awards prioritize standings by money. Tracks go by wins, so in the official Arapahoe Park standings, Sharlot was third, behind Rushton (23) and Tyrone Gleason (19).\n\nEither way, a strong run in the final weekend of the meeting, which concludes Sunday, could propel Martinez up in the trainer standings.\n\nThe other female leading thoroughbred trainer at an Arapahoe Park meeting was Jodi Davis. In 1997, her entries had 20 wins, 20 seconds and 10 thirds in 107 starts at Arapahoe Park, earning $122,047. She obtained her trainer\u2019s license in 1978, following her father, Dean, into the business. She stayed in it following Dean\u2019s December 1996 death, and trained through 2003.\n\nDavis lives in Phoenix and works as a sergeant on the security guard staff at Turf Paradise. \"I love it,\" she said recently. \"I get to be around the horses and horsemen, so it\u2019s a perfect job for me.\"\n\nShe said she got out of training because she has a home in Phoenix, \"and I got tired of moving from state to state.\"\n\nNow Martinez is hoping to join Davis among the ranks of annual leading trainers at Arapahoe Park \u2014 whether that\u2019s this summer or in the future.\n\nThe Martinez stable star is Lady Jila, the late-blooming 8-year-old mare that July 26 won Arapahoe Park\u2019s Columbine Stakes for fillies and mares for the third year in a row, and in June won the track\u2019s Molly Brown Stakes for the second successive time.\n\nOwned and bred by Michael Barro, who has a string of pizza restaurants in the Phoenix area, Lady Jila has 21 wins in 49 career starts and $258,118 in earnings. She has won her past seven races. It\u2019s all mind-boggling considering that as recently as early 2012, Lady Jila \u2014 known as \u201cJill\u201d in the stable area \u2014 could have been claimed for $3,000.\n\n\u201cThat was scary,\u201d Sharlot said. \u201cIt took her a while to grow up. When we first got her, she was a little high-strung and a little hard to manage. But what she is now is all heart. It\u2019s in her heart and she just tries.\u201d\n\nThe way the Martinezes look at it, they\u2019re co-trainers of Lady Jila and the other horses in Arapahoe Park\u2019s Barn 10.\n\n\u201cWe make all the decisions together,\u201d Sharlot said. \u201cO.A. is more front line, and I\u2019m behind the scenes. He talks to the owners. He does the entering. He handles that and I can handle down here. I stay at the barn and work at the barn and keep the crew lined out and directed.\n\n\u201cHe can go out and gallop horses and say, \u2018This horse feels like this,\u2019 or whatever, and I\u2019ll go, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll take it from there.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe couple has a home in Phoenix and leaves a trailer on the Arapahoe Park grounds year-round.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t moved in five years,\u201d Sharlot said. \u201cWe\u2019re in Phoenix for eight months and it\u2019s not bad because Phoenix is so hot. And then we come up here and it\u2019s kind of like a summer vacation.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: frei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sharlot Martinez could become second woman leading thoroughbred trainer at Arapahoe Park meeting", "title": "Sharlot Martinez could become second woman leading thoroughbred trainer at Arapahoe Park meeting", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/09/sharlot-martinez-could-become-second-woman-leading-thoroughbred-trainer-at-arapahoe-park-meeting/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150809__BN20150810_B1_BNSP10HORSEMARTINEZp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150809__BN20150810_B1_BNSP10HORSEMARTINEZp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-09T21:08:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T11:12:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat was our transportation when we were kids \u2026 our horses,\u201d Sharlot \u2014 now Sharlot Martinez \u2014 said recently in Arapahoe Park\u2019s barn area.\nThe other female leading thoroughbred trainer at an Arapahoe Park meeting was Jodi Davis.\nAURORA \u2014Not surprisingly, the woman who has a bona fide chance of becoming the second female leading thoroughbred trainer at an Arapahoe Park meeting was raised on horses.\n\u201cThey all know we\u2019re together over here.\u201dBased on earnings of the horses, Sharlot until recently was the leading trainer at the Arapahoe Park thoroughbred meeting.\nAt this Arapahoe Park meeting, Sharlot is listed as the trainer of record for most of the roughly 30 horses in the Martinez barn, O.A."}
