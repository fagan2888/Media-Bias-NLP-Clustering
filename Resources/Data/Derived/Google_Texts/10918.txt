ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) â€” A Florida man killed after being struck not once, not twice, but three times on a busy roadway in Orlando has investigators searching for two suspected hit-and-run drivers.

The Florida Highway Patrol says 39-year-old Rasheed Wiggins was standing in the grassy median of Universal Boulevard and Destination Parkway Saturday night when a car veered into him, sending him onto the roadway, where another car ran him over. Then cab driver, Fito Pierre, 47, who didn't see Wiggins, rolled over him. Pierre remained on scene to talk to troopers.

FHP investigators say they have few leads on the two suspected hit-and-run drivers. The first car was "a newer, white" car; the second car, also white with "a female driving."

FHP is asking for the public's help. Tipsters can call 407-737-2213.
