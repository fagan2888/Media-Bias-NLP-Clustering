Bruce Watts.\n\nAfter a physical fight, police say the suspect pulled a gun and shot the dealer who then drove down the street.\n\n\u201cHe ran into a Wichita officer at Woodlawn and Douglas, almost literally ran into the police car, but he didn't. He missed the police car,\u201d Watts said.\n\nThe 35-year-old victim was taken to Wesley Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the shoulder. He was listed in serious condition Saturday evening.\n\nThis shooting is at least the fourth violent crime so far this year on South Mission.\n\nThe first was in March in the 800 block. A man on his way to see his brother was shot multiple times in the chest.\n\nThen in June, a man flagged down a woman on East Harry after he was stabbed in the foot and torso in the 900 block.\n\nAnd in July, police responded to a report of gunshots in the 800 block and found a 20-year-old man lying on the ground with serious injuries after an alleged beating.\n\nNone on the residents we spoke with on South Mission would talk on camera, fearing retribution. But they says they\u2019re tired of the crime and worried for the many children being raised on the block.\n\nPrevious story:\n\nA man was critically hurt early Saturday morning in a shooting in east Wichita.\n\nIt happened near around 3 a.m. in the 800 block of South Mission, near Lincoln and Woodlawn.\n\nSgt. Dale Mattern said following the shooting, the 35-year-old victim drove to Douglas and Woodlawn before flagging down an officer, saying he'd been shot in an attempted robbery.\n\nHe was taken to a local hospital with critical injuries and is currently in serious but stable condition.\n\nPolice are still investigating. Suspect descriptions were not immediately available.\n\nWe hope to learn more this afternoon during a noon briefing with Wichita police.
