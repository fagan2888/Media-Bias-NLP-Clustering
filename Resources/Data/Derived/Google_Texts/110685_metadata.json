United States House of Representatives v. Burwell. The decision will have no immediate legal impact, since the court stayed the ruling while the case is appealed.\n\nThe case involves a different subsidy from the one the Supreme Court of the United States upheld in the recent King v. Burwell case. The King case challenged whether the ACA provides for tax credits to pay premiums for insurance purchased through the federal (rather than a state) exchange. House v. Burwell challenges whether Congress appropriated funds to pay for the ACA\u2019s cost-sharing reductions.\n\nCost-sharing reductions under the ACA. The ACA provides that individuals who meet certain income thresholds are eligible to receive CSRs through enhanced health plans. Individuals eligible for CSRs do not receive any payments from the government. Rather, the individual pays the premium for a standard value health plan, but the health insurance company provides them a plan with an enhanced actuarial value (i.e., 73, 87 or 94 percent rather than 70 percent). The difference in plan costs between the standard and the higher value plan represents the total amount of CSRs. The statute provides that the government \u201cshall make periodic and timely payments to the issuer equal to the value of the reductions.\u201d Approximately 58 percent of individuals who purchase insurance through an exchange receive an enhanced plan.\n\nThe lawsuit. The US House of Representatives filed suit in 2015 asserting that it had not appropriated funds to make the CSR payments to health insurance issuers. The House argued that by making the payments, the Executive Branch violated the Constitution, which provides that \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . . . .\u201d\n\nThe decision. The Obama administration initially challenged the House\u2019s standing to bring the case. In October 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled for the House on that threshold question, concluding that the House\u2019s allegations gave rise to a \u201cconcrete, particularized injury\u201d as an institution, because the House was \u201cdeprived of its rightful and necessary place under our Constitution\u201d as the exclusive authority to appropriate funds. The court also rejected the administration\u2019s argument that the lawsuit raised a \u201cpolitical question\u201d that implicated separation of powers concerns among the three branches of government. The administration asked Judge Collyer for leave to immediately appeal the standing decision to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, but Judge Collyer denied that request and ordered the parties to proceed to briefing the lawsuit\u2019s merits.\n\nThe court\u2019s May 12 decision ruled in the House\u2019s favor on the merits. The court rejected the administration\u2019s argument that the ACA\u2019s permanent appropriation for the Advance Premium Tax Credits (APTC) also extended to CSRs, concluding that the law only appropriated funds for APTCs. Reviewing principles of appropriations law, the court held that although the statute permanently authorized CSRs as a benefit plan, it made payments \u201cdependent on non-permanent appropriations,\u201d which Congress had refused to provide. The court also rejected the administration\u2019s argument that CSRs and APTCs are an integrated and unified system of subsidies, and that cutting off CSR payments would cause issuers to charge higher premiums for products on the exchanges, which in turn would result in increased government payments for APTCs. The court concluded that the ACA\u2019s text permanently appropriated funds only for APTCs, and not for CSRs. Accordingly, Judge Collyer enjoined payment of CSR reimbursements \u201cpending an appropriation for such payments.\n\nNext steps. The decision will not result in an immediate suspension of CSR payments, because the court stayed the order pending a likely appeal. On appeal, the DC Circuit will address the threshold issues of whether the House has standing to bring the lawsuit and whether the case presents a political question that is not justiciable. If it decides for the House on these threshold issues, it would also decide the case on the merits.\n\nOf course, the November elections will change the composition of the House of Representatives and usher in a new administration, which could change the dynamics of the case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal district court judge in Washington, DC ruled Congress did not appropriate funds for Affordable Care Act\u2019s cost sharing reduction subsidies", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "A federal district court judge in Washington, DC ruled on May 12, 2016, that Congress did not appropriate funds for the Affordable Care Act&amp;rsquo;s (ACA) cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies.&amp;nbsp;U", "title": "D.C.
