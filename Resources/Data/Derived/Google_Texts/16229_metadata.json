Fletcher chatted with Phareall, a boy receiving cancer treatment at the facility, who told the police officer about his awesome dance moves. Fletcher asked to see them. Phareall agreed, but only if Fletcher joined him.\n\nPhareall admittedly has some pretty smooth dance moves, but Fletcher might be a different story. Regardless, the goofy police officer brought a smile to Phareall\u2019s face by attempting to copy his moves. Onlookers quickly videotaped the moment then uploaded it to YouTube.\n\nAccording to the Cure 4 The Kids Foundation website, the facility was started in 2007 for a \u201ccharitable, educational, and scientific purpose\u201d toward children\u2019s health needs. \u201cIt is not unusual for children with cancer and other complex medical conditions from Nevada and the surrounding region to travel hundreds of miles, seeking appropriate care and access to the latest treatment protocols and clinical trials,\u201d the website states. \u201cHowever, the most vulnerable of children diagnosed with complex medical issues such as cancer; the uninsured, under insured, and medically indigent are often excluded from this opportunity due to their lack of medical coverage and/or the finances required to appropriately treat these childhood conditions. It is not only our policy that no child will be denied care at our clinic for financial reasons; it is our legacy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "las vegas police, tim fletcher, cancer patients", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A police officer visiting a cancer facility was caught on camera dancing with a young cancer patient.", "title": "Las Vegas Police Officer Caught On Camera \u2014 Dancing With A Young Cancer Patient [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/las-vegas-police-officer-caught-camera-dance-young-cancer-patient-306248", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/police.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A police officer visiting a cancer facility was caught on camera dancing with a young cancer patient.", "title": "Las Vegas Police Officer Caught On Camera \u2014 Dancing With A Young Cancer Patient [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/las-vegas-police-officer-caught-camera-dance-young-cancer-patient-306248", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/police.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/04/police.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-04T13:10:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-04T13:10:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A police officer visiting a cancer facility was caught on camera dancing with a young cancer patient."}, "article_summary": "Fletcher chatted with Phareall, a boy receiving cancer treatment at the facility, who told the police officer about his awesome dance moves.\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) Officer Tim Fletcher was caught on camera while dancing with a young cancer patient at the Cure 4 The Kids Foundation facility, and it\u2019s something a little more uplifting than much of what we see in the news.\nPhareall admittedly has some pretty smooth dance moves, but Fletcher might be a different story.\nRegardless, the goofy police officer brought a smile to Phareall\u2019s face by attempting to copy his moves.\nAccording to the Cure 4 The Kids Foundation website, the facility was started in 2007 for a \u201ccharitable, educational, and scientific purpose\u201d toward children\u2019s health needs."}
