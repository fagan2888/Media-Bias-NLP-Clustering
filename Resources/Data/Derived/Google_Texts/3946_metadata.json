I had high hopes for John McCain and Sarah Palin, but my hopes were dashed as America elected Obama, despite not knowing much about him.\n\nI wanted to do something, speak out, have a voice, but I was just a mom in Charlotte, N.C., struggling to get by. I felt alone, my voice heard only within the confines of my own home as I snapped back at television commentators or politicians spouting drivel on the radio. Then came the Tea Party.\n\nAfter his inauguration in 2009, Obama announced more government bailouts. Those of us who were worried about out\u2010of\u2010control spending and a growing centralized government rose up. The Tea Party was born. I was one of the first members, if you could even call us official members at the time. As soon as I heard about other like\u2010minded people gathering in downtown Charlotte for a rally, I printed out my first homemade \u201cTea Party\u201d bumper\u2010sticker and taped it to my faded red mini\u2010van. A neighbor called me crazy. I just smiled and put another sticker on the side window, so he could see it as I drove by.\n\nIn A Reaction Against Big Government, The Tea Party Was Born As Tea Partiers gathered on the National Mall in 2009, I went to local rallies, my oldest daughter and I painting \u201cConservative Victory\u201d T\u2010shirts with stars and stripes. The rallies were a mixture of people\u2014old, young, teenagers, whites, Hispanics, blacks. Every rally felt like the Fourth of July in a small town, complete with iced tea and lemonade.\n\nBut things soon changed. Anderson Cooper dubbed us Tea Baggers, and the Republican Establishment fixed its eye on us like Sauron from Mordor. During one rally across from the Mecklenburg County Courthouse, a couple of black female professionals came up to me and asked me what was going on. They looked concerned. \u201cWhat do you have against President Obama?\u201d one of them asked me suspiciously. I explained that the issue wasn\u2019t Obama but the size of government and how we\u2019re all taxed too much. I told her that I had three children and three step\u2010 children to support, but a lot of our money went to taxes. \u201cI just want to be free to take care of my kids and help in my community the way I choose,\u201d I told her. She said she\u2019d just had her third child and agreed that she could use more money. We parted with a greater understanding of one another\u2014no animus, no anger, just a deep concern about our families.\n\nThroughout the first term of Obama\u2019s presidency, the Tea Party grew in strength. I was able to replace my tattered homemade bumper\u2010sticker with a glossy official one. But things soon changed. Anderson Cooper dubbed us Tea Baggers, and the Republican Establishment fixed its eye on us like Sauron from Mordor. Those of us in the Tea Party faced a two\u2010headed hydra in Washington\u2014the Democrats and those from our own party who hated us because we embarrassed them and challenged their power.\n\nStill, the Tea Party didn\u2019t relent. Obamacare spurred us to action, and the 2010 midterms were a landslide. We wanted change in Washington. The newly elected congressmen we sent there promised change, but the two years that followed didn\u2019t bring much, despite the efforts of brave men like Sen. Mike Lee and Sen. Rand Paul. The real blow came when the Establishment\u2019s candidate of choice, Mitt Romney, won the Republican nomination. During the primary, the GOP had repeatedly beat up on the Tea Partiers, calling them irrational, angry, and most of all stupid. They were characterized as ignorant outsiders with pitchforks. Hobbits. Crazies. When newly elected Sen. Ted Cruz fought to defund Obamacare in 2013, Peter King called his supporters \u201ca dark strain in the American psyche.\u201d\n\nFighting For Limited Government With Words After the election of Obama in 2012, I felt helpless and depressed. I\u2019d worked hard in the Tea Party, but we were failing. We were failing, not because of the Democrats, but because of the GOP and its refusal to give up its love of centralized power. They were no different than the leftists. Money. Power. Cocktail parties. Media incest. The Capitol in the Hunger Games really did portray for many of us what Washington had become\u2014narcissistic, money\u2010grubbing, self\u2010indulgent, condescending, and egotistical. There was little evidence that anyone inside the beltway cared about everyday Americans.\n\nI continued to work hard, writing, standing for principles of liberty and freedom. I needed to do something. I had been a journalist before becoming a full\u2010time mom, so I used the only skills I had\u2014my writing. Maybe it would give me a voice, albeit a small one. Attending rallies wasn\u2019t enough. I was worried about the future. I saw other women being sucked in by the war\u2010on\u2010women lies, and I needed to say something, try to make a difference. My children were getting older, and I wanted better for them, financially, culturally, and morally.\n\nSo, I got on the Internet, started a blog, and I began writing. I was passionate and not always politically correct. I challenged people on my side as well as Democrats. I made friends, and I made enemies because I didn\u2019t care about playing politics. That\u2019s because I was speaking out, not for a political party, but for my family, for myself. I had to live and write by my own conscience, not to please others or even to advance myself and a possible career in punditry.\n\nI got up at dawn and wrote all day. I was unemployed at the time, so I could do it. I joined a wonderful website, Ricochet, where I continued to work hard, writing, standing for principles of liberty and freedom. I called people to be faithful to the Constitution, to think as individuals, to strengthen the civil society by loving one another and being personally responsible for themselves and their families, and to stand for what they believe no matter what. I studied, read more books than I can remember, and scoured the Internet. My family thought I had gone nuts, but I wouldn\u2019t relent. I was just a little voice, just a Tea Party mom who wanted to make a difference, but I believed in what I was writing.\n\nI was often demeaned and ridiculed. I didn\u2019t have a fancy degree. I didn\u2019t have a fancy fellowship. I didn\u2019t know any politicians. I didn\u2019t have any connections. I was just a journalist with some knowledge of philosophy and theology. I was just a mom and a wife, busy cooking dinner, cleaning house, not attending cocktail parties and rubbing elbows. I was a nobody. But I kept writing. In response to Peter King and his attack on Ted Cruz, I wrote in September of 2013 a post about how the GOP was mischaracterizing the Republican base. I was tired of being called angry and stupid. Even \u201cvile.\u201d The fact is I wasn\u2019t angry. I was afraid.\n\nThe Tea Party\u2019s Fears Still Matter This is what I wrote two years ago, and given what my colleague Tom Nichols (whom I respect a great deal) has written about the Tea Party and Trump supporters, it bears repeating:\n\nIf you really want to understand what motivates the Republican base, you need to stop listening to the bully name\u2010calling that the establishment has adopted from the left or to people like Peter King who talk about a \u2018dark strain in the American psyche\u2019 and all the \u2018vile\u2019 phone calls he has received in support of Cruz. Instead, you need to listen and understand that conservatives are not\u2014and never have been\u2014motivated by anger. They are motivated by fear.\n\nSome might not want to admit this fact. It sounds weak, maybe even naive. But fear in the proper context is anything but naive. It\u2019s wisdom based on experience and knowledge. It\u2019s realizing that something you love is threatened, something worth fighting for\u2014even worth dying for.\n\nThey fear a government that is no longer acting within the boundaries of the Constitution. They fear tyranny. \u2018Anger,\u2019 as it has been leveled at the Republican base, is a mischaracterization, designed to dismiss them as irrational and even dangerous. The truth is they\u2019re simply good people who love their country and are honestly afraid of losing their freedom, having their private property taken away through high taxes, being robbed of their rights through increasing regulations, having their privacy invaded by the IRS and the NSA, and having an expanding government rob them of quality healthcare, the right to defend themselves, and free choice in the education of their children.\n\nConservatives today look at the government and they see creeping tyranny (and in some instances, not so creeping). They see very few checks and balances among the branches, they see the Constitution violated and undermined by legislators\u2014including those in the GOP, they see judges legislating, and they see an unaccountable executive ruling by fiat. Is it any wonder they\u2019re afraid? The question is \u2018Why isn\u2019t the GOP establishment afraid?\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s been said, \u2018When government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\u2019 The Republican base doesn\u2019t hate the government as Dorothy Rabinowitz of the Wall Street Journal said in her rant against Cruz supporters. They fear a government that is no longer acting within the boundaries of the Constitution. They fear tyranny.\n\nI wrote that two years ago. Today, we\u2019re hearing the same thing from insiders (even if they are registered \u201cIndependents\u201d). Nichols writes that Trump supporters \u201cembrace being the underdog because it gives them a sense of importance and specialness that comes from believing they are in an ongoing struggle with The Man or The System or The Cartel. Thus they love it when The Donald says things like \u2018everybody is stupid,\u2019 because that\u2019s how they feel all the time.\u201d\n\nNichols uses the term \u201cstupid\u201d seven times to describe those who oppose political insiders and Washington elites. Of the Tea Party, he says they put people on the political stage \u201cwhose stock in trade was either pristine ignorance or pure rage.\u201d\n\nAs a Tea Party member, I can say I\u2019m neither ignorant nor filled with pure rage. Neither am I stupid. I have been thoughtful in my opposition to tyranny in Washington, and it\u2019s one reason I\u2019ve pushed to keep writing, despite having little support, struggling with personal issues, and often doing it while working three jobs to help pay the bills. As a Senior Contributor at The Federalist, I continue to write, standing for local governance, low taxes, a strong defense, the civil society, the Constitution, and life in the womb.\n\nTrump Speaks For Small Government Advocates When The GOP Doesn\u2019t I don\u2019t support Trump as a candidate, but I understand and respect the anger of my fellow Americans\u2014and, yes, it is now true anger (mixed with some other legitimate points Nichols makes about our celebrity\u2010driven culture). But, as someone who has been a part of this conflict since the beginning\u2014and an outsider\u2014I can tell you, it is the GOP\u2019s fault\u2014it\u2019s the fault of all politicians who are either protecting the status quo or pushing us into even more tyranny, a point Walter Russell Mead makes in his explanation of the populism of Trump.\n\nPeople are more angry now than they have been because they have been pushed and pushed and pushed. This isn\u2019t just about Donald Trump and stupid Americans. If it were, Nichols might have a point, but there\u2019s history here. It goes back to the Tea Party. The same things were being said years ago (and continue to be said) about Lee, Cruz, and others who dared to \u201cmake fools of themselves\u201d in their fight against the status quo, in their fight against tyranny.\n\nPeople are more angry now than they have been because they have been pushed and pushed and pushed. Let me explain a little something about human nature. When someone feels oppressed and controlled and you continue to belittle them and push them against the wall, they get angry. They\u2019re not going to be particularly rational at that point. They\u2019re in a corner and they lash out\u2014that\u2019s human nature. They fight. They get angry. They grab hold of whatever weapon they can find to defend themselves. That\u2019s what you mostly see with Donald Trump. It\u2019s anger, fueled by fear and stoked by insiders who continue to demean the base, who refuse to listen, and who want to maintain the status quo.\n\nAs I watch what\u2019s happening with the Trump phenomenon, I see it not just from a political point of view, but from a human one. Nichols says supporters of Trump and Tea Partiers are just a bunch of petty \u201cpedestrian\u201d narcissists who like to play the victim\u2014they\u2019re just stupid, enraged idiots. He\u2019s wrong.\n\nAs I watch what\u2019s happening with the Trump phenomenon, I see it not just from a political point of view, but from a human one. This reminds me of a toxic relationship between a man and a woman in which the man continues to control the woman, keeping her from speaking her mind, calling her stupid whenever she does. She tries to find ways to win her independence, to be heard, to be free, but he keeps pushing her back against the wall, telling her that she\u2019s the problem. Over time, the anger swells within her. She\u2019s afraid. She isn\u2019t free, and she hates it. She\u2019s powerless. Anytime she tries to stand up for herself, she is mocked and slapped down. Her fear resides. Her anger grows. Her hope recedes. One day, she just loses it. She lights a match and burns the whole house to the ground. Give me liberty or give me death takes on a whole new meaning in the context of oppression and abuse.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 12 Aug 2015 07:49:11 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The GOP has been stoking a fire under fed-up conservatives for years.
