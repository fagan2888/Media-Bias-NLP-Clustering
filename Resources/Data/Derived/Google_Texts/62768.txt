â€” A 29-year-old man serving time for second-degree murder escaped from the Brown Creek Correctional Institute early Saturday, according to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety.

Authorities said Kristopher McNeil, who was in the prison's minimum-security unit, was discovered missing shortly after midnight. They believe he scaled the facility's fence.

McNeil is serving a 14-year sentence for second-degree murder, and he was scheduled for release in 2018.

Anyone with information about McNeil's whereabouts should call local law enforcement officials or the Brown Creek Correctional Institution at 704-694-2622.
