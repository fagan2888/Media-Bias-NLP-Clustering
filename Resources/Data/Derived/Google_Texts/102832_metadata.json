I like who we are, what we\u2019re about. But that doesn\u2019t help Ram fans. The bottom line is, you have to win, and we\u2019re 0-2. This was obviously a tough one to swallow.\u201d\n\nThe game-winner was set up by a 45-yard run from senior Trey Watts to the CSU 20 with 19 seconds remaining. That play followed a lengthy delay when Tulsa wide receiver Keyarris Garrett had to be taken off the field by ambulance after suffering a leg injury.\n\nWatts finished with 152 yards rushing on 22 attempt and also led Tulsa in receptions with eight.\n\n\u201cIt is always tough to see someone go down like that, (Garrett) is one of my (team) brothers,\u201d Watts said of his 45-yarder. \u201cWe just had to keep moving forward and rally. I didn\u2019t want to go into overtime so I needed to help this team and make a play.\u201d\n\nTulsa had pulled to within a touchdown on a 23-yard field goal by Salazar with 13:12 remaining. Then, with 7:01 to go, Tulsa pulled even at 27-27 when sophomore wideout Derek Patterson nabbed a 15-yard touchdown pass from Cody Green.\n\n\u201cWe stalled as an offense,\u201d CSU quarterback Garrett Grayson said about being shut out in the fourth quarter. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.\u201d\n\nGrayson finished with just 12 completions in 29 pass attempts, for 108 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions.\n\n\u201cTo not generate anything in the fourth quarter is disappointing,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cWe had an opportunity to ice the game and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. But I\u2019m not going to pin this (loss) on Garrett. There were a lot of things that happened.\u201d\n\nSenior running back Chris Nwoke put the Rams up 27-17 by scoring on his third try from the 1-yard line with 50 seconds left in the third quarter. The bulk of the five-play, 52-yard Rams scoring drive came compliments of a 52-yard pass from Grayson to redshirt freshman receiver Jordon Vaden, who was tackled a yard shy of the goal line.\n\nCSU got two first-half touchdown passes from Grayson and two field goals by Jared Roberts. The first-half touchdowns receptions were the first college scores by senior tight end Joe McKay and Vaden.\n\nBoth teams must have entered the stadium feeling a sense of urgency. CSU was coming off a 41-27 to Colorado in Denver. Tulsa, the 2012 Conference USA champion, was shocked 34-7 at Bowling Green in its season opener.\n\nNext, Colorado State will host FCS program Cal Poly on Saturday at Hughes Stadium in the home opener. The Rams began Saturday\u2019s game knowing they needed a victory over the Golden Hurricane to have an opportunity to take a winning record into the Sept. 21 game at No. 1 Alabama.\n\nAn interception by Colorado State sophomore safety Trent Matthews at the CSU 12-yard-line with 32 seconds left in the second quarter preserved a 20-14 Rams halftime lead.\n\nColorado State had to play short-handed. Not making the trip were running backs Donnell Alexander and wide receivers Joe Hans ley and Charles Lovett. Alexander (hand) and Hansley (ankle) were injured in the season opener against Colorado.\n\nBut CSU got some big plays from players who were unproven or unheralded, or both, including McKay, Vaden and sophomore defensive tackle Joe Kawulok, who recorded a sack to stop a Tulsa possession.\n\nCSU got on the board first with a 2-yard pass from Grayson to McKay, capitalizing on a blocked punt by the Rams\u2019 Danny Nwosu at the Tulsa 2. But Tulsa tied the game with 7:18 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nTulsa then took the lead for the first time after Golden Hurricane defensive back Michael Mudoh intercepted a Grayson pass and returned it 9 yards to the CSU 33. Tulsa needed five plays to go up 14-7, the short drive completed by Cody Green\u2019s second touchdown pass, a 5-yard flip to Jordan James.\n\nAfter Vaden\u2019s second-quarter touchdown put CSU up 17-14, Tulsa wouldn\u2019t lead again until the final play of the game.\n\n\u201cI was just proud of our guys staying around, making the plays we had to,\u201d Tulsa coach Bill Blankenship said.\n\nWith a little help from Colorado State. Perhaps a lot of help.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU Rams fall to Tulsa on last-second field goal", "title": "CSU Rams fall to Tulsa on last-second field goal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/07/csu-rams-fall-to-tulsa-on-last-second-field-goal/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907__ColoradoStatevTU_001p1.jpg", "height": 449}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907__ColoradoStatevTU_001p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-07T21:07:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:03:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ca7\"", "article_summary": "Next, Colorado State will host FCS program Cal Poly on Saturday at Hughes Stadium in the home opener.\nTULSA, OKLA. \u2014 A 10-point underdog, Colorado State appeared in good shape entering the fourth quarter Saturday night, holding a 10-point lead on host Tulsa.\n\u201cWe stalled as an offense,\u201d CSU quarterback Garrett Grayson said about being shut out in the fourth quarter.\nAfter Vaden\u2019s second-quarter touchdown put CSU up 17-14, Tulsa wouldn\u2019t lead again until the final play of the game.\nThen, with 7:01 to go, Tulsa pulled even at 27-27 when sophomore wideout Derek Patterson nabbed a 15-yard touchdown pass from Cody Green."}
