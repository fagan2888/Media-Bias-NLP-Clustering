Although the present lack of prenatal screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) makes it difficult to administer the medication to at-risk fetuses, the effect observed in mice opens up a new world of possibilities for researchers and drug developers. \"This study validates the clinical trials using bumetanide to reduce chloride and restore strong GABAergic inhibition in humans with autism,\" he said. \u201cThis is one of the most promising clinical strategies for ASD currently available.\u201d\n\nThe study also sheds new light on the process whereby autism is thought to develop. During birth, a \u201cswitch\u201d mediated by oxytocin from the mother quiets the child\u2019s neurons, protecting the brain circuitry during the vulnerable first moment of life. But in autism, this \u201cswitch\u201d kicks in, and the child\u2019s neuronal connections take damage. It is believed that higher levels of chloride are responsible for this misfiring.\n\nThe study, which is published in the journal Science, shows that the chloride-lowering bumetanide prevents autistic behavior when administered to mice pregnant with mouse models of the disorder. According to Ben-Ari, this boosts confidence in the current theory of development as well as the possibility of a human cure. \"The observation that a single treatment of the mother before delivery prevents the expression of \u2026 features of autism in offspring illustrates the importance of conditions at delivery and the amazing long-term priming consequences of a wrong start,\u201d he explained.\n\nAutism Cure and Chloride\n\nThe current study is the latest in a growing series of responses to the alarming rise in U.S. autism diagnoses. Another example is a 2013 paper from Duke University, which shows that the risk of autism may be heightened in children born to mothers whose labor is induced or whose contractions are strengthened with procedures like hormone treatment. Scientists hope that these efforts will help dispel pseudo-scientific implications of vaccine schedules and bring the world closer to a cure for the disorder that costs the average caregiver tens of thousands each year.\n\n\"I think that an early diagnosis of ASD coupled with a drug such as bumetanide or other regulators acting to reduce aberrant brain activities that perturb neuronal activities are likely future therapies,\" Ben-Ari concluded.\n\nSource: Ben-Ari Y, Tsintsadze T, Khalilov I, et al.
