Sarah Palin wrote on Facebook, \u201cThe America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama\u2019s \u2018death panel\u2019 so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their \u2018level of productivity in society,\u2019 whether they are worthy of health care.\u201d\n\nThus, the \u201cdeath panels\u201d lie was born, and seven years later it still remains potent. According to a new poll from Public Policy Polling, 60% of Americans\u2014including 74% of Republicans and even 51% of Democrats\u2014still either believe in or are unsure about the existence of death panels.\n\nWhy are so many Americans still clinging to 2009\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year?\u201d Tens of millions of people are receiving health care thanks to the Affordable Care Act, with no evidence of seniors or disabled citizens being forced to end their lives early due to a panel of government bureaucrats.\n\nI commisioned this poll to clarify a key point in my new book, \u201cLies, Incorporated: The World of Post-Truth Politics.\u201d Discussions about corruption of our political processes often center around money and lobbying. Yet a third element, lies, specifically those lies that are strategically designed to distort the policy-making process, are ignored. There is in fact a group of individuals who have intentionally used falsehoods to hack our democracy for both financial and ideological gain, thus the title. In \u201cLies, Incorporated,\u201d I chronicle a series of these lies, profile the people who created them, and assess the damage they have caused.\n\nI could never have imagined a figure like Donald Trump would emerge a leader in the primary, even though I was familiar with his type. Like Trump in 2016, Betsy McCaughey in 2009 combined brazen falsehoods with a shamelessness that meant she never has to apologize for them.\n\nBetsy McCaughey also shared Trump\u2019s thirst for the spotlight. A former staffer from her time as lieutenant governor of New York said, \u201cA lot of politicians are out for the limelight, but Betsy\u2019s constant need twenty-four hours a day was something I\u2019d never seen.\u201d\n\nAlthough a mini fact-checking industry immediately sprang up to correct the record on death panels, the story\u2014like many of Trump\u2019s claims today\u2014proved stubborn. Even before Sarah Palin coined the term \u201cdeath panels,\u201d Politifact already declared the theory a \u201cridiculous falsehood\u201d rating it \u201cpants on fire.\u201d And McCaughey\u2019s death-panel lie was debunked within days by groups as diverse as the AARP and Media Matters for America, as well as by more than 40 major media outlets including The New York Times, USA Today, Associated Press, The Washington Post, CBS, and MSNBC.\n\nIn The Washington Post, Ezra Klein explained why Betsy McCaughey\u2019s lie caught fire in the media, a reason extremely familiar to those of us watching Trump in 2016: \u201cShe\u2019s among the best in the business at the Big Lie: not the dull claim that health-care reform will slightly increase the deficit or trim Medicare Advantage benefits, but the claim that it will result in Death Panels that decide the fate of the elderly, or a new model of medical ethics in which the lives of the old are sacrificed for the good of the young, or a government agency that will review the actions of every doctor,\u201d Klein wrote. \u201cMcCaughey isn\u2019t just a liar. She\u2019s an exciting liar.\u201d\n\nBeing an exciting liar led to media attention and numerous bookings not only with the conservative media, but also with ostensibly liberal venues like \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d It forced progressive organizations and news outlets like MSNBC to devote countless segments to debunking her falsehoods. Yet this seemed to instead perpetuate the lie, keeping it active.\n\nA further similarity between Trump and McCaughey is that she was already known as someone who played fast and loose with the truth about a Democratic president\u2019s healthcare policies.\n\nIn 1994 as a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, McCaughey excoriated the Clinton White House health care proposal in an article in The New Republic titled \u201cNo Exit.\u201d\n\nNewt Gingrich said McCaughey\u2019s New Republic piece was \u201cthe first decisive break point\u201d that led to the defeat of what conservatives derided as \u201cHillarycare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Misinformation spreads rapidly -- and intentionally -- in right-wing echo chambers.
