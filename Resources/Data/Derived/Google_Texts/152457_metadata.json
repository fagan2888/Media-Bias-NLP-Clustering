He denied a request filed Nov. 19 by 11 hospital systems.\n\nConsumers already have started signing up for the plans, which offer lower premiums than other Horizon plans and lower cost-sharing if consumers seek care from preferred hospitals and doctors, according to the order by Richard J. Badolato, acting commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance.\n\nHalting the plans\u2019 sales \u201cwould cause significant disruption in the healthcare market, especially for those who have already chosen to enroll or are considering enrolling in a plan using the OMNIA network,\u201d the order said.\n\nHorizon is by far the largest health insurer in the state, providing coverage to 3.8 million people.\n\nIt has projected first-year enrollment of 250,000 in the new plans, which group healthcare providers into two tiers \u2013 preferred and non-preferred \u2014 as a way to provide lower-cost coverage. Providers in the preferred tier agree to lower reimbursements from Horizon in exchange for seeing more patients, and some of them have formed a partnership with Horizon to share the savings.\n\nIn northern New Jersey, Hackensack University Medical Center and its affiliated hospitals \u2014 Englewood Hospital Medical Center, HackensackUMC at Pascack Valley and HackensackUMC Mountainside \u2014 along with St. Joseph\u2019s Healthcare System, are in the preferred, or Tier 1, network.\n\nHoly Name Medical Center in Teaneck and The Valley Hospital are in Tier 2, where consumers would still have coverage, but with higher deductibles, coinsurance and copayments. They are among the 17 hospitals challenging the state\u2019s approval of Horizon\u2019s plan, which was announced on Sept. 10.\n\nOMNIA plans are currently being sold to small businesses, government employees on the State Health Benefits Program, and individuals who buy their own coverage, including those who receive subsidies through federal marketplace for New Jersey set up by the Affordable Care Act. Coverage is set to begin at the first of the year.\n\nIn fact, one of Horizon\u2019s OMNIA plans has been used as the base plan to calculate the subsidies provided to every New Jersey customer on healthcare.gov who receives a subsidy. If it is removed, subsidies for everyone buying in the federal marketplace would have to be recalculated. That would require emergency action by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which runs the marketplace, Badolato\u2019s order said.\n\nThe hospitals that had requested the \u201cstay\u201d in the state\u2019s approval of the OMNIA plans now will take their case to the Appellate Division of state Superior Court, asking the court to reverse the state\u2019s action, their attorney said. The hospitals all are non-profit institutions that were excluded from Horizon\u2019s Tier 1, or preferred, network.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision\u2026 is disappointing but not surprising,\u201d said Steven M. Goldman, the former insurance commissioner who is their lead counsel. \u201cWe intend to continue to pursue a stay of [the department\u2019s] decision in the Appellate Division and correct what our clients believe to be a flawed process and network.\u201d\n\nThe hospital group had argued that the state had \u201cutterly abdicated\u201d its responsibility to protect the public interest, because they said Horizon\u2019s tiered-network plan threatens the financial viability of some Tier 2 hospitals, especially safety-net hospitals in urban areas. The loss of insured patients, who would choose to get their care at the preferred hospitals, would force some institutions to close, they said.\n\nThat possibility was \u201cextremely remote,\u201d Badolato wrote, and \u201csuch dire financial consequences are hyperbole at best.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed other arguments that the network didn\u2019t provide enough specialty services in obstetrics in all the geographic areas where its customers will live. After an appeal by Trenton-area lawmakers, the order said, the insurance department conducted a second, additional review of the network coverage and found it to be sufficient.\n\nTiered networks are common in New Jersey and the rest of the country, he said; the insurance department has approved 10 over the last five years. Horizon itself has sold coverage with a tiered network for the last two years, attracting about 3 percent of its customers, and no complaints have been received from consumers or from any hospitals, including those currently complaining, he said.\n\nA legislative hearing about the impact of tiered insurance networks is to be held by two Assembly committees \u2014 Health and Senior Services and Regulatory Oversight \u2014on Wednesday in Trenton.\n\nEmail: washburn@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The state Insurance Commissioner on Monday refused to halt sales of OMNIA health plans by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, saying it \u201cwould \u201cimmediately trigger chaos\u201d in the health-insurance market.
