Brokers feel pain of Obamacare\n\nAdd insurance brokers to the list of people stymied by HealthCare.gov.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a headache. It\u2019s their income.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSome brokers are waiting for the site to be fixed before they deal with clients using it. But those that are sticking with the arduous online enrollment journey are facing a new question: Will I get paid for this?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they don\u2019t like the insurance agents being involved. That\u2019s what it feels like,\u201d said Kelly Fristoe, a broker from Wichita Falls, Texas.\n\nBrokers say their clients are having trouble entering the right ID numbers in the balky website \u2014 and that\u2019s what\u2019s needed for the health plan to pay them.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\nAgents who have completed training and registration for the federal marketplace can help individuals and small businesses sign up for exchange plans. Federal navigators and in-person assisters are also trained to help. But brokers say they\u2019ve been dealing with insurance for years, and have expertise that lets them walk clients through the complicated new health plan terrain and explain it at a level that will really help people understand the specifics of their options.\n\nBrokers are supposed to be paid by insurance companies once a policy is in place and the first premium payment has been made. Brokers have contracts with the plans on their fees \u2014 and there can\u2019t be incentives to move people outside the exchanges.\n\n\u201cIf you want our guys to participate in the exchange and help people enroll \u2026 you\u2019re talking about a lot of time and resources on their part, which they\u2019re happy to do provided that they\u2019re compensated for their work,\u201d said Diane Boyle, vice president of government relations for the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors.\n\nBut those brokers\u2019 identification information is slipping through the HealthCare.gov cracks.\n\nPHOTOS: 10 Sebelius quotes about the Obamacare website)\n\nIn the chaotic days after the rollout of HealthCare.gov, many brokers were told by call center operators that they could not, or would not, enter a broker\u2019s identification, or the \u201cnational producer number.\u201d In other cases, the numbers seemed to be recorded \u2014 but then they got caught up in the problems with the corrupted \u201c834\u201d files that the exchanges send to the health plans with enrollment information.\n\nBoyle and other broker advocates were told Nov. 8 by the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight that call center operators had been notified of the mistake and instructed to accept brokers\u2019 numbers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has urged the call center assistants to record a broker\u2019s identification number during three-way calls with agents and their clients and has encouraged agents to notify the agency if they still encounter problems.\n\nStill, brokers say problems persist. Just last week, Fristoe was helping a client of four years sign up for an exchange plan when a call center operator told him that she could not enter his number. After being unable to resolve the problem on the phone, he and the customer gave up on the Web enrollment and switched to paper.\n\nIt can be even harder when consumers start enrollment by themselves and then reach out to a broker midway through the application, said Jessica Waltman, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Association of Health Underwriters. That may be an option for some of the hundreds of thousands of people who have completed applications online but haven\u2019t picked a plan.\n\nWATCH: Best lines from Obama\u2019s ACA mea culpa)\n\nPeople who started the application \u2014 without the broker \u2014 can\u2019t go back to enter the ID number if they end up seeking a broker\u2019s help. Without it, the broker doesn\u2019t get credit \u2014 and if there\u2019s a problem, the consumer protections wouldn\u2019t be in place either, Waltman said.\n\n\u201cIf they want to take action against somebody, they can\u2019t because they\u2019re not going to know who they are,\u201d she said.\n\nBoyle said she has been in touch with CMS about the problem. But until there\u2019s a solution or a good work-around, brokers may prefer to focus on their existing clients than to take on new clients trying to navigate a confusing new system. But that extra help may be what\u2019s needed, Boyle said, in helping uninsured people sign up.\n\nBoyle said brokers may be thinking, \u201cIf I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be compensated for additional outreach, why would I go in that direction?\u201d\n\nBrokers insist that it\u2019s in the interest of Health and Human Services \u2014 not just the interest of the brokers \u2014 to get the problem fixed and enlist the brokers\u2019 help in meeting the target of getting 7 million covered by the end of March.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019d just loosen up and let the agents be involved, then we would be able to show that we can get those numbers up to where they want those numbers,\u201d Fristoe said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Some sticking with the online enrollment journey face a new question: Will I get paid for this?", "title": "Brokers feel pain of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/health-insurance-brokers-obamacare-affordable-care-act-100016.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/11/18/131118_obamacare_insurance_brokers_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare (1022),Health Care (1804),Affordable Care Act (574)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Some sticking with the online enrollment journey face a new question: Will I get paid for this?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfeb\"", "article_summary": "Brokers feel pain of ObamacareAdd insurance brokers to the list of people stymied by HealthCare.gov.\nStory Continued BelowSome brokers are waiting for the site to be fixed before they deal with clients using it.\nBrokers have contracts with the plans on their fees \u2014 and there can\u2019t be incentives to move people outside the exchanges.\nBrokers are supposed to be paid by insurance companies once a policy is in place.\nBrokers are supposed to be paid by insurance companies once a policy is in place and the first premium payment has been made."}
