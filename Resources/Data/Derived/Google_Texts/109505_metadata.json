But many haven\u2019t been able to find a doctor, because Medicaid reimbursement rates are so low.\n\nBut now, one of Oregon\u2019s new Coordinated Care Organizations is increasing those rates, saying good primary care saves the CCO money.\n\nIn 2012, FamilyCare increased its reimbursement rates by 50 percent, in an effort to help customers find a primary care provider.\n\nPresident Jeff Heatherington says that increase worked so well, FamilyCare will now reimburse at or above the level of commercial insurers.\n\nTo illustrate how this will save his CCO money, he gives the example of non-compliant diabetics; people who are not following nutrition and exercise guidelines to manage their disease. Getting some patients to stick to this kind of common sense program takes time; time to establish a relationship, and encourage the patient to feel accountable. In the past, medicaid reimbursement was so low that many physicians couldn\u2019t afford this kind of time. Instead non-compliant patients might be transferred to the care of a specialist, to manage their symptoms with drugs or in other ways.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says Hetherington, \u201cthe primary care people are taking more time and saying, okay, let me work with you on this problem, rather than sending them off.\u201d\n\nHeatherington says help comes in the form of advice about better eating and exercise \u2014 not something, he says, for which a specialist is needed.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-cco-increases-medicaid-reimbursement-rates/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/jurrbcjbhrofccipklue.jpg", "description": "Many people on the Oregon Health plan haven't been able to find a doctor, because Medicaid reimbursement rates are so low.
