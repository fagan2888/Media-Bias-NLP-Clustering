But Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, the non-profit public-interest law firm representing the teachers along with the international law firm Jones Day, does not expect the unions to do so.\n\n\u201cThe next stop is the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Pell told The Daily Signal adding:\n\nThis ruling [from the 9th Circuit] happened much more quickly lhan we had a right to expect. It\u2019s a big step forward. The panel hit the nail on the head. There\u2019s nothing left for the 9th Circuit to do. This is a question of law that has already been decided so it has to go to the Supreme Court.\n\nPell said the teachers are likely to petition the Supreme Court to hear the case by early January and the court to decide whether to take it in March or April. A ruling would not be expected until 2016.\n\n>>> Teachers Hope to Erase Union Dues That Deny Free Speech\n\nRebecca Friedrichs, a fourth-grade teacher in Anaheim, and nine other state schoolteachers\u2013along with the Christian Educators Association International\u2013last summer sued the California Teachers Association, several local unions and the National Educational Association.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cagency shop\u201d law makes payment of union dues a requirement for public employment. The Daily Signal previously reported that Friedrichs and her co-plaintiffs argue the law is unconstitutional because it requires them to finance political activism they oppose.\n\nThe California Teachers Association, the largest affiliate of the National Education Association, has argued that non-union employees should pay \u201cfair share\u201d fees because non-union members benefit from union representation.\n\nUnder the California agency shop law, schoolteachers are not required to join the union, and they can opt out of the approximately 30 percent of dues the union acknowledges are overtly political.\n\nCalifornia teachers, who typically spend up to $1,000 a year in dues, can apply for a refund and generally receive $300 to $400 back. But Friedrichs has said this process brings scrutiny and stigma from the union and colleagues.\n\nPell said that, beginning in the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court essentially \u201ccarved out an exception to the First Amendment\u201d where labor law is concerned in a series of decisions that culminated in the 1977 Abood v. Detroit Board of Education ruling.\n\nIn the interest of maintaining \u201clabor peace,\u201d the court reasoned, it was necessary to guard against \u201cfree-riders\u201d who might dissent from the union position but still benefit from the collective-bargaining process.\n\nFinancial disclosure forms show the California Teachers Association spent more than $211 million on political activities from 2000 through 2009.\n\nThe union spent more than $26 million to oppose Proposition 38, a ballot measure that would have created a school-voucher program in California.\n\nThe union spent $50 million in 2005 to oppose three measures, one of which would have made changes to the probationary period for new teachers and another having to do with school-funding requirements. More closely related to this case, the third ballot initiative would have prohibited use of agency fees for political contributions without workers\u2019 consent.\n\nFriedrichs and several of the other teachers who filed suit have resigned from the California Teachers Association and now belong to the Christian Educators Association International.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An appeals court ruling allows teachers who object to paying for certain union political activity to take their case to the nation's highest court.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An appeals court ruling allows teachers who object to paying for certain union political activity to take their case to the nation's highest court.", "title": "Teachers' Challenge of Union Political Spending Advances", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Unknown3-1250x6501.jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-11-23T15:40:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xVguuq"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An appeals court ruling allows teachers who object to paying for certain union political activity to take their case to the nation's highest court.", "title": "Teachers' Challenge of Union Political Spending Advances", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Unknown3-1250x6501.jpeg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "constitution", "published_time": "2014-11-20T03:01:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T15:40:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "California, Supreme Court, 9th Circuit, NEA, CTA, teachers unions, Rebecca Friedrichs, Jones Day, Center for Individual Rights"}, "article_summary": "Friedrichs and several of the other teachers who filed suit have resigned from the California Teachers Association and now belong to the Christian Educators Association International.\nFinancial disclosure forms show the California Teachers Association spent more than $211 million on political activities from 2000 through 2009.\nThe teachers unions could ask the full 9th Circuit to reconsider the panel\u2019s ruling.\nThe California Teachers Association, the largest affiliate of the National Education Association, has argued that non-union employees should pay \u201cfair share\u201d fees because non-union members benefit from union representation.\nCalifornia teachers, who typically spend up to $1,000 a year in dues, can apply for a refund and generally receive $300 to $400 back."}
