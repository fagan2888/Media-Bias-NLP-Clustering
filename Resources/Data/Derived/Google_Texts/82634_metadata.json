I\u2019ll amplify my critique here.\n\nLet me say at the outset that I very much admire Richard Epstein for his plethora of creative insights and his dogged determination. The reader of his essay will find much of interest. But I think that Epstein\u2019s larger points are unsound.\n\nAs his subtitle (\u201cRight Results, Wrong Reasons\u201d) indicates, Epstein\u2019s \u201cthesis is that the five-member majority reached the right result, albeit for the wrong reasons\u201d (p. 38). Let\u2019s consider his arguments:\n\n1. Epstein contends that it was \u201ca serious mistake\u201d for Justice Alito to have \u201cfound it unnecessary to decide whether the government had a compelling interest in imposing its contraceptive mandate\u201d (p. 38). According to Epstein, Alito should simply have concluded that the government had no compelling interest.\n\nEpstein makes an extended libertarian argument that the federal government has no legitimate interest in \u201ccompel[ling] employers to make payments \u2026 that violate their religious beliefs when the very services at issue are freely available elsewhere\u201d (p. 52; see generally pp. 50-58). (Yes, given the \u201corganized repressive regimes in the Old South,\u201d the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was justified as \u201ca perfectly sensible second-best solution, but one that should not be kept in place now that the coercive institutional structure of segregation has been dismantled\u201d (p. 66).)\n\nThe short answer to Epstein\u2019s argument that Alito should have ruled on this basis is that Alito doesn\u2019t have four colleagues who are Richard Epstein. Indeed, the most obvious explanation for Alito\u2019s choice to assume arguendo the existence of a compelling interest, despite arguments to the contrary (see posts at 2.a here) that most justices would find much more appealing than Epstein\u2019s, is that Alito couldn\u2019t get a majority to hold that the HHS mandate didn\u2019t serve a compelling governmental interest. (Epstein doesn\u2019t mention Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion, which, though rather opaque, certainly doesn\u2019t signal that Kennedy was ready to make a majority on this point.)\n\n2. Epstein contends that Alito not only shouldn\u2019t have reached the least-restrictive-means inquiry but also \u201cconcluded, wrongly,\u201d that the government \u201cfailed to choose the least restrictive means for its implementation\u201d (p. 38). In a somewhat different criticism later, Epstein asserts that Alito\u2019s least-restrictive-means argument \u201cis at best incomplete because it brought no scrutiny to the overall system that it validated\u201d (p. 59 (emphasis added).\n\nContrary to Epstein\u2019s misunderstanding, Alito didn\u2019t \u201cvalidate\u201d the overall system of the HHS mandate. Epstein thinks that Alito\u2019s reliance on the accommodation for religious nonprofits as a less restrictive means requires Alito to have concluded that the accommodation satisfies RFRA. But he\u2019s simply wrong on that point, for the reasons I\u2019ve spelled out (see also point 3 here).\n\n(This error of Epstein\u2019s leads him further astray, as he wrongly asserts that Justice Sotomayor \u201cmay be right about the flip-flop\u201d in the Wheaton College order (p. 51) and that \u201cAlito should have been trapped \u2026 and Wheaton College sent packing\u201d (p. 67).)\n\n3. Epstein even faults Alito on his substantial-burden analysis. According to Epstein, the \u201ccorrect analysis does not look at the cost of noncompliance, which may be high, but at the cost of compliance, which in monetary terms is far lower\u201d (p. 46). In his libertarian universe, \u201cit is hard to think that any explicit requirement that someone perform an action that violates his or her core religious beliefs could ever be dismissed as an insignificant burden\u201d (p. 48 (emphasis in original).\n\nI think that Epstein is clearly wrong to assert that it is somehow improper to look at the cost of noncompliance. Hobby Lobby and its owners were facing massive fines for noncompliance with the HHS mandate. How can it possibly be improper to look to those fines to conclude that the HHS mandate substantially burdens their adherence to their religious beliefs?\n\nFurther, is there any reason to think that Alito would have gotten a majority for the aggressive libertarian position Epstein advances?\n\n4. On the question whether a corporation is a person entitled to protection under RFRA, Epstein finds it \u201cregrettable\u201d that Alito \u201cdid not make explicit reference to the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, which certainly applies to this case\u201d (p. 44). But Alito reached his conclusion through ordinary statutory analysis. There was no need to reach for a constitutional trump. (Epstein supports his assertion that the notoriously difficult doctrine of unconstitutional conditions \u201ccertainly applies to this case\u201d only by citing his own law-review article.)\n\n5. While I\u2019m at it, let me note a few more errors or confusions. (I\u2019m not being exhaustive.)\n\nIn the second sentence of his opening paragraph, Epstein asserts that the Court in Hobby Lobby held that RFRA \u201cprecluded [HHS] from issuing regulations under the Affordable Care Act that required Hobby Lobby \u2026 to supply health insurance coverage for contraceptive and abortion services \u2026.\u201d (Emphasis added.) No, the Court didn\u2019t hold that RFRA precluded HHS from issuing the HHS mandate. It held merely that RFRA entitled Hobby Lobby to an exemption from the mandate.\n\nOne sentence later, Epstein asserts that \u201cRFRA would not have applied at all if the ACA had explicitly required employers to observe the contraceptive mandate, because the latter specific statute would be a congressional trump of the earlier general statute.\u201d That assertion is highly dubious at best. In a provision that Epstein is apparently unaware of, RFRA bolsters the already-robust presumption against implied repeal by stating that any repeal or override of its protections must be explicit: \u201cFederal statutory law adopted after November 16, 1993, is subject to this chapter unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this chapter.\u201d\n\nEpstein refers to \u201cJustice Antonin Scalia\u2019s sharp about-face on the Free Exercise Clause in the 1990 case Employment Division v. Smith.\u201d The passage would seem to suggest that Epstein is contending that Scalia himself reversed his position (did a \u201csharp about-face\u201d) on the Free Exercise Clause.

In a provision that Epstein is apparently unaware of, RFRA bolsters the already-robust presumption against implied repeal by stating that any repeal or override of its protections must be explicit: \u201cFederal statutory law adopted after November 16, 1993, is subject to this chapter unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this chapter.\u201d\n\nEpstein refers to \u201cJustice Antonin Scalia\u2019s sharp about-face on the Free Exercise Clause in the 1990 case Employment Division v. Smith.\u201d The passage would seem to suggest that Epstein is contending that Scalia himself reversed his position (did a \u201csharp about-face\u201d) on the Free Exercise Clause. I\u2019m guessing that Epstein means instead that the Supreme Court, as a result of Scalia\u2019s majority opinion, reversed its position.", "card": "summary", "title": "Contra Richard Epstein on Hobby Lobby, by Ed Whelan, National Review"}, "tweettext": "Contra Richard Epstein on Hobby Lobby", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Contra Richard Epstein on Hobby Lobby", "keywords": "Ed Whelan", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Contra Richard Epstein on Hobby Lobby, Ed Whelan, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Ed Whelan, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8dc\"", "article_summary": "How can it possibly be improper to look to those fines to conclude that the HHS mandate substantially burdens their adherence to their religious beliefs?\nNo, the Court didn\u2019t hold that RFRA precluded HHS from issuing the HHS mandate.\nAccording to Epstein, Alito should simply have concluded that the government had no compelling interest.\nHobby Lobby and its owners were facing massive fines for noncompliance with the HHS mandate.\nContrary to Epstein\u2019s misunderstanding, Alito didn\u2019t \u201cvalidate\u201d the overall system of the HHS mandate."}
