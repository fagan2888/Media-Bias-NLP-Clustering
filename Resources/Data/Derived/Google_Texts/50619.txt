Twitchy regular Eric Boehlert from the perpetually aggrieved Media Matters is at it again, this time with an inane and ludicrous strawman argument comparing the story of Navy SEAL hero Chris Kyle to that of alleged deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl:

RW media: criticizing American Sniper or the military is unpatriotic!! RW media: Sgt Bergdahl is traitor who deserved to die in Afghanistan — Eric Boehlert (@EricBoehlert) January 28, 2015

Sheesh. What is it about the film “American Sniper” that causes lib heads to explode?

And this, in light of Boehlert’s tweet, is a legit question:

@EricBoehlert you're not a smart man, are you? Because if you don't see the difference… — brent mohrman (@motrbotr) January 28, 2015

Actually, we’re not entirely sure if Boehlert does see the difference between “American Sniper” and Sgt. Bergdahl, but we hope he does.

We’ll end it with this strawman example of our own:

@EricBoehlert Liberals: Bergdahl is a hero and a true patriot! Liberals: Chris Kyle was a cold blooded killer who deserved to die! — PolitiWars (@politiwars) January 28, 2015

Heh.
