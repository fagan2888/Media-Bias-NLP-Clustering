Two-thirds of the Obamacare exchange\u2019s enrollments have been for the expanded Medicaid program, adding over 70,000 Oregonians to the plan.\n\nBut state officials have been manually sending the information incorrectly and incompletely for months, and thousands of applicants to the Citizen/Alien Waived Emergent Medical program, which provides services to low-income individuals without a legal immigration status, were given full coverage under Medicaid instead.\n\n\u201cIt never works perfectly the first time out,\u201d Oregon Health Authority manager Kathleen Paul said Friday. \u201cWe were just getting people into the services.\u201d\n\nCover Oregon has been battling it out with Maryland\u2019s Obamacare exchange for having the most glitch-ridden Obamacare rollout in the country, despite both deep-blue states immediately adopting and implementing Obamacare, supplied with millions of early innovator grants courtesy of federal taxpayers.\n\nThe state\u2019s health department, the Oregon Health Authority, which tracks Oregon Health Plan members, was supposed to communicate electronically with the Obamacare exchange. But the electronic interface was one of the many parts that didn\u2019t work on the exchange.\n\nUntil several weeks ago, state officials have been sending information incorrectly and incompletely for months, Paul said. State officials are fixing the enrollment glitch manually on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
