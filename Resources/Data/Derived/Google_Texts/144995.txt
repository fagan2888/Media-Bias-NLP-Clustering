STORM LAKE, Iowa -- A heated debate took place Thursday night as the two candidates running for the 4th District congressional seat met up for their first and only debate.

Republican congressman Steve King and his Democratic challenger Jim Mowrer met in Storm Lake for the IPTV debate.

During the debate King and Mowrer went back and forth on things like Obamacare, the environment, Ebola, ISIS, and immigration. They were also given the chance to respond to allegations made in the other candidate’s campaign ads

"The claims made in that ad are simply false. Of course he doesn't cite anything. He claims I support Nancy Pelosi, which I do not. He claims I support the Affordable Care Act, which I have publicly stated I have a lot of problems with. And again he claims I support amnesty, which no one proposes. So again he doesn't understand the definition of amnesty,” said Mowrer.

King said, "No member of Congress that I know of gets free health care for life, none. No member of Congress while I was there had the opportunity to vote for free health care for life. No member of Congress had the opportunity to vote on a raise while I was there. I had one opportunity to freeze my pay. I did that. My pay has been frozen since 2009."

Initially King refused to take part in the debate because of a Mowrer ad he claimed was false.

Mowrer's campaign did not pull the ad, claiming everything in it was backed up by King’s voting record.
