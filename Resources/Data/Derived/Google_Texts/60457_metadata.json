Just make sure you're practicing proper pool safety when dealing with harmful chemicals designed to keep out bacteria and infectious pathogens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a report revealing that inhalation of pool chemicals sends an estimated 5,000 to the emergency room each year.\n\n\"Chemicals are added to the water in pools to stop germs from spreading. But they need to be handled and stored safely to avoid serious injuries,\" chief of CDC's Healthy Swimming Program, Michele Hlavsa said in a statement.\n\nResearchers from the CDC used data from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) to estimate the number of emergency room visits caused by exposure to pool chemicals in the United States. Approximately 4,247 people were sent to the emergency room due to pool chemical-related injuries each year between 2003 and 2012. In 2012 alone, 4,876 Americans visited an emergency room following pool chemical exposure, half of which were people under the age of 18.\n\nAlthough no deaths were reported, a majority of the injuries reported to the NEISS were poisoning diagnoses caused by the inhalation of vapors, fumes, or gases. Over a third of the injuries occurred at a residence and around 75 percent were documented between Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends. Emergency room patients treated for injuries reported handling pool chemicals without protective equipment, entering water directly after pool chemicals were added, and keeping pool chemicals within the reach of children.\n\nOne case reported to the Minnesota Department of Health occurred in December 2013 during a child\u2019s birthday party. After the party was held at an indoor hotel swimming pool and spa, 12 people who attended the party had developed rashes and symptoms of respiratory illness. Following a questionnaire answered by telephone, it was revealed eight out of the 10 people injured had developed a red rash all over their body. The most common respiratory symptoms included headache, cough, sore throat, vomiting, and trouble urinating.\n\nThe CDC offered effective steps for preventing pool chemical injuries for residential pool owners and public pool operators:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pool, chemical, injuries", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The CDC has offered steps for preventing pool chemical-related injuries after around 5,000 people visited an emergency room in 2012.", "title": "Pool Chemicals Send 5,000 People To The ER Each Year, Half Of Which Are Children And Young Adults", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pool-chemical-injuries-skin-eye-and-repiratory-injuries-related-pools-send-over-2000-children-and", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/pool-chemical-injuries.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The CDC has offered steps for preventing pool chemical-related injuries after around 5,000 people visited an emergency room in 2012.", "title": "Pool Chemicals Send 5,000 People To The ER Each Year, Half Of Which Are Children And Young Adults", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pool-chemical-injuries-skin-eye-and-repiratory-injuries-related-pools-send-over-2000-children-and", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/pool-chemical-injuries.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/pool-chemical-injuries.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-16T10:15:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T10:15:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The CDC has offered steps for preventing pool chemical-related injuries after around 5,000 people visited an emergency room in 2012."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab7a\"", "article_summary": "Emergency room patients treated for injuries reported handling pool chemicals without protective equipment, entering water directly after pool chemicals were added, and keeping pool chemicals within the reach of children.\nAlthough no deaths were reported, a majority of the injuries reported to the NEISS were poisoning diagnoses caused by the inhalation of vapors, fumes, or gases.\nApproximately 4,247 people were sent to the emergency room due to pool chemical-related injuries each year between 2003 and 2012.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a report revealing that inhalation of pool chemicals sends an estimated 5,000 to the emergency room each year.\nThe CDC offered effective steps for preventing pool chemical injuries for residential pool owners and public pool operators:"}
