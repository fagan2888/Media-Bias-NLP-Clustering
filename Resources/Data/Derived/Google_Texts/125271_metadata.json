Right now, our hospitals are reimbursed 98 cents on the dollar by Medicare and 76 cents on the dollar by Medicaid. Those figures are not going up. The challenge is to transform the way we deliver services without losing quality within that payment framework.\u201d\n\nSomething that could help boost New York\u2019s outcomes and financial fragility would be a forged agreement between the federal government and New York\u2019s Medicaid/Medicare Redesign Team that\u2019s currently awaiting approval.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo announced New York had reached an agreement in principal with the feds on a Medicaid Redesign Team (MRT) waiver. It will allow the state to reinvest $8 billion in federal savings generated by MRT over five years to help hospitals transition into healthcare systems. \u201cWe hope to have a final decision on this soon,\u201d said Kroll.\n\nKroll said it was vitally important to get as many New Yorkers signed up on ACA, particularly its Millennials, (25-34 age group) who traditionally bypass health insurance. \u201cThey\u2019re young and healthy, so they don\u2019t think they need it, but by signing on, they are guaranteeing they are protected \u2013no one is invulnerable to a health crisis\u2014and helping to pay for the program for all New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nObamacare has hit many bumps in the road\u2014from a mediocre rollout of the program with a multi-million website with a multitude of miscues and states overwhelmed by applications they cannot process quickly enough. There are also concerns it will leave currently insured employees without insurance, since many companies are dropping their own healthcare programs and encouraging employees to buy healthcare through the exchange system.\n\nTo date, New York has taken in over 745,000 completed applications and gotten 456,000 people enrolled. In the meantime, those who are undocumented aliens will continue to use their local emergency room for healthcare, while thousands of others will slip through the cracks, making too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to pay for healthcare. \u201cI thought Obamacare was going to help cover everyone,\u201d said one RBA member after the presentation. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to come to terms with how I am going to pay $25,000 a year for my family under the new law\u2026it doesn\u2019t seem \u2018affordable\u2019 at all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Rockland County Times", "description": "\u201cNo person turned away\u201d breaking hospitals\u2019 banks BY KATHY KAHN How are hospitals faring under the Affordable Care Act?
