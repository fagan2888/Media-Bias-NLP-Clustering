Every now and again, somebody in Washington says something that manages to be, not only catastrophically stupid, but offensive on so many levels that partisan debates about whether or not such was stupid and offensive should not even be possible.

The latest to do so is Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-GA).

Wait until you hear this.

Speaking with John Bachman of Newsmax TV, Westmoreland was asked why he and members of the G.O.P. house felt they would be able to get their bill, which seeks to permanently defund Obamacare, through the Senate, as well as how they planned to get President Obama to sign it.

Westmoreland began by stressing that they were "not waiting until the last minute" and that they were "not trying to jam the Senate." He then proceeded to list all of his reasons for disliking Obamacare, all without actually answering the question.

Instead of repeating the question that Westmoreland ignored, Bachman stressed that "there's only ten days until this apocalyptic moment when the government supposedly is going to shut down, government might default for the first time in history. To the people who say that you guys kind of are waiting to the last minute here with only ten days to go, what do you say?"

To that, Westmoreland responded (I kid you not) with this:

Well, God created the world in seven days.

What exactly is Westmoreland implying by this? That we should trust God to pass a budget deal? Or that, if God can do it, so can Congress?

Again, this is that exceptionally rare, very special kind of stupidity that absolutely should not be partisan. It's dumb no matter what angle you look at it from.
