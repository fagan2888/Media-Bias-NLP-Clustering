LANDOVER HILLS, Md. (AP) — Relatives, friends and dignitaries from the United States gathered to remember the heroic actions of a surgeon who died after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.

Dr. Martin Salia died Nov. 17 after being flown to a hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. Salia was a permanent U.S. resident who chose to work in his native Sierra Leone because the need for surgeons there was so great.

White House Ebola response coordinator Ron Klain was among those who spoke Saturday at a funeral Mass for Salia at his family’s parish in Maryland. Klain says Salia was among the greatest of heroes because he voluntarily risked his own life to help others. Klain also read a personal message from President Barack Obama.
