In a state where just one percent of the population identifies as Jewish, it can be tough just to find a religious community, let alone a politically active one. Although older Jews who may have been activists in the civil rights movement of the 20th century still live there, it appears their coordinated work for justice ended along with that era. There is no sustaining, Jewish-identified organizational infrastructure that today\u2019s generation of younger North Carolina Jews could revive and harness for today\u2019s fights.\n\nBut recently one Raleigh-based Jewish group has tapped into a wellspring of political passion among Jews and is mobilizing them across the state to challenge the Republican takeover of the legislature. Through building coalitions with other faith and community-based groups, turning Jews out to the Moral Mondays rallies at the state capitol and organizing laypeople and rabbis to take action, the members of Carolina Jews for Justice (CJJ) are speaking up for the political changes they want to see in North Carolina.\n\nThrough building coalitions with other faith and community-based groups, turning Jews out to the Moral Mondays rallies at the state capitol and organizing laypeople and rabbis to take action, the members of Carolina Jews for Justice (CJJ) are speaking up for the political changes they want to see in North Carolina.\n\nCJJ president Debbie Goldstein describes the loose but committed network of grassroots volunteers that maintains this activity. \u201cThere are eight or 10 of us that keep the day-to-day work going, 20 of us that come all the time and 100 that come out to a rally,\u201d she says. Goldstein adds that while CJJ\u2019s regular meetings are held in Raleigh and Durham, it claims members from all over the state, including the metro regions of Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Asheville and Greensboro.\n\nFaith in Action\n\nMax Socol, CJJ\u2019s 27-year-old co-founder, grew up in Greensboro and now lives and works in Raleigh as principal of a temple-based school. His organizing pedigree, though, dates back to his living and working in Israel in 2008-2009 with Israel-Palestine Creative Regional Initiatives (IPCRI). From there, he moved to Washington, DC, where there were plenty of opportunities to work for social justice but no consensus among those who were doing the work. \u201cThere were two moments,\u201d he says, \u201cthat crystallized for me the idea that it would be useful to advocate for justice from a Jewish perspective.\u201d\n\nThe first such moment, he says, was at the Occupy DC encampment, where Socol attended meetings and tried to make his voice heard. \u201cMy overall experience with that movement was, \u2018Gee, I\u2019ve never met so many people who have similar political opinions, but have such a hard time communicating with each other,\u201d Socol says. \u201cAll of us wanted to address economic inequality in a public, hands-on way; but despite that, we couldn\u2019t get through a single organizing meeting! We didn\u2019t have a single touchstone with which to communicate.\u201d Socol says that this prompted him to re-examine how a shared commitment to Jewish ritual and practice might become such a touchstone.\n\nSocol became active in the DC Jewish community, attending Shabbat dinners where people discussed how to support the Occupy movement. \u201cI\u2019m actually getting more done,\u201d he remembers thinking to himself. \u201cOrganizing within the Jewish community allows me to leapfrog these communication barriers because we understand each other.\u201d\n\nSocol\u2019s second moment of clarity came when he approached a mentor about using Torah as the foundation for taking action and organizing others to work for social justice. He was apprehensive, he told his mentor, about being so bold as to \u201cpoliticize the texts\u201d \u2013 in other words, to interpret and apply Torah to modern struggles for economic and social justice. \u201cShe laughed in my face,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said, \u2018Have you ever even read the book of Jeremiah?\u2019\u201d Socol saw what she meant and decided to embrace a social-justice interpretation of Torah. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend,\u201d he adds, \u201cthat Jeremiah is only speaking metaphorically when he says a society that fails to care for the poor is doomed.\u201d\n\nSocol\u2019s faith-driven activism found some willing partners in the Jewish community when he moved back to Raleigh in 2012. As liaison for his congregation\u2019s social action committee, Socol says he couldn\u2019t sit by as the committee organized simple acts of charity while hard-right Republicans swept to power at the statehouse. The new state majority, backed by wealthy North Carolina businessman Art Pope, began passing tax cuts for the wealthy and moved right along to gutting voters\u2019 rights. Socol asked the committee to consider taking a political stance. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s great that we send 10 volunteers down to serve at the food pantry every month, but there\u2019s a reason that there\u2019s greater need at the food pantry. Are we in any way going to express unhappiness with the new tax plan?\u2019\u201d\n\nCJJ president Debbie Goldstein had had a similar moment a few years ago when it became clear that Jews in her state needed to speak out. \u201cThe debate over immigration reform was to me very disturbing in North Carolina,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just seemed like candidates were fighting over who could be more anti-immigrant. It shocked me.\u201d Goldstein says she began attending regular events with Jewish social activists in Raleigh and met some others who wanted to become politically engaged. \u201cThere was a proposal two years ago to have a constitutional amendment that would limit the right of gay people to marry. That also bothered me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt pushed many Jews to take a political position where they had never taken a position before.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, along with a few people from his own congregation who were interested in doing political work, Socol began reaching out to social action committees at area congregations and a group formed that became the executive board of CJJ.\n\nA Growing Movement\n\nFortunately, North Carolina\u2019s legacy civil rights movement institutions had been marshaling their supporters and resources to provide an opportunity for CJJ to take action in concert with other progressives from around the state. The NAACP\u2019s Rev. William Barber, North Carolina\u2019s most vocal progressive leader and other labor and community activists have spent the past six years crafting a 15-point progressive policy agenda. This helped to create a \u201cbig tent\u201d under which Jewish and other faith-based activists could organize for change. Beginning in 2012, the policy agenda formed the basis for a series of weekly rallies at the state capitol that became known as Moral Monday Marches (or Moral Marches when they aren\u2019t held on a Monday). Following its initial board meetings in 2012, CJJ began recruiting Jews from around the state to come to the Moral Monday Marches.\n\nThe agenda, known as Historic Thousands on Jones Street (or HK on J), serves as both a list of policy demands and a rallying cry for the state\u2019s grassroots progressives. \u201cIf you believe in unabridged voting rights for every citizen, expanding our democracy, fighting against the forces that would attempt to steal, segregate and suppress our vote, you should march with us,\u201d reads a Web banner ad for the most recent Moral March, which took place February 8. CJJ responded to the call, turning out 130 Jews from across the state for a Shabbat morning service before the march, which was on a Saturday. Total crowd estimates for the march ranged from 25,000 to 80,000.\n\nGoldstein has found the Moral Marches to be an exciting moment for Jewish progressives in the state, especially in the cities of Raleigh and Durham. Despite being just a 30-minute drive apart, Goldstein says that \u201cin many ways the communities are isolated and separate. It (the Moral Marches) just made me feel like I was part of something bigger. It was empowering to say we can do something to mobilize the Jewish community.\u201d Goldstein adds that a group of rabbis from around the state have been working with CJJ, signing statements of support and working with their congregations to encourage participation. \u201cSeveral rabbis have really been phenomenal and willing to write sermons and bring their congregations out and help CJJ to make this really be something in North Carolina,\u201d she says.\n\nThough it is politically non-partisan, CJJ\u2019s mission includes the statement, \u2018We work to influence policy at the local and state levels and encourage individuals and Jewish institutions to take a stand on important issues in our community.\u2019\n\n\u201cI think the big change that we have brought is that we have reconnected the Jewish community to the broader political community in North Carolina,\u201d Socol says. \u201cThat connection had become weak. We were kind of limited to a once a year visit from the Jewish legislators.\u201d Socol adds that CJJ welcomes a diversity of levels of Jewish observance, acknowledging that approaching social justice activism from a place of Jewish religious identity may not be for everyone. \u201cThere are plenty of folks in CJJ who wouldn\u2019t ever bring up faith as why they are activists,\u201d he said. \u201cI tend not to challenge that. I say that for me, it\u2019s important that this [work] come from a place of faith.\u201d\n\nCJJ includes some core Jewish teachings in its statement of principles, with a foundation composed of three primary teachings: B\u2019tzelem Elohim (In the image of G-d), meaning all human beings are created in the Divine image and that members follow the Torah\u2019s requirements to \u201cput ourselves in the position of others and to protect their fundamental rights and dignity as carefully as we protect our own.\u201d CJJ also holds as central the teaching to \u201cLove thy neighbor as thyself\u201d; the teaching of \u201ctikkun olam\u201d; and the value of kehillah, or community. Though it is politically non-partisan, CJJ\u2019s mission includes the statement, \u201cWe work to influence policy at the local and state levels and encourage individuals and Jewish institutions to take a stand on important issues in our community.\u201d\n\nBeing the one percent\n\nBut Socol adds that working among other faith groups, even as progressives, in a state that is 79 percent Christian-identified and one percent Jewish-identified has its challenges. \u201cFor me personally, the biggest unexpected challenge is how thoroughly infused progressive politics are in this state with Christianity and with evangelical Christianity in particular. I wasn\u2019t expecting it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we first got going, I had people asking me, how are we going to be comfortable at these rallies where Jesus is being invoked all the time. I thought, we all get through our daily lives just fine \u2013 we\u2019ll just put a little asterisk in our minds next to the prayers! In actually attending these rallies I\u2019ve realized that yeah, it\u2019s challenging. It\u2019s that same communications barrier that I experienced at Occupy \u2013 people really don\u2019t know much about Judaism or Jews in North Carolina. We are more likely to experience casual anti-Semitism. People will make an off the cuff remark, and somebody takes it the wrong way and all of a sudden you have a little dustup that you\u2019ve got to clear up between people who are really on the same team.\u201d\n\nSocol explained that it helps to view some of these tensions in the historical context of the civil rights movement in North Carolina. \u201cMy gut feeling,\u201d he says, \u201cis that you cannot separate progressive activism in the South from the civil rights movement. People who are the top level organizers in progressive organizing in the South today are people who grew up in the civil rights movement. And that movement is integrally Christian. That\u2019s the reality of where that movement comes from. Particularly when we work with the NAACP, it\u2019s only natural that they view their work as Christian work. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s only in the South \u2013 the difference is that it\u2019s all the more pervasive because of our civil rights history. I think that\u2019s a gain, not a loss.\n\n\u201cI grew up in Greensboro. I grew up going to that Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter in downtown Greensboro. And I learned not only that it was important, but that it happened here. On my doorstep. Civil rights is a part of what we do. And when it comes to Christianity, I just have to be careful that I don\u2019t say anything that makes an assumption about somebody else\u2019s beliefs.\u201d\n\nSocol adds that his response as a CJJ organizer is to proudly wear the outward signs of his Jewish faith, hoping his visibility can help other Jews see that they have a place in the movement for social justice. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to be uncomfortable with being identified as Jewish,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody is going to intimidate me into not appearing Jewish. I\u2019m out there with my kippeh and my tallis. Others may be less comfortable with that.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge CJJ has faced is how to mobilize younger Jews. \u201cI can count on two hands the number of young people who have come out to CJJ events,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve hosted a couple of events with local young professionals groups to try to bring people in. But where the rubber meets the road and we need people to come out and register voters or come out to a rally, younger folks just aren\u2019t in the mix.\u201d\n\nSocol adds that CJJ organizers continue to try to get Jews from across the state involved with social justice work on whatever level makes sense for individuals. \u201cIf you want to be able to come out to a Moral Monday rally, we have this big banner that says CJJ and you can come and stand with us and be in photos, or you can drift away and no one will be the wiser.\u201d Socol says CJJ meetings include some text study to anchor the social justice work in Jewish practice and ritual. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s the point,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to have a common language. We also make sure to include texts that are not Jewish altogether for people who are not religiously inclined.\u201d\n\nMoving Ahead\n\nCJJ organizes and raises public awareness around issues of economic justice and inequality. But Socol says the word \u201cunion\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily helpful in doing this work. \u201cThe language around labor rights is really different in the South. We\u2019re one of the least unionized states in the country. The South is the least unionized region of the country. It\u2019s not uncommon to meet somebody who identifies as liberal and also identifies as anti-union.\u201d Goldstein says that, with this in mind, CJJ has chosen to focus on achieving policy goals that would lessen inequality, such as fighting for better access to healthcare through Medicaid (which the NC legislature declined to expand using the money available through the Affordable Care Act). They also try to speak up for teachers, who have come under attack in the state. \u201cNorth Carolina always had a reputation for being a strong supporter of public education,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a real regression here. Salaries are very low.\u201d\n\nRaising awareness of and getting more Jews involved in, policy issues that affect regular and poor North Carolinians is one of CJJ\u2019s major goals for the next year. To this end, they are already mobilizing teams of people in Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill to register voters and make sure people have the proper identification to comply with the state\u2019s new Voter ID law. Raising money to make the work sustainable is another pressing goal. \u201cOur funding is zero dollars,\u201d Socol says, laughing. \u201cWe are developing a fundraising plan.\u201d\n\nThis piece was reprinted with permission from Tikkun Daily.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carolina Jews for Justice is mobilizing the Jewish minority across the state to join the Moral Mondays campaign to challenge the Republican takeover of the legislature.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "Carolina Jews for Justice is mobilizing the Jewish minority across the state to join the Moral Mondays campaign to challenge the Republican takeover of the legislature.", "title": "We Want to Have a Common Language: Carolina Jews for Justice Stand Out in the Moral Mondays Crowd | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Raleigh1.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-04-22T10:28:21-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/03/03/we-want-to-have-a-common-language-carolina-jews-for-justice-stand-out-in-the-moral-mondays-crowd/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carolina Jews for Justice is mobilizing the Jewish minority across the state to join the Moral Mondays campaign to challenge the Republican takeover of the legislature.", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Raleigh1.jpg", "title": "We Want to Have a Common Language: Carolina Jews for Justice Stand Out in the Moral Mondays Crowd | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Activism", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-03-03T10:09:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-22T10:28:21-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140303, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4c6\"", "article_summary": "There is no sustaining, Jewish-identified organizational infrastructure that today\u2019s generation of younger North Carolina Jews could revive and harness for today\u2019s fights.\n(AP Photo/The News & Observer, Chuck Liddy)It can be isolating to be a progressive Jew in North Carolina.\n\u201cNorth Carolina always had a reputation for being a strong supporter of public education,\u201d she says.\nIt\u2019s that same communications barrier that I experienced at Occupy \u2013 people really don\u2019t know much about Judaism or Jews in North Carolina.\n\u201cThe debate over immigration reform was to me very disturbing in North Carolina,\u201d she says."}
