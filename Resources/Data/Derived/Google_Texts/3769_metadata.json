It opens at 4:30, but it\u2019s often slow until closer to 6:30, when the church across the street begins serving hot meals for homeless people.\n\nThe inside of this RV has been retrofitted so there\u2019s an exam room, a nurse\u2019s station and a waiting area. A generator gives off a droning buzz as it powers this efficient little clinic.\n\nRebecca Callantine, 23, is one of the first patients to arrive one afternoon. She hopes to get an inhaler. But before the doctor sees her, Callantine tells the nurse that lately she\u2019s been feeling lightheaded, even nauseous. It\u2019s gotten more frequent since she\u2019s been homeless.\n\nCallantine came up from Oregon a year ago for a job, but that fell through. Since then she\u2019s been struggling to find work and has been without a home. Callantine and her boyfriend sleep in their truck.\n\nThe expansion of Washington state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act has helped homeless people like Callantine access medical care, but having no home or stability makes staying well more complicated.\n\nDiabetes runs in Callantine\u2019s family, so the nurse checks her blood glucose, and asks how often she\u2019s able to eat. Callantine and her boyfriend come to Salvation Army twice a month for free hot meals. In between, they rely on food stamps. They try to make it last two weeks. Three weeks, if they\u2019re lucky. The nurse asks how they make it last.\n\n\u201cYou only eat once a day, pretty much,\u201d Callantine said. \u201cYou try to spend like $10 a day. You shop at the Dollar Tree \u2013 a lot.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what kind of food they get at the dollar store, Callantine answered chips, cheese, hot dogs \u2013 mostly junk food. They\u2019ve given up going to the food bank because most of the items require a microwave oven or a can opener which they don\u2019t have.\n\nAsking about meals may seem trivial, but the answers are revealing. \u201cThat\u2019s one question I routinely ask: How many times a day do you eat?\u201d said Dr. Sarah Vanston, a family physician on the mobile medical van. \u201cWhich seems strange, but it really helps you gauge what type of medication you\u2019re going to use and how you\u2019re going to have them take it.\u201d\n\nIn her practice, Vanston has to tailor her medical treatment to fit each person\u2019s living situations. \u201cEverything gets compounded when you live on the streets, your car, or in a motel. You\u2019re in survival mode,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in survival mode, all these things fall by the way side. All you care about is where you\u2019re going to sleep that night, is it going to be safe, and where are you going to get something to eat.\u201d\n\nVanston said in many ways her patients lack the same necessities as people in developing nations: access to food, drinking water, a place to clean up and a roof over their heads.\n\n\u201cSometimes the only thing you can do is bear witness to their experience. And that is really hard to do sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cAs somebody who\u2019s trained to be a doer, that was one of the biggest challenges for me.\u201d\n\nVanston has been seeing patients at the mobile medical van since the program started six years ago. She said treating homeless patients isn\u2019t always straight-forward.\n\nShe recalled trying to prescribe insulin to a 60-year-old man to help control his diabetes. The medication goes bad if it\u2019s not kept at a certain temperature, and the man was living in his truck. So Vanston spent some time brainstorming with the patient to come up with ideas to keep his insulin cool and usable.\n\nLacking basic necessities isn\u2019t the only problem for the patients of the mobile medical van, said its program manager, John Gilvar. Many struggle with untreated mental illness or substance abuse, sometimes both.\n\n\u201cJust imagine if you have cognitive impairment or if you have schizophrenia, and you\u2019re living literally in a storage container in the back of some lot somewhere, how can you follow all the directions, all the steps and then travel from office to office to get care?\u201d he said.\n\nGilvar said Medicaid expansion has given patients more access to providers, including specialists. But some have many other underlying problems that Medicaid can\u2019t address.\n\nBack at the nurse\u2019s station, the nurse notes Rebecca Callantine\u2019s blood pressure and blood glucose. She then asks Callantine how she\u2019s been feeling in the last couple of weeks, to screen for possible signs of depression.\n\nRebecca tells the nurse she\u2019s getting frustrated about not being to find work. She said sometimes, it feels like businesses won\u2019t even consider hiring them because they\u2019re homeless. \u201cLike the Sub shop, they\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re not hiring.\u2019 Well, can we at least get an application? \u2018No, we\u2019re not giving out applications.\u2019 Seriously, you\u2019re not even going to give out applications?\u201d\n\nThe nurse listens. She said after the doctor, she\u2019ll have Callantine meet with one of the social workers in the van. After that, Callantine plans to head over to the church for her only meal of the day.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "About twice a month, King County\u2019s Mobile Medical van comes to Renton.
