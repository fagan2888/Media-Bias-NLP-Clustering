CREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nMore women than ever are using long-term forms of birth control \u2014 and it could be thanks to Obamacare.\n\nA new federal report found the amount of women using \u201clong-acting contraception\u201d \u2014 specifically, an intrauterine device (IUD) or a contraceptive implant \u2014 quadrupled between 2002 and 2013. A record 11.6 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 44 used an IUD or implant in 2013 \u2014 up from around 7 percent in 2012.\n\nWhile these types of birth control aren\u2019t as widely used as condoms (15 percent) or birth control pills (26 percent), they are growing in popularity far faster than any of their competitors. The 2013 study found both condom and birth control use significantly down compared to 2002 numbers.\n\nCREDIT: Alyson Hurt/NPR\n\nIUDs and implants have proven to be so popular because of their effectiveness \u2014 at 0.05 percent, they have the lowest pregnancy rate of all other contraception methods. Part of the method\u2019s success lies in the simplicity. After initial insertion, some women can keep the same IUD for up to ten years \u2014 without any maintenance. This factor has made IUDs and implants an increasingly popular suggestion in programs aimed at decreasing unwanted pregnancies in developing countries andcommunities where regular health care options are hard to find.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t explicitly point to the cause of this surge, but expanded federal coverage \u2014 along with growing medical support \u2014 could be major contributing factors.\n\nIn 2012, the Affordable Care Act made sure all that health plans offered by employers and by state-level marketplaces covered contraception costs \u2014 phasing out co-pays for around 47 million women. This led to women saving an estimated $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs for contraception in 2013. Broken down, that means the average woman is saving $255 per year for pills or $248 per year for an IUD.\n\nAnd while exemptions to this mandate, based on employers\u2019 religious beliefs, remain on the the Supreme Court docket, a July decision allowed employees of anti-contraception organizations to continue to access birth control on the government\u2019s tab.\n\nA strong backing by the medical community has also helped boost understanding and use of IUDs. A slew of major medical organizations have sung this method\u2019s praises in recent years. The American Academy of Pediatrics updated its teen pregnancy prevention guidelines last year to encourage pediatricians to recommend IUDs and implants to adolescent women before any other contraceptive. And in 2011, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists deemed IUDs the \u201cmost effective forms of reversible contraception available.\u201d\n\nMany anti-abortion organizations have recently worked to demonize IUDs , encouraged by the contentious Hobby Lobby case that sparked a spread of erroneous information claiming IUDs can trigger abortions. But, in most cases, the use of any kind of contraception actually prevents future abortions by decreasing the rate of unintended pregnancy.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Long-term contraception use quadrupled between 2002 and 2013.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Long-term contraception use quadrupled between 2002 and 2013.", "title": "Has Obamacare Contributed To A New Spike In Contraceptive Use?", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/11/10/3720881/iud-use-quadruples/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10105319/shutterstock_193541405-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Long-term contraception use quadrupled between 2002 and 2013.", "creator": "@alex_zee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10105319/shutterstock_193541405-321x214.jpg", "title": "Has Obamacare Contributed To A New Spike In Contraceptive Use?", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10105319/shutterstock_193541405-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10105319/shutterstock_193541405-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-10T11:52:08+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/alexzielinskireporter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "While these types of birth control aren\u2019t as widely used as condoms (15 percent) or birth control pills (26 percent), they are growing in popularity far faster than any of their competitors.\nHealth Has Obamacare Contributed To A New Spike In Contraceptive Use?\nCREDIT: ShutterstockMore women than ever are using long-term forms of birth control \u2014 and it could be thanks to Obamacare.\nThe 2013 study found both condom and birth control use significantly down compared to 2002 numbers.\nA new federal report found the amount of women using \u201clong-acting contraception\u201d \u2014 specifically, an intrauterine device (IUD) or a contraceptive implant \u2014 quadrupled between 2002 and 2013."}
