The fourth annual survey of directors shows a Medicaid program that continues to \"evolve, improve and innovate at a rapid pace,\" according to a report from the nonprofit association that represents leaders of state Medicaid agencies across the U.S.\n\nHere's what the survey showed:\n\nPayment and delivery system reform is at the top of Medicaid agency innovations.\n\nAgencies are moving to performance-based reimbursement models within both traditional fee-for-service care delivery and managed care.\n\nHigh priorities for states include patient-centered medical homes, health homes, alignment of physical and behavioral health, super-utilizer programs and population health.\n\nTop issues for four-fifths of the agencies include managed long-term services and support and managed behavioral health programs.\n\nFederal programs designed to improve population health include the Pioneer ACO program, the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement and the Medicaid Shared Savings Programs. While innovation is also taking place at the state level, most directors cite factors such as limited staffing, data and systems infrastructures, administrative budgets and complex procurement processes as barriers to innovation.\n\nAs FierceHealthPayer previously reported, one such innovative program is taking place in New York, where Medicaid officials are investing more than $1 billion in a five-year program aimed at transforming how providers coordinate to take a more active role in caring for members' health.\n\nWhile they take on more responsibilities, director salaries remain flat, according to the survey. About two-thirds of Medicaid agency chief executives earn between $100,000 and $150,000 a year. That's a factor that may hurt the Medicaid program's success, as one report suggested states should review program directors' compensation levels, which do not compare with salaries of top health insurance executives.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the survey results\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMedicaid directors' inadequate pay may hurt program's success\n\nNew York Medicaid tests pay-for-performance method that pairs competing providers\n\nTop health insurance CEO pay exceeds $10 million in 2014\n\nDespite political wrangling, the public likes Medicaid and Medicare programs", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some of the biggest shifts and improvements in government healthcare programs may be happening at the state level, according to a\u00a0new survey.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Some of the biggest shifts and improvements in government healthcare programs may be happening at the state level, according to a\u00a0new survey.", "title": "Survey of Medicaid directors shows innovations in state programs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/survey-medicaid-directors-shows-innovations-state-programs/2015-11-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Medicaid directors,Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP,National Association Of Medicaid Directors,patient-centered medical homes,payment reform", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP"}, "article_summary": "In 2015, nearly 60 percent of Medicaid directors across the country spent half or more of their time working on major payment, delivery system or programmatic reforms, according to a survey by the National Association of Medicaid Directors.\nTop issues for four-fifths of the agencies include managed long-term services and support and managed behavioral health programs.\nThe fourth annual survey of directors shows a Medicaid program that continues to \"evolve, improve and innovate at a rapid pace,\" according to a report from the nonprofit association that represents leaders of state Medicaid agencies across the U.S.\nFederal programs designed to improve population health include the Pioneer ACO program, the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement and the Medicaid Shared Savings Programs.\nSome of the biggest shifts and improvements in government healthcare programs may be happening at the state level, according to a new survey."}
