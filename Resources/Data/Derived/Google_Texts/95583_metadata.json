These plans tend to have lower monthly premium payments for their enrollees than traditional health plans.\n\nBut they also require enrollees to pay more in out-of-pocket charges when they obtain health services than what they are required to pay under traditional plans. The minimum deductible for a high-deductible plan is $1,300 for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for family coverage.\n\n\n\nBenefitfocus' report was based on an analysis of actual 2015 enrollment data from about 500 employers with more than 1,000 workers apiece. In all, the report reflects enrollment choices of more than 700,000 workers.\n\nHigh-deductible plans have become increasingly common in recent years as companies and insurers look for ways to control health spending. The plans are seen as encouraging more careful shopping for and consumption of health services, such as by opting for a generic drug as opposed to a brand-name prescription.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Millennials are more likely to enroll in high-deductible health plans but put less money into health savings accounts than older workers.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Millennials are the biggest fans of high-deductible plans but put the least amount of money into health-savings accounts.", "title": "Who loves big deductible health plans", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/12/young-workers-like-those-high-deductible-health-plans.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/12/103385317-GettyImages-595348491.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Millennials are the biggest fans of high-deductible plans but put the least amount of money into health-savings accounts.", "title": "Young workers like those high-deductible health plans", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/12/young-workers-like-those-high-deductible-health-plans.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/12/103385317-GettyImages-595348491.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Health Insurance, Employee Benefits, Obamacare, US: News, Benefitfocus Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-02-16T09:00:00-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2016-02-16T11:13:51-0500", "tag": "Benefitfocus Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 103385305, "news_keywords": "Health insurance, Obamacare, deductible, generic drugs, HSA, health savings accounts"}, "article_summary": "These plans tend to have lower monthly premium payments for their enrollees than traditional health plans.\nHigh-deductible plans have become increasingly common in recent years as companies and insurers look for ways to control health spending.\nBenefitfocus also found that younger workers were much more apt to choose the high-deductible option when given the choice.\nThe minimum deductible for a high-deductible plan is $1,300 for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for family coverage.\nBut they also require enrollees to pay more in out-of-pocket charges when they obtain health services than what they are required to pay under traditional plans."}
