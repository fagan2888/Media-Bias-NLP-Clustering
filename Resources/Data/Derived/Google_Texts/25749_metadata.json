The man\u2019s only ailment was a neurological condition similar to multiple sclerosis which causes him to occasionally have slurred speech and an unsteady walk.\n\nHe ended up being held in custody for several days for being \u201cmentally ill and dangerous\u201d when it later was revealed in a hearing that \u201cGoines had no mental illness and should not have been confined,\u201d Rutherford reported on Friday.\n\nA case brought on his behalf for an illegal detention, however, was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, which \u201cgranted a motion [for dismissal] filed by police officers, the Valley Community Services Board and one of its mental health screeners.\u201d\n\nThe court found the police didn\u2019t violate the law by taking a sane, if not fully healthy, man into custody on suspicion of mental health issues.\n\nRutherford officials had argued that the defendants violated clearly established law protecting citizens from \u201cunjustified mental-health seizures.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy giving government officials the power to declare individuals mentally ill and detain them against their will without first ensuring that they are actually trained to identify such illness, the government has opened the door to a system in which involuntary detentions can be used to make people disappear,\u201d said John Whitehead, chief of the Institute.\n\nIt\u2019s time for \u201cPolice State USA: How Orwell\u2019s Nightmare is Becoming our Reality,\u201d by Cheryl Chumley, who chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, government officials in the Cold War-era Soviet Union often used psychiatric hospitals as prisons in order to isolate political prisoners from the rest of society, discredit their ideas, and break them physically and mentally,\u201d Whitehead said.\n\nGoines\u2019 affliction is cerebellar ataxia, and as a result he \u201chas difficulty at times with his balance, causing him to walk unsteadily, speaks slowly and with a slur and has problems with fine motor skills.\u201d\n\nBut he has no cognitive impairment and is of above-average intelligence, the report from Rutherford noted.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling granted qualified immunity to the officers and others who \u201cwrongfully arrested, strip searched, handcuffed to a table\u201d Goines.\n\nHe was locked up for five days in a mental health hospital against his will \u2013 and with no access to family and friends, Rutherford reported.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment lawsuit explained that it was on May 15, 2014, when Goines had difficulty with his cable service. He called the company, and a technician told him a neighbor had spliced into his service, suggesting Goines call police.\n\nHe walked across the street to the Waynesboro Police Department to report the theft, and one responding officer said Goines was having \u201cmental-health issues.\u201d\n\nThe officers asked him if he wanted to talk to someone, and Goines, thinking they meant about the cable theft, agreed.\n\nInstead of addressing the theft, the officers handcuffed him and took him to the Augusta County Medical Center, where he was interviewed by a screener who was not a licensed medical professional, clinical psychologist or social worker.\n\nHe then was taken to the Crossroads Mental Health Center where he was held until a later hearing found he had no mental illness.\n\nWND reported earlier that the lawsuit named the Valley Community Services Board, VCSB \u201cintake clinician\u201d Jenna Rhodes and police officers David Shaw, Robert Dean and D.L. Williams as defendants.\n\nThe complaint noted, \u201cThe impacts of cerebellar ataxia are purely physiological. The disorder does not affect Goines\u2019 cognitive functioning.\u201d\n\nIt charges that the officers \u201cignored or did not take the time to understand Goines\u2019 complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the time of the seizure, transportation and detention of Goines, none of the defendants had probable cause to believe that Goines had committed any crime, nor did any defendant have probable cause to believe that Goines was a danger to himself or others, nor did any defendant have any other legitimate lawful basis to seize, arrest or detain him,\u201d the complaint stated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A federal court has refused to help a man who was arrested, essentially, for being sick.
