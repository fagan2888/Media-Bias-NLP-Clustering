Jon Runyan (R-Mount Laurel) four years ago.\n\nRunyan, who has served two terms, is not seeking reelection.\n\nDemocratic organizations are hopeful they can flip the district and have given their support to Burlington County Freeholder Aimee Belgard, a former Edgewater Park councilwoman who rode Obama\u2019s coattails to an upset freeholder win in 2012.\n\nBelgard, 40, has locked up key endorsements from the Burlington and Ocean County Democratic committees and was given priority status by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Emily\u2019s List, which funnels campaign contributions to pro-choice women Democrats.\n\nCiting economic issues as voters\u2019 main concern, Belgard said in an interview that her top issues are improving recovery efforts for victims of superstorm Sandy and preventing a future Base Closure and Realignment Commission from potentially shuttering parts of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.\n\n\u201cThere's a current fear that the Joint Base, which is the second-largest employer in this state, and the largest employer in South Jersey, may face another BRAC process potentially in 2017,\u201d she said. \u201cOr even worse than that, may face decommissioning of certain missions there, which may ultimately result in basically padlocking the base, which would just be extremely detrimental to the folks in this district and even surrounding areas.\u201d\n\nHer Democratic opponents are Howard Kleinhendler, a Lakewood attorney who ran in the 4th Congressional District in 2010, and Bruce Todd, a Lyndon LaRouche activist.\n\nSteve Lonegan and Tom MacArthur are vying for the Republican nomination.\n\nKleinhendler, 51, an ordained Orthodox rabbi turned New York litigator, has positioned himself to the left of Belgard. He defends the Affordable Care Act, advocates creating a public option through Medicare, and is calling for increasing Sandy aid, taxing corporations\u2019 overseas revenue, giving amnesty to undocumented workers and boosting veterans benefits.\n\nA Lakewood resident, he would have to move to the 3rd District if he won the seat. In 2010, he challenged the 4th District\u2019s longtime congressman, Rep. Chris Smith (R-Robbinsville), earning 28 percent of the votes to Smith\u2019s 66 percent.\n\nTodd, 64, a retired millwright from Ocean Township, ran for lieutenant governor last year and said he previously ran for office on a LaRouche ticket in the 1970s. He\u2019s calling for Wall Street reform, Obama\u2019s impeachment and more nuclear power plants.\n\nBelgard has ignored her primary rivals and run a low-key campaign so far, with little media spending and no television commercials. That has allowed her to save her funds for the general election, when candidates will have to spend heavily in both the Philadelphia and New York TV markets.\n\nWith help from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who headlined a February fundraiser for her and two other candidates in Philadelphia, Belgard has raised over $400,000, with $230,000 coming in the first quarter of 2014. She received about $121,000 from the Democrats\u2019 AmeriPAC and other political action committees.\n\nBelgard had $326,000 in the bank and had spent $77,000 as of March 31, including $10,000 on a fundraising consultant.\n\nBy contrast, MacArthur, who was ahead of Lonegan in a recent Monmouth University poll, has already loaned his campaign $2 million and run several commercials.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats rallying around Belgard, and avoiding an expensive primary that the Republicans are engaged in, matters here even more than in other districts,\u201d said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute of New Jersey Politics at Rider University. \u201cBelgard is able to conserve her resources.\u201d\n\nWhile she declined to discuss Kleinhendler, Belgard has begun working to motivate her base with attacks on House Republicans. Last month she took aim at Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s budget plan, criticizing proposals to flatten tax rates, turn Medicare into a voucher program and cut education funding.\n\n\u201cThis budget proposal could mean that a family trying to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy destroyed their lives could actually see their taxes go up. That\u2019s simply unacceptable,\u201d she said in a press release. \u201cWe must work together to find ways to balance the budget without crippling job creation, slashing Medicare and raising taxes on middle-class families.\u201d\n\nAn attorney and the daughter of a Vietnam vet, Belgard said she would also work to improve services for veterans and defend Social Security and Medicare, while bringing a woman\u2019s voice to the state delegation. New Jersey has not had a female House representative in more than a decade and has never had a woman senator.\n\nBelgard lost both her parents to cancer and served on the board of the American Cancer Society Eastern Division, which led to her entry into politics. She and her husband have two young sons.\n\nKleinhendler argued that voters do not know Belgard, especially in Ocean County, and said she has failed to take meaningful positions that will motivate voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the better candidate to stand up to the Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think she can go toe-to-toe in debates with whoever emerges, whether it's Lonegan or MacArthur. I don\u2019t think she has the skills or the backbone really to stand up for the platform that I think is going to win.\u201d\n\nBut Belgard said she is well-known in Burlington County and has been doing frequent outreach in Ocean County.\n\n\u201cPeople are absolutely starting to get to know my name,\u201d she said. \u201cI've been at events recently where I've had people approach me and say, \u2018Oh, you know, I've been waiting to meet you.\u2019 I think people are really receptive to this race out there.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Belgard has experience persevering through tough elections. The Burlington County freeholder board has been dominated by Republicans for decades, and in her first run in 2010 she lost to a Republican incumbent by 4 points, or more than 5,000 votes.\n\nWhen she ran again two years later, in an expensive race noted for negative TV ads, she and another Democrat romped to victory over much better-funded Republicans who received contributions from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson\u2019s Super PAC. Belgard was the top vote-getter with 26 percent, or over 100,000 votes, while the two Republicans garnered fewer than 92,000 each.\n\nPresident Obama was at the top of the ticket in 2012, helping the Democratic field. Dworkin noted that U.S. Sen. Cory Booker will be running for his first full term this fall, which could motivate some Democrats to go to the polls again, but the Obama assist will be gone.\n\n\u201c2014 is obviously not a presidential year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an uphill battle for Belgard.\u201d\n\nThe 3rd District is the state\u2019s most competitive by party registration, with 27 percent of voters registered as Democrats, 25 percent Republicans and 48 percent unaffiliated.\n\nPresident Obama won the district twice, but local voters split their ballots in 2012, reelecting Runyan by a 9-point margin. He bested Democrat Shelly Adler, whose late husband Jon Adler had been ousted by Runyan in a narrower vote two years earlier.\n\nOne issue Belgard has not highlighted but which is sure to figure into the general election is the Affordable Care Act. Lonegan and MacArthur have made the law\u2019s repeal central to their campaigns.\n\nIn a November radio interview with Belgard, WPHT talk show host Dom Giordano criticized Belgard for giving vague responses to complaints about the law. The National Republican Congressional Committee picked up on his comments to attack her.\n\nBelgard said she\u2019s aware of the problems with the ACA and advocates improving transparency efforts, small business options and the CHIP program for children. But she also said voters appreciate the ACA\u2019s coverage guarantees, and cited examples of uninsured people who could not afford cancer treatment and a teenage leukemia survivor whose coverage for chemotherapy-related surgery was limited by payment caps.\n\n\u201cPeople understand that, and they don't want to turn back the clock on that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's more of an issue of what we can do to fix the Affordable Care Act going forward, as opposed to repealing it like my opponents on the other side are seeking to do.\u201d\n\nBelgard\u2019s website barely mention healthcare reform, but Kleinhendler has seized on the issue, describing the Affordable Care Act as \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d In addition to advocating a public option, he argues for improving tax benefits for small businesses and individuals who buy health insurance and other reforms.\n\n\u201cI think it is a strength,\u201d he said of the law. \u201cI believe the best defense is an offense. As opposed to what Ms. Belgard has done, I think we hold up the Obamacare banner, point out the good things it's done and show how we're going to make it better and address the criticism. That's the play.\u201d\n\nKleinhendler loaned his campaign $11,000 in the first quarter and received $2,700 in contributions. He has spent about $6,000 and has $8,000 cash on hand.\n\nTodd, a resident of the Waretown section of Ocean Township, ran for lieutenant governor with independent gubernatorial candidate Diane Sare last year. He said he previously ran for state Assembly and Congress on LaRouche\u2019s U.S. Labor Party ticket four decades ago.\n\nIn his platform, Todd prioritizes restoration of the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking to curtail Wall Street speculation and prevent future recessions, and the impeachment of President Obama for what Todd portrays as dangerous provocations of Russia and China. He also favors building hundreds of nuclear power plants and supports work at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab to develop clean fusion energy.\n\nTodd, who has not filed federal campaign finance reports, said it is difficult for an independent candidate like himself to get exposure. He said he frequently talks with voters on the street and attends political, labor and community events to introduce himself.\n\n\u201cThe point is to get out and to really rally the people of the country to turn the country around,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause clearly we\u2019re very much on the edge of extinction as a nation.\u201d\n\nThe candidates\u2019 websites are www.belgardforcongress.com, www.hkcongress.com and www.toddforcongress.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/14/0520/2347"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "With incumbent not seeking reelection, race is one of few in which Republican-held seat is considered at risk", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2af3\"", "article_summary": "A Lakewood resident, he would have to move to the 3rd District if he won the seat.\nPresident Obama won the district twice, but local voters split their ballots in 2012, reelecting Runyan by a 9-point margin.\nNew Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District has one of the few Republican seats up for grabs in this year\u2019s election \u2014 not just in New Jersey but nationally.\nKleinhendler argued that voters do not know Belgard, especially in Ocean County, and said she has failed to take meaningful positions that will motivate voters.\nTodd, a resident of the Waretown section of Ocean Township, ran for lieutenant governor with independent gubernatorial candidate Diane Sare last year."}
