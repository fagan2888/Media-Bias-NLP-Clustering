Market participants in the six states that had severe exchange glitches [Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon] are worse off by approximately $750 per participant on an annualized basis, relative to participants in other states with their own exchanges.\n\n\n\nI find suggestive evidence that participants in states that allowed renewal of non-grandfathered plans are worse off than participants in other states. I also find inconclusive evidence that participants in states with pre-ACA community rating and guaranteed issue regulations are better off than participants in other states.\n\n\n\nI find further inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of having more insurers in the pre-ACA state market.\n\n\n\nAlthough impacts within each state are likely to change over the course of 2014 as coverage, costs, and premiums evolve nationally, I expect that the differential impacts that we observe across states will persist through the rest of 2014.\n\nVisit this interactive map to explore ACA adverse selection state-by-state.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is Justin Wolfers, co-editor of the Brookings Papers on Economic Policy, talking about the paper:\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about this paper and the other papers being discussed at the conference today, including research on credit policies in a housing debt crisis, and geographic variation in health care spending as it relates (or doesn't) to the quality of the health care system. On the second day of the conference, conference attendees will discuss papers on Social Security benefits indexing, eurozone integration, and labor force participation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Brookings Panel on Economic Activity began on Thursday with discussion among leading economists and policymakers about a paper by Amanda Kowalski on the early impact of the Affordable Care Act, particularly whether the impact of ACA differed across states due to their key decisions on ACA implementation.", "title": "BPEA Paper Looks at Early Impact of the Affordable Care Act", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "The Brookings Panel on Economic Activity began on Thursday with discussion among leading economists and policymakers about a paper by Amanda Kowalski on the early impact of the Affordable Care Act, particularly whether the impact of ACA differed across states due to their key decisions on ACA implementation.", "title": "BPEA Paper Looks at Early Impact of the Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brookings-now/posts/2014/09/bpea-paper-early-impact-affordable-care-act", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/blogs/2014/brookings%20now/09/map_aca/map_aca_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "website", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Brookings Panel on Economic Activity began on Thursday with discussion among leading economists and policymakers about a paper by Amanda Kowalski on the early impact of the Affordable Care Act, particularly whether the impact of ACA differed across states due to their key decisions on ACA implementation.", "title": "BPEA Paper Looks at Early Impact of the Affordable Care Act", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/research/files/blogs/2014/brookings%20now/09/map_aca/map_aca_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 151106990}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"geographiesspecialized": "U.S. States and Territories", "title": "BPEA Paper Looks at Early Impact of the Affordable Care Act", "geographiesbroad": "U.S. States and Territories", "topicsbroad": "Health", "geographies": "U.S. States and Territories ; U.S. States and Territories", "broadcontenttype": "Commentary ; Blog Posts", "authors": "Fred Dews", "contentdate": "2014/09/11 09:15:00", "topicsspecialized": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "topics": "Health ; The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"}, "article": {"tag": "U.S. States and Territories", "published_time": "2014-09-11", "modified_time": "2014-9-12"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde76b\"", "article_summary": "I find further inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of having more insurers in the pre-ACA state market.\nI find suggestive evidence that participants in states that allowed renewal of non-grandfathered plans are worse off than participants in other states.\nI also find that the impact of setting up a state exchange depends meaningfully on how well it functions.\nThe Brookings Panel on Economic Activity began on Thursday with discussion among leading economists and policymakers about a paper by Amanda Kowalski on the early impact of the Affordable Care Act, particularly whether the impact of ACA differed across states due to their key decisions on ACA implementation.\nI also find inconclusive evidence that participants in states with pre-ACA community rating and guaranteed issue regulations are better off than participants in other states."}
