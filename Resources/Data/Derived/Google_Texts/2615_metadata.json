The system\u2019s hospitals in West Virginia are the Bluefield Regional Medical Center, Greenbrier Valley Medical Center in Ronceverte, Williamson Memorial Hospital and Plateau Medical Center in Oak Hill.\n\nBluefield Regional Medical Director of Marketing Becky Ritter released the following statement Monday evening from Community Health System:\n\n\u201cLimited personal identification data belonging to some patients who were seen at physician practices and clinics affiliated with Bluefield Regional Medical Center over the past five years was transferred out of our organization in a criminal cyber attack by a foreign-based intruder. The transferred information did not include any medical information or credit card information, but it did include names, addresses, birth dates, telephone numbers and social security numbers.\u201d\n\nRitter said they have no reason to believe the data will ever be used. All impacted patients are being notified by mail and being offered free identity theft protection.\n\n\u201cOur organization believes the intruder was a foreign-based group out of China that was likely looking for intellectual property. The intruder used highly sophisticated methods to bypass security systems. The intruder has been eradicated and applications have been deployed to protect against future attacks. We are working with federal law enforcement authorities in their investigation and will support prosecution of those responsible for this attack,\u201d Community Health System said.\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that his office would protect those who may have had their information compromised.\n\n\u201cIf you believe you were affected by this data breach, it will be very important to check your statements carefully,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cBe on the lookout for things like being billed for medical items you never ordered or received, or if you\u2019re being billed multiple times for certain procedures or items.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health system offering free identity theft protection.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Health system offering free identity theft protection.", "title": "Patient information hacked at 4 hospitals in WV", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2014/08/18/patient-information-hacked-at-4-hospitals-in-wv/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/metronews/images/metronews-default-color.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-18T22:09:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T22:09:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7daa\"", "article_summary": "By Jeff Jenkins in News | August 18, 2014 at 6:09PMBLUEFIELD, W.Va. \u2014 Patient information from four southern West Virginia hospitals is part of information hacked from more than 200 hospitals in the U.S.\nThe system\u2019s hospitals in West Virginia are the Bluefield Regional Medical Center, Greenbrier Valley Medical Center in Ronceverte, Williamson Memorial Hospital and Plateau Medical Center in Oak Hill.\nThe Community Health System announced Monday information on 4.5 million patients from its computer network was taken earlier this year.\nThe transferred information did not include any medical information or credit card information, but it did include names, addresses, birth dates, telephone numbers and social security numbers.\u201dRitter said they have no reason to believe the data will ever be used.\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that his office would protect those who may have had their information compromised."}
