A man suffered serious injuries in a shooting early Saturday morning outside of a bar in west Wichita.

Sgt. Rodger Runft said the shooting happened just before 2 a.m. outside Rocco's Sports Bar in the 4300 block of West Central. That's just west of West Street.

Officers were monitoring people leaving the bar, Runft said, and heard two gunshots. They stopped a vehicle and found the 30-year-old victim inside. He had been shot in the stomach.

The man was taken to the hospital to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Runft said he was "mostly uncooperative."

Police have not made any arrests and did not release information on potential suspects.

Runft said there's no indication the shooting was drug or gang related. Anyone with information is asked to call Wichita police.
