There are more than 2,000 rules in the benefit formula that mainly serve the army of financial advisors needed to explain them to seniors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government must run Social Security. Social insurance is by its nature antitheoretical with capitalism because pricing is dictated by the buyer\u2019s earnings rather than production costs. Imagine asking a grocer about the price of bread, and he replies well that the price depends upon how much you earn.\n\nThe program has however overtime assumed tasks that go beyond social insurance. One example of the expansion is the rule which enables a retiree to increase monthly benefits by delaying retirement claiming (DRC). DRC is essentially buying an inflation adjusted annuity. It serves an individual\u2019s want, not a societal need, in which the retiree transforms his benefit into the way that he want to collect his benefit. There is nothing social about it.\n\nWhen DRC was created in 1972, the annuity market may have forced the government to assume a monopoly role. The past is the past. Today, the government\u2019s role is completely unnecessary. There is a robust annuity market today that could support retirees with an expanded range of choices.\n\nThe problem for Americans with this rule is risk. Annuities in the private sector are priced daily \u2013 every day. The government does not re-price the annuity daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly. The last time that the government changed the pricing for the annuities issued by Social Security was in 1983. Pricing is a tri-decennial event.\n\nA lot has happened over the last 32 years. Interest rates have dropped from 13.75 percent to slightly more than 2.125 percent. Our life expectancies have risen nearly two years since that time. Pricing seems unconnected to the cost and benefit of what the government is selling.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a problem that the government provides incentives or disincentives for work behavior. Social Security in 1990 paid people to collect benefits early, and today it pays them to defer their retirement. The problem is that we do not seem to follow what incentives are hidden in the system.\n\nPricing is a legislative process which is not perfect nor responsive. In 1972, for example, Congress introduced a flawed benefit adjustment method which triggered benefit increases large enough to push the system into crisis by 1983. It took Congress five years to address that flaw.\n\nDRC introduces open-ended risk to the system because we don\u2019t know how long these annuities will last. For prospective, the VA is still paying today on pensions from the Civil War. So any mistake may be around for a very long time.\n\nAll of the risk for the system benefits the few. Who are the few? Today about 10 percent of claims occur after normal retirement age. The one thing that we know about these retirees is that they can afford to defer their benefits.\n\nIt would be wonderful if Social Security could help retirees structure their income protection. It can\u2019t. DRC are expensive to run, complex to understand, and assigns accountability to no one.\n\nI buy and sell risk for a living. I never buy open-ended risk. I never leave open-risk unattended for more than 10 minutes, and am never more than 3 clicks away from cancelling it. The government has left open-ended risk unattended for more than 30 years, and we have rewarded it with a monopoly on annuitizing the benefits from Social Security for our seniors.\n\nAt some point, the debate about Social Security reform must grow beyond simply cutting benefits and raising taxes. These solutions do not fix Social Security. They are the way that we pay for its brokenness.\n\nSmith is the founder of \u201cFix Social Security Now\u201d which provides information on all alternatives in the public debate on Social Security through its site www.FixSSNow.Org.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The debate about Social Security focuses too much on fix and too little on better.", "description": "The debate about Social Security focuses too much on fix and too little on better.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The debate about Social Security focuses too much on fix and too little on better.", "title": "Eliminate the DRC", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/248108-eliminate-the-drc", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/248108-eliminate-the-drc", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-16T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Brenton Smith", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-16T15:00:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/248108-eliminate-the-drc", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The debate about Social Security focuses too much on fix and too little on better.", "card": "summary", "title": "Eliminate the DRC"}, "dcterms.title": "Eliminate the DRC"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdabb\"", "article_summary": "Smith is the founder of \u201cFix Social Security Now\u201d which provides information on all alternatives in the public debate on Social Security through its site www.FixSSNow.Org.\nOne example of the expansion is the rule which enables a retiree to increase monthly benefits by delaying retirement claiming (DRC).\nDRC introduces open-ended risk to the system because we don\u2019t know how long these annuities will last.\nWhen DRC was created in 1972, the annuity market may have forced the government to assume a monopoly role.\nThe debate about Social Security focuses too much on fix and too little on better."}
