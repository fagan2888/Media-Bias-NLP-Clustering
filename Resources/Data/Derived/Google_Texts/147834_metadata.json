The first stop for the Florida gang: a meeting with Jolly, who many of them worked for during his last campaign. FFC has armed its members with a packet of talking points for their meetings. There is a page on immigration reform, (\u201cFFC opposes amnesty in any form\u201d), a page on religious freedom and the Affordable Care Act, (\u201cWe oppose the employer mandates in Obamacare that force employers, including religious charities, to provide health care services that violate their faith and assault their conscience\u201d), and a page on education, (\u201cFFC opposes federal imposition of Common Core because of its one size fits all approach to education\u201d).\n\nPackets in hand, the Floridians go to Jolly\u2019s office, where they are seated in a conference room. Jolly is still busy with the vote for the new House Majority Leader, so while they wait the group finds pictures of themselves at Jolly\u2019s victory party to send to his office. They also eagerly discuss the vote \u2013 they are all rooting for Tea Party favorite Rep. Raul Labrador over current leadership team member Rep. Kevin McCarthy.\n\n\u201cWe need to pray about this,\u201d someone says.\n\n\u201cCan you tell us who he\u2019s voting for?\u201d Brown, 59, asks a staffer. The staffer claims he doesn\u2019t know, and Brown responds, \u201cWell, text him right now and ask!\u201d Before he can respond, Mark Kober, an air-conditioner installer from Largo, gets a breaking news update on his phone: McCarthy has won the election. And in another disappointment for the day, the group is informed that Jolly won\u2019t be able to join them. Brown immediately suggests another time for the meeting, and gets a \u201cmaybe\u201d from the staffer. For now, that\u2019s good enough for her. She does a little victory dance and says, \u201cAll you need to do is pretend you know what you\u2019re doing!\u201d\n\nNext, the group heads across the street to take a tour of the Capitol before their appointment with Rubio, though Brown hasn\u2019t been able to get confirmation they\u2019ll actually meet him yet, just another \u201cmaybe.\u201d As he walks through the Capitol, Kober, 35, marvels at how many famous men and women have walked these same halls, and how, at some point, reverence for that fact must wear off. \u201cThat\u2019s why you need people like us,\u201d he says. \u201cTo remind you of where you came from.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, Senator Ted Cruz walks by, and smiles. \u201cDid you just see that?\u201d \u201cThat was Ted Cruz!\u201d \u201cDid you see him?\u201d The group titters. It\u2019s the closest they\u2019ve been to a lawmaker all day.\n\nBut such excitement is ephemeral. At this point it\u2019s past four, so the rotunda is closed and sitting in the nearby gallery overlooking the floor of the Senate means looking down at a room full of empty chairs during a quorum call. The tour ends early. Disappointment begins to set in. \u201cWe\u2019re just a day late and a dollar short everywhere we go today,\u201d Misty says.\n\nThe group makes a final stop of the day at Rubio\u2019s office. But there the tentative meeting \u201cmaybe\u201d becomes \u201cno\u201d and the group meets instead with J.R. Sanchez, Rubio\u2019s director of outreach and senior policy advisor. Still, this last meeting of the day is also their first, and they are eager to talk.\n\n\u201cGive me some solutions,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cTell me what I can relay back to Marco.\u201d With an opening to bring up the talking points, someone mentions immigration reform. \u201cUnder the current administration, we\u2019ve realized we will never be able to pass real, comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Sanchez replies.\n\nThe Oudshoffs then talk about how they feel the Left is infringing upon their religious freedom by not letting people express Christian religious views in schools.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day you can\u2019t force your faith and values on people,\u201d Sanchez says, \u201cbut you shouldn\u2019t have your personal religious beliefs impaired.\u201d How about the decay of the nuclear family unit in society? \u201cWe can\u2019t legislate how people should conduct themselves in marriage or not,\u201d Sanchez says, but that they should support laws that encourage the family structure.\n\nThe group seems disheartened by such non-committal rhetoric. Finally, Sanchez says, \u201cAt the end of the day, the best way you can deal with your outrage is by mobilizing grassroots and not staying at home.\u201d That validation after a day of canceled meetings, \u201cmaybes\u201d and truncated tours offers some solace. This group from Florida did not stay home.\n\nBut what did they accomplish by coming? That morning, when the buses pulled up and members of FFC got their first look at the Capitol building, Kober looked up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s powerful just to be here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Members of FFC\u2019s Road to Majority Conference hope to challenge the idea that Washington can stymie impassioned religious activists.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Members of FFC\u2019s \"Road to Majority\" Conference come armed with faith and idealism to take on Washington.", "title": "This Is What Democracy Looks Like: A Day at the FFC \u201cRoad to Majority\u201d Conference", "url": "http://time.com/2905048/this-is-what-democracy-looks-like-a-day-at-ralph-reeds-road-to-majority-conference/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/freedom-coalition-road-to-majority.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/freedom-coalition-road-to-majority.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "This Is What Democracy Looks Like: A Day at the FFC \u201cRoad to Majority\u201d Conference", "description": "Members of FFC\u2019s \"Road to Majority\" Conference come armed with faith and idealism to take on Washington.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "senate, marco rubio, david jolly, ted cruz, bible, ralph reed, john bolton, florida, obamacare, kevin mccarthy, religion, u.s.,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "freedom and faith coalition, road to majority, conservative, freedom, democracy, marco rubio, david jolly, florida"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfabb\"", "article_summary": "The Oudshoffs then talk about how they feel the Left is infringing upon their religious freedom by not letting people express Christian religious views in schools.\nThe first stop for the Florida gang: a meeting with Jolly, who many of them worked for during his last campaign.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not typical Floridians,\u201d Regina Brown, founder of the biblical Christian activist group Transforming Florida, is quick to point out.\nAnd in another disappointment for the day, the group is informed that Jolly won\u2019t be able to join them.\nStill, this last meeting of the day is also their first, and they are eager to talk."}
