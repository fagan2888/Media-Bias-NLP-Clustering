Hands down, Johnson is the real victim of our politically correct culture.\n\nClock Boy has achieved global notoriety on par with Cecil the lion whereas few Americans have heard the story of Dandelion Boy: Indiana kindergartner Drew Johnson of Cumberland Elementary School. Today I\u2019ll utilize Dandelion Boy\u2019s story to explain a trend in American public schools and playgrounds that threatens your child\u2019s long-term psychological development.\n\nJohnson is now a freshman in high school, but several years ago he was on the front lines of what is today a common technique in American grade schools to micromanage malleable minds at recess. From California to New York. From Minnesota to Texas. Children are at risk.\n\nDandelion Boy\n\nOne day during recess, little Drew noticed a patch of dandelions growing near the playground. He picked a few of the bright yellow flowers. Before he knew it, the principal was sentencing him to many days of lunchtime detention.\n\nThe principal informed Drew\u2019s parents that their son violated the school\u2019s ban against picking up anything off the ground during recess. Everything was off limits\u2014including non-rock items like grass, ladybugs and flowers. This rule was instituted after a group of children threw rocks on the playground. The principal hinted that lazy recess monitors\u2014who didn\u2019t want to spend the extra few seconds to find out what a child clutched in his or her hands before blowing the whistle\u2014helped shape this rule.\n\nPlayground policing like Drew experienced is a now a fashionable craze that taxpayers like you and I are being forced to subsidize. Most notably, self-described \u201cplayground consultants\u201d from the nonprofit known as Playworks have wiggled their way into school districts in at least 21 states.\n\nPlayworks is notorious for instituting playground bans on supposedly hurtful phrases like \u201cYou\u2019re out!\u201d Playworks also controls and develops all activities, reducing the opportunity for children to choose a game like pick-up basketball at an open net if basketball is not on that day\u2019s allowable activity list. Most notably, children cannot invent their own games or imaginative fun.\n\nThe Threat To Your Child\n\nAs Boston College psychologist Peter Gray argues, a militant management style for children\u2019s playtime will stymie their long-term development. Playtime is authentic and beneficial only when children develop it on their own\u2014without adults\u2014says Gray. Furthermore, author Virginia Postrel cites copious resources in Bloomberg View showing: \u201cbans deprive children of the very experiences they need to master peaceful social interactions.\u201d\n\nAll the major research indicates that children who depend on adults to police trivialities like how to say \u201cYou\u2019re out!\u201d (Playworks allows \u201cNice try!\u201d or \u201cGood job!\u201d) will struggle to function as adults. These children will lack the diplomatic and interpersonal skills to resolve simple disputes with friends or coworkers\u2014without enlisting an outside referee.\n\nPlayworks often cites Mathematica Policy Research and Stanford University studies indicating that its style of playground policing reduces bullying and increases focus. Certainly, treating kindergartners like robots is one way to keep them focused and in line. But there are better and healthier ways.\n\nParents are the best \u201cplayground consultants.\u201d No one\u2014no matter the number of certifications beside their name\u2014is more qualified than you as a parent at deciding how your child should learn.\n\nThe Clock Ticks\n\nSudanese American Ahmed Mohamed was treated like the World\u2019s Number One Victim when he showed up at his Texas school in September with a clock that looked like a bomb. President Obama immediately tweeted out his support for his \u201ccool clock\u201d and passion for \u201cscience.\u201d MIT, Facebook and Google also opened their doors to Ahmed for personalized tours and meet-and-greets.\n\nMuch ado was made of Ahmed\u2019s brief arrest. Little was said about the fact that police never charged Ahmed with a crime and swiftly turned the case back to the school upon realizing that the clock only looked like a bomb.\n\n\u201cI am glad that this happened to me,\u201d Ahmed said afterward. \u201cI get to spread my word out to the people and tell them it\u2019s not about the color of your skin or your religion.\u201d\n\nGlad indeed. Ahmed\u2019s fleeting arrest turned him into an international celebrity and garnered him a scholarship to attend the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development\u2019s Young Innovators program. Last week, his attorney Kelly Hollingsworth threatened to sue Ahmed\u2019s school and the city of Irving, Texas if they don\u2019t pay $15 million to her 14-year-old client.\n\nAhmed\u2019s \"reputation in the global community is permanently scarred,\" causing severe psychological damage, his attorney wrote. Hold up. How was Ahmed scarred by having America\u2019s largest tech institutions and the world\u2019s most powerful leader\u2014the President of the United States\u2014welcome him with open arms? How was he scarred when #IStandWithAhmed became a trending topic on Twitter? Finally, how was Ahmed scarred when TIME Magazine named him one of the world\u2019s 30 Most Influential Teens? C\u2019mon!\n\nIf any children have cause to sue their school, it\u2019s your children who are being policed by manipulative playground consultants and lazy principals. Your children are being denied the ability to play on their own; to think creatively; and to overcome mini setbacks like being called \u201cout\u201d in a game of tag. Your children are the real victims of our politically correct culture.\n\nPresident Obama has committed to bringing 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States this year. 47 Democrats voted for a bill to block the president\u2019s wishes, showing bipartisan support against the president. We lack the ability to fully vet these refugees\u2014and even current Muslim refugees like Dr. Mudar Zahran are warning of the connection between migration and terrorism.\n\nISIS terrorists could easily take advantage of America\u2019s clear obsession with political correctness and send a 14-year-old Syrian girl to a school with a bomb that she says is \u201cjust a calculator.\u201d Her teacher might, in the wake of Clock Boy\u2019s petulant lawsuit, be too intimidated to call the cops. ISIS knows that Americans have a poor track record of exercising common sense. Let\u2019s not wait for a smiling schoolchild, exploited by ISIS, to blow up a school before we wake up and smell the dandelions.\n\nDandelion Boy picked a few flowers and was publicly shamed as a violent rock-thrower. Clock Boy carried a bomb look-alike clock into a gun-free zone and was treated like a rock star. Like Dandelion Boy, your children are being excessively policed on the playground\u2014on your dollar.
