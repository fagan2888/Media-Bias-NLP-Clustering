Well, they\u2019ve had a string of pretty awful seasons, actually. The Cubs are staring down their fifth consecutive losing season. They\u2019re currently in last place in the National League\u2019s Central Division. Oh, and they haven\u2019t won a pennant since 1908 \u2014 since Theodore Roosevelt was president.\n\nThe good news for Cubs\u2019 fans is that their farm system is probably one of the best in baseball, and team\u2019s future does look bright, though that isn\u2019t going to help this season. But the Cubs still have some problems, and not all of them are related to the team they\u2019re putting on diamond in the friendly confines of Wrigley Field.\n\nOn Tuesday, Major League Baseball was forced to suspend the game between the Cubs and the San Francisco Giants before the bottom half of the 5th inning due to a torrential downpour made worse by grounds crew that had a difficult time covering the field with the tarp in a timely fashion.\n\nThe Cubs had a 2-run lead when the game was delayed, and won the game when it was completed the following day. But, as you can see in the video below, the grounds crew struggled to cover the field, making it completely unplayable:\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy said that the Cubs\u2019 grounds crew didn\u2019t put the tarp away properly, which was the cause of the botched effort to cover the infield. That may be true, and Major League Baseball certainly agreed, acquiescing to the Giants\u2019 protest by allowing the game to be completed the following day. For those who don\u2019t know, a game in considered \u201cofficial\u201d after the top of the 5th inning is completed as long as the home team is ahead.\n\nAlthough the Cubs supported the Giants\u2019 protest, the Chicago Sun-Times says that part of the problem is that the team\u2019s grounds crew was understaffed because they\u2019re trying to keep hours down because of Obamacare:\n\nThe staffing issues that hamstrung the grounds crew Tuesday during a mad dash with the tarp under a sudden rainstorm were created in part by a wide-ranging reorganization last winter of game-day personnel, job descriptions and work limits designed to keep the seasonal workers \u2013 including much of the grounds crew \u2013 under 130 hours per month, according to numerous sources with direct knowledge. That\u2019s the full-time worker definition under \u201cObamacare,\u201d which requires employer-provided healthcare benefits for \u201cbig businesses\u201d such as a major league team.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe issue is the short hand Baird was dealt by policies driven from the top of the business and stadium side of the operation, leading to a national embarrassment \u2013 which might have been preventable, if not foreseeable. Sources say 10 crew members were sent home early by the bosses Tuesday night with little, if any, input from the field-level supervisors.\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting that the Cubs\u2019 owner, Joe Ricketts, is a Republican. Yahoo! News reported in May 2012 that he\u2019d contributed to every single Republican presidential contender, including Mitt Romney and Ron Paul.\n\nIn 2010, Ricketts, founder of TD Ameritrade, launched a campaign to target pork-loving lawmakers. Originally named Taxpayers Against Earmarks, the organization is now called the Ending Spending. It also has a super PAC called the Ending Spending Action Fund. This super PAC that backed Romney\u2019s general election campaign against President Barack Obama and Republican congressional candidates. Ricketts and family have contributed $1.55 million to the Ending Spending Action Fund in the 2014 cycle.\n\nThe Cubs have come under a lot of criticism for the decision to cut grounds crew members\u2019 hours to avoid paying offering health insurance benefits. Well, this is something some businesses and corporations are doing to avoid Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate. And you can hardly blame them for doing so. Health insurance has gotten more expensive due to the law\u2019s mandates, the costs of which aren\u2019t easily absorbed.\n\nYeah, maybe sending members of the grounds crew home on a night in which rain is in the forecast because the Cubs are worried about them racking up too many hours is a bad idea. But the team wouldn\u2019t have been concerned about it if they weren\u2019t going to either have to offer coverage to what are supposed to be part-time employees, or face fines per employee if they didn\u2019t, if the employer mandate weren\u2019t around.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Chicago Cubs,employer mandate,grounds crew,Joe Ricketts,Major League Baseball,ObamaCare,San Francisco Giants,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "Wrigley Field The Chicago Cubs are having a pretty awful season.
