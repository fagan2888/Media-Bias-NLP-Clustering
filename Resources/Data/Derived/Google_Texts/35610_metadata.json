After the accrediting agency employed its three trademark tools to target interventions at each of the hospitals tailored to specific causes of nonadherence, compliance improved to 81 percent across all eight hospitals, according to the article.\n\n\"Such a targeted approach may be more effective, efficient and sustainable than 'one-size-fits-all' strategies,\" the article concludes, adding \"If one does not know exactly why hand hygiene is failing and which specific causes are most prevalent in a particular hospital, it will not be possible to devise an effective set of interventions.\"\n\nAfter its initial project, the Joint Commission used its findings when working with another 19 hospitals to create a web-based \"Targeted Solutions Tool\" to enable healthcare organizations to use the same methods employed by the original eight hospitals, according to another article in the journal, titled \"Beyond the Collaborative: Spreading Effective Improvement in Hand Hygiene Compliance.\"\n\nUsing the Joint Commission's tool from 2008-2010, 289 healthcare organizations initiated a total of 1,495 projects to improve hand-hygiene compliance, and were able to improve their average compliance from 57.9 percent to 83.5 percent--similar results to the original eight hospitals, according to the article.\n\nThe Joint Commission is not the first organization to tackle the stubborn issue of improving hand-washing compliance rates in healthcare facilities. Past research into the subject has indicated that improving patients' own hand hygiene and leveraging consequences could be crucial, and another study suggested that a simple social tool like peer pressure is effective in improving compliance, as healthcare staff were found to improve their hygiene habits when in their coworkers' presence, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nFor the Joint Commission's part, the organization learned from its hand-hygiene project that using business-tested models and statistics may be the best way to go about improving compliance among healthcare workers that will in turn lead to better patient care, wrote Peter Pronovost, M.D., of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in an editorial published in the journal.\n\n\"In the struggle to find the balance between art and science, patients would be better served if more emphasis was placed on management science,\" he wrote.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the articles (subscription required)\n\n- see the project details\n\n- read a statement about the project\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPeer pressure may improve hand-hygiene compliance\n\nHand-hygiene strategies for healthcare workers--what really works?\n\nNew guidance offers recommendations for hand-hygiene best practices\n\nHospital infections 'unacceptable and avoidable'\n\nHand-washing helps control MRSA, but may not be enough\n\n6 must-know strategies to build a safer hospital", "article_metadata": {"description": "With\u00a0hand hygiene\u00a0a key factor in the fight against deadly\u00a0hospital-acquired infections, the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare decided to tackle the issue by conducting its first patient safety project on the subject, the results of which are\u00a0published\u00a0in several articles in the\u00a0Joint Commission's", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "With\u00a0hand hygiene\u00a0a key factor in the fight against deadly\u00a0hospital-acquired infections, the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare decided to tackle the issue by conducting its first patient safety project on the subject, the results of which are\u00a0published\u00a0in several articles in the\u00a0Joint Commission's", "title": "'One size fits all' is no way to improve hand-hygiene compliance", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/one-size-fits-all-no-way-improve-hand-hygiene-compliance/2015-01-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "hand hygiene compliance,handwashing,hospital acquired infections (HAIs),HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,The Joint Commission", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda918\"", "article_summary": "The Joint Commission is not the first organization to tackle the stubborn issue of improving hand-washing compliance rates in healthcare facilities.\nIn the first article, the Joint Commission details its attempt to improve hand hygiene at eight hospitals by using data-savvy change management methods to target specific areas of noncompliance.\nIn the beginning of the project, compliance was at an average of 47.5 percent across the hospitals, with the Joint Commission identifying a total of 41 causes of noncompliance.\nUsing the Joint Commission's tool from 2008-2010, 289 healthcare organizations initiated a total of 1,495 projects to improve hand-hygiene compliance, and were able to improve their average compliance from 57.9 percent to 83.5 percent--similar results to the original eight hospitals, according to the article.\nTo learn more:- check out the articles (subscription required)- see the project details- read a statement about the projectRelated Articles:Peer pressure may improve hand-hygiene complianceHand-hygiene strategies for healthcare workers--what really works?"}
