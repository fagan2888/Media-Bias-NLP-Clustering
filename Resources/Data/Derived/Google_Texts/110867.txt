Although the NFL schedule doesn’t typically come out until April, now that the 2013 AFC division winners are finalized, the Broncos know all of their 16 opponents for the 2014 season and where they’ll be playing them.

The team will, of course, have home and away games against its division rivals Oakland, San Diego and Kansas City. It will also travel to New England, New York (Jets), St. Louis, Seattle and Cincinnati.

At home, it’ll host the three other AFC West teams, along with Buffalo, Miami, Arizona, San Francisco and Indianapolis.
