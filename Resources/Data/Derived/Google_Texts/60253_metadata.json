But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could decide whether to increase their Medicaid programs, and Florida chose not to, Zuckerman said.\n\nThe state's Medicaid program serves 169,365 clients in Palm Beach County and 240,192 in Broward. Only parents who make under 35 percent of the federal poverty level can get Medicaid; adults with no children generally can't, Zuckerman said. The federal poverty level for a family of four is $23,550.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative politcal advocacy group, said expanding Medicaid is not the answer to providing quality health care to the working poor in South Florida.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "business", "og": {"url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-02-07/business/fl-broward-palm-beach-uninsured-healthcare-20140207_1_health-care-coverage-medicaid-program-affordable-care-act", "site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "type": "article", "description": "Nearly 118,000 adults in Broward and Palm Beach counties are too poor to qualify for benefits under Obamacare, but they don't qualify for Medicaid either, according to a new analysis.
