Curt Clawson, R-Naples, spoke to a large group of health care workers with the Family Health Centers of Southwest Florida during an event in Fort Myers Wednesday.\n\nThe organization operates community health centers across the region providing care to underserved and disadvantaged communities.\n\nClawson\u2014a Tea Party Republican who has called for repealing the federal health care law\u2014toned down his rhetoric for the group and said he had reservations about the law. He said he agrees the country\u2019s health care system was unsustainable before the Affordable Care Act, but said he \u201cwould just go about it a lot different than Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could solve that problem of the uninsured without impacting all these people that like their doctor and like their health insurance and that\u2019s my main point,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think Obamacare is too invasive. It\u2019s not fair, maybe not even constitutional.\u201d\n\nSandra Vega works for one of the centers in Fort Myers that provides care to mostly children. She said the law has a lot of positive impacts.\n\n\u201cFor our patients, they will benefit from it,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, there are legal some issues regarding that if they are legal in the country or not.\u201d\n\nVega said for those children that don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid because of their legal status, the law is a big help because it funds centers like hers, which provide care to those patients. For example, the Affordable Care Act awarded a grant to Family Health Centers of Southwest Florida that went to expanding operations in Lee County.\n\nClawson\u2019s Democratic Opponent this November, April Freeman, has said she supports the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government", "description": "U.S. Rep.
