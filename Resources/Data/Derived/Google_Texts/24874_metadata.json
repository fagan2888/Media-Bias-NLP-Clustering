One common type of decline is in contrast sensitivity, the ability to distinguish gradations of light to dark, making it possible to discern where one object ends and another begins.\n\nWhen an older adult descends a flight of stairs, for example, she may not tell the edge of one step from the next, so she stumbles. At night, an older driver may squint to see the edge of white road stripes on blacktop. Caught in the glare of headlights, he swerves.\n\nBut new research suggests that contrast sensitivity can be improved with brain-training exercises. In a study published last month in Psychological Science, researchers at the University of California at Riverside and Brown University showed that after just five sessions of behavioral exercises, the vision of 16 people in their 60s and 70s significantly improved.\n\nAfter the training, the adults could make out edges far better. And when given a standard eye chart, a task that differed from the one they were trained on, they could correctly identify more letters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an idea out there that everything falls apart as we get older, but even older brains are growing new cells,\u201d said Allison B. Sekuler, a professor of psychology, neuroscience and behavior at McMaster University in Ontario, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cYou can teach an older brain new tricks.\u201d\n\nThe training improved contrast sensitivity in 16 young adults in the study as well, although the older subjects showed greater gains. That is partly because the younger ones, college students, already had reasonably healthy vision and there was not as much room for improvement.\n\nBefore the training, the vision of each adult, young and older, was assessed. The exercises were fine-tuned at the beginning for each individual so researchers could measure improvements, said Dr. G. John Andersen, the project\u2019s senior adviser and a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nDuring each session, the subjects watched 750 striped images that were rapidly presented on a computer screen with subtle changes in the visual \u201cnoise\u201d surrounding them \u2014 like snow on a television. The viewer indicated whether the images were rotating clockwise or counterclockwise. The subject would hear a beep for every correct response.\n\nEach session took an hour and a half. The exercises were taxing, although the subjects took frequent breaks. But after five sessions, the subjects had learned to home in more precisely on the images and to filter out the distracting visual noise. After the training, the older adults performed as well as those 40 years younger, before their own training.\n\nThe older participants were also better able to make out letters on an eye chart at reading distance, although not one 10 feet away. The younger students were better able to see the distant eye chart, but not the closer one.\n\n\u201cWe think that a behavioral intervention where learning is going on changes brain structure in older adults,\u201d Andersen said.\n\nIn the absence of a disease like glaucoma or changes in the retina and optic nerve, contrast sensitivity is processed by the brain\u2019s visual cortex.\n\nThis study suggests that certain areas of the brain can be strengthened.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/06/1003025719-FL_sar_hfaging09.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9953\"", "article_summary": "After the training, the older adults performed as well as those 40 years younger, before their own training.\n\u201cWe think that a behavioral intervention where learning is going on changes brain structure in older adults,\u201d Andersen said.\n\u201cYou can teach an older brain new tricks.\u201dThe training improved contrast sensitivity in 16 young adults in the study as well, although the older subjects showed greater gains.\nIn the absence of a disease like glaucoma or changes in the retina and optic nerve, contrast sensitivity is processed by the brain\u2019s visual cortex.\nOne common type of decline is in contrast sensitivity, the ability to distinguish gradations of light to dark, making it possible to discern where one object ends and another begins."}
