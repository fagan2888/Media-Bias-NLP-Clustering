Archer called the timeline \u201cextremely long\u201d and Commissioner Kevin Cook said a two-year wait was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait two years to hear back,\u201d Archer said.\n\nAn amendment requiring recommendations from the committee within one year, rather than two, was approved 3-0. After the amendments were added, the commission approved creation of the Building Code Committee by another 3-0 vote.\n\nQuestions remain about how the county\u2019s building code committee will interact with the city of Topeka\u2019s Property Maintenance Code Unit. Commissioners said the new committee should aim for unity with the city, though Commissioner Shelly Buhler noted \u201cvast differences\u201d between building codes inside Topeka and those outside the city.\n\nIn other action Thursday, the commission voted 2-1 to allow Alan Schramm, an unpaid volunteer health insurance navigator, to continue assisting county residents as they enroll in the federal health insurance marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBuhler and Cook voted in favor of the motion; Archer voted against. In comments after the commission adjourned, Archer said he is an adamant opponent of the Affordable Care Act and has consistently voted against efforts to help implement the 2010 health care law.\n\nThe commission also voted to raise salaries for non-union employees. A recent compensation study found Shawnee County pays employees significantly less, on average, than comparable counties in Kansas, Missouri and Iowa.\n\nThe commission voted 3-0 Thursday to adjust pay scales for most of the county\u2019s employees, beginning Jan. 23. Affected employees will see increases in their pay beginning Feb. 12. The money will come from $2.1 million the county commission set aside for pay increases in this year\u2019s budget.\n\nCommissioners unanimously approved a request from public works and solid waste director Tom Vlach for a $341,008 contract for construction of a bridge on S.E. Tecumseh Road over Stinson Creek. The contract went to Klaver Construction, based in south-central Kansas.\n\n\u201cThey are a very reputable firm and do very good work,\u201d Vlach said.\n\nCook applauded Vlach\u2019s department for spending money on an in-state firm. Vlach said the bridge will be paid for with funds from the countywide half-cent sales tax. Construction will begin next week and be completed by the end of April, according to Vlach.\n\nCommissioners also unanimously approved a request by corrections director Brian Cole for nearly $5,000 in equipment to establish Wi-Fi access points at the Juvenile Detention Center, 401 S.E. 8th.\n\nCole told commissioners the equipment, paid for out of the corrections department budget, will allow his department to use iPads to manage behavior of inmates, teach social skills and track data on interactions between jail staff and juveniles.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "The Shawnee County Commission on Thursday voted to create a committee tasked with recommending building codes for unincorporated Shawnee County.", "title": "Shawnee County Commission creates building code committee, splits over ACA volunteer", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2016-01-21/shawnee-county-commission-creates-building-code-committee-splits-over-aca-volunteer", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/15062664.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The Shawnee County Commission on Thursday voted to create a committee tasked with recommending building codes for unincorporated Shawnee County.Barry Beagle, the county\u2019s planning director, presented a proposal to commissioners with a list of prospective members for the new committee, along with a brief overview of the committee\u2019s expectations.Commissioner Bob Archer criticized the proposal, telling Beagle it didn\u2019t state how much money the committee would spend or what the advantages and disadvantages of creating the committee are."}, "article_summary": "The Shawnee County Commission on Thursday voted to create a committee tasked with recommending building codes for unincorporated Shawnee County.\nThe money will come from $2.1 million the county commission set aside for pay increases in this year\u2019s budget.\nAfter the amendments were added, the commission approved creation of the Building Code Committee by another 3-0 vote.\nQuestions remain about how the county\u2019s building code committee will interact with the city of Topeka\u2019s Property Maintenance Code Unit.\nBeagle\u2019s proposal called for the committee to make recommendations on building codes within two years."}
