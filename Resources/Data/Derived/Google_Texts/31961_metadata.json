Which is why the tamales at Annie\u2019s Cafe keep bringing us back.\n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Annie\u2019s for more than a half-dozen years. It\u2019s a cozy set of rooms at the southeast corner of East Colfax Avenue and St. Paul Street, decorated with old movie posters and vintage lunch boxes. The televisions are always tuned to TCM, which means you get to fill in the gaps in your movie viewing while sipping your morning coffee. (A recent showing: \u201cDays of Wine and Roses\u201d with Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick \u2014 a decidedly downbeat way to start the day, but a classic film nonetheless.)\n\nRight before Christmas, I was there for my holiday fix of tamales. Well, one of them, at least. Annie\u2019s does a savory version: Two moist corn tamales (they dehusk them for you before plating) that are packed with shredded pork and masa, then smothered in pork green chile and cheese. You also get two eggs your way, black beans and a flour tortilla.\n\nWhat\u2019s not to love?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Annie's Cafe,tamales", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2014/12/23/denver-breakfast-club-hot-tamales-annies-cafe/", "site_name": "The Den", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2014/12/annies-495x371.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "Denver Breakfast Club: Hot tamales at Annie's Cafe"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Denver Breakfast Club: Hot tamales at Annie\u2019s Cafe", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2014/12/23/denver-breakfast-club-hot-tamales-annies-cafe/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2014/12/annies-495x371.jpg", "creator": "@williamporterdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "At the Denver Breakfast Club, we love eggy goodness with a Southwestern twist.
