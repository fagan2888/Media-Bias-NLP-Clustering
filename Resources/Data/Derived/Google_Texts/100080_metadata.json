Williams says that Chief Justice John Marshall and the other justices of the U.S. Supreme Court \u201cwere well aware of the historical paternity of this bastardized\u201d (illegitimate) doctrine of discovery. Williams quotes Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s good friend Justice Joseph Story as saying European nations claimed on the basis of that doctrine:\n\nan absolute dominion over the whole territories afterwards occupied by them, not in virtue of any conquest of, or cession by, the Indian natives, but as a right acquired by discovery. [emphasis added]\n\nThe title of the Indians was not treated as a right of property and dominion, but as a mere right of occupancy.\n\nAfter informing his readers of Story\u2019s view that colonizers claimed \u201can absolute dominion\u201d as \u201ca right acquired by discovery,\u201d Williams could have asked: \u201cWhat was the rationale for treating the title of the Indians as not being a right of property and dominion, but as a mere right of occupancy?\u201d An accurate answer, using Justice Story\u2019s own religious wording, is this: \u201cThe reason why the title of the Indians was treated as \u2018a mere right of occupancy,\u2019 and not as a right of property and dominion, is because the Christians were controlling the terms of the discussion by classifying the Indians as \u2018infidels, heathens, and savages\u2019.\u201d Christians claimed the power to allow or disallow non-Christians \u201cto possess the prerogatives belonging to absolute, sovereign, and independent nations.\u201d They made this presumption on the basis of their claim of what Chief Justice Marshall called \u201can ascendancy,\u201d which is defined as \u201ccontrolling or governing power : domination.\u201d\n\nWhat is missing from Williams account is a follow up on Story\u2019s explicit and bigoted religious language, or on Story\u2019s specific acknowledgment that the claim of \u201cabsolute dominion\u201d was not a claim made \u201cin virtue of any conquest.\u201d Instead, Williams refers to the doctrine of discovery\u2019s \u201cdiscourse of conquest,\u201d and thereby contradicts Story\u2019s disavowal. Also, Williams immediately shifts away from Story\u2019s explicit Christian religious vocabulary\u2014\u201cinfidels\u201d and \u201cheathens\u201d\u2014to secular vocabulary, such as \u201cthe superior rights of a European-derived nation,\u201d \u201cwhite society,\u201d and similar non-religious expressions.\n\nOn what basis are we to decide whether the claimed \u201cright of discovery\u201d expressed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Johnson v. M\u2019Intosh was advanced on Christian or secular grounds? Simple. Story tells us. Williams provides Story\u2019s explanation of the religious basis of Johnson\u2019s ruling, which Story played a part in deciding. For example, Story wrote at one point: \u201cThe territory over which they [the Indians] wandered\u2026 was, in respect to Christians, deemed as if it were inhabited only by brute animals\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nWilliams\u2019 phrases \u201cEuropean-derived nation\u201d and \u201ca white society\u2019s will to empire\u201d may be accurate as modern day characterizations of that earlier history, using today\u2019s terminology of critical race theory. Yet those secular phrasings are not consistent with Story\u2019s religious wording, e.g., \u201cin respect to Christians,\u201d and with the two bigoted religious metaphors he drew from the tradition of Christianity, i.e., \u201cinfidels\u201d and \u201cheathens,\u201d which pinpoint the religious basis of the claimed right of discovery in the Johnson v. M\u2019Intosh decision. Furthermore, Story\u2019s use of the word \u201cheathens\u201d corresponds with Marshall\u2019s use of that word in the following phrase from Johnson v. M\u2019Intosh, \u201cnotwithstanding the occupancy of the natives, who were heathens\u201d as contrasted with the Supreme Court\u2019s mention of \u201cChristian people\u201d and their claim of \u201cultimate dominion.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the point: Christians claimed, in Joseph Story\u2019s words, \u201can absolute dominion over whole territories\u201d that were inhabited by those whom Christians defined and categorized as \u201cheathens\u201d and \u201cinfidels,\u201d \u201csavages,\u201d and \u201cbrute animals.\u201d Yet Professor Williams\u2019 remarkable book does not direct his readers to this religiously premised conclusion, which seems so patently obvious given Story\u2019s phrasing. The religious premise of a claimed Christian \u201cright of dominion\u201d (domination), based on a claim of \u201cdiscovery\u201d by Christians, becomes even more obvious when we examine Story\u2019s book Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, which was published in 1833, ten years after the Johnson v. M\u2019Intosh ruling was decided. In Book I, Chapter I, \u00a7 5, Story wrote the following as his own paraphrasing of Marshall\u2019s wording in the Johnson decision:\n\nThe European nations found little difficulty in reconciling themselves to the adoption of any principle, which gave ample scope to their ambition, and employed little reasoning to support it. They were content to take counsel of their interests, their prejudices, and their passions, and felt no necessity of vindicating their conduct before cabinets, which were already eager to recognize [sic] its justice and its policy. The Indians were a savage race, sunk in the depths of ignorance and heathenism. If they might not be extirpated for their want of religion and just morals, they might be reclaimed from their errors. They were bound to yield to the superior genius of Europe, and in exchanging their wild and debasing habits for civilization and Christianity they were deemed to gain more than an equivalent for every sacrifice and suffering. The Papal authority, too, was brought in aid of these great designs; and for the purpose of overthrowing heathenism, and propagating the Catholic religion, Alexander the Sixth, by a Bull issued in 1493, granted to the crown of Castile the whole of the immense territory then discovered, or to be discovered, between the poles, so far as it was not then possessed by any Christian prince.\n\nFootnote 7, which Story inserted after the phrase \u201cand for the purpose of overthrowing heathenism, and propagating the Catholic religion,\u201d provides evidence that Justice Story used as one of his sources a Latin version of one of the papal bulls issued by Pope Alexander VI. Footnote 7 reads: \u201c\u2018Ut fides Catholica, et Christiana Religio nostris praesertim temporibus exaltetur, &c., ac barbarae nationes deprimantur, et ad fidem ipsam reducantur,\u2019 is the language of the Bull. 1 Haz. Coll. 3.\u201d The Latin terms \u201cdeprimantur\u201d and \u201creducantur\u201d both translate to \u201creduce.\u201d The original nations were to be reduced and subjected by Christian dominators (\u201cdominorum Christianorum\u201d).\n\nWhen reading Justice Story\u2019s Commentaries, the principle of discovery found in the Johnson v. M\u2019Intosh ruling is traced to the above Latin phrasing and other sections found in the papal bull of 1493, and to the actual language of royal charters issued by various monarchs. Story identified this connection between those old papal documents and the Johnson ruling. We know this because after quoting from one of the papal bulls of 1493, Story then wrote: \u201cThis principle, then, that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects or by whose authority it was made against all other European governments\u2026\u201d Story drew that wording verbatim directly from Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s language in the Johnson ruling, yet Story wrote it in his Commentaries without attribution and without quotation marks.\n\nAdditionally, Story uses the phrase \u201cabsolute dominion\u201d which matches the Latin language of \u201cdominio\u201d and \u201cdominorum Christianorum\u201d from one of Pope Alexander VI\u2019s papal bulls from 1493. Rob Williams seems to have missed a critical point: By means of Johnson v. M\u2019Intosh the U.S. Supreme Court covertly incorporated into U.S. law and politics the idea of the domination of Christian dominators (the dominio of dominorum Christianorum), which is what Story called in English, \u201cabsolute dominion.\u201d Given that this well-cloaked religiously premised principle of dominance has been used by the United States against our nations and peoples for two centuries now, isn\u2019t it time to demand that the United States no longer use it against us?\n\nSteven Newcomb (Shawnee, Lenape) is co-founder and co-director of the Indigenous Law Institute, and author of Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (Fulcrum, 2008).
