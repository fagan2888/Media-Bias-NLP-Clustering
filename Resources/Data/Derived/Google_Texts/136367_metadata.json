You are right. Liberals, you were right.\u201d\n\nBeck said he now sees that \u201cyou cannot force democracy on the Iraqis or anybody else,\u201d and it is time for the left and the right to unite on common values and principles.\n\n\u201cThis is something I think that we can come together on, the right and the left,\u201d Beck began. \u201cNot one more life, not one more dollar, not one more airplane, not one more bullet, not one more Marine, not one more arm or leg or eye. Not one more.\u201d\n\nAs the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria threatens to overtake Baghdad, Beck stood firmly against sending thousands of American troops back into the country.\n\n\u201cThe only way to prevent Baghdad from being overrun is stay there and continue to fight this, militarily, in perpetuity,\u201d Beck said. \u201cAre you willing to do that?\u201d\n\nYou can watch Beck\u2019s complete comments around 8 minutes into the video below.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nBeck addressed those who were against intervention in Iraq under President George W. Bush, but support whatever Barack Obama chooses to do.\n\n\u201cLiberals, you were against it in the first place. How could you be in favor of more intervention now?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow could you possibly be for that, after everything you have said about \u2018it\u2019s going to fall apart in the end\u2019 was right? Everything I said, that we could hold it together, was wrong!\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, there\u2019s some things we can agree on,\u201d Beck added. \u201cFinally, there\u2019s some things we can come together on, and clean up our own house.\u201d\n\nBeck cautioned Americans not to do what \u201cliberals did to us and George W. Bush,\u201d saying we can\u2019t make the crisis \u201cjust about politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis cannot become about the president. It cannot become about the Democrats. This has to be about the principles, because in the principles we all agree,\u201d Beck said. \u201cEnough is enough. Bring them home, period.\u201d\n\nBeck has long spoken about how Americans need to hold principles above politics, and find common ground on which they can unite. On Monday, he laid out what he believes is next for the American people, and how faith, hope, and charity will play an enormous role if we hope to unite.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
