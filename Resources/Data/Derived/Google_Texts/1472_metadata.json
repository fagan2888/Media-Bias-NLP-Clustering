Rickerson launched the temp agency in September 2013. Since the beginning, Rickerson has seen success.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything from housekeepers and food service, construction, equipment maintenance technicians, [and] welders,\u201d said Rickerson.\n\nIn his first full calendar year in operation, in 2014, Rickerson says he did nearly $1.5 million in business. In 2015, Rickerson forecasts he\u2019ll do $3 million in business.\n\nRickerson credits a lot of his success to several changes in Kansas\u2019 economy, along with more financial demands required of business owners. He tells KSN News that some businesses may want to keep employees on as \u201ctemporary\u201d workers so they can avoid, and/or postpone, fees or penalties for health insurance costs.\n\n\u201cCompanies want to try an employee out before they commit to hiring them,\u201d said Rickerson. \u201cThey may be at that tipping point where they need employees to get the work done, but they don\u2019t want to go over the number that puts them in that criteria of having to be able to provide those benefits.\u201d\n\nRickerson says he understands companies\u2019 concerns. After all, he experiences things from both sides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to affect me just like it affects everyone else,\u201d said Rickerson.\n\nOn average, 130 people work for Rickerson, through Elite Staffing Solutions, on a daily basis. Rickerson is responsible for workers\u2019 compensation insurance, liability insurance, providing drug screening, and payroll.\n\nAlong with those responsibilities, until an employer/employee match is made, employees are still technically his responsibility. So too, then, is their health insurance.\n\nFor more information about Elite Staffing Solutions, click here.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health & Human Services announced Wednesday that 96,226 Kansas consumers either selected a plan or were automatically reenrolled in coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\nMore than 96,000 sign up in Kansas for health care", "article_metadata": {"description": "KSN sat down with the president of a local temp agency to take a closer look at how the ACA requirement is impacting businesses and hiring d\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.ksnw", "og": {"site_name": "KSN-TV", "description": "KSN sat down with the president of a local temp agency to take a closer look at how the ACA requirement is impacting businesses and hiring decisions in Kansas.", "title": "ACA affects hiring decisions for businesses; boosts temp agencies", "url": "http://ksn.com/2015/02/18/aca-affects-hiring-decisions-for-businesses-boosts-temp-agencies/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://lintvksnw.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/healthcare-gov.jpg", "height": 324}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "KSN sat down with the president of a local temp agency to take a closer look at how the ACA requirement is impacting businesses and hiring decisions in Kansas.", "creator": "@KSNNews", "image": {"src": "https://lintvksnw.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/healthcare-gov.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "ACA affects hiring decisions for businesses; boosts temp agencies", "site": "KSNNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "msapplication-tooltip": "Wichita, KS News Weather and Sports | We've Got Your Back", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411762914", "fb": {"pages": 92102484724}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "KSN-TV", "google-site-verification": "jbNLEolQgA8nCvD85o9rK2CTlZ5C_13qD6LkX7ZpOPQ", "keywords": "Brittany Glas and The Associated Press, aca, Affordable Care Act, Brittany Glas, career, careers, Chris Rickerson, Elite Staffing Solutions, employment, fine, health care, hires, ICT, jobs, kansas, money, obamacare, staff, temp agencies, temporary, unemployment, wichita", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KSNNews", "published_time": "2015-02-18T23:34:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T00:58:14+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://ksn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/079d66e0e6c53e14a5429c524ad3e55d?s=16"}, "article_summary": "For more information about Elite Staffing Solutions, click here.\nChris Rickerson is the President of Elite Staffing Solutions in Wichita.\nOn average, 130 people work for Rickerson, through Elite Staffing Solutions, on a daily basis.\nSo too, then, is their health insurance.\nThe U.S. Department of Health & Human Services announced Wednesday that 96,226 Kansas consumers either selected a plan or were automatically reenrolled in coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace."}
