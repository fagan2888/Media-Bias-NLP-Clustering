IzuenGordelekua, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nThe parents of an 8-month-old boy who died of treatable pneumonia face a sentence of three and a half to seven years in prison after religion-based medical neglect. In just four years, Herbert and Catherine Schaible of Philadelphia have been held accountable for the deaths of their two children \u2014 Kent, 2, and Brandon, 8 months, after both reportedly suffered \u201ceerily similar\u201d symptoms and failed to see a doctor. A judge rejected the Schiables' claims that their religious beliefs \u201cclashed\u201d with child welfare laws in both faith-healing cases.\n\n\"My religious beliefs are that you should pray, and not have to use medicine. But because it is against the law, then whatever sentence you give me, I will accept,\" said Catherine Schaible to Judge Benjamin Lerner, The Associated Press reported. Judge Lerner \u2014 aware of Schiable and her husband\u2019s conviction of involuntary manslaughter in their first child\u2019s death \u2014 believed the couple\u2019s beliefs are so ingrained that it put both of their children at high risk. \"You've killed two of your children. ...Not God. Not your church. Not religious devotion \u2014 you,\u201d Lerner said.\n\nThe Pennsylvania couple received a court order in 2011 which mandated the Schiables to take their children to get annual checkups and call a doctor if a child became ill. After the death of their son Kent, rather than have the family supervised by a Department of Human Services caseworker, a different judge assigned the couple to probation officers who were not trained to look over the welfare of the children. \"Everybody in the system failed these children,\u201d said Joanne Pescatore, Assistant District Attorney.\n\nWhile the government protects the constitutional right to freedom of religious expression and practice, it is also responsible for enforcing child welfare laws. Believers of faith healing, like the Schiables, claim a clash exists when they choose other spiritual healing practices rather than traditional medical care to treat children\u2019s illnesses. If the parents\u2019 decision harms the minor, it is up to the courts to decide a balance between these two laws.\n\nStates that allow a religious defense to most serious crimes against children include: Idaho, Iowa, and Ohio with religious defenses to manslaughter; West Virginia with religious defenses to murder of a child and child neglect resulting in death; and Arkansas with a religious defense to capital murder, according to Children\u2019s Healthcare, an educational charity. Approximately a dozen U.S. children die in faith healing cases each year, the AP reported.\n\nThe couple, third-generation members, and religious educators of the First Century Gospel Church in northeast Philadelphia, chose to neglect Pennsylvania laws during Brandon\u2019s battle with pneumonia. The lung infection \u2014 caused by either a bacteria, a virus or fungi \u2014 could have 30 different causes, but more than one-third of cases are caused by respiratory viruses common in children younger than 5 years old. Difficulty breathing and a loss of appetite, says the American Lung Association, are some of the most common symptoms of pneumonia, all of which Brandon experienced.\n\nThe 8-month-old boy\u2019s parents tried to comfort and pray over to heal his illness, rather than getting their son medical care. \u201cWe believe in divine healing, that Jesus shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil's power,\u201d Herbert said in his police statement last year, the Los Angeles Times reported. The couple pleaded no contest to third-degree murder in Brandon\u2019s death. His mother is free on bail, while Herbert has served about a year in prison.\n\nThe Schiables\u2019 oldest son, 18, parents, family pastor, Nelson Clark, and other supporters sat in the court to hear Herbert\u2019s lawyer, Bobby Hoof, call him a \"a good man, a righteous man, a spiritual man.\" The couple has seven surviving children, while six of them are in foster care, some residing with relatives. The children are getting an education, medical, dental, and vision care now.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pa. couple, prayer death, faith healing, divine healing, the schiables, treatable pneumonia, manslaughter, medical treatment, medical care, religion-based medical neglect", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Pennsylvania couple was sent to prison after choosing faith healing over traditional medicine, which caused the death of the second child with pneumonia.", "title": "Faith Healing Puts Couple In Prison After Death Of 2nd Child", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pennsylvania-couple-faces-prison-after-2nd-prayer-death-child-pneumonia-should-faith-healing-be", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/20/candles-surface.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Pennsylvania couple was sent to prison after choosing faith healing over traditional medicine, which caused the death of the second child with pneumonia.", "title": "Faith Healing Puts Couple In Prison After Death Of 2nd Child", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pennsylvania-couple-faces-prison-after-2nd-prayer-death-child-pneumonia-should-faith-healing-be", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/20/candles-surface.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/20/candles-surface.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-20T12:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-20T12:00:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Pennsylvania couple was sent to prison after choosing faith healing over traditional medicine, which caused the death of the second child with pneumonia."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7b9e\"", "article_summary": "A Pennsylvania couple was sent to prison after choosing faith healing over traditional medicine, which caused the death of the second child with pneumonia.\nA judge rejected the Schiables' claims that their religious beliefs \u201cclashed\u201d with child welfare laws in both faith-healing cases.\nThe couple, third-generation members, and religious educators of the First Century Gospel Church in northeast Philadelphia, chose to neglect Pennsylvania laws during Brandon\u2019s battle with pneumonia.\nThe couple has seven surviving children, while six of them are in foster care, some residing with relatives.\nWhile the government protects the constitutional right to freedom of religious expression and practice, it is also responsible for enforcing child welfare laws."}
