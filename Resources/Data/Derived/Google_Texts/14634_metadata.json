Moore said in an order. He explained his move as \u201cnecessary for the orderly administration of justice within the state.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court denied the state\u2019s request to stop same-sex marriages in Alabama on Monday morning, and there were scattered reports of judges issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as expected. A United States district court ruled last month that Alabama must issue same-sex marriage licenses starting Monday. Moore issued his order when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.\n\nMORE: Gay Marriage and the Law of the Land\n\nMoore wrote that his order protects both the U.S. and Alabama constitutions. But the move, a dramatic challenge to the authority of the federal judiciary, drew quick condemnation in legal circles. Federal courts supersede state courts and Moore lacks the authority to disregard a federal court decision, they said.\n\nHis move also drew comparison the state\u2019s attempts to avoid implementing federal court decisions during the civil rights era. Then-Gov. George Wallace made a similar states\u2019 rights argument when he famously tried to block the implementation of a federal order to integrate the University of Alabama in 1963.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy S.
