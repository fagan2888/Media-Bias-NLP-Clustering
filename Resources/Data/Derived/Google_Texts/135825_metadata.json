When Vermont four years ago enacted a landmark bill to establish the nation\u2019s first single-payer health care system, they saw their long-sought dream about to be fulfilled.\n\nBut reality hit last month. Governor Peter Shumlin released a financial report that showed the cost of the program would nearly double the size of the state\u2019s budget in the first year alone and require large tax increases for residents and businesses. Shumlin, a Democrat and long-time single-payer advocate, said he would not seek funding for the law, effectively tabling the program called Green Mountain Care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn my judgment, now is not the time to ask our Legislature to take the step of passing a financing plan for Green Mountain Care,\u2019\u2019 Shumlin said.\n\nThe decision not only stunned and angered supporters in Vermont, but also signaled that the dream of universal, government-funded health care in the United States may be near its end. Vermont\u2019s experience, analysts said, shows how difficult \u2014 and costly \u2014 it can be to shift from a system long-dominated by private health insurance, and that the future of universal health care lies within the private market.\n\nIn short, if a liberal state electing a Socialist (US Senator Bernie Sanders) to Congress can\u2019t or won\u2019t put a single-payer system into place, then who will?\n\n\u201cThe idea of single-payer, or a Medicare-for-all type program, has always been a cherished dream for many in the Democratic Party,\u201d said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning Washington think tank. \u201cIn truth, there had never been a hard, developed plan to implement such a dream. In Vermont, they finally developed a plan, and look what happened.\u201d\n\nA single-payer system has been the Holy Grail for progressives since the end of World War II, when President Harry Truman unsuccessfully pushed for a government-run National Health Insurance Plan to provide medical coverage for all Americans. In the 1970s, the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts vainly battled for a variation of Truman\u2019s national insurance plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 1990s, President Bill Clinton turned to the private market to provide universal care, requiring that employers furnish health insurance for their workers. But that plan was rejected, too. Finally, in 2010, after a momentous congressional battle, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, achieving universal coverage by expanding Medicaid, the government health care program for the poor, and mandating private insurance for others.\n\nVermont took Obamacare a step further. In 2011, Shumlin proudly signed a bill to establish a publicly financed, single-payer system. The law required Shumlin to submit a detailed financial plan by 2013.\n\nShumlin missed the deadline, raising fears among supporters and critics alike that single-payer health care would cost much more than anticipated. Those fears were realized on Dec. 17, when Shumlin, two years late and just a month from narrowly winning reelection, released the financial analysis.\n\nThe numbers were stunning. To implement single-payer, the analysis showed, it would cost $4.3 billion in 2017, with Vermont taxpayers picking up $2.6 billion and the federal government covering the rest. To put the figures into perspective, Vermont\u2019s entire fiscal 2015 budget, including both state and federal funds, is about $4.9 billion.\n\nShumlin\u2019s office estimated the state would need to impose new personal income taxes of up to 9.5 percent, on top of current rates that range from 3.55 to 8.95 percent. Businesses would be hit with an 11.5 percent payroll tax, on top of 7.65 percent payroll taxes employer pay for Social Security and Medicare.\n\nAnd even those tax increases might not have been enough. The governor\u2019s office estimated the Green Mountain Care program would run deficits of $82 million by 2020 and $146 million in 2021. Shumlin said he feared the tax increases would harm businesses and the economy.\n\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff Stauch Blaise, 59, a former landscaping firm owner who is now disabled, said health care is \u201can issue of human rights and justice.\u201d\n\nArt Woolf, an economist at the University of Vermont, said Shumlin was right to be worried. Though Vermont\u2019s unemployment rate is 4.4 percent, compared with 5.6 percent nationally, residents and companies are burdened by high property taxes, housing prices, utility costs, and other expenses, he said.\n\nBetsy Bishop, president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, said the 11.5 percent payroll tax would have crippled small companies that account for most of the state\u2019s employment. \u201cOur businesses experienced a collective sigh of relief when the governor announced his decision last month,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nSo what went wrong? In a speech last month, Shumlin explained that conditions had changed since Vermont embarked on Green Mountain Care at the start of the decade. He noted the state\u2019s recovery from the last recession was slower than expected and tax revenues had not grown as much as a result.\n\nHe also said federal funding would be less than anticipated, forcing Vermont residents to cover more of the costs of a single-payer system.\n\nHealth care specialists said Vermont always faced a daunting challenge. Switching from the current system \u2014 a hybrid of private insurance and government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 was inherently complicated, contentious, and costly.\n\nIn Europe, many countries built their universal health care systems from scratch, with some starting early last century when most citizens had no medical coverage and any services provided by governments were welcome, the Brooking Institution\u2019s Aaron said. That allowed those countries to slowly build and expand health care systems over decades.\n\nBut in the United States private insurance arrangements between employees and employers have expanded and matured over the decades, with many people with insurance expecting a high level of medical service. So, switching to a single-payer system would need to meet those higher expectations \u2014 and higher costs \u2014 all at once, Aaron said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to build from scratch than when a system is already up and running,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have maybe created a single-payer system 60 or so years ago, when insurance wasn\u2019t as complete and widespread. But it would be very disruptive and costly today.\u201d\n\nRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national organization representing health care consumers, said he has long believed in the benefits of a single-payer system. But he also remembered his talks with Kennedy. The late senator, Pollack said, expressed regrets he didn\u2019t earlier embrace insurance-based universal care, rather than holding out for a single-payer system that never materialized.\n\nPollack said activists might be better off pushing to improve provisions of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt may change in time and single-payer might become reality,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cBut the political reality and the fiscal realities make it a very tough sell.\u201d\n\nIn Vermont, however, activists have not given up the fight. During Shumlin\u2019s inauguration this month in Montpelier, protesters disrupted festivities to protest the decision to drop the single-payer plan. Twenty-nine protesters were arrested and charged with unlawful trespassing; some were also charged with resisting arrest.\n\nOne of the protesters was Stauch Blaise, 59, a former landscaping firm owner who is now disabled from spine and nerve problems. He said he supported the state\u2019s single-payer plan because he can\u2019t afford all his medical expenses not covered by Medicare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue of human rights and justice,\u201d said Blaise, of East Randolph, Vt.\n\nVermont political analysts say the state\u2019s Progressive Party, which didn\u2019t run gubernatorial candidates against Shumlin in recent elections, is all but certain to nominate a gubernatorial candidate in favor of single-payer care in 2016. Shumlin, who is now in his third two-year term, declined requests for an interview.\n\nFor the time being, many Democrats, who control the Legislature, are rallying around Shumlin, who has held out hope that a single-payer system could be implemented one day in the future.\n\n\u201cHe would have damaged the whole cause of universal health care if he had proceeded with a plan that didn\u2019t work,\u201d said state Senator Claire Ayer, a Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee. \u201cIt costs too much and could create difficulties. It was just completely unsustainable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.1364148228", "eomportal-id": 580140, "description": "Reality hit last month when a financial report that showed the cost of single-payer program would nearly double the size of the state\u2019s budget in the first year alone and require large tax increases.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"city": "Montpelier", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Reality hit last month when a financial report that showed the cost of single-payer program would nearly double the size of the state\u2019s budget in the first year alone and require large tax increases.", "title": "Costs derail Vermont\u2019s single-payer health plan - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/25/costs-derail-vermont-single-payer-health-plan/VTAEZFGpWvTen0QFahW0pO/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/01/20/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/0b9c1a29a6e0479aabe2707c4e8e25c2-0b9c1a29a6e0479aabe2707c4e8e25c2-0.jpg", "longitude": "-72.57538690000001", "state": "VT", "latitude": "44.26005929999999", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "single-payer,peter shumlin,brookings institution,art woolf,green mountain care,bernie sanders,henry j. aaron,president bill clinton,obma,truman", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 20:44:28 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "single-payer,peter shumlin,brookings institution,art woolf,green mountain care,bernie sanders,henry j. aaron,president bill clinton,obma,truman,edward m. kennedy,affordable care act,university of vermont,art woolf,ron pollack,families usa,claire ayer, Peter Shumlin, Bernard  Sanders, Harry S  Truman, Edward M  Kennedy, Bill  Clinton, Barack  Obama, Ron  Pollack,Democratic Party, Senate,House of Representatives, Brookings Institution, University of Vermont, Families USA, Progressive Party, Senate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "b525b1bc-a43b-11e4-95d3-d4bf6021d430"}, "article_summary": "He said he supported the state\u2019s single-payer plan because he can\u2019t afford all his medical expenses not covered by Medicare.\nDemonstrators gathered on the steps of the State House in Montpelier on Dec. 18 for a rally in favor of single-payer health care, following Governor Peter Shumlin\u2019s decision to pull the plug on Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan.\nFor decades, liberal activists yearned for a European-style, single-payer health system that they argued would lead to more affordable, efficient, and comprehensive medical coverage for all citizens.\nDuring Shumlin\u2019s inauguration this month in Montpelier, protesters disrupted festivities to protest the decision to drop the single-payer plan.\nSo, switching to a single-payer system would need to meet those higher expectations \u2014 and higher costs \u2014 all at once, Aaron said."}
