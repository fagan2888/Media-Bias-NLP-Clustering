By now you’ve tried every “How To Get A Six-Pack In 30 Days” challenge you’ve come across with the same disheartening result: a no-pack. The science behind building your ideal six-pack comes down to a very simple formula, but one that is often snubbed by overzealous gym rats. Reduced fat + enlarged abdominal muscles = six-pack. The best abdominal workout in the world is useless on someone who does not consume the right type of diet.

So what food should you eat to develop a six-pack? For your best six-pack-building protein sources, pick up some eggs, chicken, oily fish, and Greek Yogurt. Brown bread and brown rice are a great source of complex carbohydrates, but avoid simple carbohydrates, such as white pasta, white rice, and processed food. Consume at least 150 grams of protein a day and if you’re not into eating oily fish pick up some fish oil supplements which can increase the amount of lean muscle you’re putting on.

In terms of exercise, it’s time to do away with crunches. This outdated ab exercise will only help you achieve damaged spinal discs and lower back pain. Instead of exercises that require you to lay down, try upright exercises which are more effective at engaging your core. Some upright exercises to consider include hanging leg raises, medicine ball leg drops, and kneeling cable crunch. Also, if you’re worried about getting a gym membership, sprinting, skipping, and other fat-burning exercises can be performed almost anywhere.
