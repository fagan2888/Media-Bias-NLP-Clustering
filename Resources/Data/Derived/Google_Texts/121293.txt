BRUNSWICK COUNTY, NC (WWAY) — Heavy rains throughout the night led to multiple sinkholes along roadsides in Brunswick County.

A section of Kingtown Road near the 6100 block was closed due to a sinkhole Saturday.

In Sunset Beach, Department of Transportation crews responded to a sinkhole they said was 20 feet across and 10 feet deep near Highway 179 and Park Road.

“The best thing we can right now is temporarily support the walls of the hole until all the rain stops,” said Rodney Gore with the Department of Transportation.
