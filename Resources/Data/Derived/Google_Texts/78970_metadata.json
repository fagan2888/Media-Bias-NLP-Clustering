On that and other gun issues, he has said that he believes states and not the federal government should set limits. He also voted for NRA-backed bills granting gun manufacturers legal immunity against claims by gun victims, and making it possible to carry checked guns on Amtrak.\u201d\n\nWalsh didn\u2019t say that Sanders has consistently supported specific gun-controls during his tenure in Congress, such as banning semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity bullets, nor allowing people to carry concealed weapons across state lines. Instead, she wrote that Sanders has an \u201copen-minded approach to guns\u201d that\u2019s from \u201chis political reality: He\u2019s the senator from a pro-gun state that suffers little gun violence.\u201d\n\nThat blurry synopsis is the conventional wisdom about Bernie and guns. It echoes reports from this summer recounting the NRA\u2019s surprising endorsement. And like this detailed Politifact.com summary of all Sanders\u2019s congressional gun votes, it notes that talking about guns is outside his comfort zone of economic inequality and justice.\n\nHowever, the Nation and the other reports like it don\u2019t shed real light on where Sanders is coming from. They don\u2019t explain why he supports some gun controls but not others. Nor do they ask if there\u2019s a consistency to Sanders\u2019 positions and votes over the years? They simply suggest that Bernie\u2019s position is muddled and makes a good target for Hillary.\n\nYet there is an explanation. It\u2019s consistent and simpler than many pundits think. And it\u2019s in Bernie\u2019s own words dating back to the campaign where he was first elected to the U.S. House\u2014in 1990\u2014where he was endorsed by the NRA, even after Sanders told them that he would ban assault rifles. That year, Bernie faced Republican incumbent Peter Smith, who beat him by less than 4 percentage points in a three-way race two years before.\n\nIn that 1988 race, Bernie told Vermont sportsmen that he backed an assault weapons ban. Smith told the same sportsmen\u2019s groups that he opposed it, but midway through his first term he changed his mind and co-sponsored an assault rifle ban\u2014even bringing an AK-47 to his press conference. That about-face was seen as a betrayal and is the background to a June 1990 debate sponsored by the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen\u2019s Clubs.\n\nI was at that debate with Smith and three other candidates\u2014as the Sanders\u2019 campaign press secretary\u2014and recorded it. Bernie spoke at length three times and much of what he said is relevant today, and anticipates his congressional record on gun control ever since. Look at how Bernie describes what being a sportsperson is in a rural state, where he is quick to draw the line with weapons that threaten police and have no legitimate use in hunting\u2014he previously was mayor of Vermont\u2019s biggest city, and his record of being very clear with the gun lobby and rural people about where he stands. His approach, despite the Nation\u2019s characterization, isn\u2019t \u201copen-minded.\u201d\n\nThe debate opened with the simple question, \u201cHow would you define a sportsmen?\u201d\n\nBernie began his reply, \u201cI would define a sportsmen\u2014not as a sportsman, but as a sportsperson, to begin with. There are many women who are involved in hunting and fishing and other outdoor activities. Sportspeople are people who enjoy communion with nature. They enjoy getting out in the woods. They enjoy fishing in a pond. They enjoy taking their kids out away from the hustle and bustle of dail life. And they can be in contact with nature.\n\nIn our state, which is one of the most rural states in America, there are tens and tens of thousands of Vermonters for whom going out and fishing, hunting and walking\u2014walking through the snow, walking in the spring\u2014is of extraordinary importance. And very often these are people who do not have the sums of money to go to the yachting clubs, or country clubs, or to buy big boats, but they enjoy what nature has given us. So, as an overview, that\u2019s how I would define a sportsperson.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, Bernie\u2014who moved to rural northeastern Vermont in the late 1960s\u2014has an appreciation and feeling for where hunting and fishing fit into the lives of lower income rural people. He\u2019s not a hunter or a fisherman. When he grew up in Brooklyn, he was a nerdy jock\u2014being captivated by ideas and a high school miler who hoped for a track scholarship for college. But like many people who settled in Vermont for generations, he was drawn to its freer and greener pastures and respected its local culture.\n\nNext, the 1990 debate turned to gun control. The moderator, who clearly was a Second Amendment absolutist, went after Bernie\u2014to test his mettle after Smith\u2019s about-face.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberals pointing at his endorsement from the NRA and his vote against the Brady Bill are missing the big picture VIDEO", "title": "Bernie Sanders\u2019 critics misfire: The Vermont senator\u2019s gun record is better than it looks", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Liberals pointing at his endorsement from the NRA and his vote against the Brady Bill are missing the big picture VIDEO", "title": "Bernie Sanders\u2019 critics misfire: The Vermont senator\u2019s gun record is better than it looks", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/10/what_bernies_gun_control_critics_get_wrong_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie-sanders-screen-shot-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liberals pointing at his endorsement from the NRA and his vote against the Brady Bill are missing the big picture VIDEO", "title": "Bernie Sanders\u2019 critics misfire: The Vermont senator\u2019s gun record is better than it looks", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie-sanders-screen-shot-2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bernie Sanders, Brady Bill, Congress, Gun Control", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd58b\"", "article_summary": "Bernie spoke at length three times and much of what he said is relevant today, and anticipates his congressional record on gun control ever since.\nTopics: AlterNet, Bernie Sanders, Brady Bill, Congress, Gun Control, Elections News, Media News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetEarlier this week, The Nation announced that Bernie Sanders was not as progressive on gun control as Hillary Clinton, suggesting that Sanders\u2019s mixed record on gun control bills during his 25-year congressional career could give Clinton an edge with primary voters\u2014especially after the mass shooting at Oregon\u2019s Umpqua Community College.\nNext, the 1990 debate turned to gun control.\nIn that 1988 race, Bernie told Vermont sportsmen that he backed an assault weapons ban.\nOn that and other gun issues, he has said that he believes states and not the federal government should set limits."}
