Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah expansion plan, which would have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicaid expansion monies and covered tens of thousands more needy Utahns.\n\nInstead, a GOP-House generated plan was passed and signed by a disappointed Herbert, which only covers around 16,000 of Utah\u2019s poorest, sickest people and doesn\u2019t get the extra funds that would have come through Obamacare\u2019s expansion.\n\nPollster Dan Jones & Associates finds that 51 percent of Utahns believe Medicaid should have been expanded to include all those in other expansion plans \u2013 not just what the Legislature did.\n\nNineteen percent support just what the Legislature did.\n\nEighteen percent didn\u2019t want any expansion of Medicaid at all, and 12 percent didn\u2019t know.\n\nUtahns are fairly well educated on Medicaid expansion, Herbert and lawmakers have been debating various expansions for more than two years, with Healthy Utah passing the 2015 Senate, but failing in the House.\n\nThe so-called Gang of Six \u2013 an all-Republican study group of top state officeholders \u2013 came up with a plan last summer that went nowhere. There wasn\u2019t even a formal vote after it died a quick death in the House GOP caucus.\n\nAnother compromise, HB437, finally did pass in March and Herbert signed it into law, saying he hopes future Legislatures may revisit Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe expansion is a campaign issue between Republican Herbert and his GOP challenger, Jonathan Johnson.\n\nJohnson says he wouldn\u2019t expand Medicaid at all, arguing Healthy Utah would be too costly and just lead to tax hikes.\n\nHerbert defends his failed option, saying it would bring into Utah hundreds of millions of dollars state taxpayers are sending to D.C. under Obamacare, and should get at least much of it back.\n\nJones finds that Utah Republicans are split over Medicaid expansion:\n\n34 percent of the rank-and-file want to cover move folks than the 16,000 the Legislature approved.\n\n28 percent say what lawmakers passed in the 2016 session is adequate.\n\n24 percent are with Johnson, no Medicaid expansion at all.\n\nJohnson impressed Republicans by getting 55 percent of Saturday\u2019s4,000 GOP delegates in convention. Herbert got 45 percent, and so officially advances to a primary with Johnson, even though Herbert would have gotten there anyway by gathering 28,000 voter signatures under the new SB54 election law.\n\nNow Herbert and Johnson have nine weeks to convince GOP primary voters to pick them. Herbert is well ahead in the last Jones poll for UtahPolicy.\n\nIn his new survey, Jones finds that Democrats really want Medicaid expanded more \u2013 87 percent say expand medical coverage to more Utahns sick and poor, 5 percent say what the GOP Legislature did is adequate, 5 percent say don\u2019t expand Medicaid at all, and 3 percent don\u2019t know.\n\nMost political independents also favor greater Medicaid expansion, 67 percent want all covered, 10 percent like what the Legislature did, 14 percent say don\u2019t expand the program at all, and 9 percent don\u2019t know.\n\nThus, Johnson has a slight advantage with GOP voters on this issue going into the June 28 primary with Herbert.\n\nBut should Herbert win the nomination, he would be on the right side of most Utah voters as he tries for his third election to the governorship.\n\nSome other demographic findings in the latest Jones\u2019 poll on Medicaid:\n\n31 percent of those who said they are \u201cvery conservative\u201d politically are with Johnson \u2013 no expansion at all -- 28 percent say they like what the Legislature did, 28 percent favor greater expansion, and 13 percent don\u2019t know.\n\n39 percent of those who said they are \u201cvery active\u201d in the LDS Church support greater expansion, 26 percent of active Mormons like what lawmakers did, 21 percent don\u2019t want any Medicaid expansion, and 14 percent don\u2019t know.\n\nThose who said they are Mormons, but not active, Catholics; Protestants; and have no religion; all greatly (58-to-79 percent) favor expanding Medicaid to more of the sick and poor.\n\nLDS Church leaders did not endorse Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah, although leaders did say more should be done to help the poor and sick.\n\nMany other religious groups in Utah did support Healthy Utah, as did various civic groups and, ultimately, Democratic legislators.\n\nJones polled 600 Utahns from March 23 to April 5. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most Utahns say the GOP-controlled Legislature didn\u2019t go far enough in Medicaid expansion this year, a new UtahPolicy poll finds.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Bob Bernick", "og": {"url": "http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/9290-poll-utahns-want-larger-medicaid-expansion", "site_name": "utahpolicy.com", "image": "http://utahpolicy.com/images/articles/Utah_State_Capitol_06.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Poll: Utahns Want Larger Medicaid Expansion"}, "google-site-verification": "lihgswQmNHE4uzDhVlR0Saxekx4JgwwjFYC6fjhIvCM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah expansion plan, which would have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicaid expansion monies and covered tens of thousands more needy Utahns.\nMost Utahns say the GOP-controlled Legislature didn\u2019t go far enough in Medicaid expansion this year, a new UtahPolicy poll finds.\nUtahns are fairly well educated on Medicaid expansion, Herbert and lawmakers have been debating various expansions for more than two years, with Healthy Utah passing the 2015 Senate, but failing in the House.\nAnother compromise, HB437, finally did pass in March and Herbert signed it into law, saying he hopes future Legislatures may revisit Medicaid expansion.\n24 percent are with Johnson, no Medicaid expansion at all."}
