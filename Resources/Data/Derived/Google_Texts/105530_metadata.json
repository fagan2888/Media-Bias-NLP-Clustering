The space, leased from the city of La Grange, was a \u201csubstation\u201d for Oldham County EMS, which is headquartered on Ky. 146 in La Grange, EMS Director Todd Early said.\n\nOldham County EMS opted not to renew its lease when it expired earlier this year, and the initial plans approved last year by La Grange City Council \u2014 which included bays for Oldham County EMS to store two ambulances \u2014 changed.\n\nInstead of building the ambulance bays, the space will remain vacant, and the city will try to rent it out to someone else.\n\nEarly said the ambulances formerly stored at the old fire station have moved to a temporary spot at Baptist Health La Grange, where Oldham County EMS hopes to build an additional station in the near future. Planning is in its earliest stages, Early said, but he would like to see it up and running by the end of the year.\n\nThe conversion of the firehouse into a new police station will be paid for with the rent money EMS has already paid the city for the space it occupied, as well as fees from alcohol sales and the sale of the current police building.\n\nLammlein said the city will auction off the current police station after the department moves. The current facility has been appraised, Lammlein said, although he declined to disclose its value.\n\nCollett said he is looking forward to having a more up-to-date building, \u201csomething we can be proud of and can be proud to have the public in.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks the new location will benefit the community.\n\n\u201cHaving the police department on Main Street, we\u2019re going to be much more visible, much more open to the public,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be nice for the community to see the police station, stop by the police station, see our officers out and about more often around the Main Street area.\u201d\n\nReporter Kirsten Clark can be reached at (502) 582-4144 or on Twitter by following @kirstenlmclark.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1hwgiN5", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "La Grange Police Department is expected to move into its new home on Main Street by July.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "La Grange Police Department is expected to move into its new home on Main Street by July.", "title": "Old La Grange firehouse will become police headquarters", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/oldham/2014/06/08/old-la-grange-firehouse-will-become-police-headquarters/10201275/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "La Grange Police Department is expected to move into its new home on Main Street by July.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/08/policeasb01.jpg", "title": "Old La Grange firehouse will become police headquarters", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/oldham", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7693856023716441bc41369055bedd0168e81635/c=750-0-2250-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/08/policeasb01.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e47265371f176e1ca60045acf5227a963f0f1c0e/c=500-0-2500-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/08/policeasb01.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bbe2e70b2c309b93e709f274c1c5ea3dd9112584/c=166-0-2833-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/08/policeasb01.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cbc94ded4cd4bf3d281aa6ac7a3bc6555ff8c958/c=0-156-3000-1844&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/08/policeasb01.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-08T15:48:01-04:00", "shorthed": "La Grange firehouse becomes police HQ", "articleid": 10201275, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2887f5d7d58a75a6437c45e987fd994202334aff/c=0-156-3000-1844/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/08/policeasb01.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4116c3ed324a74438ec644f3fd7c164ae39936f3/c=938-0-2063-2000/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/08/policeasb01.jpg"}, "author": "Kirsten Clark", "title": "Old La Grange firehouse will become police headquarters", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd207f\"", "article_summary": "The space, leased from the city of La Grange, was a \u201csubstation\u201d for Oldham County EMS, which is headquartered on Ky. 146 in La Grange, EMS Director Todd Early said.\nConstruction on a $300,000 project to transform the former La Grange firehouse at Main Street and Second Avenue into the police department\u2019s new home began at the end of March.\nLa Grange Fire and Rescue moved out of the 24-year-old building and into its new $4 million facility on Ky. 53 two years ago.\nBuy Photo La Grange Police Chief Kevin Collett said he is looking forward to the department\u2019s new headquarters \u2014 \u201csomething we can be proud of and can be proud to have the public in.\u201d (Photo: Aaron Borton/Special to the Courier-Journal)Buy PhotoThe La Grange Police Department has occupied its West Jefferson Street headquarters since Chief Kevin Collett was a kid in the 1980s.\nEarly said the ambulances formerly stored at the old fire station have moved to a temporary spot at Baptist Health La Grange, where Oldham County EMS hopes to build an additional station in the near future."}
