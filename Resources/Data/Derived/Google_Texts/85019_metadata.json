He\u2019s a Kenyan and it has been a long time.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s visit this weekend will be his fourth to Africa since becoming US president, but his first to Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace, since taking office in 2009.\n\nBut while celebrated as a hero throughout the country, many Kenyans have been disappointed it has taken him until almost the end of his second term in office to make the trip.\n\nA presidential visit to Kenya had been put on ice while President Uhuru Kenyatta faced charges of crimes against humanity for his role in 2007-2008 post-election violence.\n\nThe International Criminal Court has since suspended that prosecution.\n\nStreet children not happy\n\nBut some are frustrated it has taken a visiting president to make the improvements.\n\n\u201cOne wonders why it takes a distinguished guest to beautify the city,\u201d said taxi driver Douglas Mwangi.\n\nThe local council says it is splashing out some $440,000, but critics say the makeover is limited to a few official buildings and the routes taken by the US president\u2019s convoy.\n\nThe council insist the improvements are more than just for Obama.\n\n\u201cNairobi is an economic hub in the region, and these improvements such as street lighting and cleaning of the city, will benefit all residents of the city,\u201d added Oyake.\n\nOthers are not so pleased, especially the street children being forced out from central areas.\n\n\u201cEveryday we get arrested,\u201d said Moses, a 16-year old who lives on the streets and sniffs glue.\n\n\u201cBefore, we could enter the town but now it\u2019s too risky for us. We are begging for money when the cars are stopped in the traffic.\u201d\n\nExcitement is growing. Kenya\u2019s Luo people\u2014the ethnic community of Obama\u2019s father, who come from the western region towards the border with Uganda\u2014are particularly proud, holding a recent celebration of music and dancing, dubbed the Luo Obama Festival.\n\n\u201cHis father was a Kenyan - not only a Kenyan but a Luo,\u201d said businessman Jonathan Mweke. \u201cWe are happy, we are proud\u2026 he will be one of us.\u201d\n\nIn Nairobi, actors are rehearsing a musical stage version of Obama\u2019s autobiography, Dreams from My Father.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important moment that we must capture as artists,\u201d said director George Orido.\n\n\u201cMusic is a universal language so those who want to understand who Obama is, this big visitor who everyone is talking about\u2026 they can come and watch our play.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Obamacare': Kenya's capital Nairobi gets a facelift for US president's visit", "og": {"site_name": "MG Africa", "description": "In Nairobi, actors are rehearsing a musical stage version of Obama's autobiography, Dreams from My Father.", "title": "'Obamacare': Kenya's capital Nairobi gets a facelift for US president's visit", "url": "http://mgafrica.com/article/2015-07-20-obamacare-kenyas-capital-nairobi-gets-makeover-for-us-presidents-visit/", "image": "http://cdn.mg.co.za/crop/content/images/2015/07/20/3531b0ed8fdbb6689b22e8291dda7749a145079d_landscape.jpg/600x250/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Nairobi, actors are rehearsing a musical stage version of Obama's autobiography, Dreams from My Father.", "creator": "@MandGAfrica", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.mg.co.za/crop/content/images/2015/07/20/3531b0ed8fdbb6689b22e8291dda7749a145079d_landscape.jpg/600x250/"}, "title": "'Obamacare': Kenya's capital Nairobi gets a facelift for US president's visit", "site": "@MandGAfrica", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 800545203}, "keywords": "Dreams From My Father, Barack Obama, Kenya Visit, Nairobi, Luo People,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-20 13:10:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20 13:10:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey are doing maintenance works like weeding, grass cutting,\u201d said city council official Leah Oyake.\nKenya\u2019s Luo people\u2014the ethnic community of Obama\u2019s father, who come from the western region towards the border with Uganda\u2014are particularly proud, holding a recent celebration of music and dancing, dubbed the Luo Obama Festival.\nIN Kenya, they\u2019ve dubbed it \u2018Obamacare\u2019: potholes filled, new pavements and overnight flower beds, as Nairobi is spruced up for the capital\u2019s most awaited visitor, US President Barack Obama.\n\u201cHis father was a Kenyan - not only a Kenyan but a Luo,\u201d said businessman Jonathan Mweke.\nA presidential visit to Kenya had been put on ice while President Uhuru Kenyatta faced charges of crimes against humanity for his role in 2007-2008 post-election violence."}
