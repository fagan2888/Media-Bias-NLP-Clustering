Just who is driving the 'new civil rights movement' demonstrations on Ferguson?

If you think all the demonstrators across America in the wake of the grand jury in Missouri declining to issue a true bill on Officer Wilson are motivated by genuine racial grievances, think again. The message is in the signs, which are basically advertising.

Study the photos of demonstrations in Ferguson, and about Ferguson across the U.S., and it becomes clear who is driving the new civil rights movement. REVCOM.US is just one of a multitude of alleged players. SOCIALISTWORKER.ORG is an arm of the International Socialist Organization, “committed to building a left alternative….a different kind of society.” But then, the question really is: who’s paying for the signage, and how are the signs being distributed? The MSM is not asking that question.
