And that\u2019s just the way I see it.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan Just Admitted One of the GOP\u2019s Biggest Mistakes\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person. I\u2019d like to think my face is somewhat fresh, but I\u2019m not for this conversation. I think you need to run for president if you\u2019re going to run for president, and I\u2019m not running for president. Period, end of story.\u201d\n\nRyan made a similar \u2018Shermanesque\u2019 statement to The Times of Israel over the weekend. \u201cI decided not to run for president,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you should run if you\u2019re going to be president. I think you should start in Iowa and run to the tape.\u201d\n\nYet despite Ryan\u2019s repeated dismissals, top Republicans can\u2019t stop themselves from talking about the idea of having their 2012 vice presidential nominee at the top of the ticket.\n\nRelated: Trump Is the Wrong Messenger, But He\u2019s Raised Some of the Right Issues\n\n\"He's the most conservative, least establishment member of the establishment,\" a GOP source told Politico. \"That's what you need to be.\"\n\nDespite his public claims, Ryan has, at times, fed the speculation. He received national media coverage last month for his \u201cState of American Politics\u201d speech, an address aimed at raising the tone above the venomous, sometimes vulgar, talk that has come to dominate the GOP presidential primary.\n\nRyan, 46, has also not shied away from taking on Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, like when the real estate mogul proposed to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. \u201cThis is not conservatism,\u201d Ryan said at the time. \u201cWhat was proposed yesterday is not what this Party stands for\u2026.\u201d\n\nRelated: GOP Accused of \u2018Stealing Delegates\u2019 to Dump Trump\n\nHe has since called the former reality TV star out, though usually not by name, on several more occasions, such as when Trump was slow to disavow support from former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke.\n\nThat Ryan has taken shots at Trump and lived to talk about it has led some within the GOP to believe he has a strong enough jaw to survive a floor flight when Republicans gather in Cleveland in July. Ryan is slated to serve as chair for the convention.\n\nBuzz is already building that the convention will be unlike any in recent history, with Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (TX) and Ohio Governor John Kasich all prepping for an open meeting that could see multiple ballots before any of them garner the 1,237 delegates needed to capture the nomination.\n\nIn fact, Trump and Cruz, who have been at each other\u2019s throats for weeks, are teaming up to keep Kasich off the ballot at the convention, according to NBC News. The thinking is that a two-man race would benefit both camps.\n\nThe overlapping interests show that the idea of horse-trading is very much on the minds of the Republicans months before the convention gavels in, ensuring that talk about Ryan being drafted, much the way he was for the speakership after the surprise retirement announcement by his predecessor John Boehner, will continue.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In what is becoming an almost weekly ritual of the 2016 election, House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday emphatically rejected the idea that he would accept the Republican presidential nomination if the GOP convention this summer becomes deadlocked.", "title": "Why the GOP Won\u2019t Give Up on Paul Ryan as a Presidential Nominee", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/04/Why-GOP-Won-t-Give-Paul-Ryan-Presidential-Nominee", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05302011_Ryan_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/04/Why-GOP-Won-t-Give-Paul-Ryan-Presidential-Nominee", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05302011_Ryan_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In what is becoming an almost weekly ritual of the 2016 election, House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday emphatically rejected the idea that he would accept the Republican presidential nomination if the GOP convention this summer becomes deadlocked.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In what is becoming an almost weekly ritual of the 2016 election, House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday emphatically rejected the idea that he would accept the Republican presidential nomination if the GOP convention this summer becomes deadlocked.\nI think you need to run for president if you\u2019re going to run for president, and I\u2019m not running for president.\nRelated: Paul Ryan Just Admitted One of the GOP\u2019s Biggest Mistakes\u201cI\u2019m not that person.\nHe received national media coverage last month for his \u201cState of American Politics\u201d speech, an address aimed at raising the tone above the venomous, sometimes vulgar, talk that has come to dominate the GOP presidential primary.\n\"If you want to be president, you should go run for president."}
