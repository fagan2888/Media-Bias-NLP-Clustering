That\u2019s exactly how they want you to feel, according to award-winning journalist David Kupelian.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to overcome anger because people don\u2019t realize that not only does all this crazy stuff going on make them angry, which is understandable because [the left is] destroying the country, but causing the anger is strategic,\u201d said Kupelian in a recent interview on \u201cThe Jesse Lee Peterson Radio Show.\u201d \u201cYou are intended to become angry.\u201d\n\nIn his new book, \u201cThe Snapping of the American Mind,\u201d Kupelian writes that stoking anger and resentment is a key tactic employed by the left.\n\nIt\u2019s done because the ultimate goal is to radically transform society, and the people will not be in the mood for a revolution if they are calm and happy. In fact, stirring up anger is absolutely essential to the fundamental transformation of America, according to Kupelian.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work if people don\u2019t get mad,\u201d he told Peterson\u2019s audience. \u201cLet me put it another way: It\u2019s totally dependent on your reaction, your overreaction, your [hate]. When you\u2019re angry and upset and ticked off and frustrated, you\u2019re not on your game. You\u2019re not thinking right. It\u2019s almost like a temporary insanity.\u201d\n\nHe observed that the word \u201cmad\u201d can mean either angry or insane, which is appropriate, because people do become a little insane when they\u2019re very angry.\n\nSPECIAL OFFER: Get your copy of David Kupelian\u2019s \u201cThe Snapping of the American Mind: Healing a Nation Broken by a Lawless Government and Godless Culture\u201d \u2013 autographed and personalized \u2013 at a special discount at the WND Superstore!\n\nConservatives would argue President Obama has done a lot to drive Americans mad. For example, he has granted a path to citizenship to millions of illegal aliens. He has sided with protesters rather than police officers. He has struck a nuclear deal with Iran. Then there\u2019s Obamacare, marriage and abortion.\n\n\u201cWhat Obama has brought to the table is he has taken cans of gasoline and poured it all over this fire that has already been burning in our country, and he\u2019s accelerating it,\u201d Kupelian said. \u201cHe\u2019s like an arsonist. He\u2019s creating this conflagration.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Antidote,\u201d supported Kupelian\u2019s arguments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen good people just go off the deep end because they became so frustrated at Obama and what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Peterson, who also writes a WND column. \u201cIt\u2019s as though he\u2019s going around the country looking for everything that\u2019s good and attacking it. And then when you get mad at him and point it out, he lies about it, but yet he continues with the frustration; and a lot of people don\u2019t know how to handle that type of evil. And I can totally see and have seen why they do snap.\u201d\n\nPeterson said it doesn\u2019t help that many black pastors encourage their parishioners to be angry.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing is there are men in churches that have taught their congregations that anger is good and that you should learn to control your anger. but you need the anger. And these people who have been taught that are very unhappy with the anger, but they\u2019re trying to hold onto it, because the preacher said it\u2019s good to have,\u201d he said.\n\nKupelian pointed out the consequences can be dire when anger causes Americans to snap.\n\n\u201cHe has lit a match to where we have the school shootings, the mass shootings are happening more often,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have young people born in the greatest country on Earth, the United States of America, they haul off and go to Syria so they can become barbarians or sex slaves, joining ISIS. So we are snapping more rapidly than ever.\u201d\n\nThe two authors agreed the country needs to heal, as evidenced by the fact that the subtitles of both of their new books begin with the word \u201chealing.\u201d\n\nWatch the interview:\n\n\u201cAmerica needs a healing, and it needs it real badly. And we need the healing sooner rather than later, and so we need to have some honest, insightful discussion about what\u2019s really, really going on,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nKupelian warned Americans not to disengage from the political process or the culture wars, because that will only make it easier for the left to achieve its goals.\n\nSaid Kupelian: \u201cI know a lot of people who don\u2019t listen to the news anymore and don\u2019t vote, because it\u2019s so upsetting to them that they just for their own peace of mind say: \u2018I can\u2019t watch it anymore. I can\u2019t stand Obama.\u2019 You know what? The bad guys win when the good guys stay home.\u201d\n\nKupelian said the key is for right-leaning Americans to realize the left wants to make them angry and upset. Then they need to stand up to the left in a firm but non-angry way.\n\n\u201cThey want us to be angry and upset and frustrated and snapping, and we need to frustrate them by saying: \u2018Uh-uh. You are insane. \u2026 You guys are nuts. You\u2019ve been doing this to us for a hundred years. We\u2019re not taking it anymore.\u2019 But we can do it in a dignified way, and there\u2019s great power in that.\u201d\n\nPeterson confessed that he himself was driven by anger as a young man. What he didn\u2019t realize at the time was that his anger was causing him to make bad decisions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time that that was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the anger was removed from me by God that I see, \u2018Wow, no wonder my life was so messed up.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t see what I was doing.\u201d\n\nSPECIAL OFFER: Get your copy of David Kupelian\u2019s \u201cThe Snapping of the American Mind: Healing a Nation Broken by a Lawless Government and Godless Culture\u201d \u2013 autographed and personalized \u2013 at a special discount at the WND Superstore!\n\nAlso, get Kupelian\u2019s culture-war bestseller, \u201cThe Marketing of Evil\u201d \u2013 now available in paperback \u2013 and the acclaimed sequel, \u201cHow Evil Works,\u201d also in paperback \u2013 all available, autographed by the author, at the WND Superstore!", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "By Paul Bremmer Are you feeling frustrated, disaffected or just plain angry at the Obama administration and the progressive left in general?
