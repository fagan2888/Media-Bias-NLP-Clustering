The Metro system said it would reopen Monday with very limited underground service on only three lines, and local authorities said it could take days for snowplows to reach some residential streets.\n\n\"This is unlike anything many of us have seen in our lifetimes,\" Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said of the blizzard's impact on the Metro system, which reaches 730,000 trips on the typical weekday, according to The Washington Post. \"It\u2019s going to take days to fully recover.\"\n\nSee also: Here are all the records that the snowstorm set over the weekend\n\nTotals in the region ranged from 10 inches to more than 35 inches, with the heaviest accumulation recorded to the north and west of Washington, D.C.\n\nFederal government offices in the Washington area will be closed on Monday, the Office of Personnel Management said. Many state and county governments in the region also announced that they would be closed on Monday.\n\nJUST IN @GovernorVA authorizes #VA govt to shutdown MONDAY. @nbcwashington pic.twitter.com/GAGhOA96Ug \u2014 David Culver (@David_Culver) January 24, 2016\n\nThroughout the course of the storm, local and regional authorities repeatedly urged drivers to stay off the roads and projected that it would take days to dig out from the snow and restore movement to the region.\n\n\"Two feet of snow is a lot to move,\" Christopher Geldart, the director of the city's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency said, calling the snow removal a \"major operation.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be in our response phase for at least 24 to 36 hours, and the recovery phase for much longer than that.\u201d\n\nDC officials say there has been 1 death in the city so far due to the snow storm. An 82 yr old man went into cardiac arrest while shoveling \u2014 Abigail Hauslohner (@ahauslohner) January 24, 2016\n\nSchool systems and colleges in the Washington, D.C. region said they planned to close on Monday, with some closures already extending into Tuesday.\n\nAirline passengers up and down the East Coast were stranded due to the storm, including at the D.C. region's three major airports. Reagan National and Dulles International airports were expected to resume limited operations on Monday.\n\nWe're digging out of 29.3\" of snow at IAD, and we plan to gradually restart operations there & at surrounding airports on Monday afternoon. \u2014 United (@united) January 24, 2016\n\nEven Congress's plans were snarled by the weather. House lawmakers will no longer be in session this week due to the \"severity of the winter storm in the D.C. area,\" a notice sent to lawmakers Sunday morning said. The House will stay out of session until Feb. 1, delaying a vote on whether to override President Barack Obama's veto on the GOP reconciliation bill, which would have repealed Obamacare.\n\nThe Senate could return to Washington on Wednesday, as a vote set for Tuesday afternoon has been rescheduled for then.\n\nThe storm also stopped Vice President Joe Biden from returning to Washington D.C. from Turkey, where he had been meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other officials there.\n\nBiden had planned to return to Washington on Saturday, but White House officials said Air Force Two would redirect to Miami and that Biden would return to Washington, D.C. once the weather cleared up.\n\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter, who was returning from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland was also diverted to MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Fla.\n\nHave something to add to this story?
