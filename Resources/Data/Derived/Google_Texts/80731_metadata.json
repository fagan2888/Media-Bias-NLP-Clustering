On September 16th, during a speech at the Legal Service Corporation\u2019s fortieth anniversary, the Vice-President talked about soldiers who have been hounded by debt collectors even during deployments. He condemned the \u201cShylocks who took advantage of these women and men while overseas.\u201d In footage of the speech, his gaze then sweeps across the audience, and, judging from the flicker that passes across his face, one senses that he glimpsed a familiar hint that he may have devoured another heaping portion of his foot.\n\n\u201cAction is eloquence,\u201d Shakespeare wrote in \u201cCoriolanus,\u201d just a few years after he wrote \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d the play that established a Shylock as a reliable slur. Within a few hours, the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s national director, Abraham Foxman, said, \u201cShylock represents the medieval stereotype about Jews and remains an offensive characterization to this day.\u201d Because Biden is a longtime supporter of the Jewish community, Foxman was in a bit of a fix, so he sought to place the Vice-President\u2019s podiatric self-cannibalization into the proper context: \u201cWhen someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice-President Joe Biden, uses the term \u2018Shylocked\u2019 to describe unscrupulous money lenders dealing with service men and women, we see once again how deeply embedded this stereotype about Jews is in society.\u201d (Biden soon apologized for \u201ca poor choice of words.\u201d)\n\nBiden\u2019s uncomfortable autumn was just beginning. The next day, at a kickoff event in Des Moines for the Nuns on the Bus \u201cWe the People, We the Voters\u201d tour, Biden praised Singapore\u2019s former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as \u201cthe wisest man in the Orient.\u201d The \u201cOrient\u201d and \u201coriental\u201d may still be used when referring to carpets, or in the names of schools, but not for places, and certainly not with regard to people. Ninio Fetalvo, the Republican National Committee Asian-American and Pacific Islander spokesman, said that Biden\u2019s comment was \u201cnot only disrespectful but also uses unacceptable imperialist undertones.\u201d\n\nThen, last week, at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, Biden finished his formal remarks and went free range when a student asked whether the U.S. should have intervened earlier in Syria. \u201cOur allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe Turks were great friends, and I have a great relationship with Erdo\u011fan, [whom] I just spent a lot of time with, [and] the Saudis, the Emirates, et cetera. What were they doing? They were so determined to take down Assad, and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia war, what did they do? They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad\u2013except that the people who were being supplied, [they] were Al Nusra, and Al Qaeda, and the extremist elements of jihadis who were coming from other parts of the world.\u201d\n\nErdo\u011fan demanded an apology and called his relationship with Biden \u201chistory.\u201d Biden apologized to Erdo\u011fan two days later, and has been apologizing to everyone else ever since.\n\nUnder the conventions of politics, once is flub; often is a flaw. Biden\u2019s misadventures, which tend to strike when he ventures \u201coff prompter,\u201d as his staff calls it, feed on one another, because the pattern is already in place. Over the years (and in preparation for a piece on Biden), I have come to diagnose a few distinct sources of Biden\u2019s troubles.\n\nThe most common is the Biden crime of passion. In March, during a trip to Scottsdale, Arizona, he was talking about health-care reform with reporters outside Butterfield\u2019s Pancake House, when he spotted a young woman on a bench and bounded over to enlist her as a prop, pitching her on the need to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act: \u201cDo it for your parents! Give them peace of mind!\u201d he implored. After he had moved on, she explained to reporters that she couldn\u2019t sign up because she was a tourist visiting from Canada. (\u201cI just didn\u2019t know if I should say.\u201d) Some of this is just salty. On April 29th, in a White House event on protecting students from sexual assault, Biden said that, where he came from, when \u201ca man raised his hand to a woman, you had the job to kick the living crap out of him if he did it. Excuse my language.\u201d\n\nThe second is Biden\u2019s intermittent interest in precision, a tendency that began in childhood and was reinforced during his tenure in the United States Senate. As a kid, Biden was no scholar. In his memoir, he wrote, \u201cJoe Biden wasn\u2019t hitting the library on very many Saturday nights.\u201d That fed an intellectual insecurity that lingers and nudges him to grasp a bit too lustily at a statistic, or to plunge headlong into the classics. (After the Shylock moment, Foxman said, \u201cJoe and I agreed that perhaps he needs to bone up on his Shakespeare.\u201d) In a commencement address at the University of Pennsylvania in May, for instance, he hailed American workers as \u201cthree times as productive as any worker in the world.\u201d (By most measurements, we trail Norway and Ireland.) During his thirty-four years as a senator from Delaware, Biden, like many of his peers, did not receive constant attention, despite his best efforts. Therefore, most of what he said went unrecorded, and so his words inhabited a happy no man\u2019s land between quality and quantity. If he said something unfortunate, it was generally swept away in the ambient wind produced by his colleagues. Once he was tapped as a V.P. candidate, his statements were parsed.\n\nThe last category, and one that has never actually served him well in Washington, is a tendency to say things that are true. This causes him trouble at work, because honesty in American politics is taken as an absence of self-control. And, given his position, Biden\u2019s candor can have high stakes\u2014as it did with Erdo\u011fan.\n\nIn describing the role of America\u2019s regional allies in Syria, Biden was largely correct. The U.S. has publicly called on the Turks to seal their border to jihadists en route to Syria, and experts do not question that money from Gulf countries has ended up in the hands of militant extremists there. Andrew J. Tabler, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told the Times\u2019s Mark Landler that \u201cthere are factual mistakes, and then there are political mistakes\u201d\u2014and Biden\u2019s was the latter.\n\nBiden\u2019s off-the-cuff moments at Harvard distracted us from what was, not incidentally, an important speech, in which he drew connections between crises\u2014 ISIS , Ukraine, Ebola\u2014and the territorial tensions in East Asia. Building on President Obama\u2019s speech at the United Nations, which invoked the importance of a \u201clanguage of force\u201d in dealing with ISIS , Biden called for other kinds of active response: strengthening NATO , and helping \u201csmall nations resist the blackmail and coercion of larger powers using new asymmetric weapons\u201d (a reference to Russia and China). He described a new era defined by an \u201cincredible diffusion of power within states and among states that has led to greater instability\u201d requiring \u201ca global response involving more players, more diverse players than ever before.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke to Biden this spring, he told me, \u201cIt\u2019s probably better that they think I make off-the-cuff comments. I don\u2019t say very much I don\u2019t really think through. I know that sounds inconsistent with Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe Vice-President\u2019s twilight war with his words is not likely to end soon, in part because, curiously, his speechifying is something of a private triumph in itself. As a child, he had a crippling stutter. He was nearly in college before he put it behind him and discovered, to his surprise, that he could give a decent speech. Importantly, and a bit ominously, he learned that keeping his crowd meant going off script. He wrote, \u201cI could watch an audience for their reaction. If I felt myself losing them, I would extemporize, tell a joke, focus in on a single person who wasn\u2019t paying attention and call him out. I fell in love with the idea of being able to sway a jury\u2014and being able to see it happen right before my eyes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s misadventures, which tend to strike when he ventures off script, feed on one another, because the pattern is already in place.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s misadventures, which tend to strike when he ventures off script, feed on one another, because the pattern is already in place.", "title": "Off Prompter: Joe Biden Explained - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Osnos-Biden-1200-630.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2014-10-09T07:56:54-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/prompter-joe-biden-explained", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joe Biden\u2019s misadventures, which tend to strike when he ventures off script, feed on one another, because the pattern is already in place.", "title": "Off Prompter: Joe Biden Explained - The New Yorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Osnos-Biden-1200-630.jpg", "creator": "@eosnos", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"2858007\",\"title_alt\":\"Off Prompter: Joe Biden Explained\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/10\\/Osnos-Biden-728-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-10-09T06:00:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T07:56:54-04:00"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 2858007, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Joe Biden, Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd762e\"", "article_summary": "In anticipation of a visit by Vice-President Joe Biden to Tokyo last December, Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese paper, prepared its readers.\n\u201cOur allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria,\u201d Biden said.\nIn describing the role of America\u2019s regional allies in Syria, Biden was largely correct.\nIn his memoir, he wrote, \u201cJoe Biden wasn\u2019t hitting the library on very many Saturday nights.\u201d That fed an intellectual insecurity that lingers and nudges him to grasp a bit too lustily at a statistic, or to plunge headlong into the classics.\nOver the years (and in preparation for a piece on Biden), I have come to diagnose a few distinct sources of Biden\u2019s troubles."}
