They didn\u2019t include profits that hospitals earn from other activities, such as donations, investments, parking fees, rental space and sales from gift shops, which often are used to subsidize patient care.\n\n\u201cAll hospitals should make a little profit,\u201d Bai said, \u201cbut some hospitals are obtaining outrageous profits.\u201d\n\nGundersen said the report does not reflect its costs as an integrated health system in a largely rural, multistate region with a large Medicare population. The data used by the authors excluded some administrative and other costs that would have changed the medical center\u2019s ranking.\n\nThe hospitals with the highest price markups earned the largest profits. Anderson thinks they should lower their prices or plow more back into the communities.\n\nThe authors analyzed Medicare data for about 3,000 acute care hospitals, of which 59 percent were nonprofit, 25 percent were for-profit and 16 percent were public.\n\nAfter adjusting for cost of living and the types of patients served, they found that more than half of all facilities lost money on patient care services.\n\nRural hospitals, small hospitals, and major teaching hospitals tended to lose more money than urban hospitals and larger ones.\n\nOne limitation of the study is its look at a single year of data and the fact that in 2013, the federal government\u2019s payments to hospitals were based mainly on volume.\n\nThat system, known as fee for service, incentivizes hospitals and doctors to do more tests and procedures to earn money. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospital reimbursements are increasingly tied to the quality of care, not quantity.\n\nStanford, a major academic medical center that the authors ranked as the nation\u2019s third most profitable hospital, said it primarily used its 2013 profit for capital projects. In addition, Stanford said its prices reflect the costs of treating patients with more complex needs in more advanced settings. This higher level of care \u201cis simply more expensive to provide than what is available in a community hospital,\u201d Stanford said in a statement.\n\nThe Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, which is also part of an academic health system and medical school, said \u201cexcess revenue derived from clinical care\u201d is used to subsidize initiatives across the organization. According to a spokeswoman, that includes supporting and improving critical programs like its trauma center and neonatal intensive care units, as well as funding biomedical research, education and training at the university\u2019s medical school.\n\n1.
