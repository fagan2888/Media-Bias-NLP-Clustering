Moreover, Obama has not hesitated to reach across the political aisle before, as when he selected Republican Jeffrey Immelt to head the President\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.\n\nEven if the nomination is not a total surprise, it is intriguing in that it focuses the social security debate on the relationship between Obama and one of his leading critics.\n\nSmart and Headstrong\n\nChen has earned a reputation for having a good head on his shoulders, as well as being a bit headstrong. When his acquaintances are asked to describe him, inevitably the first thing they mention is his intelligence. A son of Taiwanese immigrants and fluent in English, Taiwanese Hokkien and Mandarin, Chen holds four degrees from Harvard, including doctorates in law and political science.\n\nThe 33-year-old wrote his dissertation on how judicial elections affect legislation. His dissertation adviser Sidney Verba, who stands in succession to Woodrow Wilson as a former president of the American Political Science Association, remembers Chen as one of his best students in his 35 years of teaching. By all accounts, Chen is a prodigy.\n\nSince earning his first degree in 1999, Chen has continued to stay academically engaged, serving as a research fellow at Berkeley\u2019s Institute of Government Studies from 2010-2011 and currently at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution. Chen has been active at the Heritage Foundation since 2003, and he writes regularly for Bloomberg.\n\nA Rising Star\n\nLike his mentor Verba, Chen takes an engaged approach to political science, not merely an academic one. In 2004, he served the George W. Bush administration as a senior policy and political aide at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. He became Mitt Romney\u2019s domestic policy director in 2007, lending his expertise in health care policy.\n\nWill the close working proximity between declared opponents merely serve to sharpen points of disagreement and bitterness from frustrated efforts at communication, underscoring how bipartisanship in Washington today seems to exist more in theory than in practice?\n\nFollowing the 2008 campaign, he served for eight months as an associate attorney at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a prestigious global law firm. He left this position in June 2009 to advise Steve Poizner\u2019s 2010 California gubernatorial campaign.\n\nIn spring 2011, the Romney campaign tapped Chen to head Romney\u2019s Free and Strong America PAC as its policy director. Chen came to exert such an influence on Romney, observers were soon calling him the brains behind the campaign\u2019s policy positions, crediting him as the unacknowledged author of Romney\u2019s 59-point position paper on the economy.\n\nRomney also relied on Chen\u2019s communication skills and his knack for witty remarks to not only develop the campaign\u2019s message, but deliver it through articles, TV interviews and social media posts. Chen gained a reputation as one of Romney\u2019s top spokesmen, as well as his leading adviser, leading some to portray him as an orchestra leader conducting Romney\u2019s campaign. Some critics claim Chen ultimately hurt Romney\u2019s campaign by extending his reach beyond his domestic policy competency into foreign affairs and shaping the candidate\u2019s response to Benghazi.\n\nFrom Campaign Rivalry to Bipartisan Cooperation?\n\nSince the inauguration of Obama\u2019s second term, Chen has resumed his role as a vocal media critic of the administration\u2019s policies, actively writing for Bloomberg in opposition to Obamacare. Chen argues the antidote to government overspending on health care is employer-sponsored, tax-advantaged health savings accounts, such as those offered by State Farm and other HSA providers. Chen has also positioned himself as a commentator, shaping Republican policy on issues such as immigration reform, on both the California state level and on a national level.\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Chen contended Obama\u2019s retirement policy had set both social security and Medicare on a path to insolvency. He cited the social security and Medicare Trustees\u2019 annual reports to argue seniors will see social security benefits cut of 25 percent in 2033 if things stay on their current track.\n\nSo what effect will bringing one of Obama\u2019s most vocal domestic policy critics onto the Social Security Advisory Board have on the bipartisan committee? Will it create an opportunity for representatives of opposing positions to step away from the heated arena of media debate and discuss their differences in a subdued forum more akin to the academic environment Chen hails from \u2014 better conducive to civil disagreement, dialogue and cooperation? Or will the close working proximity between declared opponents merely serve to sharpen points of disagreement and bitterness from frustrated efforts at communication, underscoring how bipartisanship in Washington today seems to exist more in theory than in practice?\n\nCreative Commons image by DonkeyHotey", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "barack obama, elections, mitt romney, social security, politics", "og": {"site_name": "IVN.us", "description": "Last month, President Obama announced the nomination of Republican Lanhee Chen to the Social Security Advisory Board, a move some found peculiar after Chen called Obama's retirement policies laughable during the 2012 campaign and just three weeks ago attacked Obamacare in a Bloomberg column.", "title": "Washington's Definition of Bipartisanship Works in Theory, Not Practice - IVN.us", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/republicrat-FI.jpg", "height": 413}, "updated_time": "2013-10-17T09:29:51-07:00", "url": "http://ivn.us/2013/10/17/washingtons-definition-bipartisanship-works-theory-practice/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last month, President Obama announced the nomination of Republican Lanhee Chen to the Social Security Advisory Board, a move some found peculiar after Chen called Obama's retirement policies laughable during the 2012 campaign and just three weeks ago attacked Obamacare in a Bloomberg column.", "creator": "@DanTaibleson", "image": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/republicrat-FI.jpg", "title": "Washington's Definition of Bipartisanship Works in Theory, Not Practice - IVN.us", "site": "@IVN", "card": "summary"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-17T01:48:47-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 322111017868621, "pages": 233116802464}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IVN", "section": "Legislation", "tag": "social security", "published_time": "2013-10-17T01:48:47-07:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-17T09:29:51-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf8e\"", "article_summary": "He cited the social security and Medicare Trustees\u2019 annual reports to argue seniors will see social security benefits cut of 25 percent in 2033 if things stay on their current track.\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Chen contended Obama\u2019s retirement policy had set both social security and Medicare on a path to insolvency.\nEven if the nomination is not a total surprise, it is intriguing in that it focuses the social security debate on the relationship between Obama and one of his leading critics.\nSo what effect will bringing one of Obama\u2019s most vocal domestic policy critics onto the Social Security Advisory Board have on the bipartisan committee?\nIn spring 2011, the Romney campaign tapped Chen to head Romney\u2019s Free and Strong America PAC as its policy director."}
