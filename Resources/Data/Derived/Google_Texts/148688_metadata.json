Six Venezuelan youths are confirmed dead and hundreds have been injured and/or arrested.\n\nForget looking in the mainstream media for the nitty-gritty of this communist repression. The Venezuelan regime \u2014under the (literal!) and expert tutelage of their Cuban colonial overlords--is easily censoring the sheeplike mainstream media. The truth is getting out through social media. Please don\u2019t miss these dramatic videos.\n\nBut these are Communist police and National Guardsmen doing the beating, gassing and shooting, you see. Hence the silence. Worse still, these Venezuelan storm-troopers are \u201cpracticed at the art of repression\u201d thanks to hands-on training by the best in the business: Castro\u2019s police.\n\nThere is no place in the media-celebrity narrative on Latin American police repression for this sort of thing. Pinochet? Somoza? Batista?\u2014sure! These Latin American dictators thrived on repressing young hipsters. But they were all \u201cright-wingers.\u201d So it was only natural. A good word regarding any of those regimes by a rocker celebrity would have lead to instant and permanent blacklisting.\n\nOn the other hand, a good word regarding the Castro regime serves almost as password into the uppermost reaches of celebrity-rocker status, especially it\u2019s \u201cthinking\u201d echelons (as such things are measured among rockers.)\n\nThe notion of Castro\u2019s Cuba as stiflingly Stalinist nation never quite caught on among \u2018the enlightened.\u201d Instead the island often inspires hazy visions of a vast commune, rock-fest or Occupy site, studded with free health clinics and with Wavy Gravy handing out love-beads at the entrance. The regime was founded by beatniks, after all. In 1960 Jean Paul Sartre hailed Cuba\u2019s Stalinist rulers as \u201cles Enfants au Pouvoir\u201d (the children in power). A few months earlier Fidel Castro spoke at Harvard the same bill as beat poet Allen Ginsberg. And ever since then, long-haired Che Guevara has reigned worldwide as top icon of youthful rebellion.\n\n\u201cThey saw in him (Fidel Castro,)\u201d writes Camelot court scribe Arthur Schlesinger Jr. \u201cthe hipster who in the era of the Organization Man had joyfully defied the system.\u201d\n\nIn fact the brain-shackled robot Fidel Castro and Che Guevara tried to create with their firing squads, forced labor camps and Stalinist indoctrination makes the Eisenhower era\u2019s \u201cOrganization Man\u201d look like a combination of Jimmy Hendrix and Jack Kerouac.\n\nAs exhibit A. in this grotesque ideological disconnect let\u2019s take the famous rockers and \u201cpolitical thinkers\u201d responsible for the songs \u201cFour Dead in Ohio\u201d and \u201cChicago.\u201d\n\nIn 1979 when Fidel Castro (whose regime murdered more political prisoners than pre-war Hitler's and jailed political prisoners at a higher rate than Stalin's) invited Stephen Stills to perform in Cuba at a Communist propaganda-palooza known as \u201cHavana-Jam,\u201d the famous Woodstocker could hardly contain his elation. The fervent champion of human-rights, civil rights and free-speech (indeed Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young\u2019s last tour was titled \u201cThe Free-Speech Tour\u201d) not only took up the offer to perform at this \u201cHavana-Jam,\u201d but also composed a song in Castro\u2019s honor, titled \u201cCuba al Fin!\u201d (Cuba at Last!)\n\nJazz-master and Cuban exile Paquito\u2018d Rivera, living in Cuba at the time, recalls watching Stephen Stills on stage at Havana\u2019s Karl Marx theatre lovingly crooning his songs to the families of Cuba\u2019s Stalinist nomenklatura as if Havana-Jam were a personal performance for the mass-murderer - in-chief himself. Within blocks of this cheeky \u201cHavana-Jam,\u201d (which also included Human-Rights activist Kris Kristofferson along with Billy Joel) Cuban youths, black and white, languished in dungeons suffering longer prison sentences than Nelson Mandela\u2019s. The Cubans\u2019 crimes were attempting free speech.\n\n\u201cThey (Castro\u2019s Stalinist regime) invited me because they knew I was politically astute,\u201d gloated Stephen Stills regarding the acumen and good taste of his Cuban hosts, who to this day jail and torture youths for the crime of saying \u201cDown with Fidel!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a man with a gun over there, \u2019tellin me I gotta beware,\u201d wrote Stepen Stills in the 1967 hit For What it\u2019s Worth.\u201d Indeed, Stephen Stills: Cuban youths have much to teach regarding that scenario. If only you\u2019d deigned to part briefly from your Stalinist hosts (the gunmen) in Havana and asked around.\n\n\u201cParanoia strikes deep, into your life it will creep. It starts when you're always afraid, you step out of line, the man come and take you away.\u201d The \u201cman who came to take away\u201d Cubans at a higher rate than Russians were taken away by Stalin and Germans were taken away by Hitler was your very host on your Cuban visit, Stephen Stills.\n\n\u201cYoung people speaking their minds\u2014a getting SO much resistance from behind..\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly Stephen Stills, from the people right behind your stage, from the Stalinists who were sponsoring you, who you were brownnosing with you, who were jailing and torturing us, for the crime of listening to YOUR music!\u201d Might reply many Cuban youths of the time.\n\n\u201cYou have to give them (Cuba\u2019s Stalinists) due respect because they have a unique form of socialism that\u2019s very significant in the scheme of world history,\u201d Stephen Stills gloated while explaining his Cuba visit.\n\nOh, it\u2019s unique alright, Mr. Stills. Few 20th Century regimes jailed and tortured youths en-masse for the crime of growing long hair and craving rock music.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That silence you hear issues from the media/celebrity axis regarding the massive protests in Venezuela where hip college kids are being beaten, tear-gassed and shot down in a manner to shame anything done by Mayor Daley\u2019s police in 1968 or the Ohio National Guard in 1970..05/26/2016 19:48:14PM EST.", "author": "Humberto Fontova", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "That silence you hear issues from the media/celebrity axis regarding the massive protests in Venezuela where hip college kids are being beaten, tear-gassed and shot down in a manner to shame anything done by Mayor Daley\u2019s police in 1968 or the Ohio National Guard in 1970.", "title": "Humberto Fontova - Where Have all the Flower (Children) Gone?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/humbertofontova/2014/02/22/where-have-all-the-flower-children-gone-n1798691", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/52/4d11bd0b-3338-429f-ae47-2b9cecae8137.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "That silence you hear issues from the media/celebrity axis regarding the massive protests in Venezuela where hip college kids are being beaten, tear-gassed and shot down in a manner to shame anything done by Mayor Daley\u2019s police in 1968 or the Ohio National Guard in 1970.", "title": "Humberto Fontova - Where Have all the Flower (Children) Gone?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/humbertofontova/2014/02/22/where-have-all-the-flower-children-gone-n1798691", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/52/4d11bd0b-3338-429f-ae47-2b9cecae8137.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Where Have all the Flower (Children) Gone?, Humberto Fontova, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In 1960 Jean Paul Sartre hailed Cuba\u2019s Stalinist rulers as \u201cles Enfants au Pouvoir\u201d (the children in power).\nWithin blocks of this cheeky \u201cHavana-Jam,\u201d (which also included Human-Rights activist Kris Kristofferson along with Billy Joel) Cuban youths, black and white, languished in dungeons suffering longer prison sentences than Nelson Mandela\u2019s.\nFew 20th Century regimes jailed and tortured youths en-masse for the crime of growing long hair and craving rock music.\nOn the other hand, a good word regarding the Castro regime serves almost as password into the uppermost reaches of celebrity-rocker status, especially it\u2019s \u201cthinking\u201d echelons (as such things are measured among rockers.)\nA good word regarding any of those regimes by a rocker celebrity would have lead to instant and permanent blacklisting."}
