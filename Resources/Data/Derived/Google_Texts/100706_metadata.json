The assault was alleged; no charges have been filed. The article has been corrected.\n\nD.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier, left, and Mayor Muriel Bowser speak with the press about the ongoing investigation of Relisha Rudd at the Metropolitan Police Department headquarters on March 2 in Washington. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nThe disappearance of an 8-year-old homeless girl living in a D.C. shelter in March 2014 triggered an avalanche of promises to fix a dysfunctional system for caring for the city\u2019s least fortunate families.\n\nA year later, little has changed. And little is expected to, for now. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), who campaigned on a promise to close the shelter where Relisha Rudd lived with her mother and brothers, is preparing to announce that it will take 18 months, and perhaps longer, to get it done.\n\nWhat happened to Relisha, who has not been found, isn\u2019t the only mystery the city is trying to solve. The other is how to improve what by all accounts is a broken system sheltering a record number of families this winter but doing little to help them find permanent homes.\n\nRelisha\u2019s abduction became a symbol of the decay and dysfunction of the shelter at the former D.C. General Hospital where she lived, and it highlighted what many describe as the city\u2019s inadequate services for the homeless.\n\nAs details emerged, then-Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) vowed to conduct a complete review of how the city had handled the case. He also promised to close D.C. General within a year. He said he would work with new intensity to get families out of the building and into their own homes. In the primary election she won that spring, Bowser pummeled Gray for his handling of the issue.\n\n1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close April 6, 2016 Feb. 27, 2016 March 1, 2015 April, May 2014 March 31, 2014 March 28, 2014 March 28, 2014 Thursday March 28, 2014 Saturday Skip Ad \u00d7 The search for 8-year-old Relisha Rudd View Photos The missing girl was last seen March 1, 2014, in the care of Kahlil Tatum, a janitor at the D.C. homeless shelter where she lived with her mother.

Homeless Children\u2019s Playtime Project Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nMore recently, city officials have said some changes have been made at D.C. General, such as additional case managers, extra police patrols, a new playground and improved building maintenance.\n\nBut homeless advocates say those actions are mainly small-bore and fail to address the underlying issues that leave families vulnerable. No plan is in place to remove the roughly 250 families living at D.C. General. On a recent morning, a woman watched a child pick up a used hypodermic needle from the trash-strewn sidewalk in front of the shelter.\n\nIn addition, some are concerned that the city is creating a new D.C. General as it deals with a surge in homelessness this winter by sheltering several hundred families at hotels on a run-down strip of New York Avenue in Northeast Washington with little support or oversight. Another Relisha, they say, could easily fall through the cracks.\n\n\u201cI frankly don\u2019t think the District is a better place for poor children than it was a year ago,\u201d said Judith Sandalow, executive director of the Children\u2019s Law Center. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are taking seriously getting to the deep root causes of homelessness. We have a shortage of housing. We don\u2019t have a good job-training program. We don\u2019t have wraparound services and we have too few mental health services for families. We may be chipping away at the problem, but that\u2019s not fast enough for these kids.\u201d\n\nCampaign issue\n\nAuthorities think Relisha disappeared after her mother left her in the care of Kahlil Tatum, a janitor at D.C. General who befriended the girl.\n\nThe child was last seen with Tatum on March 1, 2014. In late March, Tatum\u2019s wife was found dead with a gunshot wound to the back of her head in an Oxon Hill hotel room. Tatum was found dead 11 days later in a shed in a Northeast Washington park, with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nCity officials said at a news conference last week that they were not giving up the search.\n\nThe high-profile case shocked the city and shone a light on D.C. General, which, wedged between a jail, a former morgue and a clinic for people with sexually transmitted diseases in Southeast, housed more than 500 children at the time.\n\nBowser and others criticized Gray on the campaign trail for his approach to the city\u2019s homeless problem \u2014 particularly his efforts to keep additional families from entering shelters, which he said were meant to steer people to longer-term housing. Bowser vowed to be more humane.\n\nA week after his defeat, Gray called for D.C. General\u2019s closure. He set a goal of moving out 500 families by July; by mid-October, nearly 400 families had been moved. Also in October, Gray issued a plan, including a transition to smaller, more manageable neighborhood shelters that could house as many as 50 families each.\n\nThe city would lease or convert six buildings citywide at a cost of $52 million \u2014 and close D.C. General by October 2015. Gray\u2019s plan included almost no timeline for how to achieve that goal, and it left wide open the criteria for what might constitute a shelter.\n\nGray officials said they received several inquiries to a five-page solicitation to house the smaller shelters by the time the administration packed up at the end of the year.\n\nThen Bowser took office and the cold weather arrived, and the homeless kept coming.\n\nBound by a campaign promise to be more welcoming to families, Bowser and her aides could barely keep pace with the surge of families seeking shelter \u2014 let alone implement longer-term solutions.\n\nD.C. General is full again, and it will remain that way for another summer, another winter and beyond \u2014 all while many of the same perils there for children remain.\n\nA Washington Post investigation of D.C. General last summer found an unhealthy facility. Residents alleged that shelter employees had propositioned them for sex, attempted tax scams and even fathered a child with one of them. Nearly 30 residents were taken to the hospital or forced to seek treatment for bug bites, rashes and other ailments picked up at the shelter in recent years. Heating and water problems were chronic.\n\nResidents interviewed recently said they have seen improvements, but the shelter remains a challenging place to live. One resident said she went without heat for a week this winter; others complained about mice and roaches. In January, city officials said there was an alleged sexual assault. In February, a contagious skin disease spread from one child to two others.\n\n\u201cPeople are outside smoking and doing drugs.. . . It\u2019s chaos,\u201d said Andrea Pitts, who lives at the shelter with her husband and 5-month-old son. \u201cIt\u2019s not a place where you want to raise your kids. There is staff that cares about their job and staff just collecting a paycheck. You can better yourself, but I think of it like a jail.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the city has dealt with the homeless surge this year by offering more than 500 families \u2014 including almost 1,000 children \u2014 open-ended motel stays that have gobbled city resources and forced the administration to scurry to find two, and then four, new motels to accommodate more families.\n\nSome D.C. Council members say that children are even more vulnerable in motels than at D.C. General. There are no security cameras recording the arrivals and exits of children and no central door to restrict access.\n\nAwaiting specifics\n\nBowser\u2019s administration has offered few details on how she will fulfill her campaign promise to end homelessness. Officials have pledged a complete \u201csystems change\u201d by 2018 so that shelter use is \u201cbrief, rare and not recurring\u201d \u2014 but little more.\n\nDirector of Human Services Laura Zeilinger is leading the effort to draft a specific plan, which calls for closing D.C. General by the fall of 2016. But that can happen, she said, only in concert with new coordination of support services, shelter for single adults and construction of hundreds of millions of dollars in housing.\n\nA draft of the blueprint will be released as early as March 16. Some details of Gray\u2019s plan are expected to survive. Four of the sites identified by Gray\u2019s team last fall, for instance, remain viable, Zeilinger said. But they can accommodate fewer than 100 families, meaning nearly twice as many units must be found elsewhere.\n\nIn addition, Bowser\u2019s team must persuade six or more neighborhoods in a gentrifying city to accept new homeless shelters.\n\nDespite the hurdles, advocates say they are optimistic about the experienced team Bowser has put in place, including Deputy Mayor Brenda Donald and Zeilinger, a former Obama administration official. They say meetings with officials have been positive and they are encouraged that the mayor announced new \u201chousing navigators\u201d to help pair the city\u2019s 4,000 homeless with permanent housing and pledged $100 million annually for affordable housing. The lack of affordable housing is one of the city\u2019s root causes of homelessness.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from their view in September, when Gray released a review of how the city handled Relisha\u2019s case. The report found that \u201cno justifiable government actions\u201d would have prevented the tragedy \u2014 and homeless advocates panned it.\n\nEven with signs of progress, D.C. General residents will have to wait for a better home.\n\nRenae Garrett, 21, said she is hoping to get into an apartment-style shelter with her two children. She said her three months at D.C. General have been long enough.\n\n\u201cThey are trying, but what they are doing is not enough,\u201d Garrett said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Closing the D.C.
