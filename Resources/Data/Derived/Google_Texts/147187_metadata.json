The silence of the fans was interrupted only by applause and chirps of \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cwhat a shot.\u201d\n\nCooprider credited the crowd with giving him home-court advantage and the mental toughness to battle through late-match cramping that nearly derailed him.\n\n\u201cIt was a long day, fighting through a tough three-setter in mixed doubles, then following it up with this,\u201d he said. \u201cMy knees almost gave out, but I changed my game plan to shorten the volleys and got the win.\u201d\n\nCooprider said the title match was a good warm-up for his travels to Portugal and Spain next month to compete in professional tournaments. Despite receiving a top-1,000 ITF ranking in his first month as a pro, he has played only sporadically overseas since graduating from North Carolina-Wilmington in 2013.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough money in that level of pro tennis. You have to be in the top 200 to see any real money,\u201d Cooprider said. \u201cMost of the time you end up losing money even if you win the tournament.\u201d\n\nCooprider didn\u2019t lose money Sunday. He took home a check for $1,300, which brought a smile to his face after a tough day of tennis.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all about the money for Cooprider. He started playing tennis when he was 7, and it wasn\u2019t until he was 16 that he envisioned playing in college or as a pro.\n\nHe now teaches tennis at the Colorado Athletic Club at Inverness. Some of his students played in the Denver City Open and contributed to what he called the toughest competition at the tournament in years.\n\nLauren Strasburger, a former Colorado State star, completed a Denver City Open hat trick by winning her third women\u2019s open singles title with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Kelli Woodman.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chris Cooprider wins first Denver City Open tennis title", "title": "Chris Cooprider wins first Denver City Open tennis title", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/21/chris-cooprider-wins-first-denver-city-open-tennis-title/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-21T21:02:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-21T21:02:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Some of his students played in the Denver City Open and contributed to what he called the toughest competition at the tournament in years.\nLauren Strasburger, a former Colorado State star, completed a Denver City Open hat trick by winning her third women\u2019s open singles title with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Kelli Woodman.\nLong morning matches Sunday at the Denver Tennis Club delayed the Cooprider-Iftikhar title match 90 minutes, but the fans who stayed to see it weren\u2019t disappointed.\nHe took home a check for $1,300, which brought a smile to his face after a tough day of tennis.\nYou have to be in the top 200 to see any real money,\u201d Cooprider said."}
