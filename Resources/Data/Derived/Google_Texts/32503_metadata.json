Critics thus expressed concern that the move could undermine the university\u2019s legal case, especially when other options were available for circumventing compliance requirements for the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe university need not provide student health insurance at all,\u201d said Gerard Bradley, a constitutional scholar at Notre Dame\u2019s law school, who outlined the options available to university administrators.\n\nBradley noted that only group health plans must comply with the mandate. Consequently, the university also had another option: It could have opted to self-insure the plan for students and avoid coverage of services that violate Catholic teaching.\n\n\u201cNotre Dame could self-insure the students \u2014 as they do the faculty and staff \u2014 and if they self-insure, they would be free to exclude the contraceptive coverage,\u201d said Bradley.\n\nThe Notre Dame law professor was equally concerned about the legal implications of the university\u2019s voluntary decision to provide services it had strongly opposed in legal papers filed with a U.S. district court.\n\n\u201cIn its pending lawsuit about the employee and staff health plan, Notre Dame has said that its Catholic faith forbids it to arrange or facilitate coverage for contraception and abortion,\u201d Bradley said.\n\n\u201cYet when it comes to student health coverage, the university has chosen to facilitate and arrange coverage for contraception and abortion. The court hearing Notre Dame\u2019s lawsuit will surely notice this inconsistency.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame: No Comment\n\nThus far, Notre Dame has not publicly commented on the latest controversy linked to its high-profile legal challenge to the mandate.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to add to our previous comments while this matter is in litigation,\u201d Dennis Brown, a Notre Dame spokesman, stated in an email message to the Register.\n\nThe Sycamore Trust, an alumni group that has worked to strengthen the Catholic identity of the nation\u2019s leading Catholic institution of higher education, broke the news about the student health plan.\n\n\u201cNotre Dame is complying with the contraceptive mandate in renewing its student health-insurance program for 2014-15. Aetna, the insurer, will now provide students with free abortifacients and contraceptives,\u201d Sycamore Trust\u2019s newsletter reported. \u201cMoreover, the university will itself enroll all otherwise uninsured graduate and foreign students in the plan.\u201d\n\nWilliam Dempsey, a Notre Dame alumnus and retired lawyer who leads the alumni group, told the Register that he has been concerned about the university\u2019s confusing response to the free-exercise issues posed by the federal law and has waited to see how it would handle a student health plan.\n\nIn 2012, Notre Dame gained national attention when it was among the first religious nonprofits to challenge the mandate. But the original lawsuit was dismissed as premature, and then the university delayed filing papers to seek emergency relief until a month before a January 2014 deadline.\n\nIn its Dec. 3, 2013, complaint filed with the district court, Notre Dame outlined its moral objections to the requirement that it comply with the mandate.\n\n\u201c[T]he mandate would require Notre Dame to commit scandal, which \u2026 is particularly grave when associated with those \u2018who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others,\u2019 Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2285,\u201d read one portion of the complaint.\n\nEmployee Contraceptive Coverage\n\nHowever, both a U.S district court and the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago refused to grant injunctive relief.\n\nOn Jan. 2, the university signaled that it would comply with the federal law. Faculty and staff were informed that a third-party administrator would notify them about access to \u201cfree\u201d contraception and other mandated provisions.\n\n\u201cHaving been denied a stay, Notre Dame is advising employees that, pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, our third-party administrator is required to notify plan participants of coverage provided under its contraceptives payment program,\u201d said Paul Browne, who was then Notre Dame\u2019s vice president for public affairs and communications, in a Jan. 2 statement that was reported by WNDU radio.\n\n\u201cAs part of an ongoing legal action, however, the program may be terminated once the university\u2019s lawsuit on religious-liberty grounds against the HHS mandate has worked its way through the courts.\u201d\n\nBut legal experts and alumni who backed Notre Dame\u2019s lawsuit were disappointed with the outcome and questioned whether the university had done enough to secure a reprieve.\n\nDempsey contended that Notre Dame\u2019s 11th-hour petition prompted the judge to question the university\u2019s sincerity. That skepticism, said Dempsey, will be reinforced in the wake of the latest news regarding the student health plan.\n\n\u201cNotre Dame has declared in court that to do what it is doing now would be scandalous. And it is doing this voluntarily,\u201d Dempsey emphasized, echoing concerns raised in the alumni newsletter.\n\nHoly Cross Father Bill Miscamble, a professor of history at Notre Dame, echoed Dempsey\u2019s concerns about the optics and the substance of the university\u2019s decision to approve the group health plan for students.\n\n\u201cThe university\u2019s decision \u2026 seems designed to clarify that it doesn\u2019t care about Church teaching or the position of the bishops on the mandate,\u201d Father Miscamble told the Register.\n\n\u201cIt completely reverses its previously stated position \u2014 made in a court of law \u2014 that to provide contraceptives and abortifacients to students and employees would violate its own sincerely held religious beliefs. One wonders what exactly has happened to those beliefs.\u201d\n\nFurther, the history professor has not seen any formal statement explaining the decision to approve the group health plan for students, and he questioned the lack of transparency regarding a crucial moral and legal matter that goes to the heart of the Notre Dame\u2019s mission as a Catholic university.\n\nCall for Accountability\n\nCritics of the university\u2019s puzzling health-care decision acknowledge that elite institutions like Notre Dame are under mounting pressure to accommodate secular beliefs and practices. For example, a July 2014 MSNBC news story featured two Notre Dame graduate students who attacked the student health plan for failing to cover birth control, including costs related to the insertion of an intrauterine device.\n\nMSNBC reported that \u201cthe fight over birth control has disillusioned them, and they\u2019ve begun warning prospective students about the lack of contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\nBut Father Miscamble emphasized the need for Notre Dame to maintain its high academic standards while defending its founding principles. And he concluded that university officials responsible for the decision should be held accountable.\n\n\u201cThis unnecessary and disgraceful decision on student health insurance damages Notre Dame\u2019s standing as a Catholic university,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose responsible for it should apologize and then step down from their positions in order for credibility to be regained.\u201d\n\nJoan Frawley Desmond is the Register\u2019s senior editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics say the move undermines the university\u2019s legal challenge to the HHS mandate.
