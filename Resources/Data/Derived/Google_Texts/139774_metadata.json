One was rushed to St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood and the other to the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora.\n\nAir Methods operates medical-transport flights in 48 states. The company issued a statement Saturday:\n\n\u201cSt. Anthony Summit Medical Center and Air Methods would like to acknowledge the many brave individuals who assisted with the tragic crash of Flight For Life Lifeguard 2 on July 3. We extend our thanks to Lake Dillon Fire-Rescue, Summit County Sheriff Department, Denver Health\u2019s Critical Incident Stress Team and St. Anthony Summit Medical Center\u2019s Spiritual Care Team for their immediate response and support.\n\n\u201cThe rescue effort moved swiftly to get necessary medical attention to those injured. We are cooperating with National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration to keep the area secured. We ask that you respect these efforts and containment of the site while the agencies complete the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the news that the Air Methods pilot, Patrick Mahany, was fatally injured. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family. Two of the flight crew were injured in the crash and are currently being treated in Denver area hospitals; one is in fair condition and the other is in critical condition.\n\n\u201cThe families requested that we refrain from releasing the names of the crew members at this time. We continue to pray for these individuals and their loved ones, and ask that the media respect their privacy during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frisco helicopter crash survivor in critical condition, 2nd in fair", "title": "Frisco helicopter crash survivor in critical condition, 2nd in fair", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/04/frisco-helicopter-crash-survivor-in-critical-condition-2nd-in-fair/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150703__20150704_A4_CD03WILDFIREp1.jpg", "height": 368}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150703__20150704_A4_CD03WILDFIREp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T17:38:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T15:16:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The crash occurred shortly after liftoff near St. Anthony Summit Medical Center and killed the pilot, 64-year-old Patrick Mahany of Silverthorne.\nOne was rushed to St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood and the other to the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora.\nWe extend our thanks to Lake Dillon Fire-Rescue, Summit County Sheriff Department, Denver Health\u2019s Critical Incident Stress Team and St. Anthony Summit Medical Center\u2019s Spiritual Care Team for their immediate response and support.\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the news that the Air Methods pilot, Patrick Mahany, was fatally injured.\nOne of the two surviving crew members from a Flight for Life helicopter crash in Frisco Friday is in fair condition and the other is critical condition Saturday, said Centennial-based Air Methods, the company that operates the medical transport aircraft."}
