She tried diets, different exercises, different trainers but nothing worked.\n\nCogan then heard about UltraShape, one of the newest treatments that's advertised as a fat buster.\n\nAccording to Plastic Surgeon Dr. Jason Pozner of Boca Raton, UltraShape uses ultrasound to send a focused sound wave that breaks up the fat.\n\nIt's also painless and it can treat a larger portion of the body at one time. After the treatment, the body absorbs the fat, it goes in to the bloodstream and it's excreted, according to Pozner.\n\nUltraShape has been used in Europe for nearly a decade and it's been in the U.S. for a year.\n\nPatients need three treatments, two weeks apart before results can be noticed. Slight swelling is the only possible side effect.\n\nCost is between $800 and $1,000 for a single treatment.\n\nFor Cogan, she said she noticed a difference after one treatment and was pleased with her flatter tummy after her final treatment.\n\nFor more information about the procedure, contact Sanctuary Medical Center at www.sanctuarymedical.com .", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "New, non invasive treatment advertised as a fat buster uses ultra sound.", "author": "Roxanne Stein", "og": {"site_name": "WPTV", "description": "New, non invasive treatment advertised as a fat buster uses ultra sound.", "title": "UltraShape: New non-invasive fat buster uses ultra sound", "url": "http://www.wptv.com/news/health/ultrashape-new-non-invasive-fat-buster-uses-ultra-sound", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.wptv.com/photo/2014/11/26/wptv-ultrashape_1416998199206_9962616_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 483190653, "iphone": 487668935}}, "site": "@wptv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "New non-invasive fat buster uses ultrasound", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.wptv.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 207362756082470}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Roxanne Stein"}, "keywords": "Health,Homepage Showcase,Tablet Showcase,Mobile Showcase", "google-site-verification": "wC61UByVj5fiZY--ruGCAnX8tqv4rXry8Pfwou1uSO0", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WPTV5", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2014-11-26T10:38:35+0000", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T10:38:35+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/236767809717751"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe45a9\"", "article_summary": "According to Plastic Surgeon Dr. Jason Pozner of Boca Raton, UltraShape uses ultrasound to send a focused sound wave that breaks up the fat.\nCogan then heard about UltraShape, one of the newest treatments that's advertised as a fat buster.\nAfter the treatment, the body absorbs the fat, it goes in to the bloodstream and it's excreted, according to Pozner.\nShe tried diets, different exercises, different trainers but nothing worked.\nFor Cogan, she said she noticed a difference after one treatment and was pleased with her flatter tummy after her final treatment."}
