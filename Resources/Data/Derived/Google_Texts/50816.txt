A German court has ruled that after a breakup, a person can demand that their ex-partner delete all intimate and nude images taken during the course of the relationship.

The court found Tuesday that one person’s right of privacy was more important than another person’s ownership rights to the intimate content.

The case was brought by a woman in central Germany who split with her partner, a photographer, who had made several erotic videos and taken nude photos of her with her consent, Time magazine reported Friday.

PHOTOS: What are the chances?

A higher court in Koblenz ruled that the photos and videos must be deleted to protect her personal rights.

However, the court rejected the woman’s demand that her ex delete all photos of her, saying clothed pictures had “little, if any capacity” to compromise her privacy.
