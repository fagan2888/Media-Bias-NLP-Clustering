How\u2019s it doing with premiums?\n\nObamacare Premiums Will Increase Faster Than Private Plans\n\nHow about deductibles? Co-pays? Medical choices?\n\nConsumers Face Higher Deductibles Under Obamacare Plans\n\nObamacare Shock: $12,600 Deductible, 40 Percent Co-Pay, Zero Competition\n\nWhat Obamacare did succeed in doing was giving governments at all levels unfathomable new powers.\n\nWhich allows governments at all levels to give deals and favors galore to its friends \u2014 and pummel its enemies and the enemies of its friends. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting scandal, anyone? Net neutrality?\n\nThis is crony socialism \u2014 because it has nothing to do with capitalism.\n\nObamacare empowered further still federal and state governments \u2014 when governments since time immemorial have proven to be utterly incompetent. Veterans Administration deaths and delays, anyone?\n\nObamacare website, anyone? And not just the federal site. Behold the roiling nightmare mess that is Oregon\u2019s foray into government medicine \u2014 Cover Oregon.\n\nRemember this?\n\nCrony Socialism brought him down. What, specifically?\n\nKitzhaber Turned Cover Oregon Decision-Making Over to Campaign Consultant \u201cThere is a very bright line between political activity, which is trying to get the governor re-elected, and doing the state\u2019s business in which the governor is supposed to act in the best interest of taxpayers.\u201d\u2026 \u201cThese emails show that a lot of the state\u2019s business was being conducted in secret on private email accounts and far from the scrutiny of the Legislature, or the press, or the public.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, anyone?\n\nWhat exactly happened with Cover Oregon?\n\nCover Oregon Health Exchange Website to Shut Down Oregon\u2019s exchange is seen as the worst of the more than a dozen states that developed their own online health insurance marketplaces\u2026. Oregon\u2026received a total of $305 million in federal grants to fund its operations\u2026.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of our coin. How did Cover Oregon use it?\n\nOutstanding. That explains Kitzhaber\u2019s earnest interest in transparency. Turns out his political consultant wasn\u2019t the optimal choice for the gig.\n\nHow has the ex-governor been behaving since becoming ex-governor?\n\nFormer Gov. John Kitzhaber\u2019s and Cylvia Hayes\u2019 Trip to Dump Brings Police Sweeping In The former governor and Hayes showed up at the Knott Landfill southeast of Bend in a pickup and an SUV about 2 p.m. last Friday and spent a few minutes dumping trash, according to Timm Schimke, the director of the Deschutes County Solid Waste Department.\n\nEven more transparency.\n\nCheck the landfill. Bring a mask and some air freshener.\n\nThe thing is, this isn\u2019t just an Oregon scandal and a Cover Oregon failure. The Obama administration is absolutely also on the hook.\n\nThey kept pouring federal money into Oregon \u2014 way, way after it was obvious Oregon\u2019s Obamacare was a train wreck.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen time and again, program oversight and care for taxpayer coin is decidedly lacking from all things government \u2014 and this administration in particular.\n\nIs anyone in Washington paying any attention?\n\nExcellent. But they should expand their investigation all the way up the Obamacare food chain.\n\nWhen asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton famously responded \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d\n\nThe federal Obamacare superstructure is where the real coin is wasted. Our intrepid investigating Congressmen should adhere to Sutton\u2019s maxim \u2014 and go there.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Seton Motley", "description": "The Obama administration is also on the hook for Oregon's failure.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare is an unmitigated, omni-directional disaster.
