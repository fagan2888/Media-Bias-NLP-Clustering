He\u2019s showing up in states like New Hampshire and South Carolina and forming PACs and doing other things one does when preparing to run for the White House, but he\u2019s still mulling it over and waiting for God to give him the thumbs-up. I hope Kasich does run, mainly so the Republicans can have a knock-down, drag-out fight over Obamacare.\n\nWhat sets Kasich apart from other 2016 aspirants is that he actually supports one of the most important pieces of the Affordable Care Act: the expansion of Medicaid. In fact, Kasich was so gung-ho about expanding Medicaid in Ohio that when the state legislature resisted him, he pushed the expansion through via the state\u2019s Controlling Board, leading Republican critics to gripe that he\u2019d broken the law. Kasich was no fan of the Affordable Care Act, but he argued at the time that it was Ohio\u2019s duty to \u201cget the most out of [the ACA] as possible,\u201d and that meant opening Ohio\u2019s doors to lots of new federal spending that would boost health coverage for low-income residents.\n\nOf course, if you ask Kasich what he\u2019d do about Obamacare as president, he\u2019ll tell you the same thing every other Republican candidate says: he\u2019d repeal every word of it on day one. But Kasich also argues that the expansion of Medicaid made possible by the Affordable Care Act would somehow survive the law\u2019s complete and total repeal. He said as much this past weekend at the Republican 2016 cattle call in New Hampshire this past weekend. \u201cKasich insisted he would leave the Medicaid expansion intact, saying that\u2019s a separate issue,\u201d the Columbus Dispatch reported.\n\nKasich has been arguing for a while that the Medicaid expansion and Obamacare are two separate things. That doesn\u2019t make any sense, and it\u2019s contradicted by what Kasich himself has said in the past, but being a Republican with national ambitions means you have to present yourself as an implacable foe of the ACA, even as your state benefits from the law.\n\nAnd the fact that Ohio is benefitting from Kasich\u2019s embrace of Obamacare \u2013 even if he\u2019s contorting himself to avoid describing it as such \u2013 is why he absolutely should run for the Republican nomination. There have been a lot of positive changes wrought by the expansion in Ohio to which Kasich can and should point on the stump \u2014 and that will wreak havoc among the other Republican candidates.\n\nEmbracing expanded Medicaid instantly made over 500,000 Ohioans eligible for coverage, and as of last June, close to 300,000 had signed up. By opening up that access to healthcare, instances of uncompensated and charity care at Ohio hospitals have plummeted \u2013 hospitals in Franklin County say charity care is \u201con pace to decline by more than half this fiscal year compared with last year,\u201d while the Cleveland Clinic reported a 40-percent drop in charity care. The uninsured rate statewide has plummeted since 2013, in keeping with the trend observed in other pro-expansion states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio's GOP governor hates \"Obamacare\" but embraced its Medicaid expansion, and that could roil the 2016 GOP field", "title": "GOP sociopaths are about to be exposed: How John Kasich\u2019s presidential run would reveal their callousness", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ohio's GOP governor hates \"Obamacare\" but embraced its Medicaid expansion, and that could roil the 2016 GOP field", "title": "GOP sociopaths are about to be exposed: How John Kasich\u2019s presidential run would reveal their callousness", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/20/gop_sociopaths_are_about_to_be_exposed_how_john_kasichs_presidential_run_would_reveal_their_callousness/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/scott_kasich_perry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ohio's GOP governor hates \"Obamacare\" but embraced its Medicaid expansion, and that could roil the 2016 GOP field", "title": "GOP sociopaths are about to be exposed: How John Kasich\u2019s presidential run would reveal their callousness", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/scott_kasich_perry.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Florida, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, Ohio, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2b8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cKasich insisted he would leave the Medicaid expansion intact, saying that\u2019s a separate issue,\u201d the Columbus Dispatch reported.\nKasich has been arguing for a while that the Medicaid expansion and Obamacare are two separate things.\nBut Kasich also argues that the expansion of Medicaid made possible by the Affordable Care Act would somehow survive the law\u2019s complete and total repeal.\nWhat sets Kasich apart from other 2016 aspirants is that he actually supports one of the most important pieces of the Affordable Care Act: the expansion of Medicaid.\nI hope Kasich does run, mainly so the Republicans can have a knock-down, drag-out fight over Obamacare."}
