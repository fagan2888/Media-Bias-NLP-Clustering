Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

With the Jan. 1 inauguration of unabashed liberal Bill de Blasio as mayor of New York, talk has begun of a possible resurgence of the far left.That would be just fine with George Will."Oh, I hope there's the resurgence you talk about," the conservative columnist said on "Fox News Sunday." "There's nothing better for American conservatism than periodic examples of untrammeled liberalism."President Lyndon Johnson had huge majorities in Congress after his 1964 election and essentially "had his way," Will said. He was able to push through Great Society programs that conservatives argued actually did more harm than good.The result, Will noted, was that Republicans won five of the next six and seven of the next nine presidential elections."Let him have his way in New York City, and let people see what happens," Will said of de Blasio, who has promised to raise taxes on the richest to fund programs such as universal preschool.Will said there is little science that preschool helps children, but it does help teacher's unions by hiring more dues-paying members."I give him three years, and people will be begging for a return to something else," Will said.
