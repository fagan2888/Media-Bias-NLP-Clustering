Health Care-Focused PE Firm RoundTable Buys J.H. Whitney-backed Tidi

Audax Group and Cardinal Health also picked up medical-product businesses

RoundTable Healthcare Partners is buying Tidi Products LLC from private equity firm J.H. Whitney Capital Partners.

Tidi designs, develops and manufactures medical devices, including thermometer shields and patient garments, used to prevent infections.

Lake Forest, Illinois-based RoundTable is a health care-focused private equity firm. The group has about $1.9 billion in capital under management, through three equity funds and two debt funds. The firm's other investments include Argon Medical Devices, Avalign Technologies and Excelsior Medical.

J.H. Whitney, headquartered in New Canaan, Connecticut, was formed in 1946, and invested in Tidi in July 2012. Generally, the firm invests in consumer, health care, specialty manufacturing and business services businesses.

Harris Williams & Co. advised Tidi on the deal.

Several other medical device companies have attracted buyers in recent months. In June, Audax Group agreed to buy Katena Products, which makes surgical instruments and single-use medical devices. Before that, in March, Cardinal Health Inc. made a deal for Johnson & Johnson's Cordis business, which makes cardiology and endovascular devices.
