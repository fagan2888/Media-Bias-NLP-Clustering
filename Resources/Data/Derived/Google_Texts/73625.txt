Q.

Thoughts on today’s stories about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech?

A.

The main stories captured the extraordinary theater well. It was an audacious play by Bibi and the Republican leadership, unprecedented in our history, and that came across in the pieces. They captured the politics in Washington well.

But the story I found most illuminating was David Sanger’s piece on the competing views of Obama and Netanyahu — not on the threat of a nuclear Iran, but how realistically to confront it.

The editorial and Tom Friedman’s column also were useful in picking through the fog of Bibi’s words and cutting to the core issues.

Q.

Anything on the Netanyahu speech you would like to have seen in the paper but didn’t?

A.

I would have liked to have seen more than five paragraphs at the end of the main story on the reaction and likely political implications in Israel, where Bibi faces election in two weeks and is fighting for his political life. A later piece, posted from Israel on Wednesday morning, addressed this in greater detail.

Q.

Thoughts on the story about Speaker John Boehner’s retreat on Department of Homeland Security funding?

A.

There is obviously a bigger, ongoing story here about the battle between the Republican ego and id. Boehner was taken to the brink by the most strident members of his caucus before he finally acted, with Bibi’s speech to provide cover.

This ongoing battle between small-government conservatives and no-government conservatives within the G.O.P. is really the most interesting political story in Washington.

Q.

What do you think: Did The Times give the story about Hillary Clinton’s email the kind of display it warranted?

A.

I find this story hard to judge. There is an intimation that Secretary Clinton violated not just norms but rules in using only her private email for public business. But the State Department insists that no such rules or regulations were in place at the time she served, and her emails with departmental personnel would all be retrievable records. If she broke no rules, does this story deserve the play it has gotten?

But Team Clinton also has been slow in explaining why she exclusively used a private email address, which has allowed the story to fester.

Whether this is a function of an operation hobbled by the fact that she is not yet a full-fledged candidate and staffed to respond, or a symptom of something larger, it bears correcting.

Q.

What story in today’s paper disturbed you most?

A.

Two stories in the business section about how investors, small and large, are being fleeced by oft-conflicted money managers who extract significant fees but often underperform basic index funds.

Q.

As someone close to the president, what story was most difficult to read?

A.

The Affordable Care Act stories, knowing how hard he fought to pass it.

Q.

In the Magazine story “Obamacare Goes to the Supreme Court,” now on the home page, Emily Bazelon and Adam Liptak discuss what is at stake. By your lights did they get it right?

A.

This was really useful reading for those interested in understanding the real legal questions and potential outcomes.

Q.

Are there kinds of stories or articles about certain subjects that you skip entirely?

A.

I’m not always as attentive to international stories as I should be. I sometimes skip over New York stories. The arts section is luxury I can’t always afford.

Q.

Do you pay as much attention to the Times editorials now that you no longer work in the White House? (How much did they matter to policy makers?)

A.

Yes. They’re generally interesting and provocative. And now that I am out of the White House, what once was enraging is now just irritating.

Q.

Favorite section? Or one you save for last?

A.

In my local paper, I read sports first, as I long ago shifted my allegiances from my native New York City teams to Chicago. In The Times, however, I save the sports for last. It’s a good, fun section, but I don’t have any rooting interest.

Q.

Anything in today’s paper especially challenging to your status as a believer?

A.

Are you kidding? The Bibi spectacle in Congress; the prospect of the Affordable Care Act in jeopardy in Scotus due to what appears to be a drafting error — they try, but not break, my believer tenets.

On the other hand, it was encouraging that the House finally was forced to embrace responsibility on the D.H.S. budget was encouraging.

Q.

Anything in today’s paper that made you laugh?

A.

This line in Tom Friedman’s column, which was both sobering — and hilarious: “There are actors in the Middle East for whom ‘mutual assured destruction’ is an invitation to a party — not a system of mutual deterrence.”​
