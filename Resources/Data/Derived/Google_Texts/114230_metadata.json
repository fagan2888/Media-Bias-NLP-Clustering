The 31-year agreement is slated to come into effect on October 1.\n\n\u201cThe Canada-China FIPA will help ensure that Canadian companies doing business in China are treated fairly and benefit from a more predictable and transparent business environment,\u201d Fast said. \u201cIt will give Canadian investors in China the same types of protections that foreign investors have long had in Canada.\u201d\n\nThe Canada-China investor protection deal was finalized in 2012.\n\nThe agreement is between Canada and the People\u2019s Republic of China. It protects and promotes Canadian investment abroad through legally binding provisions as well as to promote foreign investment in Canada. The agreement isn't unique. Canada has FIPAs with 14 countries and is actively negotiating them with 12 other nations.\n\nThe suddenness of the development caught the Hupacasath First Nation, a 300-member tribe on the West Coast of Vancouver Island that spearheaded a court action aimed at stopping the ratification, off-guard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked that the government would do this. We weren\u2019t expecting this at all,\u201d tribal spokesperson Brenda Sayers said. \u201cStephen Harper took it upon himself to make this decision instead of leaving it for the court to decide. This decision is an injustice and shows no respect for the judicial process.\u201d\n\nThe tribe initiated and lost a federal court challenge against the agreement last year. Its appeal was heard in June and a decision is expected at the end of September or in early October.\n\nRELATED: Hupacasath First Nation Appeals for Funds to Fight 'Undemocratic' Canada-China Treaty\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been respecting due process but Stephen Harper hasn\u2019t. We\u2019ve been dealing in good faith and didn\u2019t get it in return,\u201d Sayers said. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t wait for the court decision because it is expected so soon.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sayers, the agreement contains provisions that interfere with governments' policies around the environment and resource extraction therefore it requires Ottawa to consult First Nations.\n\nSayers said the tribe would be affected if it didn't want resources extracted from a sacred site, or if nearby extraction would have an impact on the site. If China were to have, say, an interest in a logging company that wanted to log an area the tribe considered sacred, the tribe would oppose it. But under the agreement, China could then sue Canada for loss of revenue, Sayers said.\n\nEven so, aboriginal people should be more concerned about the broader context of the agreement, Sayers said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing First Nations protesting resource extraction,\u201d she told ICTMN. \u201cBut this agreement makes it more challenging for their interests to be considered. And Canada has already said it will fulfill its obligations under this agreement.\u201d\n\nTribal officials are waiting for the federal court decision of its appeal. A Supreme Court of Canada appeal is possible.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll hear it,\u201d Sayers said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials from a Vancouver Island First Nation say that they are shocked and disappointed that Canada ratified its foreign investment deal with China even though a Canadian cour", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/15/canada-approves-china-investment-treaty-while-first-nations-consent-issue-still-court", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/brenda_sayers-wawmeesh_hamilton.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Canada Approves China Investment Treaty While First Nations Consent Issue Still in Court"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/15/canada-approves-china-investment-treaty-while-first-nations-consent-issue-still-court", "dc": {"title": "Canada Approves China Investment Treaty While First Nations Consent Issue Still in Court"}, "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-15T09:30-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Canada Approves China Investment Treaty While First Nations Consent Issue Still in Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd3e\"", "article_summary": "It protects and promotes Canadian investment abroad through legally binding provisions as well as to promote foreign investment in Canada.\nAnd Canada has already said it will fulfill its obligations under this agreement.\u201dTribal officials are waiting for the federal court decision of its appeal.\nEven so, aboriginal people should be more concerned about the broader context of the agreement, Sayers said.\nBut under the agreement, China could then sue Canada for loss of revenue, Sayers said.\nThe agreement is between Canada and the People\u2019s Republic of China."}
