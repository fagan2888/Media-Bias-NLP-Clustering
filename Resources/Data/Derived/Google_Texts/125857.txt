Annual health-care spending on people with diabetes is more than three times higher on average than for those without the diseaseâ€”and costs for children with diabetes are rising particularly sharply as they are more apt to use pricier versions of insulin, a new study found.

The study also revealed that those with diabetes, on average, pay more than double the out-of-pocket health costs than others who don't have chronically high blood sugar levels.

"We're seeing increased spending on these people, we're seeing increased people, and I think that's going to have an effect on employers, on insurers, and on the health-care spending" of the United States, said Amanda Frost, co-author of the report released by the Health Care Cost Institute on Thursday.

HCCI's report comes two years after the American Diabetes Association found that the total cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. had risen 41 percent over the five-year period from 2007 to 2012, up to $245 billion annually.
