She now believes that burglar entered her home and stole her purse.\n\nWhat started as a quiet night in chatting with one of her best-friends on the phone took a frightening turn when Sara Lu heard a knock at her front door.\n\n\"It was kind of weird to me since it wasn't normal knocking, it seemed like they were trying to get my attention, but I didn't answer it because usually a family member would call me first before they would come to my door,\" says Lu.\n\nShe looked out the window and saw a shadow that disappeared around the corner. She ran back to her room to dial 9-1-1.\n\n\"I started hearing noise in the backyard and there was walking footsteps but I didn't hear any voices,\" says Lu. \"Then the moment I started to calm down the brick smashed through my window.\"\n\nLu says the brick shattered glass all across her room and struck her foot.\n\n\"I just screamed and ran.\"\n\nShe hurried into her parents bedroom to hide.\n\n\"Before that I was kind of freaked so I didn't really pay attention to what was missing.\"\n\nSaturday night Lu went into her room to find her purse was gone.\n\n\"I guess he got in,\" says Lu. \"I remember hearing noises of him trying to get in so I'm not surprised.\"\n\nLu's father says this scare has motivated him to boost security around the house. He's added several surveillance cameras in case the burglars come back.\n\nLu estimates the stolen purse and cash inside it to be a loss of around $500. Police are still looking for the suspect.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A teen was hit by a brick when a burglar attempted to break into the home.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "A teen was hit by a brick when a burglar attempted to break into the home.", "title": "UPDATE: Teen hurt in attempted burglary", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/An-attempted-burglary-leaves-a-teen-hurt--286928621.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/045/B45/045B4587B1DE4713AAC76EE7F2B7DA3E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3E7/A75/3E7A75650FA8406DA52CE347E6BE5394.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A teen was hit by a brick when a burglar attempted to break into the home.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/An-attempted-burglary-leaves-a-teen-hurt--286928621.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/attempted+burglary.jpg", "title": "UPDATE: Teen hurt in attempted burglary", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Teen hurt in attempted burglary", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Teen hurt in attempted"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17a7\"", "article_summary": "An attempted burglary in southeast Wichita ended with a teen hit by a brick.\nSaturday night Lu went into her room to find her purse was gone.\nA 15-year-old girl was home alone Friday night when a brick came flying through her bedroom window striking her in the foot.\n\"I started hearing noise in the backyard and there was walking footsteps but I didn't hear any voices,\" says Lu.\nLu estimates the stolen purse and cash inside it to be a loss of around $500."}
