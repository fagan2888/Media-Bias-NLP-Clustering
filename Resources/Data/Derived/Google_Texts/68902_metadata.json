It is not ageing itself that she\u2019s worried about; what she fears is losing her parents\u2019 health insurance.\n\nWhite, 24, is one of several million young people in the US who were able to be put on their parents\u2019 insurance scheme after Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) was introduced, extending the age at which people \u201caged out\u201d of a parental scheme from 18 to 25.\n\nFor White, such coverage was crucial. Months before her wedding in 2011, and at the age of just 19, she realised she was very sick. Her hands had been swelling and turning purple, her joints hurt and she was losing her hair.\n\n\n\nShe was soon diagnosed with the debilitating and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease systemic scleroderma. She had to undergo an invasive procedure to open up her blood vessels and had a finger amputated. There were countless appointments with doctors and specialists to help figure out how to treat the complex disease as it developed. At the time of diagnosis, she was not covered by her parents\u2019 scheme and so received all this treatment without health insurance.\n\n\u201cBy the time we were married, two months later, we were over $100,000 in medical debt because we did not have insurance,\u201d said White.\n\nThe hospital ended up putting White on charity care, which reduced her debt to $12,000 \u2013 more than a year\u2019s rent in the couple\u2019s first apartment, which they never moved into because they had to pay off medical bills.\n\nAs millennials occupy the insecure space between study and university, or are starting out in employment, they are unlikely to have health insurance, so many fall through the gaps and get saddled with enormous debt at a young age.\n\nThe ACA provision was an attempt to address that. It allowed White to get health insurance four or five months after her diagnosis, once her parents had found new jobs that would give them, and therefore her, quality coverage.\n\nThe ACA provision has had remarkable effects on young people in the US since it was introduced in September 2010, with 3 million young adults gaining insurance coverage in the 14 months after it was enacted.\n\n\u201cPreviously, unless they had student healthcare coverage or it was provided through their job, they were often uninsured,\u201d said Peter McGough, a University of Wisconsin professor of family medicine.\n\nUnlike other high-income countries, including Canada, the UK and Japan, the US does not have a publicly financed universal healthcare system, despite the fact that taxpayer money funds roughly 64% of healthcare spending in the US.\n\nYoung people are generally healthier and are therefore less inclined to use their often small incomes to pay for health insurance. \u201cI was young, I was like \u2018I don\u2019t need health insurance\u2019. I never got sick growing up and bam, incurable fatal illness,\u201d White said.\n\nThough she is now insured, she spends at least $600 per month on medical treatment not covered by her plan. And she is deeply worried about what will happen on her 26th birthday.\n\n\u201cWhile I still have insurance through my parents, I tell my doctors all the time: \u2018I have a year and a half \u2013 you guys need to do anything and everything while we have this because once I have the other coverage there\u2019s no guarantee I can see you guys any more,\u2019\u201d White said.\n\nShe plans to use a state insurance plan when she turns 26, which means she will probably no longer have access to the clinicians who have been directing her care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had friends that have had [that] happen,\u201d White said. \u201cThey were told they can no longer see their doctor and they are going so downhill. That\u2019s terrifying. I don\u2019t want that to happen to me.\u201d\n\nMcGough said that when the ACA coverage provision was enacted, a quarter of the young patients he saw for the first time were there for untreated mental health issues. Such problems peak in young adulthood, right when young people had previously been cut off from their parents\u2019 plans.\n\nEvery aspect of the US mental healthcare system is overwhelmed by demand; reimbursements for mental health services tend to be low, which has driven many clinicians to stop accepting insurance altogether. And young people may be reluctant to seek care while covered by their parents\u2019 insurance because of the stigma surrounding mental health disorders.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yetti Ajayi-Obe was unhappy with the list of therapists provided by her insurer.

She had coverage through her family\u2019s health insurance plan, though her parents were not convinced that therapy was the answer. They finally agreed to let her see a therapist because she was cutting herself and their preferred therapies of herbal medicine or speaking to a pastor were no longer an option.\n\n\u201cI come from a very strict African background so mental health and anxiety and depression aren\u2019t things they want to take seriously or want to hear that their child has; they believe it\u2019s more of a western thing,\u201d she said.\n\nAjayi-Obe stopped seeing a therapist in college, but wanted to start again after being overwhelmed by fear when she moved to New York City for work in 2012. She was intensely afraid of being alone and of travelling by herself.\n\nUnhappy with the list of therapists offered by her insurer, she settled on one who did not accept her healthcare plan, and so had to pay out of her own pocket.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matthew Conover currently has no insurance.

That same day, his 21-year-old brother went to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cIt just made me realise, if I get into a car accident later this afternoon and I have to go to the ER, I don\u2019t know how the hell I would pay for it,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a little bit scary and motivates me to get on to insurance.\u201d\n\nConover, who was covered by his parents\u2019 insurance when he went to hospital as a child because of concussion and asthma flare-ups,can afford health insurance through his job and plans to get a state-sponsored plan in Virginia, but in the interim he is worried about the unexpected.\n\nHe is also frustrated by a system where people need to pay for their own care: \u201cI have a lot of friends who can\u2019t afford it or just don\u2019t have the financial stability to commit to a plan and that\u2019s very upsetting.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Janne Iivonen\n\nRead on: The trials of Generation Y - the full series", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The Affordable Care Act extended coverage to millions of young adults, but many are reaching the cutoff point and risk falling through the gaps", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Amanda Holpuch", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The Affordable Care Act extended coverage to millions of young adults, but many are reaching the cutoff point and risk falling through the gaps", "title": "The perils of turning 26: when US millennials lose their parents' healthcare", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ad4dcf5dc9a71453e22fd6a1bb86a8f76a9b3f/0_606_2667_1601/master/2667.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=6b039064554b6ee17ba44cec1e0d6c29", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "site": "@guardian", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a5ad4dcf5dc9a71453e22fd6a1bb86a8f76a9b3f/0_606_2667_1601/master/2667.jpg", "creator": "@holpuch"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US news,Health,Healthcare industry,Business,Society,Insurance industry,Barack Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2016-03-11T13:21:43.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch", "section": "World news", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T12:24:22.000Z", "tag": "US news,Health,Healthcare industry,Business,Society,Insurance industry,Barack Obama"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ad4dcf5dc9a71453e22fd6a1bb86a8f76a9b3f/0_606_2667_1601/2667.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=2575aa50b1265b1e831f3bce350082c2", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US news,Health,Healthcare industry,Business,Society,Insurance industry,Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "It is not ageing itself that she\u2019s worried about; what she fears is losing her parents\u2019 health insurance.\nShe had coverage through her family\u2019s health insurance plan, though her parents were not convinced that therapy was the answer.\nPhotograph: Courtesy of Matthew ConoverWhen Matthew Conover celebrated his 26th birthday in mid-January, he lost his health insurance.\nAt the time of diagnosis, she was not covered by her parents\u2019 scheme and so received all this treatment without health insurance.\nAnd young people may be reluctant to seek care while covered by their parents\u2019 insurance because of the stigma surrounding mental health disorders."}
