A 49-year-old e-bike rider, who almost fell off his bike in front of police, is facing drunk driving charges after being stopped during a Hamilton police RIDE check.

Officers were stationed near the Kenilworth Access around 10 p.m. Friday, when they saw a man approaching on a modified e-bike, police said. The bike had the pedals removed, which makes it considered a motor vehicle under the Highway Traffic Act.

Police said they smelled alcohol and the driver nearly fell as he got off the e-bike, which tipped over.

He was transported to a police station where he failed breath tests. He was later released on a promise to appear in court at a later date.

The 49-year-old Hamilton man is facing charges of impaired driving and having over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.

This incident was one of five where people charged with impaired driving by Hamilton police over the weekend.
