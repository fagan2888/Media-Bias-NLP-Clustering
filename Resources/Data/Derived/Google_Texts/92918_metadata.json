They then have to make their way to the hospital's main building to get their x-rays. The expansion combines all of those into one building.\n\nThe expansion comes a year after the Kentucky State Auditor released a report showing reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments imposed by the Affordable Care Act were forcing rural county hospitals to make cuts.\n\n\"Anytime there's a major change, there's always concern, because you don't know what's going to come down the pipe,\" Fuqua said.\n\nFuqua says the changes have actually been good for the hospital, because more people have insurance coverage to pay for their care.\n\n\"It's better for people to have some coverage than none at all,\" Fuqua said.\n\nNow the goal is attracting the doctors who will take care of those patients.\n\nThe project could be open to bids as soon as next month. Construction is expected to take about six months.\n\nThe audit last year looked at the financial strength of rural hospitals in Kentucky. Lourdes and Caldwell Medical Center were given a \"good\" financial ranking. Murray-Calloway County, Marshall County, Baptist Health Paducah and Crittenden County were ranked as \"fair.\" The lowest rated local hospital was Livingston County, which got a \"poor\" financial rating. A spokesperson for the Livingston County Hospital said on Monday that the hospital is in a good financial situation right now.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Marshall County Hospital is constructing\u00a0a third building on its main campus to make\u00a0to make it easier for you to keep you family healthy.", "author": "Ashley Sanchez, Chad Darnall", "og": {"url": "http://www.wpsdlocal6.com/story/31928913/marshall-county-hospital-is-expanding-to-improve-patient-convenience", "image": "http://WPSD.images.worldnow.com/images/10515301_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Marshall County Hospital is constructing\u00a0a third building on its main campus to make\u00a0to make it easier for you to keep you family healthy.", "title": "Marshall County Hospital is expanding to improve patient convenience"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WPSD.images.worldnow.com/images/10515301_G.jpg", "description": "Marshall County Hospital is constructing\u00a0a third building on its main campus to make\u00a0to make it easier for you to keep you family healthy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Marshall County Hospital is expanding to improve patient convenience"}, "wnreadableurl": "marshall-county-hospital-is-expanding-to-improve-patient-convenience", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/05/09", "fb": {"app_id": 1392726427669223}, "owner": "WPSD", "google-site-verification": "KON_FXEhVU7XJQvrYMFQ7pPy1CjQdGe1__KBP51V-4", "KEYWORDS": "hospital, rural, healthcare, expansion, expand, family, healthy, health, building, construction, project, parking, patients, convenience, flow, doctors, orthopedic, physician, clinic, space, x-ray", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS23", "news_keywords": "hospital, rural, healthcare, expansion, expand, family, healthy, health, building, construction, project, parking, patients, convenience, flow, doctors, orthopedic, physician, clinic, space, x-ray"}, "article_summary": "Marshall County Hospital is trying to make it easier to keep you family healthy by expanding.\nA spokesperson for the Livingston County Hospital said on Monday that the hospital is in a good financial situation right now.\nMurray-Calloway County, Marshall County, Baptist Health Paducah and Crittenden County were ranked as \"fair.\"\nMarshall County Hospital CEO David Fuqua says the addition of a new building will make room for more doctors and improve patient flow in the orthopedic unit, which will be moved to the new building.\nLourdes and Caldwell Medical Center were given a \"good\" financial ranking."}
