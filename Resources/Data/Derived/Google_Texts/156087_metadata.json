And it trails only Texas, Arizona, and California as fourth overall, based on a review of government deportation records.\n\nIn fiscal year 2013, there were 7,120 illegal immigrants deported in Georgia alone, according to WSB-TV reporter Aaron Diamant\u2019s investigation. Of the 1,173 who had felony convictions, nearly half\u2014513\u2014had been removed at least once before.\n\n\u201cThis is a disturbing trend that has to stop,\u201d Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said in a statement to The Daily Signal. \u201cThe reality is violent illegal immigrants are repeatedly entering our country and posing a dangerous risk to our families and communities. Too many victims have unjustly suffered the consequences of President Obama\u2019s lawless executive amnesty and lack of action to address this illegal immigration crisis.\u201d\n\nPerdue cosponsored Kate\u2019s Law, which would increase penalties on illegal immigrants who unlawfully re-enter the United States after being removed. Senate Democrats blocked the measure last month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Georgia ranks first in deportations of illegal immigrants among all non-border states.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Georgia ranks first in deportations of illegal immigrants among all non-border states.", "title": "How Georgia Became a Haven for Violent Illegal Immigrants", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151102_GeorgiaImmigration.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-03T06:30:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Hnm5vP"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Georgia ranks first in deportations of illegal immigrants among all non-border states.", "title": "How Georgia Became a Haven for Violent Illegal Immigrants", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151102_GeorgiaImmigration.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-11-02T22:41:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T06:30:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "georgia, illegal immigration, david perdue, doug collins, wsb-tv"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe reality is violent illegal immigrants are repeatedly entering our country and posing a dangerous risk to our families and communities.\nAccording to an investigation by Atlanta\u2019s WSB-TV, Georgia ranks first in deportations of illegal immigrants among all non-border states.\nIn fiscal year 2013, there were 7,120 illegal immigrants deported in Georgia alone, according to WSB-TV reporter Aaron Diamant\u2019s investigation.\nToo many victims have unjustly suffered the consequences of President Obama\u2019s lawless executive amnesty and lack of action to address this illegal immigration crisis.\u201dPerdue cosponsored Kate\u2019s Law, which would increase penalties on illegal immigrants who unlawfully re-enter the United States after being removed.\nAnd it trails only Texas, Arizona, and California as fourth overall, based on a review of government deportation records."}
