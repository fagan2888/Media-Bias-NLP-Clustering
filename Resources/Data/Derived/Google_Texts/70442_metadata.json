He averaged 18.8 points and 10.1 boards after the All-Star break, up from 10.4 and 7.6 before.\n\nOver the summer, after Team USA lost a number of star players including Paul George and Kevin Durant, Faried helped to fill the void down low and lead the Americans to a gold medal, averaging a team-high 7.7 rebounds with 12.1 points per game along the way.\n\nThe Nuggets rewarded him for his improved play over the past year with a contract extension that could be worth nearly $52 million with incentives.\n\nArron Afflalo, who was re-acquired in a draft-day trade for Evan Fournier, received votes as one of the most underrated players, while the trade was voted as the third-most surprising move of the offseason (7.1 percent), behind LeBron James\u2019 return to Cleveland and Chandler Parsons\u2019 signing with the Mavericks.\n\nThe Nuggets earned the second-most votes (28.6 percent) as the team with the best home-court advantage, behind on the Thunder (42.9 percent); Ty Lawson received votes as one of the fastest players with the ball; Gary Harris earned 7.1 percent of votes for the biggest draft steal, tied with Colorado product Spencer Dinwiddie, who landed in Detroit; and Danilo Gallinari and Timofey Mozgov received votes among international players most likely to have a breakout season (Fournier earned 7.4 percent of votes, the third-most).\n\nAnd lastly, Melvin Hunt received votes as one of the league\u2019s best assistant coaches.\n\nNot surprisingly, James and the Spurs were voted tops in numerous categories. NBA GMs expect the two to meet in the Finals, while James was voted most likely to win MVP and the player most GMs (50 percent of them) would want to build a franchise around.\n\nComplete NBA.com 2014-15 GM survey", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Arron Afflalo,Danilo Gallinari,Evan Fournier,FIBA World Cup,Gary Harris,Kenneth Faried,LeBron James,Melvin Hunt,Nuggets,Spencer Dinwiddie,Team USA,Ty Lawson", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Denver Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried was voted near or at the top in multiple categories in the 2014-15 NBA GM survey.", "title": "Nuggets' Kenneth Faried earns high marks from NBA GMs", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/10/22/kenneth-faried-earns-high-marks-nba-gms/11821/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/10/457470638-495x380.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Denver Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried was voted near or at the top in multiple categories in the 2014-15 NBA GM survey.", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/10/22/kenneth-faried-earns-high-marks-nba-gms/11821/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/10/457470638-495x380.jpg", "title": "Kenneth Faried earns high marks from NBA GMs", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried was voted near or at the top in multiple categories in the 2014-15 NBA GM survey."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12d3\"", "article_summary": "And lastly, Melvin Hunt received votes as one of the league\u2019s best assistant coaches.\nIf his four-year, $50 million contract extension didn\u2019t make it clear, the NBA\u2019s annual GM survey should: Executives across the clear have high hopes for Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried this season.\nFaried also garnered the fifth-most votes (7.4 percent) among players expected to have a breakout season in 2014-15.\nThe Nuggets rewarded him for his improved play over the past year with a contract extension that could be worth nearly $52 million with incentives.\nNBA GMs expect the two to meet in the Finals, while James was voted most likely to win MVP and the player most GMs (50 percent of them) would want to build a franchise around."}
