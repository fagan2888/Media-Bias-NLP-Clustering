About 800 families are currently on the waiting list. Public housing recipients in Gainesville will not pay more than 30 percent of their adjusted income toward rent and utilities. To qualify for public housing with the Gainesville Housing Authority, individuals and families must: \u2022 Have an income below 80 percent of the area median household income level, which was $37,212 in Gainesville between 2009 and 2013, according to census estimates. Income is adjusted based on various deductions, such as how many children are in a family or major medical expenses. \u2022 Pass a criminal background check. \u2022 Have no outstanding debts with any other public housing authorities.

Public housing can seem like both a blessing and a curse to those who call the projects home. Gainesville resident Lisa Chester knows this truth all too well. Some of her formative years were spent in Harrison Square, a 75-unit government-subsidized complex. \u201cGrowing up, we didn\u2019t really know we were poor,\u201d Chester, 35, said. \u201cBut once I got older, I started realizing that other people didn\u2019t live that way. It\u2019s a totally different world when you\u2019re on that side.\u201d Though public housing provided her family a place to live in hard times \u2014 transitional housing between the ups and downs of work and family life \u2014 it also opened Chester to \u201clots of bad influences.\u201d Chester gave birth to twins at just 15 years old. The drug and crime problems that often permeate public housing projects like the Green Hunter Homes on Atlanta Street or the Melrose community homes on Davis Street, continue cycling today. \u201cIt\u2019s about the same as it is now,\u201d Chester said of her youth in the 1980s and 1990s compared with 2016. A particularly common refrain heard in the projects is that kids grow up so fast there. \u201cThey pretty much raising themselves,\u201d Chester said. Antonio Champion, who now resides in Macon but visits family and friends in Gainesville frequently, said he still sees some of the faces struggling in the city\u2019s low-income housing that he remembers from decades ago. \u201cThe communities in Gainesville have lost the meaning of community,\u201d Daphne Bailey told The Times last summer as she organized community cookouts and other events along Atlanta Street. But the troubles that plague the projects have the seemingly paradoxical effect of solidifying bonds between residents. Despite their concerns and objections, Chester, Champion and Bailey keep coming back to give to the hardest neighborhoods in Gainesville. Chester said there are more resources than ever to engage troubled youth and downtrodden adults in these communities. For example, she coordinates a dance team of young girls who live along Atlanta Street. The team performs at halftime of basketball games at the local Boys & Girls Clubs. But Chester requires the girls to earn good grades or show improvement in school before they can compete with the team. She meets with the girls each week and also conducts a pregnancy prevention course, informs them about educational and work opportunities and teaches character qualities and leadership skills. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be a product of their environment,\u201d Chester said. For all the challenges of managing and operating government-run housing, existing programs remain a part of the solution to the area\u2019s affordable housing crunch. After all, just 35 percent of homes in Gainesville are owner-occupied. And these are still places where residents gather and socialize, where day laborers can meet and find work. That\u2019s why renovations have been made or are ongoing at several public housing sites throughout the city, including the Wills Street units, where residents were temporarily relocated while exterior and interior work was done. And the housing authority was rated a \u201chigh performer\u201d by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the 2015 fiscal year. The assessment reviews critical areas of operation, including physical conditions, management, financial responsibility, occupancy rate and adherence to federal guidelines. But the way that public housing currently exists is in for a shakeup. There are plans to redevelop the Atlanta Street complex as HUD looks to get out of the business of public housing. \u201cThe current public housing model is antiquated, and with the limited funding available, not viable for long-term sustainability,\u201d said Beth Brown, executive director of the Gainesville Housing Authority. There have been many attempts over the years to \u201cclean up\u201d the neighborhood, built in the 1950s, and put a stop to the recurrent issues. The latest plan calls for demolishing the public housing buildings and constructing both affordable and market-rate units in their place for a diverse group of residents \u2014 seniors, students and working-class families. Brown said this partnership will bring $10 million in cash to the project through a tax credit program. And a private developer, Walton Communities, will partner with the housing authority, though the authority will remain the majority owner. \u201cWithout that kind of funding, you can\u2019t build affordable housing, especially deeply subsidized housing,\u201d she added. The project would result in 252 new apartments, which would increase residential capacity, over three phases, which could begin as early as 2017. Meetings are underway to begin relocating tenants so the new development can move forward. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best thing they can do,\u201d Chester said. \u201cI feel like this is giving people an opportunity to learn that there is more to life than living poor.\u201d But change is hard. Wendy Glasbrenner, managing attorney for the Gainesville regional office of the Georgia Legal Services Program, said public housing affords residents strong protections, much more so than subsidized housing owned and managed by private landlords participating in a federal program. \u201cWe will continue to work with tenants in Atlanta Street to be sure they are able to find affordable housing and receive appropriate services to utilize their Section 8 vouchers,\u201d Glasbrenner said. GLSP will also have a new staff attorney in place within the next month, \u201cwhich will dedicate a lot of time and energy to this project, as well as similar situations across our 27-county area,\u201d she added. Rose Johnson, executive director of the Newtown Florist Club civil rights organization in Gainesville, said there needs to be a concentrated effort to track residents after they are relocated to ensure they retain access to support services and public resources. Johnson added that she hopes no one will be left behind. Residents of Atlanta Street and other public housing complexes are predominantly low-income African-Americans and Latinos. According to the U.S. Census, 32 percent of Gainesville\u2019s population lived below the poverty line between 2009 and 2013, compared with just 18 percent of the state\u2019s population. The current poverty threshold is $24,250 in annual income for a family of four. Chester said she recalls getting insulted and looked down on when growing up for being poor, and she always wanted a better life for her own children. She\u2019s hopeful a new focus on housing issues will provide a lifeline to the next generation trying to break free of poverty.\n\n\u201cThat was my motivation,\u201d Chester said, adding that a life of drugs, crime and gang activity was \u201cdefinitely not for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/114787/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2016/01/27/0127public3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Public housing can seem like both a blessing and a curse to those who call the projects home.", "title": "Public housing provides affordable homes, but hard environment"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Public housing provides affordable homes, but hard environment"}, "article_summary": "Video: Tour of Gainesville Housing Authority apartments Take a look inside of one of Gainesville Housing Authority's apartments as part of our week-long series looking at housing in our area.\nGet more information about public housing, including a map of units, at the Gainesville Housing Authority website.\n\u201cThe current public housing model is antiquated, and with the limited funding available, not viable for long-term sustainability,\u201d said Beth Brown, executive director of the Gainesville Housing Authority.\nPublic housing can seem like both a blessing and a curse to those who call the projects home.\nAnd a private developer, Walton Communities, will partner with the housing authority, though the authority will remain the majority owner."}
