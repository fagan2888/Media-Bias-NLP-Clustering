The system was to be the\n\nstate\u2019s first try at automated avalanche control\n\n.\n\nBut no bids met the department\u2019s $2 million budget.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to re-advertise the project before year\u2019s end so we can have someone under contract by spring \u2014 and installed next summer,\u201d said Peter Kozinski, CDOT\u2019s engineer in charge of the project.\n\nCDOT typically drops explosives from a helicopter or fires 105mm Howitzer shells to ease avalanche danger in the notorious Stanley slide path, which crosses U.S. 40 twice on Berthoud Pass.\n\nThe Gazex system would allow highway managers to regularly remotely trigger propane-fueled blasts of compressed air into avalanche paths, reducing the threat of catastrophic, road-burying slides. CDOT wants five Gazex exploders in the Stanley slide path.\n\nThe Gazex project on Berthoud Pass is planned as a pilot that could lead to more system installations across the state. Highway departments in Wyoming, Utah and California use Gazex exploders above mountain highways and the systems are popular in Canada and Europe. There are about 2,000 of the French-made Gazex systems in use around the world.\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CDOT bids miss mark for Berthoud Pass remote avalanche control system", "title": "CDOT bids miss mark for Berthoud Pass remote avalanche control system", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/23/cdot-bids-miss-mark-for-berthoud-pass-remote-avalanche-control-system/", "image": {"width": 495, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140923__gazex-explorerp1.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140923__gazex-explorerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-23T13:18:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:57:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00f4\"", "article_summary": "The Gazex project on Berthoud Pass is planned as a pilot that could lead to more system installations across the state.\nThere won\u2019t be any remote-controlled avalanche mitigation on Berthoud Pass this winter.\nThere are about 2,000 of the French-made Gazex systems in use around the world.\nCDOT typically drops explosives from a helicopter or fires 105mm Howitzer shells to ease avalanche danger in the notorious Stanley slide path, which crosses U.S. 40 twice on Berthoud Pass.\nThe Gazex system would allow highway managers to regularly remotely trigger propane-fueled blasts of compressed air into avalanche paths, reducing the threat of catastrophic, road-burying slides."}
