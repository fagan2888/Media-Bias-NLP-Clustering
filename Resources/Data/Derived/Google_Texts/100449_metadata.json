After all, the company had already been making waves as a provider of IT services across many industries, with an already-significant presence in the health insurance world.\n\nStill, the announcement that Cognizant (number 5 on the Healthcare Informatics 100 list, with $2,689,427,000 in U.S. healthcare revenues in 2014), was acquiring the Englewood, Colo.-based TriZetto for $2.7 billion in cash was seen as some in the industry as a harbinger of things to come, as the concepts of managed care, population health, and accountable care, begin to blend together, with health insurers and providers collaborating to manage patient\u2019s care, and as providers take on more financial risk, in the broad effort to improve outcomes and cut costs in U.S. healthcare.\n\nAs a report in Bloomberg Business put it on Sep. 15, the day the news broke, \u201cCognizant, one of the largest providers of outsourcing services, is tackling its biggest-ever acquisition to bulk up in information technology that helps providers streamline processes, improve the cost and quality of care and cope with an industry overhaul. The takeover follows Cognizant\u2019s 11 percent share decline this year, driven largely by the company reducing its annual revenue forecast in August because of tech-service deals taking longer to close.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a Sep. 17, 2014 analysis of the acquisition announcement entitled \u201cHow Cognizant\u2019s TriZetto Deal Could Trigger the Next Wave of Consolidation in the IT Services Industry,\u201d Harichandan Arakali wrote in the International Business Times online, \u201cThere is an accelerating shift in customer expectations: they want vendors to move from merely deploying software packages and maintaining them to implementing technology solutions that solve real business problems and provide additional value, such as insights that can drive new revenue streams.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Arakali wrote, \u201cTriZetto\u2019s cloud-based software-as-a-service platform for hospitals accounts for about 20 percent of its revenues, Cognizant's president Gordon Coburn told analysts on a call on Sep. 15, after the deal was announced. Further, including software licenses for packages used by insurers, about 60 percent of TriZetto\u2019s sales represents recurring revenue, he said.\u201d What\u2019s more, Arakali wrote, \u201cCognizant is setting the pace in acquiring the intellectual property in terms of software around which its... services team can go where Indian outsourcing services providers have never gone before.\u201d\n\nKrish Venkat, president, Global Healthcare & Life Sciences, at Cognizant, says the acquisition of TriZetto fits in perfectly with the company\u2019s broader trajectory. \u201cWhat Cognizant is trying to do is obviously synchronize to where we believe the industry is heading, and where the various participants in the healthcare ecosystem are making their moves,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you look at changes in the Affordable Care Act, they\u2019re forcing many changes: the lines are blurring between payers and providers; a lot of consolidation is occurring; a lot of providers are taking on more risk to fully become health systems; and there\u2019s a lot of consolidation on the payer side as well.\u201d\n\nVenkat says that while Cognizant was already all in, in terms of the provision of IT services for health insurers, \u201cOne of the things we didn\u2019t have in our repertoire, as late as last year\u2014one aspect we see emerging, and we didn\u2019t have the full suite of product offerings\u2014when we look at large and small customers and those in between, we look at the challenges we have in terms of what is imposed on them under the ACA [Affordable Care Act], in terms of the administrative costs and medical loss ratios. And many health plans are operating with dated technologies\u2014and they have a smaller footprint, and want to have the support of somebody with a much larger challenge.\u201d In other words, he believes that many health insurers, in order to expand their capabilities in their markets, will need the kinds of enabling services that the combined Cognizant/TriZetto can offer.\n\nObservers See Opportunities\n\nIndustry observers see Cognizant\u2019s trajectory, post-TriZetto-acquisition, as one offers great opportunity for the company\u2014along with certain specific challenges. Ben Rooks, an industry analyst and observer who heads up the ST Advisors consulting firm based in Northern California, and who in the past provided consulting expertise to Cognizant executives, says, \u201cCognizant has a great asset in that they are providing services to probably nine out of the top ten payers. Traditionally, the services were outsourcing services.\u201d After a series of complicated business moves, TriZetto acquired a very important asset, a core claims processing system that helped turn the company into a \u201cpowerhouse,\u201d as he puts it. What\u2019s more, he says, \u201cCognizant and TriZetto were both originally spun out of Dun & Bradstreet, so by acquiring TriZetto, they basically reintegrated things. It was a very smart move; and now they\u2019re one of the very dominant payer services companies. They\u2019ve got services and they\u2019ve got product; they\u2019re positioned to be one of the top players in the space.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1781\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s more, he says, \u201cCognizant and TriZetto were both originally spun out of Dun & Bradstreet, so by acquiring TriZetto, they basically reintegrated things.\nIt\u2019s not as though no one was paying attention to the Teaneck, N.J.-based Cognizant before September 2014.\nThey\u2019ve got services and they\u2019ve got product; they\u2019re positioned to be one of the top players in the space.\u201d\nIt was a very smart move; and now they\u2019re one of the very dominant payer services companies.\nObservers See OpportunitiesIndustry observers see Cognizant\u2019s trajectory, post-TriZetto-acquisition, as one offers great opportunity for the company\u2014along with certain specific challenges."}
