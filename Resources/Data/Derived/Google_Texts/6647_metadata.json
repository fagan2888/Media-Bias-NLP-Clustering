Ron Young and Rep. Kristina Roegner, in Wednesday\u2019s floor session criticized Obamacare expansion before voting for the 3,200-page budget bill.\n\nRep. Ron Amstutz, the No. 2 Republican in House leadership, bemoaned a federal \u201cmarch toward socialized health care\u201d before encouraging lawmakers to vote for the budget.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion, to me, is the right thing to do,\u201d said Majority Floor Leader Barbara Sears, a Republican. \u201cIt is the right investment for the state of Ohio.\u201d\n\nSears, long a supporter of the Obamacare expansion, repeatedly called expansion an \u201cinvestment in Ohio.\u201d Obamacare expansion is paid for with an open-ended promise of new funding from a federal government $18 trillion in debt.\n\nIn March, Ohio\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost taxpayers $323 million \u2014 84 percent more than the state budget office projected. The expansion is 60 percent over budget for the fiscal year ending June 30.\n\nBecause Republicans hold a supermajority of House seats, caucus leaders could have easily removed Obamacare expansion funding from the budget plan Republican Gov. John Kasich submitted in February. They chose not to.\n\nSpeaker Cliff Rosenberger publicly criticizes Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, but Rosenberger was elected to his leadership position with help from lobbyists close to the governor.\n\nOf the 65 Republicans in the 99-member House, only five voted against the budget Wednesday evening.\n\nWhy were Rep. Tom Brinkman, Rep. John Becker, Rep. Ron Hood, Rep. Nino Vitale and Rep. Paul Zeltwanger the only Republicans to vote against a budget including billions in Obamacare spending?\n\n\u201cThere was a feeling of inevitability,\u201d Brinkman told Ohio Watchdog. Even if Obamacare expansion had been removed from the budget, a floor amendment to add it back in would have passed, he said.\n\n\u201cThere were enough Republicans \u2014 Barb Sears, all of the people who are looking for jobs from Kasich \u2014 all those people would\u2019ve joined with the Democrats, so there was a feeling that we weren\u2019t gonna be able to stop it,\u201d Brinkman explained.\n\nMany Republicans were more concerned about stopping Kasich\u2019s tax proposals than fighting Obamacare expansion, Brinkman said. Others voted for the budget because it included health care price transparency and Medicaid savings account reforms.\n\n\u201cI think they fell for the reforms, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna be in there,\u201d he said. \u201cI think either the Senate is gonna take them out, or the governor is gonna line-item them out.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the Ohio House and Senate passed a budget with language forbidding the Obamacare expansion. Kasich line-item vetoed the ban and expanded Medicaid unilaterally.\n\n\u201cYou tell me what\u2019s changed, what\u2019s new,\u201d John Adams, a Republican who served in House leadership in the last General Assembly, told Ohio Watchdog. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Republican Party been during this administration when it comes to spending?\u201d\n\nAdams continued, \u201cYes, we fixed the $8 billion structural deficit, but after that, tell me what we stand for as a party?\u201d\n\nAdams expressed support for the same reforms Brinkman mentioned, but not for the budget as a whole.\n\n\u201cIf you get those two pieces to stay in the budget when this process is over, that is a half a step forward \u2014 and a big step back,\u201d Adams said. He wasn\u2019t optimistic the price transparency or health savings account reforms would become law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just telling those people that are trying to achieve those two pieces right now: good luck. Because leadership is gonna lie to ya, and I\u2019ll bet they don\u2019t give ya either one of \u2019em. That\u2019s my bet.\u201d\n\nAnd if the Medicaid reforms aren\u2019t included in the final budget sent to the governor? \u201cAt that point it should be all-out war,\u201d Adams said.\n\nAdams is running for Senate President Keith Faber\u2019s seat in the Ohio Senate. When Faber is term-limited in 2016 he\u2019s expected to run for Congress or a statewide executive office.\n\nWith the House tacitly endorsing the governor\u2019s Medicaid expansion, the Obamacare ball is now in Faber\u2019s court. The Senate must pass its own version of the budget, and both houses must agree on final language by June 30.\n\nIn addition to posing spending problems for taxpayers, Obamacare expansion is a messaging problem for Republican lawmakers and the Republican governor.\n\nThe Ohio Republican Party \u2014 led by Kasich loyalists \u2014 has no statewide platform, but it sent mailers last spring endorsing ORP State Central Committee members who would \u201cstand up to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn a 2014 primary, ORP attacked Brinkman as \u201cradical,\u201d \u201cnot reliable,\u201d and a supporter of President Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\nOhio newspapers, meanwhile, seem eager to forget the General Assembly voted against Obamacare expansion in 2013.\n\n\u201cWhen legislators declined to take up the issue, Kasich bypassed them,\u201d the Cincinnati Enquirer reported Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio House Republicans who campaigned against Obamacare have passed a budget containing $7 billion in Obamacare expansion spending.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio House Republicans who campaigned against Obamacare have passed a budget containing $7 billion in Obamacare expansion spending.", "title": "Ohio House Republicans embrace Obamacare expansion - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/barbara-sears-ohio-house.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T15:28:48+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/213757/ohio-house-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio House Republicans who campaigned against Obamacare have passed a budget containing $7 billion in Obamacare expansion spending.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/barbara-sears-ohio-house.jpg"}, "title": "Ohio House Republicans embrace Obamacare expansion - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "published_time": "2015-04-23T12:16:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T15:28:48+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Obamacare expansion, Medicaid expansion, Kasich Obamacare expansion, Ohio Obamacare expansion, Ohio Republican Party, John Kasich, Ohio House, Tom Brinkman, John Adams"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt is the right investment for the state of Ohio.\u201dSears, long a supporter of the Obamacare expansion, repeatedly called expansion an \u201cinvestment in Ohio.\u201d Obamacare expansion is paid for with an open-ended promise of new funding from a federal government $18 trillion in debt.\nBy Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogOhio House Republicans who campaigned against Obamacare have passed a budget containing $7 billion to expand it.\nMany Republicans were more concerned about stopping Kasich\u2019s tax proposals than fighting Obamacare expansion, Brinkman said.\nBecause Republicans hold a supermajority of House seats, caucus leaders could have easily removed Obamacare expansion funding from the budget plan Republican Gov.\nOhio newspapers, meanwhile, seem eager to forget the General Assembly voted against Obamacare expansion in 2013."}
