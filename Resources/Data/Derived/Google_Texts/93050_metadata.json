The approach isn\u2019t as revolutionary as Utah\u2019s efforts to set chronically homeless individuals up with apartments and case workers, but it\u2019s close.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold vision, no doubt: Instead of shabby tents pitched along pockmarked fields, Watters envisions tidy tracts of fully furnished sleeping cabins, plus a community center, dog park, kennel and landscaped gardens, all with the purpose of easing dozens of the city\u2019s most chronically homeless men and women back into mainstream society. Counting couples, the community could house up to 100 individuals at a time.\n\nA case manager would oversee new entries to the village, conducting needs assessments and developing tailored action plans that could include Affordable Care Act enrollment, addiction treatment, psychiatric aid, employment assistance, life-skills training and other basic services. Stays would max out at a year, but Watters expected most residents to do six-month stints. To save money, bathrooms, showers and other plumbing needs would be consolidated in the community center, while solar batteries would be installed to sop up the sun\u2019s energy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well-thought-out plan,\u201d Watters said.\n\nTo pull it off, Safe Ground could need as much as 2.5 acres of city-owned land and about $3 million, which Watters hopes to cobble from the city, foundations, the business community and grants.\n\nIt also needs someone to say yes. \u201cIt has been part of the problem, and I don\u2019t say that with any judgment of any of the council members,\u201d Watters hedged.\n\nEnter north Sacramento District 2 representative Warren. In early 2013, the councilman, then only a couple months into his freshman term, agreed to meet with Watters. The Safe Ground director planned to make a hard sell. He didn\u2019t need to.\n\n\u201cI went in prepared to do a song and dance, and before I opened my mouth, he said he was sold,\u201d Watters recalled.\n\nThe politician and activist may now be closing in on a potential location on which to build. Watters expected to make a formal announcement later this spring or in early summer, though San Miguel framed the prospects more cautiously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to hear out what [Watters] is envisioning and researching,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Watters added. \u201cI have to be.\u201d\n\nThe bid will test Warren\u2019s political capital in his district and put him out on a limb that his fellow Sacramento politicians have, thus far, failed to reach out and grab. After all, it\u2019s one thing to say you want to help homeless Sacramentans, and quite another to put your district where your platitudes are.\n\nAccording to San Miguel, Warren isn\u2019t interested in political calculus.\n\n\u201cThe council member doesn\u2019t make decisions based on whether he thinks it\u2019s a good political decision,\u201d she said. \u201cHe governs based on what\u2019s important. And this is important.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not entirely without controversy. The complex would be designed exclusively for the chronically homeless, those adults who have been living on the streets for a year or longer, rather than the larger ranks of homeless families and youth.\n\nAsked why, Watters said there appeared to be more programs available for the latter groups.\n\nNot so, according to Shahera Hyatt, director of the California Homeless Youth Project.\n\nThe only place in the five-county Sacramento region that provides shelter to homeless minors outside of the foster-care system is Wind Youth Services, which has a total of 12 beds at its emergency overnight shelter in north Sacramento. Wind nearly shuttered its popular drop-in center for youth this past fall due to a loss of grant money.\n\nFor young homeless adults between the ages of 18 and 24, who have different developmental needs than their older counterparts, Hyatt said there are \u201czero options.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supportive of Safe Ground, and definitely understand the need to respond to chronically homeless adults in a much more robust way than we currently are, but unfortunately, Watters\u2019 assertion that homeless youth and families are being adequately served by existing programs is mistaken,\u201d she said.\n\nWatters thinks the village model that Safe Ground hopes to realize locally can eventually be targeted to other populations. \u201cWe want to make it a showcase, something that Sacramento will be proud of and will want to replicate,\u201d he said.\n\nWatters believes naming a possible construction site is still months away.\n\nWatters has seen similar models fall short by cutting corners or moving forward without proper support. He doesn\u2019t want this proposal to end up being another well-intentioned casualty. \u201cI think we can do this really well,\u201d he said.\n\nThis particular journey has taken a couple of years already, he added. If it takes a couple more, that would mean opening the village just as Sacramento County\u2019s \u201c10-year plan to end homelessness\u201d reaches its 2016 deadline.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Raheem F.
