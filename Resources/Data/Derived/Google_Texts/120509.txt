Former Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich was asked on Friday on Fox News to defend a tweet in which he suggested President Obama faces impeachment if he were to act unilaterally against Syria.

“200 in #Congress demand #Syria vote. #Constitution art.1 sec.8 -@BarackObama risking #Impeachment?” the former Democratic congressman from Ohio tweeted to his 36,000 followers.

Mr. Kucinich argued that the conflict in Syria does not pose an “imminent or actual threat” to the United States.

He also took issue with how Mr. Obama phrased his statement earlier Friday when he said, “I meant what I said, I have not made a final decision.”

Mr. Kucinich argued that “it’s not ‘I, the president’ it’s ‘we the people’” who formed the U.S. Constitution and that it dictates that only Congress can take this country to war.

“He has to go to Congress,” he added. “If the people in the U.K. can be represented by their parliament, and [Prime Minister David] Cameron agreed, with the will of the people through their representatives, then why can’t President Obama do the same thing?”
