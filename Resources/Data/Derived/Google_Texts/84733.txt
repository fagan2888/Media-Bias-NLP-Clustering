The big news Friday was Patrick Roy saying he will not send rookie goalie Calvin Pickard back to the minors, nor will he keep three netminders. So when Semyon Varlamov returns from a groin injury — he practiced fully again Friday and says he’s fine — Reto Berra could be reassigned (waived) or traded. More about that here and in Saturday’s paper and online. And keep in mind: Roy could change his mind, or have his mind changed based on finances. Berra will make his $1.4 million ($1.45 million cap hit) wherever he plays, whereas Pickard makes substantially less in Lake Erie and is waiver-exempt.

About that headline: Erik Johnson didn’t have a concussion-type head injury. It was his neck that messed him up in Wednesday’s 4-3 overtime win at Arizona. EJ, who appeared to be knocked out, dangerously absorbed a hit by the Coyotes’ Martin Hanzal in OT while trying to shoot, and his follow-through resulted in Hanzal’s shoulder colliding with his head.

Minutes later, Hanzal inadvertently redirected the puck in Arizona’s net to complete Colorado’s comeback from a 3-0 hole.

“I went from pretty (upset) to pretty elated,” Johnson said. “Karma comes around — if you believe in that stuff.”

EJ said he was motionless on the ice because he was afraid to move. “I was feeling some neck pain and wasn’t sure if I should move or not. I was waiting for (trainer) Matt (Sokolowski) to get out there and tell him what I was dealing with. I had motion in my limbs and stuff but just had neck pain.”

EJ missed Thursday’s game at home against Chicago. “If it wasn’t a back-to-back I would have been able to play,” he said. “I just wasn’t able to get my range of motion, a lot of neck stiffness … How fast the game is, you have to have your head on a swivel and complete range of motion.”
