And as always pointing out the obvious brings out claims that the US system is somehow superior despite its lousy outcomes. Aaron Carroll helpfully reminds us that all of the arguments surfacing here are zombies \u2013 arguments that should have died in the face of clear evidence that they\u2019re wrong, but keep on shambling along nonetheless. (I actually learned the term \u201czombie idea\u201d from the health care discussion, specifically the unending attempts to trash the Canadian system.)\n\nI think it\u2019s important, however, to be explicit about something Carroll obviously knows but doesn\u2019t emphasize: the reason for the prevalence of zombies in this field. Some of it is chauvinism. But the main reason for the zombies is unwillingness to accept facts that conflict with ideology. The American health care system is by far the most privatized, most market-oriented system in the advanced world; it\u2019s also far and away the most expensive, without any sign of getting anything for all that money.\n\nIf you are committed to the view that the magic of the market solves all problems, this is disturbing \u2013 so it must not be true.
