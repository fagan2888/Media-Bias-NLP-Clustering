John Kasich on Friday urged Florida and South Carolina to expand Medicaid under the 2010 health law, while the Sunshine State\u2019s former governor and fellow Republican presidential aspirant slammed him for doing that in his home state.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Kasich frequently faces questions about his embrace of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. This week he has drawn fire from Jeb Bush over the policy.\n\nDuring a Friday morning Fox News interview, Kasich criticized Obamacare expansion opponents in Florida, one of 19 states whose lawmakers have refused new federal funding to put working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think it makes sense to not offer care to the mentally ill so they live under a bridge or in a prison \u2014 which costs a lot of money \u2014 or to the drug-addicted, who are in a revolving door in and out of the prisons, or to the working poor who spend their time in and out of emergency rooms,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nObamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid is not targeted at the drug-addicted, the mentally ill, or the working poor. Eligibility is based on income alone, and the program has no work requirements.\n\n\u201cI believe the governor of Florida, Rick Scott, has wanted this and they haven\u2019t been able to get it done,\u201d Kasich added. Scott, a fellow Republican, has opposed Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion since last spring.\n\nKasich also repeated his oft-stated boast that he restrained Medicaid growth to 2.5 percent in his second budget; he never mentions that Obamacare expansion was separate from his second budget because the Ohio General Assembly voted against it.\n\nRELATED: Gov. Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion end-run\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has cost $6.4 billion in two years, and is a major driver of the 33 percent increase in Ohio Medicaid spending Kasich presided over during his first term. But Kasich talked up the policy again Friday at a South Carolina town hall.\n\nNBC reporter Kailani Koenig shared some of Kasich\u2019s comments in reply to a question about his Obamacare expansion.\n\n\u201cAll the people who understood the implications of it were all for it,\u201d Kasich said before suggesting Obamacare expansion critics don\u2019t care about the drug-addicted, mentally ill, and working poor.\n\nKasich continues: If people don\u2019t want to do this, what is it they want to do with the mentally ill, the drug addicted, and working poor? \u2014 Kailani Koenig (@kailanikm) February 12, 2016\n\nLike the legislators in Florida, South Carolina lawmakers have refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare despite years of similar rhetoric from Democrats, hospital lobbyists and the press.\n\nKasich insinuates Obamacare expansion is the only way to help drug addicts, the mentally ill, and the working poor, but conservatives in the Ohio House offered a package of alternative proposals in 2013.\n\nKasich refused to consider state-level reforms that were designed to save money that would be used to help the same people Kasich credits the Obamacare expansion with serving.\n\nWhen Ohio legislators passed a ban on Obamacare expansion, Kasich vetoed the measure, expanded Medicaid eligibility unilaterally, and threatened to bankrupt the whole Ohio Medicaid program if Obamacare funding was not approved.\n\nKasich claims Obamacare expansion lets him \u201cbring Ohio money back home,\u201d but the expansion \u2014 which is on track to double Kasich\u2019s cost projections by 2020 \u2014 is paid for with new federal spending.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Kasich urged Florida and South Carolina to expand Medicaid under the 2010 health law, while Jeb Bush slammed him for doing just that in his home state.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "John Kasich urged Florida and South Carolina to expand Medicaid under the 2010 health law, while Jeb Bush slammed him for doing just that in his home state.", "title": "Kasich promotes Obamacare expansion in Florida, South Carolina - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/02/kasich-foxnews-2016-02-12-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-12T14:30:13+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/256679/kasich-promotes-obamacare-expansion-trail-florida-south-carolina/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "John Kasich urged Florida and South Carolina to expand Medicaid under the 2010 health law, while Jeb Bush slammed him for doing just that in his home state.", "title": "Kasich promotes Obamacare expansion in Florida, South Carolina - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/02/kasich-foxnews-2016-02-12-300px.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Florida", "tag": "Gov.
