That has changed because the teams finally became contenders at the same time.\n\nThe buildup to the rivalry\u2019s key conflict began in college football in 2007, when Seattle\u2019s Pete Carroll was coaching at powerful Southern California and San Francisco\u2019s Jim Harbaugh took over at long-suffering Stanford.\n\nPhoto\n\nHarbaugh went looking for a foil to motivate his team. He chose the Trojans, a perennial contender for the national title. Harbaugh quickly angered Carroll when he suggested that Carroll was coaching his final season for the Trojans. Carroll tersely denied it. Harbaugh kept talking.\n\n\u201cWe bow to no man,\u201d Harbaugh said unapologetically, months later. \u201cWe bow to no program here at Stanford University.\u201d\n\nStanford was a 41-point underdog to the No. 2-ranked Trojans when they played in Los Angeles that fall. Stanford won, 24-23, a \u201ccornerstone\u201d victory in the Cardinal\u2019s unexpected rise to national power, Harbaugh said.\n\nTwo years later, Stanford defeated U.S.C., 55-21, and the onslaught included a late 2-point conversion by the Cardinal. The coaches converged for a postgame handshake.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your deal?\u201d Carroll said to Harbaugh.\n\nSomewhat taken aback, Harbaugh replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal?\u201d\n\nIn 2010, as Stanford turned \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal?\u201d into a ticket-selling slogan, Carroll was coaching the Seahawks. The next year, the 49ers hired Harbaugh. Their rivalry, simply relocated, has been enhanced by the simultaneous rise of their teams in the division.\n\nThe 49ers won their first three meetings. In December 2012, though, at Seattle\u2019s CenturyLink Field, the Seahawks hammered San Francisco, 42-13. It did not prevent the 49ers from making the playoffs and reaching the Super Bowl.\n\nThe teams met in September at the same stadium, which is the league\u2019s loudest, Harbaugh acknowledged recently. The Seahawks won again, 29-3 \u2014 a combined 71-16 thwacking of the 49ers in Seattle the past two seasons.\n\nThe perceived unease between the coaches is Miracle-Gro for the rivalry.\n\nIn June, after the league disciplined the latest of several Seahawks caught using performance-enhancing drugs, Harbaugh was asked to comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely noticed it,\u201d he said, adding that he would tell his players to \u201cplay by the rules.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou want to be above reproach,\u201d he added, \u201cespecially when you\u2019re good, because you don\u2019t want people to come back and say, \u2018They\u2019re winning because they\u2019re cheating.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCarroll was asked for a rebuttal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about commenting about anybody else\u2019s team,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast week, they played down any tension. Harbaugh revealed that he had tried to recruit Carroll\u2019s son Nate to play for him at the University of San Diego, where he coached before Stanford. Nate Carroll went to U.S.C. and is now an assistant for his father in Seattle.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen where that\u2019s really even talked about anymore,\u201d Harbaugh said of a rift between the coaches. \u201cI think that might have been something four or five years ago. But I haven\u2019t seen it as of late. And it would be as irrelevant now as it would have been then, when people made a bigger deal out of it.\u201d\n\nBut ample boasts and invective are supplied by the players (both teams have reputations for self-congratulatory histrionics) and deep and rejuvenated fan bases.\n\nThe duel feels a bit like old money versus new money. The 49ers have won five Super Bowls and narrowly missed a sixth when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens a year ago. Part of the All-America Football Conference in 1946, and members of the N.F.L. since 1950, the 49ers have a long legacy of great players, from Y. A. Tittle and Hugh McElhenny to Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott and Steve Young.\n\nOn Sunday, the 49ers will make their third consecutive appearance in the conference championship game, but it will be only the third in the Seahawks\u2019 history. Seattle has been to one Super Bowl, losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers eight years ago. The list of Seahawks in the Hall of Fame includes Steve Largent and Cortez Kennedy, but their most popular alumnus might still be the left-hander Jim Zorn, the franchise\u2019s first quarterback.\n\nSeattle fans, calling themselves the 12th Man, have built a reputation as being fervent and loud. A San Francisco Chronicle columnist wondered if it was not indicative of an inferiority complex.\n\n\u201cThe face-painting, the costumes and the screaming isn\u2019t classy, it\u2019s just kind of silly,\u201d the columnist, C. W. Nevius, wrote Tuesday. \u201cAnd believe us. We know silly costumes. We have the Raiders.\u201d\n\nThe Seattle Times tackled the issue of \u201cour Bay Area complex,\u201d and Danny Westneat, a columnist there, riffed on the theme.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn boomtown Seattle of today, where we\u2019re smug that we\u2019re ranked No. 1 for this or that, face it, we remain deep-down envious of only one other,\u201d Westneat wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHer hipness. Her wealth. Her arts, architecture, high-tech, wine, culture, politics, you name it \u2014 we still peek insecurely south to check: What Would San Francisco Do?\u201d\n\nIn football, though, the sides are equally engaged.\n\nSeahawks fans pooled money to fly a \u201cGo Hawks\u201d banner over Candlestick Park when the teams played in San Francisco in December. A 49ers fan raised money for an electronic billboard along an interstate south of Seattle showing San Francisco\u2019s five Lombardi trophies.\n\nA television and web advertisement features 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick entering a stadium through an angry mob of shouting, rain-soaked fans \u2014 in Seahawks colors \u2014 and drowning them out with music on his Beats by Dre headphones.\n\nLast week, the Seahawks announced that the few remaining tickets for Sunday\u2019s game would be sold online, but not to anyone with a California billing address. (The Denver Broncos did the same for the A.F.C. championship game against New England, limiting sales to the Rocky Mountain region.) It was treated as the latest salvo.\n\n\u201cI actually respect it,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat you\u2019re trying to do for your team, put them in the best possible position to win that you can.\u201d\n\nThe teams, for all the bombast over their differences, are strikingly similar. Each is led by a mobile young quarterback molded in the personality of his coach \u2014 cool Russell Wilson of the Seahawks, the fiery Kaepernick of the 49ers. Each has a beefy offensive line and a dependable workhorse at running back \u2014 Marshawn Lynch for Seattle, Frank Gore for San Francisco. Each is deep at receiver.\n\nThe defenses are among the best. Seattle\u2019s was first in the N.F.L. in points and yards allowed; San Francisco was third in points allowed, fifth in yards. Each team is strong and fast up front. The 49ers have perhaps the league\u2019s best linebackers in Patrick Willis, NaVorro Bowman and Ahmad Brooks. The Seahawks have perhaps the top secondary, led by cornerback Richard Sherman and safety Earl Thomas.\n\n\u201cThere is no love lost,\u201d Sherman said of the 49ers. \u201cThere is no love found.\u201d\n\nThe game will decide which team goes to the Super Bowl, but not much else. Sunday may be the first playoff game between the N.F.L.\u2019s fiercest rivals, but it feels as if it might be only the first in a series.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat\u2019s their deal.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140118114038, "twitter": {"description": "The N.F.C. championship game between Seattle and San Francisco is the latest event in a long-running debate over football and cultural superiority in the West Coast cities.", "title": "Rivalry Between Seattle and San Francisco Heats Up the West Coast", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/sports/football/rivalry-between-seattle-and-san-francisco-heats-up-the-west-coast.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002658320"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "JohnBranchNYT", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/19/sports/nfc-illo/nfc-illo-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/sports/football/rivalry-between-seattle-and-san-francisco-heats-up-the-west-coast.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002658320", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/sports/football/rivalry-between-seattle-and-san-francisco-heats-up-the-west-coast.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/football", "hdl_p": "In College Grudge, Roots of Newly Heated Rivalry", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/football/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 18, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Seattle Seahawks", "keywords": "San Francisco 49ers,Seattle Seahawks,Carroll  Pete,Harbaugh  Jim,Football,Playoff Games", "news_keywords": "Football", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "John Branch", "SCG": "football", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Harbaugh, Jim", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JOHN BRANCH", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The N.F.C. championship game between Seattle and San Francisco is the latest event in a long-running debate over football and cultural superiority in the West Coast cities.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/19/sports/nfc-illo/nfc-illo-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The N.F.C. championship game between Seattle and San Francisco is the latest event in a long-running debate over football and cultural superiority in the West Coast cities.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 18, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/john_branch/index.html", "section": "Pro Football", "modified": "2014-04-26", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/football/index.jsonp", "tag": "Playoff Games", "published": "2014-01-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "19nfc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140426010005, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/sports/football/rivalry-between-seattle-and-san-francisco-heats-up-the-west-coast.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/19/sports/nfc-illo/nfc-illo-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The N.F.C. championship game between Seattle and San Francisco is the latest event in a long-running debate over football and cultural superiority in the West Coast cities.", "title": "Rivalry Between Seattle and San Francisco Heats Up the West Coast"}, "pdate": 20140118, "des": "Playoff Games", "articleid": 100000002658320, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Rivalry Between Seattle and San Francisco Heats Up the West Coast", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/19/sports/nfc-illo/nfc-illo-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "in points and yards allowed; San Francisco was third in points allowed, fifth in yards.\nEach has a beefy offensive line and a dependable workhorse at running back \u2014 Marshawn Lynch for Seattle, Frank Gore for San Francisco.\nA San Francisco Chronicle columnist wondered if it was not indicative of an inferiority complex.\nIn December 2012, though, at Seattle\u2019s CenturyLink Field, the Seahawks hammered San Francisco, 42-13.\nHer arts, architecture, high-tech, wine, culture, politics, you name it \u2014 we still peek insecurely south to check: What Would San Francisco Do?\u201dIn football, though, the sides are equally engaged."}
