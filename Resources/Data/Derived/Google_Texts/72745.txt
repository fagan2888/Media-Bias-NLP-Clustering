Maddie Chism, 17-year-old senior at Lafayette's Centaurus High School

Maddie and her friend, Madison Hogan, are in their second year of organizing a hunger banquet to raise money for Sister Carmen, No Kid Hungry and Oxfam International. For the banquet, the color of your ticket determines where you sit — 5 percent get to sit at a nice table with meal choices, 25 percent at a plain table with sandwiches and 75 percent find a chair or sit on the floor for beans, rice and a tortilla. To fundraise, the girls set up a page through philanthropyproject.com and raised almost $5,000. This year, the event is planned for the spring.

What do you like about the hunger banquet model?

It shows how food distribution is out of whack. It's really awesome.

Why a philanthropy project?

I love people. I love to talk to people and help people. I chose this project because food distribution is so unfair. We have so much food here. People in other places don't have anywhere near the privilege we have.

What do you like about Centaurus?

I love the community. It's so supportive and friendly.

What would you change?

I would have gotten involved with philanthropy earlier in high school. I wish I had more time.

What are you looking forward to senior year?

I'm looking forward to the hunger banquet and all the fun that comes with being a senior. It's the last year. I've got to make it count.

To work for Lawyers Without Borders. They can do so much good.
