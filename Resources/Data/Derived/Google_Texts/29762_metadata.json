Reuters/Danish Siddiqui\n\nEleven of Europe\u2019s largest private equity firms returned about $15 billion to their investors in the first three months of the year, as they took advantage of a strong exit environment.\n\nApax Partners, BC Partners, Charterhouse Capital Partners, Cinven, CVC Capital Partners, Electra Partners, EQT Partners, Montagu Private Equity, PAI Partners, Permira and Phoenix Equity Partners distributed at least \u20ac13.8 billion, or $14.9 billion in the first quarter of 2015, according to people close to the situations.\n\nThe industry has been able to use rising asset valuations and a strong exit environment to give back large chunks of capital to investors.\n\nApax and Permira were among those that produced the largest returns, distributing 4.2 billion euros and \u20ac2.2 billion respectively, while CVC\u2019s European funds distributed \u20ac4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAmong some of the significant exits for private equity firms were Apax\u2019s initial public offering of publishing group Auto Trader on the London Stock Exchange in March with a market capitalization of 2.3 billion pounds. CVC sold online payments company Skrill to Optimal Payments for about \u20ac1.1 billion, more than doubling its investment, while Permira generated the bulk of its distributions from its exits from fashion house Hugo Boss and Arysta LifeScience.\n\nThe firm made a return of 2.3 times its initial investment on Hugo Boss, which it exited in March. Permira agreed to sell Arysta for $3.5 billion to Platform Specialty in October.\n\nSpeaking at a recent conference, Tobias Eichner, a partner at consultancy Oliver Wyman, said that public markets were increasingly a popular option for private equity firms.\n\n\u201cThe IPO is back,\u201d said Mr. Eichner. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to sell \u2013 either to other buyers or to the stock market.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe IPO is not necessarily the preferred exit [but]\u2026 the current stock markets are wild. It\u2019s also a matter of reputation \u2013 to list something on the stock exchange [is good for a buyout firm\u2019s brand].\u201d\n\nIan Bagshaw, a partner at White & Case, previously told Private Equity News that the current exit market is what \u201ceveryone has talked about for the past decade\u201d and that \u201cexit routes are probably at their broadest since the crash.\u201d\n\nAccording to data provider Preqin, private equity fund managers distributed $597 billion globally to investors in the first three quarters of 2014, of which $127 billion came from Europe-focused funds.\n\nWrite to Ayesha Javed at ayesha.javed@wsj.com\n\nThis article originally appeared in Private Equity News, a U.K. trade publication owned by Dow Jones & Co.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Eleven of Europe\u2019s largest private equity firms returned about $15 billion to their investors in the first three months of the year, as they took advantage of a strong exit environment.", "title": "Top European Firms Distribute Nearly $15 Billion to Investors in First Quarter", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/08/top-european-firms-distribute-nearly-15-billion-to-investors-in-first-quarter/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HU376_HUGO_P_20150408170654.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Top European Firms Distribute Nearly $15 Billion to Investors in First Quarter", "description": "Eleven of Europe\u2019s largest private equity firms returned about $15 billion to their investors in the first three months of the year, as they took advantage of a strong exit environment.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Ayesha Javed", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Eleven of Europe\u2019s largest private equity firms returned about $15 billion to their investors in the first three months of the year, as they took advantage of a strong exit environment.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-08T21:08:50-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/08/top-european-firms-distribute-nearly-15-billion-to-investors-in-first-quarter/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-18297", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Eleven of Europe\u2019s largest private equity firms returned about $15 billion to their investors in the first three months of the year, as they took advantage of a strong exit environment.", "title": "Top European Firms Distribute Nearly $15 Billion to Investors in First Quarter", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/08/top-european-firms-distribute-nearly-15-billion-to-investors-in-first-quarter/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HU376_HUGO_P_20150408170654.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-18297", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-08T21:09:22-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda07f\"", "article_summary": "Speaking at a recent conference, Tobias Eichner, a partner at consultancy Oliver Wyman, said that public markets were increasingly a popular option for private equity firms.\nReuters/Danish SiddiquiEleven of Europe\u2019s largest private equity firms returned about $15 billion to their investors in the first three months of the year, as they took advantage of a strong exit environment.\nWrite to Ayesha Javed at ayesha.javed@wsj.comThis article originally appeared in Private Equity News, a U.K. trade publication owned by Dow Jones & Co.\nPermira\u2019s exit of Hugo Boss was part of a wave of distributions European firms made during the first quarter.\nApax Partners, BC Partners, Charterhouse Capital Partners, Cinven, CVC Capital Partners, Electra Partners, EQT Partners, Montagu Private Equity, PAI Partners, Permira and Phoenix Equity Partners distributed at least \u20ac13.8 billion, or $14.9 billion in the first quarter of 2015, according to people close to the situations."}
