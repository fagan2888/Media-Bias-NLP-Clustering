Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, but denounced the Republican Party leadership at the Values Voter Summit Saturday in Washington, D.C.\n\nBeck even said the party could be going the way of the Whigs by not standing for principle.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at a one-party system,\u201d Beck told the audience. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a system with John Boehner, John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi \u2014 they\u2019re all the same. I am thrilled to say we are finally standing up. We are finally saying, \u2018No, this is what we believe, and we will not move.\u201d\n\nBeck said the notion that Cruz and Lee will harm the Republican Party by holding firm against Obamacare, spending, and the debt is wrong. He also said the fight is much bigger than Obamacare, and Republicans lack vision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of people saying, \u2018Oh, but we might lose\u2019; yes\u2026and we just might win,\u201d Beck said, causing the ballroom to erupt in a rousing standing ovation.\n\nHe also pointed out that President Obama\u2019s approval rating now is three points lower than President George W. Bush\u2019s approval rating was at this point in his second term. Given that Obama has the backing of the media when Bush endured its scorn, Beck said he believes Republicans should show more backbone.\n\nBush \u201chad the press going after him saying, \u2018I think this guy might be a vampire,\u2019\u201d Beck recalled.\n\nAnd Obama? \u201cHe has the movies. He has the university system. He has television. He has the news. He has GE, Comcast, and NBC,\u201d Beck notes. \u201cAnd he still has a lower approval rating than Bush.\u201d\n\nBeck also noted that many in the GOP are wringing their hands about poll numbers.\n\n\u201cWhy are Republicans at 28 percent approval? I\u2019m surprised they\u2019re that high,\u201d Beck suggested. \u201cThey will tell you, \u2018Because of people like Ted Cruz or people like Mike Lee,\u2019\u201d Beck said of the Texas and Utah Republican senators. \u201cThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I believe those two guys are stopping the Republicans from having an 18 percent approval rating. These guys are truly remarkable. They both went to their constituents in the election and said, \u2018This is exactly who I am, and this is exactly what I\u2019m going to do. And now they are getting hammered by the press and the Republicans for doing exactly what they said they were going to do.\u201d\n\nBeck compared the lack of principle in the Republican party with the party (at its ashes) from which the GOP rose\u2026the Whigs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re missing a party that actually represents us, and everybody says we don\u2019t want to start a third party,\u201d Beck said. \u201cLet me tell you a little story. History repeats itself. \u2018You don\u2019t want to start a third party.\u2019 But there were about 20 Whigs and a few Democrats who said, \u2018You\u2019re lying to us. It\u2019s time to end slavery and you\u2019re lying to us.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeeming to make a comparison to Ted Cruz, Beck noted how \u201cCharles Sumner was one of the most unpopular senators. He was tearing apart the Whig party. Everything you\u2019re hearing has happened before.\u201d\n\nReferencing Abraham Lincoln, Beck noted: \u201cIt was six years later that a big gawky skinny guy with a goofy hat stood up and said, \u2018I\u2019m a Republican, and I\u2019m going to end slavery.\u2019 You\u2019re on the verge of winning. And it\u2019s going to happen quickly if you don\u2019t compromise your values.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Beck\u2019s full speech:\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Glenn Beck praised GOP Sens.
