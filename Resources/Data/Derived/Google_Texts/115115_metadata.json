Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) works on his pitch.\n\nAt a cattle call for prospective presidential candidates on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Republican hopefuls couldn\u2019t say enough good things about the members of one powerful public sector union: the firefighters.\n\n\"God bless firefighters,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), gazing out upon a sea of burly first responders seated at long tables in a hotel ballroom. \u201cI am in awe to be in the presence of heroes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirefighters embody the best values of our nation: service, commitment, dedication and unapologetic patriotism,\u201d said the video feed of former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who couldn\u2019t make the International Association of Firefighters\u2019 annual legislative conference but took the time to record a greeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at the guys who run into burning buildings,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R- S.C.), \"and I\u2019d be the first one to run out.\u201d Rep. Pete T. King (R-N.Y.), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former New York governor George Pataki rounded out the morning on the GOP side.\n\nDespite the praise, though, the affection was largely not returned. Jokes at Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s expense fell flat, and saber rattling over Iran elicited little response, as did typical conservative arguments about getting government out of the way \u2014 as a firefighter, you might reasonably ask whether they had your interests at heart.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed the Democrats, not so much the Republicans,\u201d said John Daum, a firefighter in Greenwich, Conn. \u201cI don\u2019t think they support labor.\u201d\n\nNow, Republicans don\u2019t usually bother trying to seek support from labor unions, which lean heavily Democratic. Most unions couldn\u2019t have summoned that list of busy conservatives to make a customized pitch to their members \u2014 let alone to an audience of government employees, who have come squarely into the sights of GOP politicians from the federal level on down.\n\n[Webb, O\u2019Malley seek support among firefighters]\n\nBut firefighters are a special breed of union, serving as symbols of strength and valor \u2014 a helpful backdrop for politicians seeking to wrap themselves in the flag. They\u2019re a relatively conservative bunch, with 44 percent of their 300,000 members identifying as Republican. (According to a Gallup poll from 2011, only 26.6 percent of unionized local government employees are Republican.) Sometimes they even endorse Republicans, as the Florida firefighters did in 2004 for George W. Bush. And they've got a reputation for working with both parties to get things they want, like more Homeland Security funding for local fire departments (sometimes at the expense of efficiency, in the light of firefighters\u2019 changing role in cities).\n\n\u201cWe know that there are many in that arena who appreciate the work that we do,\u201d said IAFF President Harold Schaitberger, speaking of the Republicans while killing time in between speeches. And the union is as muscular financially as it is physically. Schaitberger boasted that the firefighters\u2019 PAC was the 34th largest in the nation, having handed out $6.4 million in 2014 \u2014 mostly to Democrats but occasionally to Republicans too.\n\nAccordingly, firefighters are sometimes even protected from legislation that damages other unions. Michigan, for example, exempted firefighters and police from its 2012 right-to-work law. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R), who showered criticism on public sector unions during his campaign, proposed cutting a \u201cspecial deal\u201d to preserve police and firefighter pensions.\n\nBut if Republicans are interested in the firefighters\u2019 support, they had little to offer in the way of things they actually care about. While several talked about the problems of inequality and a failing middle class, most simply offered growth as a solution, rather than empowering the labor movement. Cruz, who has a zero percent rating on the AFL-CIO\u2019s annual voting scorecard, tried to make common cause with the firefighters over their dissatisfaction with the \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d on their health-care plans under Obamacare \u2014 and drew a swift rebuttal.\n\n\"Ted Cruz seemed to struggle up there,\u201d remarked Scott Mullins, a firefighter from Asheville, N.C. \"He seemed a little awkward.\"\n\nThe event avoided the worst potential awkwardness, though, given that GOP presidential contenders who have really antagonized the firefighters weren\u2019t present: Gov. Scott Walker, who just signed a right-to-work bill in Wisconsin, declined an invitation. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is still trying to slash public employee pensions after being dealt a setback in the courts, wasn\u2019t invited at all.\n\n[Jeb Bush, Scott Walker emerging as front-runners for GOP nod \u2014 and rivals]\n\nKing and Graham fared a little better, with King hitting Republicans like Cruz, who had held up funding for the Department of Homeland Security because of its immigration provisions. But the biggest applause line of the morning came at the end, from former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley (D), who had the advantage of critiquing politicians who spoke earlier in the event.\n\n\"All of the Republican leaders you heard from today are opposed to collective bargaining, because collective bargaining runs counter to their belief that keeping wages low somehow makes America\u2019s economy better,\u201d he said, to a standing ovation. And then, he put his finger on the sense of discomfort firefighters had with the conservative leaders who took the stage before him.\n\n\u201cWhen someone dials 911, and you show up to run into a burning building, have you ever once had a citizen say, 'No thanks, I believe government is the problem\u2019?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s broadsides resonated especially with the North Carolina firefighters, who live in one of the four states where collective bargaining is illegal for firefighters. Partly as a result, their median hourly wage is a full $6 below the nationwide average.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Malley definitely struck a chord with us,\u201d said Thomas Brewer, from Charlotte.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At a presidential candidate cattle call, GOP hopefuls failed to dispel a sense that labor isn't their friend.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "At a presidential candidate cattle call, GOP hopefuls failed to dispel a sense that labor isn't their friend.", "title": "Republicans love firefighters.
