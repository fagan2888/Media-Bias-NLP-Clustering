BOISE, Idaho (AP) -

A persistent grade school student's attempt to make the Idaho giant salamander the official state amphibian is off to a good start.

The Spokesman-Review reports that the bill championed by eighth grader Ilah Hickman on Tuesday became the first introduced in the Idaho Legislature this year.

It's her fifth attempt in as many years to persuade lawmakers to recognize the predatory amphibian that can grow to more than a foot long.

As part of her pitch Tuesday morning she told members on the State Affairs Committee the salamander makes its home almost exclusively in Idaho.

She also says its skin markings resemble a topographical map of Idaho's Bitterroot Mountains.

She says she'll bring a live salamander in an aquarium to show lawmakers if the bill gets a hearing.
