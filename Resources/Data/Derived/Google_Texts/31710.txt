The Mississippi Highway Patrol ended the 2014 Christmas enforcement period Dec. 25 at midnight without a fatality on roadways it patrols. The patrol counts holiday traffic deaths on state highways and interstates.

Patrol spokesman Lt. Johnny Poulos says in a news release that 1,500 citations were issued, including 22 DUI arrests and 30 seatbelt violations, during the enforcement period that began at 6 p.m. Tuesday.

Poulos says the Highway Patrol attributes the low statistics to responsible decisions made by motorists, public notification by the media and the high visibility of law enforcement through the period.
