In a copy of the complaint reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Lyft argues that VanderZanden, who left in August and joined Uber in October, violated a contract by downloading confidential documents containing financial projections and product plans to his personal Dropbox account before his departure.\n\nThe dispute highlights the fiercely competitive battle unfolding between Uber and Lyft, who have kept close tabs on each others\u2019 plans and, at times, outright copied one another as they fight to gain share of the fast-growing market for ridesharing apps. The rivals have undercut each other\u2019s prices, poached drivers and engaged in a public war of words.\n\nLyft\u2019s complaint alleges that VanderZanden downloaded \u201cLyft\u2019s historic and future financial information, strategic planning materials like marketing plans and product plans, customer lists and data, international growth documents, and private personnel information.\u201d He violated a confidentiality agreement by retaining possession of these documents after Aug. 15, his last day of employment at Lyft, the company said.\n\nLyft said it discovered some of the documents VanderZanden took because he had synchronized his personal Dropbox account to a company-issued laptop he returned to Lyft after his departure.\n\nVanderZanden, who is now vice president of international growth at Uber, denied Lyft\u2019s allegations in a series of tweets on Thursday, writing that he did not take any confidential data to Uber and deleted all the documents listed in the complaint before joining the company. He called the lawsuit an \u201caudacious attack\u201d on his reputation. VanderZanden did not respond to requests for further comment left on his voicemail.\n\nThe executive joined Lyft when the company acquired his startup, a car-washing service called Cherry, last year.\n\nLyft also claims VanderZanden refused to sign a termination agreement that is designed to ensure a departing employee will adhere to a promise to keep company documents confidential.\n\nThe company further alleges VanderZanden solicited Lyft employees despite a confidentiality agreement prohibiting him from doing so for a period of one year after leaving the company.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks an injunction requiring him to return the confidential materials to Lyft, as well as unspecified damages and an award of lost profits.\n\nIn an emailed statement, a Lyft spokeswoman said the company is \u201cdisappointed to have to take this step, but this unusual situation has left us no choice but to take the necessary legal action to protect our confidential information.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An executive who recently left Lyft to join ridesharing rival Uber is being accused of taking secret documents with him.", "title": "Lyft Alleges Former Executive Took Secret Documents With Him to Uber", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/05/lyft-alleges-former-executive-took-secret-documents-with-him-to-uber/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NA-BT266_CABTEC_G_20121028173920.jpg"}, "site": "WSJD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Tech", "article.headline": "Lyft Alleges Former Executive Took Secret Documents With Him to Uber", "description": "An executive who recently left Lyft to join ridesharing rival Uber is being accused of taking secret documents with him.", "article_section": "Tech", "author": "Douglas MacMillan", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Digits Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Digits", "article.summary": "An executive who recently left Lyft to join ridesharing rival Uber is being accused of taking secret documents with him.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-11-05T23:25:44-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/05/lyft-alleges-former-executive-took-secret-documents-with-him-to-uber/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DGB-38714", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Tech", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "An executive who recently left Lyft to join ridesharing rival Uber is being accused of taking secret documents with him.", "title": "Lyft Alleges Former Executive Took Secret Documents With Him to Uber", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/05/lyft-alleges-former-executive-took-secret-documents-with-him-to-uber/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NA-BT266_CABTEC_G_20121028173920.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Digits", "article.id": "BL-DGB-38714", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-06T21:08:43-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda565\"", "article_summary": "A Lyft car with its trademarked pink mustache in San FranciscoAn executive who recently left Lyft to join ridesharing rival Uber is being accused of taking secret documents with him.\nLyft said it discovered some of the documents VanderZanden took because he had synchronized his personal Dropbox account to a company-issued laptop he returned to Lyft after his departure.\nLyft also claims VanderZanden refused to sign a termination agreement that is designed to ensure a departing employee will adhere to a promise to keep company documents confidential.\nThe executive joined Lyft when the company acquired his startup, a car-washing service called Cherry, last year.\nThe company further alleges VanderZanden solicited Lyft employees despite a confidentiality agreement prohibiting him from doing so for a period of one year after leaving the company."}
