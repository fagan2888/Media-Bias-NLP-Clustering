Viewers were able to follow along via social media using the hashtag #YouTubeAsksObama.\n\nJust 2 days after his well-received State of the Union address, the President appeared relaxed as the trio took turns asking questions on everything from student loans, cyber security, and health care, to Cuba/U.S. relations and Boko Haram.\n\nBethany Mota, GloZell Green and Hank Green have more than 13 million subscribers combined. Mota\u2019s YouTube videos feature makeup tips, DIY projects and advice for young women and teens.

First, when GloZell Green referred to the police as \u201cthe po-po\u201d and when she told the President that Fidel Castro put the \u201cdick in dictatorship.\u201d Then, when she mistakenly referred to Mrs. Obama as the \u201cfirst wife.\u201d The President asked her, \u201cDo you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d He graciously accepted her gift of 3 neon hunter green lipsticks for the First Lady, Sasha and Malia.\n\nBethany Mota wrapped up her interview with a few random questions. Here they are, along with his answers:\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite TV show? SportsCenter, basketball and football games. When you were little what did you want to be when you grew up? An architect, or an NBA player, but I gave that up when I realized I didn\u2019t have the talent. If you could have a superpower what would it be? Flying, as long as I could stay warm. Invisibility seems a little sneaky, so I guess the flying thing\u2026 I\u2019d love to be able to speak any language\u2026 but as a superpower, it might be boring.\u201d\n\nWatch President Obama\u2019s YouTube Interviews \u2013 Video begins at approx. 34:38\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama sat down with 3 YouTube personalities Thursday in a rare Internet-only appearance to talk about issues facing them and their audiences.
