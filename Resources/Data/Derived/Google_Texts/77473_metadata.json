It doesn't include any vehicles in the U.S.\n\nTakata inflators can explode with too much force, sending out shrapnel. At least eight people have been killed worldwide and hundreds injured.\n\nThe problem has led to the recall of 19.2 million vehicles in the U.S., and government regulators are investigating. Millions more may be recalled.\n\nNo injuries were reported in Toyota vehicles related to the latest defect, which affects the passenger seat air bag, but a person in a Nissan Motor Co. car was injured recently in Japan.\n\nToyota has announced nearly 15 million recalls in relation to problem Takata inflators worldwide, nearly 3 million each in the U.S. and Japan, spokeswoman Kayo Doi said.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. auto safety regulators fined Takata $70 million for concealing evidence for years that its air bags are prone to explode.\n\nUnder a five-year pact, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can increase the penalty to a record $200 million if the company fails to abide by the terms.\n\nToyota, Ford Motor Co. of the U.S., Japanese automakers Honda Motor Co. and Nissan have decided not to use Takata inflators in vehicles under development.\n\n___\n\nFollow Yuri Kageyama: twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nHer work can be found at bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama", "article_metadata": {"zone": "business/articles", "keyword": "Collections: Business", "title": "Toyota recalls vehicles in Japan, Europe for air bag defect", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2015/11/25/toyota-recalls-vehicles-in-japan-europe-for-air-bag-defect", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 1.6 million vehicles for defective air bags supplied by embattled Japanese manufacturer Takata Corp.", "title": "Toyota recalls vehicles in Japan, Europe for Takata air bag defect after injury in Japan"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 1.6 million vehicles for defective air bags supplied by embattled Japanese manufacturer Takata Corp.", "card": "summary", "title": "Toyota recalls vehicles in Japan, Europe for air bag defect"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 25, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: Top News,Associated Press,Collections: Business", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 1.6 million vehicles for defective air bags supplied by embattled Japanese manufacturer Takata Corp."}, "article_summary": "The problem has led to the recall of 19.2 million vehicles in the U.S., and government regulators are investigating.\nToyota has announced nearly 15 million recalls in relation to problem Takata inflators worldwide, nearly 3 million each in the U.S. and Japan, spokeswoman Kayo Doi said.\nBy YURI KAGEYAMA, AP Business WriterTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 1.6 million vehicles for defective air bags supplied by embattled Japanese manufacturer Takata Corp.\nNo injuries were reported in Toyota vehicles related to the latest defect, which affects the passenger seat air bag, but a person in a Nissan Motor Co. car was injured recently in Japan.\nToyota, Ford Motor Co. of the U.S., Japanese automakers Honda Motor Co. and Nissan have decided not to use Takata inflators in vehicles under development."}
