WASHINGTON – Still struggling with gifts for loved ones this holiday season? Those George W. Bush ornaments – or rather, the ornaments by the artist known as “43” – not quite cutting it?

The Senate Conservatives Fund has a solution. Those who donate $10 now, not only help the group repeal Obamacare, but also receive a “Ted Cruz Was Right” bumper sticker.

The sticker is meant to refer to Cruz’s call to defund the health care act, but it also works if the gift recipient agrees with any of Cruz’s commentary on the reality TV show Duck Dynasty, which was a part of his 21-hour speech denouncing Obamacare. Do you think most things can be fixed with duck tape and extension cords? You agree with Ted Cruz!

For the young and young at heart, the Really Big Coloring Books company has the perfect present – a coloring book starring none other than Texas’ junior senator.

“We’ve talked to parents around the country and they really enjoy seeing modern day people in children’s literature,” said the company’s founder Wayne Bell, in a YouTube video.

The books contains snippets of Cruz trivia, the Ten Commandments and commentary on Cruz’s talk-a-thon. An excerpt:

“A lot of the career establishment politicians are far too out of shape, old or overweight to even perform such a magnificent feat, God bless them all.”

Bell did not speak with Cruz before writing the book nor did he donate to his Senate campaign, so if you’re going for Cruz authenticity, get the bumper stickers.

The Really Big Coloring Books company also carries an Occupy Wall Street coloring book and a 9/11 coloring book, where youngsters can color in a picture of Osama bin Laden’s assassination.

Happy Holidays!
