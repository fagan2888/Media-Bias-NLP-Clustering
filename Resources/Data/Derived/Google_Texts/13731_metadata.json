Roberts Jr. knew a torrent of conservative invective was headed his way, so perhaps praise from a left-of-center columnist is the last thing he needs.\n\nSorry, chief, here goes.\n\nRoberts saved the Affordable Care Act, a second time, for the man who voted against confirming him. It was the right decision, a wise one, for the law, the court and the country.\n\nFor this, predictably, Roberts has been branded David Souter-lite. \u201cHe stands revealed as a most political Justice,\u201d thundered the Wall Street Journal editorial board, accusing Roberts of \u201cvolunteering as Nancy Pelosi\u2019s copy editor.\u201d\n\nThat was among the milder critiques. \u201cIt\u2019s time we admitted that our national \u2018umpire\u2019 is now playing for one of the teams,\u201d said Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network.\n\nDeep breath, folks. Roberts is no liberal squish. He\u2019s not even a centrist squish. He\u2019s a deeply conservative jurist, as witnessed by his impassioned dissent in the court\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling the day after his supposed treachery on health care.\n\n\u201cWhether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cUnder the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be.\u201d\n\nI happen to agree with Roberts on health care and disagree on marriage, but his position in both is intellectually consistent in its conception of the judicial role. It behooves even those of us who believe that the court was correct in extending marriage rights to same-sex couples to think through his arguments about short-circuiting the democratic process and investing judges with policymaking powers.\n\nAnd, by the way, let\u2019s not get carried away by the remarkable string of liberal victories in the court\u2019s final week, including an expansive interpretation of the housing discrimination law along with the health care and marriage cases.\n\nThis is not a liberal court. It\u2019s a conservative court that occasionally, thanks to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, swings in the opposite direction. In the run-up to the 2016 election, complacency about the court would be foolish. The next president will shape the country\u2019s constitutional future.\n\nBut back to health care. The six-justice majority \u2014 that Kennedy would betray the cause is no longer enraging to conservatives \u2014 was correct on the law. Certainly, the phrase \u201cexchange established by the State\u201d was, to use Roberts\u2019s term, \u201cinartful.\u201d\n\nYet as Roberts convincingly demonstrated, interpreting the law to make subsidies unavailable in most states would mean that \u201cCongress made the viability of the entire Affordable Care Act turn on the ultimate ancillary provision: a sub-sub-sub section of the Tax Code.\u201d\n\nRather, Roberts wrote, \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter.\u201d\n\nThis is not judicial activism, rewriting legislation from the bench. It\u2019s judicial deference with a brain.\n\nI\u2019ve been skeptical of Roberts\u2019s famous umpire analogy because it seems to reduce judging to a mechanistic enterprise: If the judge thinks hard enough, the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer will emerge. That\u2019s too simplistic. The capacious phrases of the Constitution, as the marriage case demonstrates, inevitably leave space for judgment and ideology.\n\nBut it is also true \u2014 and this is one reason that Roberts deserves praise \u2014 that there are times when the correct legal result is reasonably clear. It is then the judge\u2019s responsibility to follow it, no matter what his or her policy preference.\n\nDoes anyone think that John Roberts, citizen, or John Roberts, member of Congress, would vote for the Affordable Care Act? Or President Obama? Of course not. The health-care ruling helps \u2014 or should help \u2014 undermine the cynical view that all judges are mere partisans in robes, reflexively ruling for their team.\n\nWhich brings me to the final point, about how the health-care ruling is good for the court and the country. Justices, and the chief justice in particular, have a duty to consider and safeguard the court\u2019s institutional role. Roberts did so in both health-care rulings, protecting the court from being accused of overreaching and of inserting itself into political arguments.\n\nThey also have a responsibility to consider the practical implications of their actions. A decision invalidating subsidies on federal exchanges would have created turmoil for millions of Americans, a step the court should not take lightly.\n\nI don\u2019t always \u2014 actually, I don\u2019t often \u2014 agree with the chief justice. I do respect logic and consistency.\n\nRead more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His logic and consistency show he\u2019s no judicial activist.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "His logic and consistency show he\u2019s no judicial activist.", "title": "The Obamacare and marriage rulings prove Justice Roberts is no partisan", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-roberts-is-no-partisan-jurist/2015/06/26/788e420a-1c22-11e5-93b7-5eddc056ad8a_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/25/Interactivity/Images/AP_862114032104.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@RuthMarcus"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-roberts-is-no-partisan-jurist/2015/06/26/788e420a-1c22-11e5-93b7-5eddc056ad8a_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ruth Marcus, same sex marriage, supreme court, supreme court gay marriage, john roberts, health care supreme court, supreme court obamacare, roberts obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus"}, "eomportal-uuid": "788e420a-1c22-11e5-93b7-5eddc056ad8a", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Ruth Marcus, same sex marriage, supreme court, supreme court gay marriage, john roberts, health care supreme court, supreme court obamacare, roberts obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f7d\"", "article_summary": "Does anyone think that John Roberts, citizen, or John Roberts, member of Congress, would vote for the Affordable Care Act?\nRoberts saved the Affordable Care Act, a second time, for the man who voted against confirming him.\nHe\u2019s a deeply conservative jurist, as witnessed by his impassioned dissent in the court\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling the day after his supposed treachery on health care.\nBut back to health care.\n\u201cWhether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us,\u201d Roberts wrote."}
