Terry McAuliffe in a state budget standoff by persuading a Democratic senator to resign his seat \u2026 Sen. Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell) will announce his resignation Monday, effective immediately, paving the way to appoint his daughter to a judgeship and Puckett to the job of deputy director of the state tobacco commission, three people familiar with the plan said Sunday.\n\nYes, indeed. Del. Terry G. Kilgore, the Republican chairman of the tobacco commission (which disburses grants funded by the national tobacco litigation settlement), told the Post that the commission was planning to meet as early as that very week to consider appointing Puckett. Kilgore \u201cdisputed the notion that Puckett was resigning in exchange for the tobacco commission job, but he said the resignation made Puckett available to take the position.\u201d Convenient! Puckett\u2019s salary, Kilgore added, \u201cwould be determined by the commission.\u201d\n\nAs for Puckett's daughter, Martha Puckett Ketron, she had been serving as a Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court judge, but merely on a temporary appointment, the Post explained. The House had approved her appointment to a six-year term when it reconvened early this year, but the (Democratic-led) Senate had declined to confirm her, in line with its policy against appointing the relatives of active legislators to the bench. But voila: if Puckett resigned, the newly Republican-led legislature would appoint her to a full six-year term:\n\n\u201cIt should pave the way for his daughter,\u201d Kilgore said of Puckett\u2019s resignation. \u201cShe\u2019s a good judge. ... I would say that he wanted to make sure his daughter kept her judgeship. A father\u2019s going do that.\u201d\n\nThe appearance of a blatant quid-pro-quo in Puckett\u2019s resignation provoked an uproar in Richmond, which was already reeling over former governor Bob McDonnell\u2019s trial on corruption charges. Federal officials launched an inquiry. Puckett ultimately was forced to relinquish claim to his tobacco commission sinecure. But his resignation stood, and the damage was done to the Democrats and the 400,000 Virginians who, unlike their low-income counterparts in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland, are still going without health coverage that would\u2019ve been paid for almost entirely by the federal government.\n\nThen, just recently, came additional revelations of l\u2019affaire Puckett from one of the Washington Post\u2019s dogged Virginia state government reporters, Laura Vozzella. She reported that McAuliffe\u2019s chief of staff, Paul Reagan, had, like any employer battling to keep a star worker, tried to keep Puckett in the fold by countering with an offer of his own. \u201cI know there was a lot of frustration with your daughter, not, you know, getting a judgeship or something,\u201d Reagan said in a voice mail left for Puckett. \u201cIf there\u2019s something that we can do for her, I mean, you know, we have a couple of big agencies here that we still need agency heads. We could potentially, potentially, subject to approval of the governor and so forth, you know, the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy could be available.\u201d\n\nAnd also pitching in was Mark Warner, a longtime friend of Puckett\u2019s. Vozzella reported that \u201cthree days before the state senator\u2019s resignation became official, Warner called Puckett\u2019s son, Joseph, and discussed an appointment to the federal bench as well as a potential corporate position for Martha Puckett Ketron, according to Joseph Puckett\u2019s attorney, Charles E. \u2018Chuck\u2019 James Jr. of Williams Mullen. James said that Warner suggested a post for Ketron at CGI, at high-tech firm Warner helped lure to Southwest Virginia when he was governor a decade ago.\u201d\n\nSo, in short, Virginia\u2019s top Democrats, panicking about the potential loss of Senate control and the fate of the governor\u2019s legislative priority\u2014not to mention the fate of 400,000 poor Virginians\u2019 health and financial well-being\u2014tried to fight fire with fire, and favor with favor, and lost. For all the uproar, it\u2019s doubtful that any of what transpired around Puckett was illegal\u2014all things considered, it can be chalked up to the seamier side of politics, and no more. But even if the overtures crossed some line, there is no disputing which overture came first, what the original sin of this saga was.\n\nYet that hasn\u2019t stopped Republicans from trying to attack Warner for his reactive response to the Republicans\u2019 own offer to Puckett. Gillespie harped on the revelations during his debate against Warner, and launched an ad attacking Warner on the matter, which he later had to revise because it overstated Warner\u2019s efforts to the point where they did sound illegal. Meanwhile, Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel, a close ally of Gillespie\u2019s K Street crowd, touted this new scandal as reason why GOP donors should stick with Gillespie in the home stretch:\n\nThis past week Mr. Warner\u2019s image began to crumble. In June, Democratic state Sen. Phil Puckett abruptly resigned, throwing control to Republicans and derailing Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe \u2019s top priority, which is to expand Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program. Within a week, federal investigators were probing whether Republicans had dangled a job for Mr. Puckett in return for his resignation. That investigation is now producing quite different details. The Washington Post last week revealed it was Mr. Warner who called the Puckett family to discuss the possibility of a federal judgeship or corporate gig for Mr. Puckett\u2019s daughter, as a means of getting him to stay in the Senate.\n\nNote the misleading wording: Strassel does her best to make it sound as if it was Warner instead of the Republicans, not in addition to them, who had made an overture to Puckett\u2014when in fact there is nothing in the new revelations that rebuts the initial reports that Republicans made the first offer to him. But of course this elision is necessary for Strassel to even attempt to spin this for the Republicans. Even the Journal\u2019s conservative readers would ridicule her chutzpah otherwise, if she let on that the quid-pro-quo\u2019ing had in fact started with her side.\n\nFinally, there are the valiant efforts by Brad Dayspring of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm. Monday night, Dayspring tweeted out this:\n\nNYT report: \"Mark Warner is the culinary Cousteau for senators hoping to find new hip places\" in DC. Not mentioned: embroiled in scandal. \u2014 Brad Dayspring (@BDayspring) October 21, 2014\n\nTo which the New York Times\u2019 Jonathan Weisman responded, with a link to the original story on the Republicans\u2019 deal with Puckett:\n\n@BDayspring Honestly, is the sin here that Warner failed where Va Republicans succeeded? http://t.co/RgFitvya8A \u2014 Jonathan Weisman (@jonathanweisman) October 21, 2014\n\nWeisman\u2019s right, of course.
