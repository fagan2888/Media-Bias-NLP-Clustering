Today's events included a parade celebrating Bavarian culture \u2013 and of course, the rampant consumption of beer, served in a traditional one-liter Mass mug.\n\nThe 16-day festival will end on Oct. 5. In that time, organizers say people will drink enough beer to fill more than two Olympic swimming pools. And as we noted in a post back in 2011, celebrants normally lose more than 4,000 items at Munich's big party. The lost property has previously included a wheelchair and a Viking helmet.\n\nLooking around for news from this year's festival, we noticed these interesting bits:\n\nFor the first time, beer prices have risen over 10 euros ($12.83) for one liter.\n\nThe traditional men's Gamsbart hat \u2013 with a tuft of animal hair representing a hunting trophy \u2013 is a status symbol that \"costs around 1000 euros,\" or $1,283, according to Deutsche Welle.\n\nIn the Ochsenbraterei beer tent, the specialty is roast oxen, reports Germany's The Local. A plate of the meat, which is roasted on-site, costs nearly 16 euros (about $20.50).\n\nNearly 7 million liters of beer will be served. Most of it is around 6 percent alcohol by volume.\n\nIn the Hofbr\u00e4u-Festzelt tent, \"an entire field of hops is used to decorate,\" The Local says.", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Munich kicked off this year&#039;s Oktoberfest Saturday, beginning festivities in which the city expects to host 6 million visitors.
