Washburn signed a reservation proclamation quadrupling the tribe\u2019s land into trust.\n\nOn December 22 Washburn announced that approximately 292 acres of trust land in the city of Payson, Gila County, Arizona belonging to the tribe would be added to the tribe\u2019s existing reservation under the authority of the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984: 25 U.S.C. 467).\n\n\u201cI am pleased to exercise the authority delegated to me by the Secretary of the Interior and to issue this reservation proclamation, which quadruples the size of the Tonto Apache Tribe\u2019s reservation,\u201d Washburn said in a release following the announcement. \u201cRestoring tribal homelands is one of President Obama\u2019s highest priorities. Consistent with this priority, the Tonto Apache Tribe hopes to develop the new reservation land into homes for tribal members.\u201d\n\nThe Tonto Apache Reservation previously consisted of 85 acres and now encompasses more than 375 acres of land. The original 85-acre reservation on the outskirts of Payson was given to the tribe in 1972.
