Hired as a research analyst in 2003, she quickly earned the moniker \u201cdata guru\u201d for her ability to sift though information to come up with recommendations.\n\n\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not that hard of a thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s looking at utilization trends. It really was just a matter of doing basic trend analysis and seeing what\u2019s going on over time.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of her first projects was figuring out how to pool the existing data and create a feedback mechanism to drive decision-making.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe operated in a risk-based environment\u2014kind of like an insurance company\u2014getting money per day. I was able to build a financial risk management system within Choices. It stabilized us financially. Instead of taking huge losses and huge gains, we became more predictable.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe also wanted front-line staff to know how they were affecting the organization, so she created what she calls the CEO Report, with a dashboard for each of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are each like CEOs of $400,000 companies,\u201d Van Deman said. \u201cThe dashboard helps them track where the money is going, how much is going there, and, is there anything better they could be doing?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe economic downturn, she said, \u201cfelt like one letdown after another.\u201d Making up for the loss of key contracts (representing 62 percent of 2011 revenue) meant staff reductions, frozen salaries and benefit changes.\n\n\n\n\u201cFortunately, in 2012, fortunes started to turn. Choices doubled both its revenue and its staff. The Affordable Care Act brings so much opportunity for organizations like Choices. It\u2019s really an exciting time.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen she joined Choices, it had an Indiana focus, having opened just one replication site in Cincinnati. Since then, it has expanded to Maryland; Washington, D.C.; Louisiana; and soon, Illinois.\n\n\n\nChoices, she said, is less concerned with geography and more with alignment.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we are looking for are communities ready to serve kids and families in a different way. If the business is there and the funding mechanism is there to support it, that\u2019s where we look. Whether a youth is served in Indiana or Maryland, the experience should be the same.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhere it differs, she said, is behind the scenes\u2014at the system level. That means \u201cwho is giving us the money, how the money is getting to us, if we are at risk. The front-line staff doesn\u2019t\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014know the difference.\u201d\n\n\n\nChoices is in a unique position in that all its contracts come from government.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice not to have a donor base,\u201d Van Deman said. \u201cI\u2019ve been on not-for-profit boards and it seems like all of the attention is focused on, \u2018How do we get more dollars?\u2019 Ours is, \u2018How do we use this to better serve?\u2019\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to Shannon Van Deman, Choices Inc. has its strongest balance sheet in its 16-year history.", "csrf-token": "Jj2uo/fOhVktDmSMu6RT102RsrEvkRZ2NiPO0JU/t+4=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/IBJ-Print2/2013/cfo-2013/mobile/vandeman-shannon.jpg?1385584903", "description": "Thanks to Shannon Van Deman, Choices Inc. has its strongest balance sheet in its 16-year history.", "card": "summary", "title": "2013 CFO OF THE YEAR: Shannon Van Deman"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "Thanks to Shannon Van Deman, Choices Inc. has its strongest balance sheet in its 16-year history.", "title": "2013 CFO OF THE YEAR: Shannon Van Deman"}, "keywords": "cfo of the year", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a46\"", "article_summary": "And thanks to Shannon Van Deman, the not-for-profit has its strongest balance sheet in its 16-year history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice not to have a donor base,\u201d Van Deman said.\n\u201cThey are each like CEOs of $400,000 companies,\u201d Van Deman said.\nThat means \u201cwho is giving us the money, how the money is getting to us, if we are at risk.\nThe front-line staff doesn\u2019t\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014know the difference.\u201dChoices is in a unique position in that all its contracts come from government."}
