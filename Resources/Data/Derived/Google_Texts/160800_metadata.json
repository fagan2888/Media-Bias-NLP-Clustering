Unfortunately, what we\u2019re seeing right now is a failure to invest in education, infrastructure, research and national defense. All the things that we need to grow, need to create jobs, to stay at the forefront of innovation and to keep our country safe. \u201cIt\u2019s not a budget that reflects the future. It\u2019s not a budget that reflects growth. It\u2019s not a budget that is going to help ensure that middle-class families are able to maintain security and stability and that people who are trying to get into the middle class are going to have the rungs on the ladder to get into the middle class.\n\nThe president was so easily able to rip apart the Republican budget proposal, because it is the same tired ideas that they have been pushing for years. The Republican budget would lower taxes for people at the top while gutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The budget is also based on the myth that Republicans will be able to repeal Obamacare. There is not a single forward thinking idea in the Republican budget.\n\nThe Republican budget was more of the same old stuff that is never going to see the light of day. It is an ideological wish list. A fantasy that is not based on the reality of what the country needs in order to move forward. The Republican budget is a broken record that is loaded with fatal scratches.\n\nIt is not surprising that President Obama was able to take it apart so quickly. This budget is a failure. It is a failure in every way that the president described and dozens more. It is a betrayal of our veterans. It is a betrayal of the poor. This budget crushes the American dream and destroys any hope of upward mobility.\n\nThe Republican budget is a Koch dream that President Obama quickly shocked back to reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It took President Obama less than a minute to destroy the Republican budget proposal by pointing out the many failures of the conservative financial fantasy blueprint.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "It took President Obama less than a minute to destroy the Republican budget proposal by pointing out the many failures of the conservative financial fantasy blueprint.", "title": "President Obama Amazingly Obliterates The Republican Budget In Less Than 60 Seconds", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/03/17/president-obama-needed-60-seconds-amazingly-obliterate-republican-budget.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama-gop-budget.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-17T17:14:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,Obama,obama blasts Republican budget,obama obliterates Republican budget,republican budget,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-03-17T17:12:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T17:14:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obama, obama blasts Republican budget, obama obliterates Republican budget, republican budget"}, "article_summary": "The Republican budget is a Koch dream that President Obama quickly shocked back to reality.\nIt took President Obama less than a minute to destroy the Republican budget proposal by pointing out the many failures of the conservative financial fantasy blueprint.\nThe Republican budget is a broken record that is loaded with fatal scratches.\nThe Republican budget was more of the same old stuff that is never going to see the light of day.\nThe Republican budget would lower taxes for people at the top while gutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid."}
