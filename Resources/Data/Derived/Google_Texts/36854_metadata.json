Neither police official knew whether they were traveling together.\n\nNo further details about the accident were available.\n\nMattingly said southbound I-65 was closed and that traffic was backed up for about six miles, from the site of the accident to exit 91. The Kentucky Transportation Department had been notified, he said, and drivers were diverted to exits 86 and 91. One lane of southbound I-65 was reopened about 8:30 p.m.\n\nReporter Kirsten Clark can be reached at (502) 582-4144 or on Twitter by following @kirstenlmclark.
