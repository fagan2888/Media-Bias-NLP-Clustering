Susana Martinez to farmers, chefs and hot-pepper aficionados professing their love for all things green chile. They\u2019re quick to argue that the quality of New Mexico\u2019s signature crop is unmatched.\n\nThe attention highlights a growing demand for the New Mexico-grown hot peppers, even as the number of acres planted and harvested each year has shrunk.\n\nLabor costs, international competition and concerns over long-term water supplies \u2014 in a region that\u2019s no stranger to drought \u2014 have worked against chile producers in the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for our farmers to compete cost-wise,\u201d and that reality poses a threat to the state\u2019s commercial chile industry, said Jaye Hawkins, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association. \u201cIf we can\u2019t compete, eventually, we\u2019re going to lose it despite the demand.\u201d\n\nIt has been years since salsa dethroned ketchup as the nation\u2019s favorite condiment, and the use of peppers in the U.S. has been on an upward trajectory, now topping 2.3 billion pounds annually. New Mexico has a share of that market, supplying fresh and dried chilies to restaurants and major spice companies, but domestic supply hasn\u2019t kept up with demand.\n\nIn the grip of a drought, most New Mexico farmers have been forced to rely on well water to irrigate their crops as flows in the Rio Grande have receded to record lows. With more pumping in the Hatch and Mesilla valleys, some farmers have seen their aquifers drop and the water grow more and more salty. And chile plants can be sensitive to the salt.\n\nStill, experts say the shrinking of the industry can\u2019t be blamed solely on drought.\n\nHawkins pointed to worker shortages, cheaper labor in Mexico and less restrictive environmental regulations in other countries as prohibitive factors.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New Mexico\u2019s green chile harvest in full swing", "title": "New Mexico\u2019s green chile harvest in full swing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/12/new-mexicos-green-chile-harvest-in-full-swing/", "image": {"width": 422, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140913__4fd5c20ba0ad41235f0f6a706700d178p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140913__4fd5c20ba0ad41235f0f6a706700d178p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-12T18:46:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:59:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Susana Martinez to farmers, chefs and hot-pepper aficionados professing their love for all things green chile.\nLOS LUNAS, N.M. \u2014 The sweet aroma of roasted peppers is wafting throughout New Mexico, signaling that fall is around the corner and the green chile harvest is in full swing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for our farmers to compete cost-wise,\u201d and that reality poses a threat to the state\u2019s commercial chile industry, said Jaye Hawkins, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association.\nStill, experts say the shrinking of the industry can\u2019t be blamed solely on drought.\nHawkins pointed to worker shortages, cheaper labor in Mexico and less restrictive environmental regulations in other countries as prohibitive factors."}
