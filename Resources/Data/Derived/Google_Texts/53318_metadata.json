Shelton said the 1,800 students from the four local schools evacuated during the fire also returned for a two-hour day on Friday.\n\nShe said emergency personnel remain in the area, and all residents returning to their homes are advised to use caution.\n\nFire fighters from Hickman, Maury and other surrounding counties spent the day battling the blaze at the site on 8526 Plant Road, known locally as the former Wrigley Charcoal Plant site. Clouds of smoke from the fire could be seen more than 30 miles away in Columbia.\n\nDocumentation of the Wrigley Charcoal Plant site on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s web site revealed \u201cTDEC has issued several notices to the recycling facility\u201d operating at the location. The site describes the Industiral Plastics Recycling facility where the fired occurred as \u201ca small-scale recycling facility, (that) conducts metals and plastics recycling, storage of waste products, and other related activities.\u201d\n\nThe site was placed on the EPA\u2019s National Priorities List in 1989 because of \u201ccontaminated debris, ground water and soil resulting from facility operation\u201d and has since been under EPA monitoring. The EPA asked the owners of the plastic recycling facility to remove hazardous materials in December 1998 and noted a month later the area had not been cleaned.\n\nIn February 1999, the EPA made another site visit. Officials noticed more hazardous materials were being stored on the site, and areas previously in violation were \u201cin worse condition\u201d than before.\n\nThe EPA took various soil and water samples of the area from 2009 to 2011, including from wells in the Clark Hollow area, and proposed a new clean-up plan for the site in 2012.\n\nThe facility where the fire broke out only covers a portion of the former Wrigley Charcoal Plant site, according to the EPA. The remainder of the land includes an athletic field owned by Hickman County Parks and Recreation Department, an unused storage basin and irrigation field as well as the residential community of Clark Hollow.\n\nAccording to the EPA website, the Superfund site was home to various industrial operations, including iron, charcoal and wood distillation product manufacturing, beginning in 1880. Contaminants of concern at the site include wood tar chemicals, metals and volatile organic compounds.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is monitoring air quality in the area.\n\nState Fire Marshal\u2019s office spokeswoman Kate Abernathy said investigators there have not yet determined what caused the fire. She said the fire appears to be accidental, but investigators are still taking statements from the workers.\n\nThe Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration also is investigating potential worker safety hazards.\n\nIndustrial Plastics Co. official Pat Nicks, reached by telephone, declined to comment on the situation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NASHVILLE \u2014 A large industrial fire at a federal Superfund site in central Tennessee has been put out and an evacuation order that affected at least 400 people has been lifted.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "From Staff and Wire Reports", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "NASHVILLE \u2014 A large industrial fire at a federal Superfund site in central Tennessee has been put out and an evacuation order that affected at least 400 people has been lifted.", "title": "Hickman County residents return after industrial fire", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/hickman-county-residents-return-after-industrial-fire", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_Lyles-Plant-Fire-Smoke-from-Mt-Pleasant_swt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/hickman-county-residents-return-after-industrial-fire", "title": "Hickman County residents return after industrial fire", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=732684", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=732684", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-21T22:02:35-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3c5\"", "article_summary": "Kim Shelton with the Hickman County Mayor\u2019s office said the last of between 400 and 500 displaced residents were able to return to their homes Friday following an evacuation of all residences within a four-mile radius of the Industrial Plastics Recycling plant fire.\nIndustrial Plastics Co. official Pat Nicks, reached by telephone, declined to comment on the situation.\nFire fighters from Hickman, Maury and other surrounding counties spent the day battling the blaze at the site on 8526 Plant Road, known locally as the former Wrigley Charcoal Plant site.\nThe facility where the fire broke out only covers a portion of the former Wrigley Charcoal Plant site, according to the EPA.\nDocumentation of the Wrigley Charcoal Plant site on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s web site revealed \u201cTDEC has issued several notices to the recycling facility\u201d operating at the location."}
