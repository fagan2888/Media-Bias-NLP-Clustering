It\u2019s about odds. The poll that was the subject of that radio program showed the former Newark mayor leading Bell 51-40 among likely voters.\n\n\n\nBut if you\u2019re a betting man, it\u2019s not a good idea to bet against the 70-year-old Bell. The guy has made a habit of running races under the radar. In 1978, the then-34-year-old Bell came out of nowhere to oust incumbent Clifford Case in a low-turnout Republican primary. He then lost the general election to Bill Bradley, who began a Democratic winning streak in Senate races that has continued to this day.\n\nBell pulled off another shocker in this year\u2019s GOP primary. He didn\u2019t even bother to attend the party\u2019s county nominating conventions. Instead he relied on a single mailing sent out to likely GOP primary voters. That was enough for him to pick up the win with a mere 29 percent of the vote in a four-way race.\n\nDue to a lack of campaign cash, Bell hasn\u2019t made much of an impression so far on potential voters in the general election. Two-thirds of those polled didn\u2019t know enough about him to form an opinion.\n\nThat would seem to permit Booker to coast to victory, as he did last year in that special election to fill the unexpired term of the late Frank Lautenberg. And he appears to be doing just that. Booker\u2019s been appearing mainly at venues packed with loyal Democrats.\n\nSuch an event was the New Jersey Black Issues Convention Thursday in New Brunswick. When he gets up a head of steam, Booker is every bit as charismatic a speaker as that other nationally known New Jersey pol who\u2019s also rumored to have presidential ambitions.\n\nThe first subject Booker brought up in his 35-minute speech was America\u2019s habit of imprisoning a big portion of its population.\n\n\u201cThe chilling reality is that America has 4 to five percent of the world\u2019s population but we have 25 percent of the world\u2019s imprisoned population,\u201d Booker said.\n\nHe went on to note that 70 percent of them are imprisoned for nonviolent crimes and that blacks are much more likely to be in that group.\n\n\u201cWhen I was at Stanford, I saw guys with bags of marijuana,\u201d he said. \u201cWere they getting raided by the police? Of course not. But kids in Newark and Paterson and Passaic are.\u201d\n\nBooker then toldl how he is reaching across the aisle to Republican Rand Paul to change that approach. He and the Kentucky senator are putting together a package to permit young people to resume their place in society after convictions, Booker said.\n\nIt was an impressive spiel and it earned him a standing ovation. But most voters won\u2019t be hearing it. Booker has agreed to only one debate with Bell and is keeping a low profile.\n\nThat worked last year in the race against former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan. But\n\nLonegan\u2019s no-holds-barred attacks on Booker\u2019s record as Newark mayor helped drive up his negatives. They were at 26 percent in that poll. As for Bell, he barely had any negatives \u2013 or positives.\n\nWhen I got him on the phone, Bell told me he was nostalgic for the days when he was against Bradley. \u201cI debated him 21 times\u201d \u2013 once for every county, he said.\n\nAs for Booker, \u201cI would think he would also want to prove he\u2019s a good debater by opening himself up to scrutiny,\u201d said Bell. \u201cBut I guess he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant.\u201d\n\nIf so, that\u2019s a loss for the voting public \u2013 and perhaps for Booker as well. This election could be shaping up as a referendum on President Obama. If Bell has any chance at all, it\u2019s that an anti-Obama groundswell combines with a low turnout to make the race competitive.\n\nWhen I got Mickey Carroll on the phone, he said those factors are not likely to matter much. The numbers show there are unlikely to be any surprises on the night of Nov. 4, he predicted.\n\nSo that\u2019s bad news for Bell. As for the good news, Mickey said that if Booker loses he\u2019ll invite me to the hara-kiri ceremony \u2013 assuming of course Mike doesn\u2019t hide the knives.\n\nADD: In this post on the primary election, I noted that Bell won but fell below what I termed \"the Byrne line\" - the 30 percent total Brendan Byrne got in the 1981 Democratic when he beat a crowded field to win a chance to run for re-election as governor.\n\nIn that piece, I noted I'd won a six-pack betting with Monmouth University pollster Pat Murray on that race (one I still haven't collected, by the way.)\n\nIf anyone wants to be on the Bell-Booker race, I hereby propose a wager. It's based on what I'll call \"the Kyrillos Line.\" That would be the 19-point margin by which state Sen. Joe Kyrillos lost to incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez in the 2012 U.S. Senate race.\n\nThat was an amazingly bad result when you consider that the Monmouth County state senator was the handpicked choice of Chris Christie and that he had the full backing of the state Republican establishment.\n\nMenendez has a rather checkered history as a Hudson County pol. Yet Kyrillos failed to capitalize on those negatives. He ran a campaign so lackluster that it barely made news.\n\nMaybe that's why Christie stayed out of this year's nominating process. Anyway, is there anyone out there who wants to bet Bell will fall below the Kyrillos Line? If so, I'll take your money - or beer as the case may be.\n\n\n\nALSO: Check George Will's piece on Bell here:\n\nBooker, who is ignoring Bell, just as Case did, has a better r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (Stanford, Oxford, Yale Law School) than reputation. His liberalism is as conventional as his eccentricity is disturbing. He is a fabulist (he has been called \u201cthe Garden State\u2019s Mother Goose\u201d) given to asserting as facts various self-aggrandizing figments of his imagination (e.g., T-Bone, a nonexistent Newark drug dealer, with whom Booker has had, he says, instructive interactions). Worst of all, Booker is perfectly suited to today\u2019s Senate. Flitting like a waterbug on the surface of things, he seizes fleeting headlines as excuses for wielding the federal government in opportunistic grandstanding. His crusade du jour would increase taxes on professional sports leagues in order to spend $100 million on domestic violence prevention.\n\nPLUS, you can read this column on Mickey Carroll's excellent book on Jack Ruby and the Kennedy assassination.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "columns, cory-booker, paul-mulshine, opinion", "title": "Stealth Senate race: Cory Booker vs. Jeff Bell equals hare vs. tortoise  (Mulshine)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Stealth Senate race: Cory Booker vs. Jeff Bell equals hare vs. tortoise  (Mulshine)\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/10/cory_booker_vs_jeff_bell_equals_hare_vs_tortoise_mulshine.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/05/15073603-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14100419\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-05T12:37:44Z\", \"author\": \"Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"columns\",\"cory-booker\",\"paul-mulshine\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/05/15073603-standard.jpg", "creator": "@Mulshine", "description": "Senator Cory Booker is sitting on a lead in the polls  against a candidate who's had a history of running under the radar", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, October 05, 2014, 10:14 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/05/jbell3jpg-3e5bb5c6efa963af.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"pmulshin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"2371\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Opinion\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Senator Cory Booker is sitting on a lead in the polls  against a candidate who's had a history of running under the radar", "title": "Stealth Senate race: Cory Booker vs. Jeff Bell equals hare vs. tortoise  (Mulshine)", "url": "http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/10/cory_booker_vs_jeff_bell_equals_hare_vs_tortoise_mulshine.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/05/15073603-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.mulshine"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, October 05, 2014,  8:36 AM", "article_author": "Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger", "Description": "Senator Cory Booker is sitting on a lead in the polls  against a candidate who's had a history of running under the radar"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd962a\"", "article_summary": "That would be the 19-point margin by which state Sen.
