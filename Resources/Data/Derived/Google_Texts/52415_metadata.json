One Ku Klux Klan organizer really likes the group because he gets to \u201cwear robes\u201d and \u201chave secret handshakes.\u201d\n\nJohn Abarr, a kleagle, or organizer, for the United Klans of America in Great Falls, Mont., met with Jimmy Simmons, president of Casper, Wyo., branch of the NAACP on Saturday last week. The meeting was extremely unprecedented and marked by heavy security for both groups, according to the Casper Star-Tribune. During the peaceful discussion, Abarr talked about why he likes the group.\n\n\u201cI like it because you wear robes, and get out and light crosses, and have secret handshakes,\u201d he said. \u201cI like being in the Klan \u2014 I sort of like it that people think I\u2019m some sort of outlaw.\u201d\n\nAbarr also pointed out that he is a member of anti-racism groups such as American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center. And after his meeting with Simmons, he is also a member of the NAACP. He signed the paperwork and donated $20 on top of the $30 membership fee.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Simmons said. He gave the KKK member a receipt.\n\nThe two men and some of their associates were meeting following reports of assaults on black men in the town of Gillette, Wyo. Klan pamphlets had also been distributed in the area. Simmons reached out to the KKK to arrange the discussion, during which Abarr condemned the attacks. The kleagle argued that the hate crimes were committed by rogue groups not associated with the Klan, according to the Star-Tribune\u2018s account of the meeting. But the NAACP men weren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t know the history of your organization,\u201d the NAACP\u2019s Mel Hamilton told Abarr. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to me that you\u2019re not going out and talking about the good \u2014 you\u2019re not talking about inclusion, you\u2019re talking about exclusion. And it\u2019s obvious to me you don\u2019t know what you are.\u201d\n\nBut Abarr worried that he would be excluded from his own group following the meeting with the NAACP.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to call me names for coming down here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I might not even have a group when I get back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Forget about white supremacy.
