DOC: Inmate Caught In Colorado Springs After Walking Away From Denver Work Site

Dozens of flash bangs could be heard in a southeast Springs neighborhood as several law enforcement agencies tried to draw Department of Corrections inmate Adolfo Lopez out of a home.

The standoff last for several hours before Lopez, 38, was finally taken into custody at 10:30 Friday night.

Lopez and a second Corrections inmate, Manuel Rodriguez, reportedly walked away from a Denver work site Thursday. Rodriguez was caught in Colorado Springs without incident on the same day. But Lopez's whereabouts were still unknown.

That changed Friday evening, when a parole office received word that Lopez was holed up in a home near Delta and Hancock. The office contacted Springs police, who then went to the home in question. The situation immediately turned into a standoff when Lopez refused to surrender. El Paso County sheriff's deputies and SWAT came to assist Springs officers, and for more than four hours authorities attempted to draw him out. Two robot were sent into the home, and neighbors reported hearing at least 40 flash bangs.

The fugitive finally surrendered, and was taken back to the DOC.
