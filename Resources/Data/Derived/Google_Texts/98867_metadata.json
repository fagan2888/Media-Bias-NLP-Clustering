But shortly after the House vote, Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND), the bill\u2019s sponsor, threatened to attach the Keystone bill as a rider to must-pass legislation if Obama goes through with his promised veto.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama now has 10 days to sign or veto this bill,\u201d Hoeven said in a statement. \u201cIf he vetoes it, we will continue to press for approval by attaching an approval measure to another bill, perhaps an energy bill or must-pass appropriations legislation. He needs to work with Congress in a bipartisan way and approve the Keystone XL pipeline project for the American people.\u201d\n\nThe White House responded the next day, reiterating that Obama will veto the bill and indicating that plans are in place to deal with the kind of \u201clegislative maneuvering\u201d that Hoeven has promised.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the approval process for this pipeline is one that predates this administration, and is hubbed at the State Department. We're going to let that process unfold,\u201d Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said, referring to an ongoing review of the pipeline proposal by the State Department. \u201cThe President has announced that he would oppose and veto any legislative maneuvering to circumvent that process. So he will indeed be vetoing it. But again, I don't even think they\u2019ve sent the bill over or even announced when the bill would come over.\u201d\n\nThe pipeline is a Canadian-owned project that would carry up to 830,000 barrels a day of bituminous crude oil more than 1,700 miles from the Alberta oil sands through Indian country and American states to refineries in Texas, then on to Gulf Coast ports for shipping to world markets.\n\nThe proposed project has divided Republicans and Democrats for the six years the issue has been before Congress. With the new Republican majority, the House easily passed the Keystone bill in a 270-152 vote with support from 29 Democrats. The Senate approved the bill by a vote of 62\u201336 with support from nine Democrats on January 28. Both the House and Senate votes fell short of the 67 required to overcome a presidential veto.\n\nRelated: Senate Passes Keystone; Obama Promised Veto\n\nThe strategy of attaching a bill as a rider to another bill that is sure to pass is all too familiar to Indian country. In December, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) attached the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act of 2013 to the annual must-pass National Defense Authorization Act, which passed in the Senate by a vote of 89-11 on December 11 and signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 19. The bill gave 2,400 acres of the San Carlos Apache Tribe\u2019s sacred site to a subsidiary of the international mining giant Resolution Copper to excavate the biggest copper mine in the country. Arizona lawmakers had tried unsuccessfully for a decade to pass the unpopular land giveaway but tribal nations and environmentalists vigorously opposed it.\n\nRELATED: San Carlos Apache Leader: \u2018What Was a Struggle to Protect Our Most Sacred Site Is Now a Battle\u2019\n\nThe controversial Keystone XL pipeline is also despised by tribal nations, environmentalists, ranchers and others who have argued for years that the pipeline would cause pollution, contribute to climate change, and could permanently destroy water sources along the way.\n\nBut Republicans have framed Keystone as a jobs bill that will bring prosperity to the nation and will not affect the environment or contribute to global climate change despite a recent statement from the Environmental Protection Agency that developing Keystone XL\u2019s oil sands crude would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.\n\nRELATED: Republicans Call for \u2018Keystone Jobs Bill\u2019 Support as TransCanada Files for Land Grab in NE\n\nRELATED: EPA: Keystone XL\u2019s Oil Sands Crude Would \u2018Significantly Increase\u2019 Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nRep. Ken Calvert (R-CA) touted Keystone\u2019s benefits during the House floor debate.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama's opposition to the Keystone pipeline and all of its economic benefits shows just how out of touch he is with middle class working families,\u201d Calvert said. \u201cThe State Department studied the environmental impacts of the Keystone XL pipeline and concluded that it would not have a negative impact. Furthermore, the State Department found that the Keystone XL pipeline project would support roughly 42,000 jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we go again!\u201d Rep. Alma Adams (D-NC) retorted. She was one of several Democrats who took to the House floor to dispute Republican claims about the benefits of the pipeline. \u201cFor the 11th time, House Republicans are falsely promoting the idea that Keystone will improve the economy,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey say Keystone will create 42,000 jobs. False! Keystone will create 35 permanent jobs. Republicans say the pipeline will guarantee U.S. energy independence. False! There is no concrete assurance that oil produced by the pipeline will remain in the U.S. Along with these economic shortcomings, U.S. taxpayers will bear 100 percent of the risk if a catastrophic spill occurs. With no real impact on job creation or energy security, this bill is a losing deal for everyone except the foreign company, TransCanada.\u201d\n\nPoking fun at Republicans who have long been climate change deniers, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR) congratulated Republicans for passing the bill because it includes an acknowledgment that climate change is real. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) presented the acknowledgment in a two-part amendment during the Senate\u2019s Keystone debate, but Republicans turned down the second part \u2013 acknowledging that climate change is caused by human activity.\n\n\u201cBy voting for this bill today, you are going to endorse language saying that climate change is real and not a hoax. I think that is tremendous progress for the Republican side of the aisle, who I expect will be supporting this bill to accept the reality of climate change,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cI am thrilled that that is in there, and their votes will be reflected in the [Congressional] Record as endorsing that language.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans threatened to attach the Keystone XL pipeline bill as a rider to must-pass legislation if President Obama vetoes.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/14/republicans-threaten-keystone-rider-must-pass-legislation-if-obama-vetoes-159200", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/keystone_protest_sign-ap_photonati_harnik-file.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Republicans Threaten Keystone Rider to Must-Pass Legislation If Obama Vetoes"}, "abstract": "Republicans threatened to attach the Keystone XL pipeline bill as a rider to must-pass legislation if President Obama vetoes.", "dc": {"title": "Republicans Threaten Keystone Rider to Must-Pass Legislation If Obama Vetoes"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/14/republicans-threaten-keystone-rider-must-pass-legislation-if-obama-vetoes-159200", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Keystone XL Pipeline, President Barack Obama, Sen.
