Hines said she wasn't running a puppy mill, but she rescued the dogs from a puppy mill.\n\nWhat happens if Hines can\u2019t get rid of all of the animals?\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t come to that point yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAnimal welfare did and took all 65 animals.\n\n9/14/15 Related Story: Animal Welfare Officers Rescue 65 Dogs From Norman Home\n\n\u201cIt was overwhelming,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I kept calling for rescue groups to come help me.\u201d\n\nSeven of them were her personal dogs which she wants back, but she was close to all of them.\n\n\u201cI slept with 14 dogs,\u201d Hines said.\n\nCity officials say a place is considered a puppy mill when someone doesn't have a kennel license and breeds animals. Four of the dogs were pregnant, but Roxanne says there was a pretty good reason why.\n\n\u201cThe females are coming in heat,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m having a hard time keeping him away.\u201d\n\nExcept for times like that, the more than five dozen dogs mostly stayed outside according to Hines.\n\n\u201cSome of them were back here, but like I said I left the back door open where they came in and out, in and out all day,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went into the kennels at night because of the coyotes. They had blankets, food and water at night.\u201d\n\nThey were taken care of she said even if at her expense.\n\n\u201cI basically went without,\u201d Hines said.\n\nPolice say they have turned charges over to the DA for consideration. There will be an adoption event for the adult dogs that will be announced at a later date, and the puppies have been fostered out until they are old enough to adopt.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Animal welfare officials remove 65 dogs from a Norman home and more than a week later, the woman who had them is telling her side of the story.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30112870/norman-woman-accused-of-running-puppy-mill-wants-dogs-back", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8875131_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Animal welfare officials remove 65 dogs from a Norman home and more than a week later, the woman who had them is telling her side of the story.", "title": "Norman Woman Accused Of Running Puppy Mill Wants Dogs Back"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8875131_G.jpg", "description": "Animal welfare officials remove 65 dogs from a Norman home and more than a week later, the woman who had them is telling her side of the story.", "card": "summary", "title": "Norman Woman Accused Of Running Puppy Mill Wants Dogs Back"}, "wnreadableurl": "norman-woman-accused-of-running-puppy-mill-wants-dogs-back", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/09/24", "KEYWORDS": "Animal Cruelty, Animal Welfare, Norman, dogs, rescue, Hines, adoption, okc, news 9, kwtv, puppy mill", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS17", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "Animal Cruelty, Animal Welfare, Norman, dogs, rescue, Hines, adoption, okc, news 9, kwtv, puppy mill"}, "article_summary": "For about the past year, she had 65 dogs in her home when an anonymous tip to the city put an end to it.\n9/14/15 Related Story: Animal Welfare Officers Rescue 65 Dogs From Norman Home\u201cIt was overwhelming,\u201d she said.\nAnimal welfare officials remove 65 dogs from a Norman home and more than a week later, the woman who had them is telling her side of the story.\nHines said she wasn't running a puppy mill, but she rescued the dogs from a puppy mill.\n\u201cI slept with 14 dogs,\u201d Hines said."}
