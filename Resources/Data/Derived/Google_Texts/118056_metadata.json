Queen Anne homes were typically built from 1885 to 1910.\n\n\u0095 Mission revival: Inspired by California's missions, this style became popularized after two railroad companies used it for their stations and hotels. This style is characterized by rounded arches, tiled roofs and a lack of ornamentation. Mission revival homes were common from 1890 to 1920.\n\n\u0095 American Foursquare: Often described as \"boxlike,\" the American Foursquare features overhanging eaves and exposed rafters and large porches. This style was popular from 1894 to 1910.\n\n\u0095 Prairie: A group of architects in the Chicago area, including Frank Lloyd Wright, developed this style. Prairie-style homes were popular in the Midwest. This style of architecture is characterized by wide eaves, large porches and geometric patterns. Prairie homes were common from 1900 to 1922.\n\n\u0095 Tudor revival: Medieval England inspired this style. Tudor revival buildings often have steep roofs, tall chimneys, stone or brick accents and arched windows. Tudor revival homes were popular from 1900 to 1942.\n\n\u0095 Craftsman bungalow: These homes became available to middle-class families through mail-order houses and were affordable and easy to construct. Wide windows and doors, brick and stone foundations, wood siding and porch piers are typical with craftsman homes. This style was common from 1902 to 1925.\n\n\u0095 Spanish Colonial revival: The creation of this type of architecture, like with mission revival, comes from the effort to restore California's missions and create a unique identity for the region. Some cities passed laws requiring new buildings to conform to this style. Spanish Colonial revival homes and buildings often have a stucco exterior, round or square towers and cupolas and red tiled roofs. This style was common from 1915 to 1942.\n\n\u0095 Art deco: Also knows as the Zig Zag Moderne, most buildings that use this style are commercial. After Long Beach's devastating 1933 earthquake, many buildings were rebuilt in the art deco style. Art deco architecture uses bronze, copper and other metals alongside glass, brick and terra-cotta and emphasizes vertical lines. This style was common from 1925 to 1941.", "article_metadata": {"content_section": "news", "description": "News: Preserving history | city, historic, long, beach, districts, building, buildings, working, craftsman, people", "author": "LAUREN WILLIAMS", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "From the turrets that cling to Queen Anne homes in Drake Park to the pillars lining the porches in Craftsman Village, much of Long Beach still reflects its early fabric.", "title": "Building on history", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/city-642180-historic-long.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nf1zy5-b88256683z.120141114155631000g4969pc1.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nf1zy5-b88256683z.120141114155631000g4969pc1.10.jpg"}, "description": "From the turrets that cling to Queen Anne homes in Drake Park to the pillars lining the porches in Craftsman Village, much of Long Beach still reflects its early fabric.", "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Building on history"}, "content_author": "LAUREN WILLIAMS", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/nf1zy5-b88256683z.120141114155631000g4969pc1.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "city, historic, long, beach, districts, building, buildings, working, craftsman, people", "publication_date": "2014-11-14", "access-type": "free", "section": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Building on history"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ffe\"", "article_summary": "Tudor revival homes were popular from 1900 to 1942.\nTudor revival buildings often have steep roofs, tall chimneys, stone or brick accents and arched windows.\nSpanish Colonial revival homes and buildings often have a stucco exterior, round or square towers and cupolas and red tiled roofs.\nMission revival homes were common from 1890 to 1920.\n\u0095 Tudor revival: Medieval England inspired this style."}
