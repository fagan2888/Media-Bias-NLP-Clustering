Mark Dayton rose to offer a toast during a dinner held in its honor. He humorously recalled attempting to try on an extra-large shirt from the menswear store in Minneapolis\u2019 North Loop, but not being able to button it.\n\nStill, he said, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more proud.\u201d\n\nThe governor was there lending his support not just as a political leader, but as a father \u2014 the store\u2019s two owners, Eric and Andrew Dayton, happen to be his sons.\n\nThe pair had invited a small group of journalists, business partners, family members and friends to mark the store\u2019s opening with a preview and a dinner in the second-floor event space of the brothers\u2019 Bachelor Farmer restaurant. Former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak was among the crowd. The current mayor, Betsy Hodges, stopped by earlier to make opening remarks, lauding Eric and Andrew for their contributions to the North Loop.\n\nThe show of support from local leaders was no happy accident. Through their renovation of disused old buildings, the Dayton brothers\u2019 businesses have helped revitalize a neighborhood and preserve some history in the process.\n\nA store, a bar, a restaurant\n\nRyan and Rachel Damhof of Minneapolis checked out the Warby Parker selection.\n\nOver coffee at the Bachelor Farmer the following Sunday, Eric Dayton said that being a positive part of the community \u201cwas very much the motivation\u201d behind his retail and restaurant ventures. Before becoming an entrepreneur and small-business owner, Dayton had been busy finishing an MBA at Stanford University and campaigning with Andrew in support of their father\u2019s 2010 gubernatorial bid.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to Stanford I didn\u2019t know exactly what I wanted to do,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I knew I wanted to come back to Minneapolis and make some kind of contribution to the city.\u201d\n\nBy the time the former Marvel Rack Manufacturing building at 200 N. 1st St. became available for sale, Dayton said, \u201cit felt like the neighborhood had a lot of potential.\u201d In 2011, following an extensive renovation, Eric and Andrew opened their Swedish-inspired Bachelor Farmer, the speakeasy-styled Marvel Bar and Askov Finlayson, named for two northern Minnesota towns.\n\nThe trifecta garnered national press from Bon App\u00e9tit and Esquire, and last year Bachelor Farmer chef Paul Berglund was named a James Beard Award finalist.\n\nBut the Dayton brothers didn\u2019t stop there. In 2012 they purchased the adjacent building, the former Hennepin Hotel, where they planned to relocate Askov Finlayson and the offices for their newly established holding company, North Corp. (Last year Andrew moved to San Francisco to oversee production of Askov Finlayson\u2019s clothing line, leaving Eric to take over day-to-day operations. Andrew has since taken a full-time job at the San Francisco mayor\u2019s office, although he continues to consult on the North businesses.)\n\nA grown-up clubhouse\n\nThree years later, those expansion plans have become reality. At 1,800 square feet, the new Askov Finlayson is nearly twice the size of the original store and includes a sleek showroom devoted to Warby Parker eyewear \u2014 the hip, Brooklyn-based brand\u2019s first retail outpost in the state.\n\nWith its forest-green walls, teak furnishings and brass fixtures alongside playful touches such as a bubble hockey table \u2014 a nod to the brothers\u2019 childhood days spent at the rink \u2014 the store evokes a grown-up clubhouse.\n\nAs with the original location, the merchandise is a thoughtful mix of durable yet tailored menswear, rugged footwear and outdoor gear, with a corner dedicated to small leather goods and apothecary items as well as an expanded selection of suiting. Near the entrance is a selection of Askov Finlayson\u2019s in-house brand of pants, shorts and shirts and North logo stocking caps.\n\nIn addition to the new storefront and offices (on the building\u2019s second and third floors), a patio and green space were installed between the two buildings \u2014 formerly a crumbling, blacktop-covered alley. A new sliding-glass door opens up to the patio, which will be home to a retrofitted Airstream trailer serving beer, wine and snacks next summer.\n\nMeanwhile, construction is underway to transform the former Askov Finlayson storefront into a cafe operated by the Bachelor Farmer and Marvel Bar this fall.\n\nCharitable works\n\nThe Daytons\u2019 civic contributions go beyond refashioning old buildings into North Loop hot spots. For the past two years, they\u2019ve participated in the Minnesota Keystone Program, donating 5 percent of their businesses\u2019 pretax earnings to community groups including the Northside Achievement Zone and Land Stewardship Project. In 2012, the Bachelor Farmer helped raise money to plant trees in the North Loop, and all of the proceeds from its recent Kr\u00e4ftskiva block party were donated to the Mississippi River Fund. Chef Berglund also serves on the board of directors of the Sustainable Farming Association, and Eric Dayton is on boards for the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\n\u201cGiving back to the community has been part of our company\u2019s DNA since the beginning,\u201d Eric Dayton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been very proud to be from Minneapolis, and we want to be a part of seeing it continue to grow and evolve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The newly expanded Askov Finlayson is part of a commitment to the hip Minneapolis neighborhood.", "title": "Minneapolis menswear store Askov Finlayson grows with North Loop", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-menswear-store-askov-finlayson-grows-with-north-loop/321880891/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143956831057005.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143956831057005.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The newly expanded Askov Finlayson is part of a commitment to the hip Minneapolis neighborhood.", "title": "Minneapolis menswear store Askov Finlayson grows with North Loop", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-menswear-store-askov-finlayson-grows-with-north-loop/321880891/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143956831057005.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143956831057005.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The newly expanded Askov Finlayson is part of a commitment to the hip Minneapolis neighborhood."}, "article_summary": "He humorously recalled attempting to try on an extra-large shirt from the menswear store in Minneapolis\u2019 North Loop, but not being able to button it.\nMeanwhile, construction is underway to transform the former Askov Finlayson storefront into a cafe operated by the Bachelor Farmer and Marvel Bar this fall.\n\u201cGiving back to the community has been part of our company\u2019s DNA since the beginning,\u201d Eric Dayton said.\nThe trifecta garnered national press from Bon App\u00e9tit and Esquire, and last year Bachelor Farmer chef Paul Berglund was named a James Beard Award finalist.\nThe current mayor, Betsy Hodges, stopped by earlier to make opening remarks, lauding Eric and Andrew for their contributions to the North Loop."}
