A man was accidentally shot by his friend Saturday at a gun show at the Arizona State Fairgrounds.

Arizona Department of Public Safety detectives say that just after 11 a.m., there was an accidental discharge of a semi-automatic handgun.

A gun buyer had apparently been inspecting his recently-purchased handgun, when the weapon accidentally discharged, and the man's companion was shot.

The bullet struck the male victim in the upper left torso and then exited from his upper right torso. The male victim suffered a non-life-threatening injury and was transported to a local hospital.

The fairgrounds is the scene this weekend of Crossroads of the West gunshow.

DPS says the investigation is on-going. There's no word yet on whether any criminal charges will be filed.
