He was a four-year starter and a first-team Ohio Valley Conference selection as a senior last year. He was initially signed by Kansas City in May as a college free agent before being released a week later.\n\nAfter wide receiver Kyle Williams ruptured his Achilles\u2019 tendon Saturday, the Broncos had yet another gap to fill. They worked out rookie Nigel King, but elected not to sign him, according to an NFL source.\n\nKing, a 6-foot-3, 210-pound rookie out of Kansas, had 30 receptions for 537 yards and one touchdown as a redshirt junior for the Jayhawks last season. He signed with the Miami Dolphins in May and competed in mini camp and organized team activities before being waived on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "connor rains,Denver Broncos,Injuries,nigel king", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The Broncos announced Sunday that they signed offensive tackle Charles Sweeton and waived injured tackle Connor Rains.", "title": "Broncos sign rookie tackle Charles Sweeton, waive injured Connor Rains", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/08/02/broncos-sign-rookie-tackle-charles-sweeton-waive-injured-connor-rains/34743/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/08/482539924-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Broncos announced Sunday that they signed offensive tackle Charles Sweeton and waived injured tackle Connor Rains.", "title": "Broncos sign rookie tackle Charles Sweeton, waive injured Connor Rains", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/08/02/broncos-sign-rookie-tackle-charles-sweeton-waive-injured-connor-rains/34743/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/08/482539924-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@cameronwolfe", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Broncos announced Sunday that they signed offensive tackle Charles Sweeton and waived injured tackle Connor Rains."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe198f\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos announced Sunday that they signed rookie offensive tackle Charles Sweeton and waived injured tackle Connor Rains.\nRains, a college free agent out of Wyoming, hurt his foot during Friday\u2019s training camp practice and was placed on the waived/injured list.\nHe was initially signed by Kansas City in May as a college free agent before being released a week later.\nThey worked out rookie Nigel King, but elected not to sign him, according to an NFL source.\nHe signed with the Miami Dolphins in May and competed in mini camp and organized team activities before being waived on Monday."}
