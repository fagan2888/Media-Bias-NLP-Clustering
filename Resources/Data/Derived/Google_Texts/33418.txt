Temperatures across New Jersey are smashing records today as the mercury passes 70 over much of the state.

Officially one day into winter, Newark was 70 degrees around 10:30 a.m., far surpassing the previous high of 65 set in 1998, according to Paul Walker, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather.

“It’s crazy warm,” said Walker.

By 7 a.m., New Brunswick had already beaten its previous record of 65, set in 1998. And Jersey City is nearly 10 degrees above its 1949 record of 60.

Temperatures in Central Jersey were expected to be the highest today, reaching 72 over much of the region, Walker said. The rest of the state will top out in the high 60s or low 70s — by comparison, normal high temperatures hover in the low- to mid-40s this time of year.

Much of the state will surpass its daily record high today, and some individual cities could log the hottest day on record for a December. But there’s one record that seems likely to stand — the highest temperature in the state recorded in December was taken in Belleplain State Forest in Cape May County on Dec. 7, 1998, when the high was 78 degrees.

The temperatures had reached their peak by mid-morning because unlike in summer, the unseasonable warmth has little to do with the sun. A storm that developed in Texas and made its way up to the Great Lakes is pushing a mass of hot, muggy air, which is now over the Northeast.

Following behind the hot air is that storm, which will arrive today in the form of spotty showers before building to a consistent rain after midnight, Walker said.

With the rain comes a cold front, which will spoil the fun for any New Jerseyans dreaming of a shorts-and-sandals Christmas.

“It's gonna be some 40 degrees colder on Christmas,” with temperatures hovering around freezing, Walker said. “This warmth is a very temporary thing.”
