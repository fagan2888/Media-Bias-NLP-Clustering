A central premise of Obamacare is that everybody should have access to healthcare regardless of income or personal circumstances. Individuals do not have to rely on others to gain access to a basic life necessity; the government supplies what they need. Individuals have both the autonomy that comes from being independent from other people and the security of the government-provided benefit.\n\nProgressives see this model of society as the inevitable result of the march of history. Society is gradually casting off the shackles of our unequal, un-free, poor, benighted, and generally terrible past, and is marching toward our equal and free and rational and prosperous future. Progressives see the Enlightenment and the Renaissance that preceded it as a particularly auspicious time in History, when society began to break down the tyranny of monarchs and unshackle the peasants. The kings came down, the middle class rose up, and History began moving much more quickly. America was at the vanguard of History when it was founded, and its founding documents, especially the Declaration, still contain the seeds of progress (even while the structures set in place by the founders are perhaps a bit anachronistic today).\n\nWhere progressives do not look for inspiration, typically, is to Christianity. They see Christianity\u2014and religion in general\u2014as a constricting, repressive tool of the powerful meant to entrench certain norms (heterosexuality, the nuclear family, monogamy, etc.) at the expense of people\u2019s expression of their individuality. Religion constrains the autonomy of individuals, and thus stands in the way of progress.\n\nAccording to Larry Siedentop\u2019s new book Inventing the Individual: The Origins of Western Liberalism (London: Allen Lane, 2014), the standard progressive understanding of Christianity is wrong. Progressives, Siedentop says, should look not to the Renaissance and Enlightenment for their roots but to the social revolution wrought by Christianity. It was Christians, and especially the Apostle Paul, who started the push for equality and individual liberty by undermining the hierarchies that characterized the ancient world and liberating the individual from the constraints imposed on him by society.\n\n***\n\nSiedentop begins his account of the rise of the liberal order, with its emphasis on liberty and equality, by examining the social structure of the ancient world. This world was characterized by a rigid hierarchy and the subjection of the individual to the community. At first, the family was central to the ancient world. The ancient city, or polis, evolved out of this family structure, Siedentop says. The polis displaced the family as the primary focus of individuals, but it retained the family\u2019s rigid hierarchy. The individual was nothing apart from the city. This was a rigid society that suppressed individual desires for the good of the community.\n\nAs the Roman Empire grew, however, people\u2019s loyalties shifted from the city to Rome, and the polis was displaced as the primary loyalty of the people. Sophists popped up using reason to prove anything. People turned inward and to more obscure sources of inspiration. A more cosmopolitan order displaced the polis\u2019 rigid hierarchy.\n\nOut of this changing landscape arose Christianity. Jesus preached a message that appealed not to the highest ranks of society but to the lowest. He offered a personal connection to God, and his resurrection showed that eternal life depended not on the family or city but could be attained by individuals apart from their social circumstances.\n\nThe Apostle Paul converted to Christianity in a sudden confrontation with Jesus in a vision. It was Paul who started to mold the egalitarian impulse in the fledgling Christian faith. Paul wrote that \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus,\u201d undermining the traditional social categories of the time. Instead of the demands of law, Paul focused on internal motivation. The condition of the heart mattered more than external conformity.\n\n\u201cPaul creates a new basis for human association,\u201d Siedentop writes, \u201ca voluntary basis\u2014joining humans through loving wills guided by an equal belief. In his eyes, the motivating power of love is the touch of divinity within each of us.\u201d All people have access to the shared capacity \u201cto think and choose, to will. That reality is our potential for understanding ourselves as autonomous agents, as truly the children of God.\u201d As a result, people of all classes are equal before God. They have access to \u201cthe deepest reality as individuals rather than merely as members of a group.\u201d\n\nSiedentop focuses the majority of his book on the period between Paul and the Renaissance, tracing how Christianity\u2019s egalitarian impulse manifested itself in various ways in Christian society. He examines how the ascetics and monks expressed their individual commitment to God by isolating themselves and then voluntarily joining communities. Augustine refined the notion of an individual will. The early church broke down social hierarchies by preaching the same message to all and allowing everyone to participate in its rites. The Pope created a kind of constitutional order. William of Ockham emphasized the individual\u2019s freedom. A movement for representative government sprung up within the church, but the church squashed it, leading to the Protestant Reformation.\n\n\u201cWas Paul the greatest revolutionary in human history?\u201d Siedentop asks toward the end of his book. The answer, based on Siedentop\u2019s argument, is obvious: With his writing, Paul launched a social revolution that is still shaping our society. After Paul, individuals were gradually freed from the constraints on their actions and consciences and allowed to live as they saw fit. The modern liberal order, with its emphasis on individual rights and personal freedoms, is the ultimate result of Paul\u2019s egalitarian thinking.\n\nIn other words, modern progressivism, with its emphasis on individual autonomy and freedom, is the heir not to Enlightenment rationalists like Immanuel Kant and Thomas Jefferson, but to the Apostle Paul. History has been marching to free the individual, and Paul\u2019s writings were a catalyst for much of this progress. Or so Siedentop argues.\n\n***\n\nBut was Paul really such a great champion of equality, liberty, and individual autonomy? Was Paul really interested in freeing individuals totally from the strictures of society so they could live fully autonomous lives?\n\nIf Paul is read in full, the answer has to be no. To see this, let\u2019s compare a passage from Siedentop\u2019s book to a couple from Paul.\n\nSiedentop sees the early Christian ascetics and monks as fully expressing the egalitarian and individualist impulse in Paul\u2019s writing. He contrasts the ascetics and monks, who lived hyper-spiritual lives in isolation or in voluntary communities, with the early church, which was under constant attack from a hostile government and as a result grew into a tight-knit community. \u201cSuch besieged communities constrained, so to speak, the moral impulses released by Christian belief,\u201d Siedentop writes. \u201cBut the monks gave those impulses a dramatic release.\u201d\n\nBut Paul knows nothing of this kind of autonomy. He writes to the church in Philippi, \u201ccomplete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.\u201d\n\nPaul wants the early Christians to set aside their own desires and to serve others. His vision for the Christian life reflects both the strong communitarianism of the ancient polis and the new egalitarianism of the fledgling faith. Individuals are bound by duties.\n\nPaul writes about the family in a similar way. In his letter to the church at Ephesus, he commands Christians to love and serve and submit to each other according to their roles in the family\u2014roles that are based explicitly on age and gender. Paul tells children to \u201cobey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.\u201d The members of the family, just as in the church, are bound together through bonds of both duty and obligation.\n\nFar from constraining the \u201cmoral impulses released by Christian belief,\u201d as Siedentop puts it, the community is what makes Christian morality possible. Individuals are certainly constrained by the community around them, Paul says. They have to be. They are not autonomous individuals.\n\nSiedentop makes no effort to wrestle with the fullness of Paul\u2019s description of human relations. The resulting picture is not Paul, but merely a progressive riff on parts of Paul\u2019s writing.\n\n***\n\nWhy does Siedentop so badly misread Paul? In his description of the ancient world we see the first signs that something is going wrong. Siedentop reads the works of the two greatest philosophers of the ancient world, Plato and Aristotle, to be mere artifacts of a rigidly stratified society, not serious works that contain true insights into reality. Plato\u2019s description of the best soul, with reason ruling the other passions, is merely a reflection of the stratified society of his time. Aristotle saw the political life as the best because he could not envision a city where individuals had meaning apart from the larger social order. \u201cAncient philosophers,\u201d Siedentop writes late in the book, \u201cliving in societies founded on the belief in human inequality, had projected hierarchy onto the \u2018natural\u2019 order of things. It infected their ideas of nature and social order.\u201d\n\nSiedentop\u2019s view of Plato and Aristotle is not completely wrong; it\u2019s just woefully incomplete. They certainly were not egalitarians, but they were not devoid of any ability to apprehend truth, either. The same can be said about Siedentop\u2019s reading of Paul: The apostle\u2019s writings do contain elements of a sort of equality, but they do not support the kind of egalitarianism found in today\u2019s progressive policies.\n\nBy simply reading Paul as a precursor to modern liberalism, as a revolutionary in the march of History, Siedentop strips Paul of his prophetic voice, and of his ability to critique modern liberalism and progressivism. The same critique that Siedentop makes of Plato and Aristotle could thus be turned on Siedentop himself: His work is a product of his own time, a time of equality and liberty defined as equal autonomy, of the welfare state and abortion and gay rights, of the National Health Service and Obamacare.\n\nThe fundamental difference between Paul\u2019s writing and our contemporary culture is the belief in a God\u2014or, put more indefinitely, in an absolute standard that stands above people, makes moral claims on them, and constrains their autonomy. Paul saw equality as generated and tempered by a higher authority. But modern progressive liberalism has no such higher ordering force. Equal liberty\u2014equal autonomy\u2014has displaced God as the ultimate authority and standard for the progressives.\n\nHere is the fundamental question that Siedentop fails to address: What is the basis of equality now that society is not based explicitly on a God that people can be equal under? For Paul, everybody stands equal under God. Equality for him is just a result of a prior belief in a sovereign being. But for modern liberalism, there is no such first object that creates this order of equality. Equality has become the first object that is meant to order society. On what is this equality based?\n\n***\n\nSiedentop wants it to be based on the \u201cmoral intuitions\u201d generated by Christianity. By appealing to the Christian tradition, however, Siedentop inadvertently exposes the shaky foundation of our liberal order. Siedentop shows how the egalitarian impulse gradually developed over the past two millennia in Western society. But he would be hard pressed to show the relevance of Christianity to modern liberal society. Put more bluntly, how can people be expected to respect the Christian origins of our liberal order when they themselves are not Christian?\n\nSiedentop is trying to demonstrate the rich moral tradition underlying our modern order, but by showing how Christianity supplied much of what underlies modern western liberalism, he shows our great need for an ordering force that can provide a foundation for equality while ordering and tempering its excesses.\n\nSiedentop concedes at the end of his book that modern liberalism has a tendency to drift into a couple of \u201cliberal heresies.\u201d It can devolve into either narrow individualism, where people are only concerned with themselves and their immediate family and friends, or into a kind of materialist consumerism, where people are only interested in acquisition of material goods. But stopping these \u201cheresies\u201d requires a prior ordering idea that tempers and gives context to equality.\n\nA return to widespread Christian belief could provide that ordering idea, Siedentop\u2019s work implies, but that prospect seems exceedingly unlikely today. Christianity constrains autonomy and does not fully liberate individuals. It ties individuals down to their communities and to an external law. It threatens our liberal sensibilities.\n\nInventing the Individual, by trying to show the roots of our liberalism\u2019s moral intuitions, ultimately exposes liberalism\u2019s rootlessness. We lack the ordering principle\u2014a just and sovereign God\u2014that drove the progress toward equality over much of the last two millennia. Instead, the consequence of this belief in God\u2014a belief in the free and equal individual\u2014has itself become the god for liberals.\n\nLiberals are ripping out the foundation of the house in which they live. What they lack, though, is an adequate replacement for the foundation, something to give them the same stability and order.
