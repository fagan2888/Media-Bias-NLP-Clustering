The ticket arrives via email and contains a link that loads malicious code onto the user\u2019s computer.\n\nThe scam prompted the local police department to issue an alert last week.\n\nRelated: Taxpayers Lose $23 Million in IRS Phone Scam\n\nThe Simi Valley Police Department in California issued a warning about a similar type of scam on Monday.\n\nWhat makes the scam particularly alarming is that the emails contain accurate traffic data, including street names, speed limits and actual driving speeds. The people who received the emails were actually speeding at the time and location noted in the scam emails.\n\nSince the emails contain legitimate information, people are tricked into thinking they\u2019re genuine and are more likely to click through the email.\n\nThe police suspect that the traffic data is being obtained through a traffic app that tracks phone GPS data, though exactly which app isn\u2019t clear.\n\nRelated: FBI Warns of a New Student Loan Scam\n\nAlthough the email requests payment within five days, no mechanism is in place to receive the fines. Instead, a link on the email that says it contains a photo of the victim\u2019s license plate loads malware onto the user\u2019s device when clicked. The message doesn\u2019t actually include a photo of the person\u2019s license plate.\n\nThe alert from the police department reminds people that citations are never issued through email or in the form of an email attachment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Tredyffrin Police Department", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "You might want to think twice before opening up that email from your local police depa", "title": "A New Scam Sends Fake Traffic Tickets to Speeding Drivers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/29/New-Email-Scam-Sends-Traffic-Tickets-Speeding-Drivers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03292016_Speeding.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/29/New-Email-Scam-Sends-Traffic-Tickets-Speeding-Drivers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03292016_Speeding.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "You might want to think twice before opening up that email from your local police depa", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The police suspect that the traffic data is being obtained through a traffic app that tracks phone GPS data, though exactly which app isn\u2019t clear.\nThe people who received the emails were actually speeding at the time and location noted in the scam emails.\nA new scam posing as a speeding ticket has hit at least three residents in Tredyffrin Township, Pennsylvania, just outside of Philadelphia.\nWhat makes the scam particularly alarming is that the emails contain accurate traffic data, including street names, speed limits and actual driving speeds.\nThe ticket arrives via email and contains a link that loads malicious code onto the user\u2019s computer."}
