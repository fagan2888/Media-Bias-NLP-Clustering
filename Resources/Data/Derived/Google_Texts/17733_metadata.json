You can\u2019t keep handing out all this free stuff. This is one of the big problems with government right now, is just bloated bureaucracy, entitlements that can run amok, and this guy just, he likes the idea, the sound of it, he loves all the socialist and communist regimes out there, but no, the American people are not agreeing with him.\u201d\n\nActually, Americans are agreeing with Sanders. According to a recent CNN poll of registered voters, Sanders leads Trump by 9 points, and is in a dead heat with Dr. Carson, trailing by only two points.\n\nBut Jesse Watters sneered, \u201cIt just shows how kooky the Democratic party is... He didn\u2019t think Obama\u2019s trillion dollar stimulus was enough. He\u2019s proposing another trillion dollar stimulus. He wants to raise taxes to 90% on the wealthy. Obama already tried that, and the middle class is getting hosed. He thinks ObamaCare is too conservative, he wants to empty Gitmo. This guy is totally ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201dSocialism is communism,\u201d Bolling said. In reality, Sanders is a democratic socialist, not a full-fledged socialist, and not even close to being a communist.\n\nBut the only \u201ccorrection\u201d came from Rivera, who said, \u201cSocialism is what you call it when someone else is getting the benefit and you\u2019re not. When you\u2019re getting the benefit, it\u2019s great American patriotism.\u201d\n\nWatters sneered again, \u201cSocialism only works until rich people don\u2019t exist any more.\u201d\n\nLater, as the discussion moved on to paying for government programs, Bolling said, \u201cMy answer is to \u2026get rid of Social Security altogether.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa, Eric!\u201d Dana Perino said, laughing. Then she added, \u201cActually, it\u2019s not a bad thought.\u201d\n\n\u201dGet rid of Social Security? I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Rivera said.\n\n\u201cGod forbid you go back to you earn your money, you save you money, you keep your money, you spend your money, and then you retire,\u201d Bolling argued.\n\n\u201cGo back to starving old people?\u201d Rivera retorted.\n\nGuilfoyle gave the elimination of Social Security her vote of approval. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we have to act like this country is so crippled and everybody has to take a knee and get a handout. Come on, grow up.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see Bolling, Perino and Guilfoyle refuse Social Security when they retire.\n\nWatch it below, from the October 19 The Five.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "4+r36qx/KGC8ghno/d2VlCMpXSD3TiP8YBlndU8dYUw=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_pundits_salivate_to_get_rid_of_social_security_102015", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox Pundits Salivate To Get Rid Of Social Security"}, "Title": "Fox Pundits Salivate To Get Rid Of Social Security"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca550\"", "article_summary": "Then she added, \u201cActually, it\u2019s not a bad thought.\u201d\u201dGet rid of Social Security?\nCome on, grow up.\u201dLet\u2019s see Bolling, Perino and Guilfoyle refuse Social Security when they retire.\nGuilfoyle gave the elimination of Social Security her vote of approval.\nWhile Fox\u2019s The Five hosts were scare mongering about Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cattacks\u201d on the \u201cdaddy\u201d who pays the bills, some of them figured they\u2019d smear Social Security right along with him.\nIn reality, Sanders is a democratic socialist, not a full-fledged socialist, and not even close to being a communist."}
