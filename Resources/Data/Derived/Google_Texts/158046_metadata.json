He and goaltender Jacob Markstrom went to Vancouver in the deal that sent goalie Roberto Luongo to the Panthers.\n\nMatthias had a career-high 18 goals, with nine assists, the next season with the Canucks and signed with the Maple Leafs as a free agent last summer. This season, he has six goals and 11 assists in 51 games with Toronto.\n\nHe didn\u2019t join the team for Sunday\u2019s game at Vancouver and instead will meet the Avalanche in Denver and be available for Wednesday\u2019s game against San Jose.\n\nSmith, 22, was a seventh-round Colorado choice in 2012 and played one game for the Avalanche, against Montreal on Dec. 1, 2014. He had 13 goals and 34 points with the Rampage this season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche acquires forward Shawn Matthias from Toronto", "title": "Avalanche acquires forward Shawn Matthias from Toronto", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/21/avalanche-acquires-forward-shawn-matthias-from-toronto/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160221_122509_shawn-matthias.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160221_122509_shawn-matthias.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T13:10:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:13:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Matthias, 28, has 75 goals and 73 assists in 459 NHL games with Florida, Vancouver and Toronto.\nSmith, 22, was a seventh-round Colorado choice in 2012 and played one game for the Avalanche, against Montreal on Dec. 1, 2014.\nHe didn\u2019t join the team for Sunday\u2019s game at Vancouver and instead will meet the Avalanche in Denver and be available for Wednesday\u2019s game against San Jose.\nThis season, he has six goals and 11 assists in 51 games with Toronto.\nHe and goaltender Jacob Markstrom went to Vancouver in the deal that sent goalie Roberto Luongo to the Panthers."}
