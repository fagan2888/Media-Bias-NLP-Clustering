Among them, women outnumbered men, most policyholders were English speakers, and Asian enrollees outnumbered Latinos.\n\nOf the 2 million state residents who have been covered by health insurance through Covered California since the opening, only 1.3 million are still enrolled. For those who left, 85percent reported gaining coverage elsewhere, most commonly through an employer.\n\n\u201cFor many, Covered California is not an end point but rather it\u2019s part of a lifetime journey to make sure people have coverage,\u201d Executive Director Peter Lee said. \u201cWe\u2019re a way station for many.\u201d\n\nCynthia Cox, an associate director at the nonprofit health research group Kaiser Family Foundation, in Washington, D.C., highlighted the 15 percent who were uninsured after disenrolling.\n\n\u201cThat can speak to affordability of the premium and the perceived value from the plan,\u201d she said.\n\nThe exchange reported gains in ethnic diversity, although Latinos are still underrepresented. They are now nearly 30 percent of enrollees, but that falls short of the estimated 37 percent of Latinos statewide who would qualify for financial assistance.\n\n\u201cIt will be something that they have to continue to work on for equity and to make sure people who are eligible know about it and are able to sign up,\u201d Cox said.\n\nLee said 90 percent of enrollees are receiving subsidies and pay an average of $150 a month. He said that, as expected, the coverage pool has attracted more old than young, with 53.5 percent of enrollees ages 45 to 64.\n\n\u201cEven though we\u2019re skewing older, we\u2019re skewing way healthy,\u201d Lee said, noting the modest 4 percent average premium increase for next year.\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-3686 or cperkes@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "business", "description": "Business: Covered California: Over 2 million sold.
