Stocks strolled lower Thursday, as the market headed toward its final hour of trade.

The S&P 500 trimmed 0.3%, while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.1% each. The Dow Jones utility average outperformed, rising 0.2%. Volume was running lower vs. the previous session on both major exchanges, which is common in the run-up to the Good Friday holiday.

The stock market will be closed Friday.

Apart from the holiday, institutional investors had another reason to step back and wait. On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its final figure on fourth quarter GDP. The first reading was 0.7% but it was revised to 1% on the second take. The Street’s consensus estimate is for the 1% percentage to remain unchanged. However, pessimists expect the figure to be revised down to 0.7%, while optimists expect 1.3% growth.

A spike up or down could raise or dash hopes on the U.S. economy.

Among IBD 50 stocks, sellers clobbered Smith & Wesson (SWHC), which slid 9%, and Sturm Ruger (RGR), down 8%. The stocks appeared to be reacting to comments from Sportsman’s Warehouse (SPWH), which said late Wednesday that firearms demand softened in February. Sportman’s Warehouse plunged 10%. Volume was heavy for all three stocks.

Blue chips were mostly down in quiet turnover. On the Dow, the worst performer was UnitedHealth (UNH). The big-cap stock dropped 2.31 to 127.48 in roughly average volume after four up-sessions in a row. UnitedHealth broke out of a base Friday, clearing a 126.31 buy point in strong volume.

The best performer on the Dow was Caterpillar (CAT), which rose 1.7% in below-average volume.
