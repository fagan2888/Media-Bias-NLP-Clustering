John Kasich (R-Ohio) of being \"an Obama Republican.\" (The American Future Fund)\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder.\u201d\n\n\u2014ad by American Future Fund, released Jan. 28, 2016\n\nThis ad by dark-money group American Future Fund, a politically active 501(c)(4) nonprofit, attacks Ohio Gov. John Kasich over being an \u201cObama Republican.\u201d You see more information about this ad at Political TV Ad Archive, which tracks and records political ads aired in key primary states.\n\nThe ad\u2019s claim that Kasich raised taxes by \u201cbillions\u201d stood out as suspicious. The Fact Checker previously has looked into Kasich\u2019s record on taxes and found there was a net tax decrease of nearly $5 billion in the state. What\u2019s going on?\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe ad attacks Kasich\u2019s record on three issues: Common Core, Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, and taxes.\n\nThe argument against Common Core as a federal curriculum coercion backed by the Obama administration is misleading. Governors and school chiefs in most states crafted standards through the Common Core national initiative. States can decide to adopt the standards, revise them then allow school districts to choose their curricula.\n\nRegarding Common Core, Kasich has maintained it was a state decision to adopt higher education standards. As for allowing Medicaid expansion in Ohio, Kasich has said it would help Ohio\u2019s poorest residents. He opposed ACA exchanges in Ohio.\n\nOn taxes, the ad cites a Feb. 3, 2015, Columbus Dispatch article about Kasich\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016-2017. He proposed cutting income taxes by 23 percent (including eliminating income taxes on many small business owners), while raising the state sales tax by another half a cent to cover the cost of the income tax cuts.\n\nAmerican Future Fund founder Nick Ryan pointed to each of the proposed sales tax increases, including higher taxes on bigger businesses, a cigarette tax increase and a new tax on electronic cigarettes, and tax increases on oil-and-gas drillers, the Columbus Dispatch reported.\n\nBut overall, Kasich\u2019s budget would have resulted in a net tax savings for Ohioans.\n\nOf course, the actual budget enacted in June 2015 looked different from Kasich\u2019s wish list. The state General Assembly scaled back Kasich\u2019s income tax cut, and set aside his request for sales tax increases. Compared to Kasich\u2019s budget, the enacted budget had a smaller cigarette tax increase and larger net tax savings.\n\nKasich\u2019s sales tax increases, mainly in cigarette taxes, would have hurt low-income residents, said Zach Schiller, research director at the progressive policy research institute Policy Matters Ohio. Overall, lower-income Ohioans have \u201cnot benefited gigantically\u201d from Kasich\u2019s tax policies, Schiller said.\n\nStill, Schiller said: \u201cThe idea that he\u2019s out there raising taxes in some way is erroneous. \u2026 If you were trying to come up with a bullet point on Gov. Kasich regarding taxes, you would not say he\u2019s a tax raiser.\u201d\n\nThe impact on low-income families is an ongoing criticism by opponents of Kasich\u2019s decision to transition Ohio\u2019s tax system to a consumption tax-based system from an income-tax based one. The Kasich campaign acknowledged such a transition requires some tax increases, such as on sales and tobacco. But income taxes have always gone down by a greater amount, said Scott Milburn, campaign spokesman: \u201cThese changes have always been made in concert, in the same legislation. To discuss one change out of context with another is therefore deliberately misleading.\u201d\n\nTo help offset the impact on low-income families, Kasich signed the earned-income tax credit in the fiscal 2012-13 budget and doubled it in the fiscal 2014 budget, Milburn noted. Plus, the personal income tax exemptions have been increased for low- and middle-income families.\n\nThere has been a net tax cut of $5 billion under Kasich\u2019s governorship, according to state budget officials. The left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that Ohio ranks among the top five states with the biggest income tax cuts, as a share of the state\u2019s economy.\n\nHe received a D in the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s 2014 Fiscal Policy Report Card, but was praised for his income tax cuts and the tax reform legislative packages he signed into law. His score was dragged down by his spending increases, the report card said. His decision to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act also hurt his score.\n\nAmerican Future Fund did not respond to our request for comment on the net tax decreases under Kasich.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThe ad grossly exaggerates Kasich\u2019s record on taxes. Yes, he did increase taxes by \u201cbillions\u201d of dollars, but he also cut taxes by billions \u2013 for a net tax decrease in the most recent state budget, and for his gubernatorial term so far. The budget that was actually enacted looked different from Kasich\u2019s wish list, and had a greater net tax savings than Kasich had called for.\n\nThe ad says Kasich\u2019s budget hit \u201cbusinesses hard and the middle class even harder,\u201d but that also is a misleading characterization. Kasich\u2019s budget would have eliminated income taxes for small-business owners. While sales tax increases affect low- to middle-income families more than the affluent, the state also increased personal income tax exemptions and created the earned-income tax credit to help offset the impact.\n\nEven Kasich\u2019s critics agree there has been a net tax decrease in Ohio under Kasich. Perhaps American Future Fund should pick a new attack ad talking point.
