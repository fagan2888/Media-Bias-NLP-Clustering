(WANE) OrthoPediatrics is a one-of-a-kind business in Warsaw. It\u2019s the only business in the U.S. specializing in orthopedic medical devices for children, and two years ago the small company of a little more than 80 employees was hit with medical device tax. The tax was put in place to help fund the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt definitely slows the development of new products for children in those surgeries because we don\u2019t have the funds to support the new products,\u201d CFO Fred Hite said.\n\nEvery other week medical device companies have to pay a 2.3 percent tax based on their revenues. However, that\u2019s all about to change with lawmakers voting to suspend the tax for two years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely happy and pleased to hear that. It costs us several hundred thousand dollars every single year,\u201d Hite said.\n\nOrthoPediatrics is just one of more than 300 Hoosier medical device companies, employing more than 20,000 people in Indiana.\n\n\u201cIndiana is a hub for medical product innovation and Warsaw in particular and this has got a severe impact on the development of new products by millions and millions of dollars,\u201d Hite said.\n\nNow, OrthoPediatrics is reworking the budget and will use the money that would have gone to the tax to develop new products to help children with deformities and traumatic injuries.\n\n\u201cLuckily now we\u2019ll be able to go back and review that and remove the expense and cash that we had put in to the budget for the medical device tax and instead replace that with incremental programs developing new projects,\u201d Hite said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers voted to suspend an excise tax on medical devices for two years.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488222080", "og": {"site_name": "WANE", "description": "Lawmakers voted to suspend an excise tax on medical devices for two years.", "title": "Northeast Indiana companies \u201cextremely happy\u201d about medical device tax suspension", "url": "http://wane.com/2015/12/18/northeast-indiana-companies-extremely-happy-about-medical-device-tax-suspension/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/medical-device-tax.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers voted to suspend an excise tax on medical devices for two years.", "title": "Northeast Indiana companies \u201cextremely happy\u201d about medical device tax suspension", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/medical-device-tax.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wane15", "site": "wane15", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Fort Wayne News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wane", "fb": {"pages": 54012016429}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wane.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2fd549580f5e4635901cf55d62e47240?s=16", "application-name": "WANE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wane15", "published_time": "2015-12-19T02:19:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-19T02:19:35+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "lNZPWZeGC4zNForuuJZt1-sG4pyZKEfDzOHjOenyArg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "OrthoPediatrics is just one of more than 300 Hoosier medical device companies, employing more than 20,000 people in Indiana.\nEvery other week medical device companies have to pay a 2.3 percent tax based on their revenues.\nIt\u2019s the only business in the U.S. specializing in orthopedic medical devices for children, and two years ago the small company of a little more than 80 employees was hit with medical device tax.\n\u201cLuckily now we\u2019ll be able to go back and review that and remove the expense and cash that we had put in to the budget for the medical device tax and instead replace that with incremental programs developing new projects,\u201d Hite said.\nNow, OrthoPediatrics is reworking the budget and will use the money that would have gone to the tax to develop new products to help children with deformities and traumatic injuries."}
