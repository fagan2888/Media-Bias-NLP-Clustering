But he looked at religious freedom through a lens of tolerance and diversity, not neuralgic social issues.\n\nAmerican bishops have argued that the religious freedom precepts of the US Constitution grant more than the right to worship (or not) however one chooses; they believe it extends to the totality of one\u2019s life. In addition to the contraception concerns, they say the legalization of gay marriage presents new challenges, such as providing insurance benefits to married same-sex couples.\n\nSpeaking in Spanish at the lectern used by Abraham Lincoln to deliver the Gettysburg Address, Francis seemed to endorse this interpretation of religious freedom, even if he didn\u2019t weigh in on the specific examples, saying it \u201ctranscends places of worship and the private sphere of individuals and families.\u201d\n\nStanding in front of the historic Colonial-era building where the Declaration of Independence was signed, Francis declared that the right to religious freedom \u201cis a fundamental right which shapes the way we interact socially and personally with our neighbors whose religious views differ from our own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Francis avoided explicit mention of social issues, around which much of the debate on religious liberty has circled, his host did not.\n\n\u201cWe live at an odd time in history,\u201d said Philadelphia\u2019s Archbishop Charles Chaput, a leader of the hierarchy\u2019s conservative wing. \u201cWhen the Church defends marriage and the family, the unborn child and the purpose of human sexuality, she\u2019s attacked as too harsh. When she defends immigrant workers and families that are broken up by deportation, she\u2019s attacked as too soft. And yet she is neither of those things.\u201d\n\nIn speeches in Washington and New York, Francis urged his audiences not to give in to efforts to destroy differences, including religious diversity.\n\nFor example, he took part in an interfaith prayer service at the 9/11 Memorial Friday, calling on those gathered to oppose \u201cevery attempt to create a rigid uniformity\u201d in order to \u201cbuild unity on the basis of our diversity of languages, cultures, and religions, and lift our voices against everything which would stand in the way of such unity.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether we are called to say \u2018no\u2019 to every attempt to impose uniformity and \u2018yes\u2019 to a diversity accepted and reconciled,\u201d he said.\n\nHe repeated those calls at Independence Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Francis could be the salvation of the religious freedom cause\n\nHe again lamented what he sees as globalization\u2019s efforts to create \u201ca one-dimensional uniformity\u201d and \u201celiminate all differences and traditions in a superficial quest for unity,\u201d and said people of all faiths must \u201cjoin their voices in calling for peace, tolerance, and respect for the dignity and rights of others.\u201d\n\nHe departed from his prepared remarks to speak about the perils of globalization.\n\n\u201cGlobalization isn\u2019t bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt unites us, it can be noble.\u201d But in apparent reference to efforts by the developed world to impose its values and practices on the Third World, he warned that if globalization results in homogenization, it will destroy the unique individual traits of each person.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an sphere, where everyone is an equal dot, at the same distance from the center, it cancels,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed of that which is an essential part of you.\u201d\n\nFrancis said that religions \u201cserve society primarily by the message they proclaim,\u201d and \u201ccall individuals and communities to worship God, the source of all life, liberty and happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey remind us of the transcendent dimension of human existence and our irreducible freedom in the face of every claim to absolute power,\u201d he continued, slamming the \u201catrocities perpetrated by systems which claimed to build one or another \u2018earthly paradise\u2019 by dominating peoples, subjecting them to apparently indisputable principles and denying them any kind of rights.\u201d\n\nHe thanked those \u201cwho have sought to serve the God of peace by building cities of brotherly love, by caring for our neighbors in need, by defending the dignity of God\u2019s gift of life in all its stages, by defending the cause of the poor and the immigrant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this witness, which frequently encounters powerful resistance,\u201d the pope said, \u201cyou remind American democracy of the ideals for which it was founded, and that society is weakened whenever and wherever injustice prevails.\u201d\n\nThe pope\u2019s words in Philadelphia complement those he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly Friday, in which he urged more than 150 world leaders to protect religious minorities \u2014 and in many cases, members of the religious majority \u2014 in the Middle East and Africa, an allusion to the threat from groups such as ISIS.\n\nHe highlighted the \u201cvarious forms of modern tyranny [that] seek to suppress religious freedom, or try to reduce it to a subculture without right to a voice in the public square, or to use religion as a pretext for hatred and brutality.\u201d\n\nDuring Saturday\u2019s speech, Francis again addressed immigration, which, along with the environment, have been constant themes in nearly all the pope\u2019s addresses.\n\nSpeaking directly to a crowd of Hispanic immigrants, Francis urged them, \u201cDo not be discouraged by whatever challenges and hardships you face. I ask you not to forget that, like those who came here before you, you bring many gifts to your new nation.\u201d\n\nHe praised them for \u201cthe vibrant faith which so many of you possess, the deep sense of family life, and all those other values which you have inherited.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy contributing your gifts, you will not only find your place here, you will help to renew society from within,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pope quoted the Declaration of Independence and said the \u201chistory of this nation is also the tale of a constant effort, lasting to our own day, to embody those lofty principles in social and political life.\u201d\n\nHe held up as examples the \u201cabolition of slavery, the extension of voting rights, the growth of the labor movement, and the gradual effort to eliminate every kind of racism and prejudice directed at successive waves of new Americans.\u201d\n\nAfter arriving in Washington from Cuba Tuesday evening, Francis winds up his US trip Sunday evening in Philadelphia.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2015/09/26/francis-the-right-to-religious-freedom-is-fundamental/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/d3099c5fe3ed4a628c26109811e52e91.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Freedom of religion extends beyond houses of worship and private homes, the pontiff declared; it also belongs in the public square.", "title": "Francis: The right to religious freedom is fundamental"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But he looked at religious freedom through a lens of tolerance and diversity, not neuralgic social issues.\nSpeaking directly to a crowd of Hispanic immigrants, Francis urged them, \u201cDo not be discouraged by whatever challenges and hardships you face.\nAmerican bishops have argued that the religious freedom precepts of the US Constitution grant more than the right to worship (or not) however one chooses; they believe it extends to the totality of one\u2019s life.\nAnd yet she is neither of those things.\u201dIn speeches in Washington and New York, Francis urged his audiences not to give in to efforts to destroy differences, including religious diversity.\n\u201cWe live at an odd time in history,\u201d said Philadelphia\u2019s Archbishop Charles Chaput, a leader of the hierarchy\u2019s conservative wing."}
