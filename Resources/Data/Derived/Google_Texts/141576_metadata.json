Here at GlobalPost we\u2019ve been digging into one aspect of the story: Whether the statistics surrounding this crisis warrant the panic that has gripped some potential visitors to the region.\n\nA key number for assessing the question: 150.\n\nThat\u2019s the rough average annual number of reported cases of microcephaly, a condition in which a child is born with a smaller-than-normal head, across Brazil in the few years prior to the current crisis. In recent weeks, that number has become the baseline that journalists, policy makers and scientists around the globe have used to establish that Brazil has seen a huge increase in cases of microcephaly.\n\nHere\u2019s the New York Times: \u201cBefore the epidemic, Brazil recorded only about 150 cases of microcephaly a year.\u201d\n\nAnd the Washington Post: \u201cIn 2014, Brazil reported only 150 cases.\u201d\n\nThe BBC: \u201cJust 150 babies were born with microcephaly in 2014.\u201d\n\nAnd, to be fair, GlobalPost: \u201cThe authorities and media are repeatedly comparing the thousands of suspected microcephaly cases to typical averages of 150 or so per year. That number is about right.\u201d\n\nWell, here\u2019s the thing: That number probably isn\u2019t about right. In fact, it\u2019s almost certainly wrong.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s growing evidence to suggest there have been thousands of annual cases of microcephaly across Brazil in recent years \u2014 not 150.\n\n\u201cAll of us knew that that number wasn\u2019t true,\u201d said Dr. Albert Ko, an epidemiologist at Yale University who has worked extensively in Brazil. \u201cUsually, when you have an outbreak, you\u2019re looking at observed over the expected, and those numbers for the expected [the 150 reported cases] were just off. Anyone who knows anything about births knows they\u2019re off.\u201d\n\nKo certainly isn\u2019t the first expert to raise doubts about the dodgy data circulating about microcephaly in Brazil.\n\nAs we reported earlier, researchers in the northeastern Brazilian state of Paraiba who went back and looked at their data for newborns discovered something startling: hundreds of children meet the definition of \u201cmicrocephalic\u201d set by the Brazilian government. And that\u2019s just at the 21 clinics they have data for.\n\nWriting in the Brazilian daily newspaper Estadao, Fernando Reinach, a Brazilian venture capitalist and Cornell-trained biologist, estimated that there should be in the region of 19,000 children born with microcephaly in Brazil every year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A growing body of evidence suggests Brazil's high rates of microcephaly predate the country's Zika outbreak", "title": "\u201cWe can\u2019t have any confidence in the numbers \u2026\u201d: Brazil\u2019s dodgy data on microcephaly", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A growing body of evidence suggests Brazil's high rates of microcephaly predate the country's Zika outbreak", "title": "\u201cWe can\u2019t have any confidence in the numbers \u2026\u201d: Brazil\u2019s dodgy data on microcephaly", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/21/no_one_actually_knows_if_brazils_microcephaly_cases_are_going_up_or_down_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/brazil-carnival.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A growing body of evidence suggests Brazil's high rates of microcephaly predate the country's Zika outbreak", "title": "\u201cWe can\u2019t have any confidence in the numbers \u2026\u201d: Brazil\u2019s dodgy data on microcephaly", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/brazil-carnival.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Will Carless", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Brazil, GlobalPost, microcephaly, Zika Virus", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cUsually, when you have an outbreak, you\u2019re looking at observed over the expected, and those numbers for the expected [the 150 reported cases] were just off.\nAnyone who knows anything about births knows they\u2019re off.\u201dKo certainly isn\u2019t the first expert to raise doubts about the dodgy data circulating about microcephaly in Brazil.\nIndeed, there\u2019s growing evidence to suggest there have been thousands of annual cases of microcephaly across Brazil in recent years \u2014 not 150.\nTopics: Brazil, GlobalPost, microcephaly, Zika Virus, Media News, Life News, NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostRIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil \u2014 There\u2019s no shortage of confusion about the mysterious and deadly Zika virus, which has captured the world\u2019s attention and recently led the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency of international concern.\nThat\u2019s the rough average annual number of reported cases of microcephaly, a condition in which a child is born with a smaller-than-normal head, across Brazil in the few years prior to the current crisis."}
