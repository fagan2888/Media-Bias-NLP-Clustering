Wear blue to support cops

For months, ever since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, the left has been rampaging against the police. They implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) urged violence, and maintained systemic police racism was the cause of disproportionate numbers of young black males arrested and convicted of crimes. The rest of us mostly remained silent as the men and women who wear blue as they protect us from the criminals who live among us were vilified. Now, two of them have been assassinated, and it is time to be silent no more. As a first step, wear something blue today. If you live in New York City or anywhere nearby, stand ready to travel to the funeral of Officers Ramos and Liu. Stand by for further demonstrations. It is important that the silent majority be silent no more.

Many of the young anti-police demonstrators have no memory of New York City before Mayor Giuliani tamed crime with “broken windows” policing, treating small crime as a precursor to major crime. I do, and it was hideous. Now, under Mayor de Blasio, those days threaten to return. A personal note: decdaes ago, when I was teaching at Columbia University, I was rescued from a mugging by a New York Police Department patrol car that caued the muggers to flee. I ahve never lost my sense of gratitude toward the NYPD, so I freely admit I am biased in their favor. Sure, among the tens of thousands who serve, there may a few bad apples. But there is no question my mind that without their bravery, we would descend into a jungle-like war. They need our support.
