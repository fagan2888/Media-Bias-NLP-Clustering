The price tag--$1.5 trillion over 55 years. The problem, as many taxpayers have already learned, is that the complicated stealth fighter has had so many engineering glitches and missed so many deadlines, that the only thing that that has gone sky high is the cost.\n\nThe F-35 has been dubbed, \u201ctoo big to kill,\u201d and so Lockheed Martin, the aircraft\u2019s contractor, and the Pentagon soldier on\u2014fixing, adjusting, testing and hoping that this time it will fly without developing yet another costly fix.\n\nSLIDESHOW: The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon\u2019s Arsenal\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department accounts for half of the federal government\u2019s discretionary spending and sometimes it\u2019s easy to understand why: the agency develops and is responsible for some of the most expensive weapons systems in the world.\n\nThanks to overly optimistic price projections, unforeseen events such as technical hiccups, and plain mismanagement, the efforts often cost tens of billions of dollars and create perpetual concerns that more taxpayer money could be wasted to maintain the various programs\u2014just like the F-35.\n\nToday, both Russia and China are developing state of the art weapons systems\u2014from autonomous ground combat fighting machines to 5th generation fighters. As you\u2019d expect, the U.S. wants to retain its status as the number one military force in the world.\n\nClick here to see 10 of the most expensive weapons in the world", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For the past 15 years, the Defense Department has been developing one of the most expe", "title": "Here\u2019s One Major Way the Pentagon Spends Your Tax Dollars", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/22/Here-s-One-Major-Way-Pentagon-Spends-Your-Tax-Dollars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/f-35_joint_strike_fighter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/22/Here-s-One-Major-Way-Pentagon-Spends-Your-Tax-Dollars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/f-35_joint_strike_fighter.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For the past 15 years, the Defense Department has been developing one of the most expe", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Click here to see 10 of the most expensive weapons in the world\nFor the past 15 years, the Defense Department has been developing one of the most expensive weapons systems in military history \u2013 the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\nToday, both Russia and China are developing state of the art weapons systems\u2014from autonomous ground combat fighting machines to 5th generation fighters.\nAs you\u2019d expect, the U.S. wants to retain its status as the number one military force in the world.\nSLIDESHOW: The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon\u2019s ArsenalThe U.S. Defense Department accounts for half of the federal government\u2019s discretionary spending and sometimes it\u2019s easy to understand why: the agency develops and is responsible for some of the most expensive weapons systems in the world."}
