Campbell\u2019s, the official soup sponsor of the NFL, has introduced three new soup varieties and announced Green Bay Packers linebacker and Super Bowl XLV champion, Clay Matthews, as the newest \u201cMama\u2019s Boy.\u201d Matthews will replace 2012 \u201cMama\u2019s Boy\u201d Victor Cruz, New York Giants wide receiver and Super Bowl XLVI champion.\n\nCampbell\u2019s \u201cMama\u2019s Boy\u201d campaign aims to strengthen the company\u2019s brand while leveraging its NFL sponsorship. The campaign was first introduced in 1997 and has since then featured several high-profile NFL players to glorify what tough and focused competitors they are on the field, but what mama's boys they are off the field, said Campbell\u2019s. \u201cThroughout the history of the campaign, Campbell has brought passionate football fans delicious and hearty soups in flavors they love, paired with a \u2018Mama\u2019s Boy\u2019 they can relate to,\u201d said Mark Materacky, senior brand manager of Campbell's Chunky Soup.\n\nMatthews will be joined by Casey Heyward and John Kuhn, Green Bay Packers teammates, in three different ads. According to Campbell, the men will take a peek into Matthews\u2019s locker and discover a \u201cMom Cave\u201d where the player is served his pre-game Campbell's Chunky Soup.\n\nThe soup company has also partnered with Matthews for the \u201cSacks for Soups\u201d program to support local communities. Every time the NFL player \u201csacks\u201d an opposing team\u2019s quarterback during the 2013 NFL regular season, Campbell will donate 1,000 soup cans to a local food bank in the opposing team\u2019s city and 1,000 cans to a food bank in Green Bay, Wis. The \u201cSacks for Soups\u201d program will provide much needed relief to food banks across the United States. Campbell has also stated that it will donate $1,000 to CM3 Charitable Fund, Matthews\u2019s chosen charity, for every \u201csack\u201d that he does in the NFL regular season.\n\nWhile the Camden-based Campbell Soup Company has suffered a financial loss with a reported $158 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, it still remains health-focused, reports Philly.com. Jonathan Feeney, analyst at Janney Capital Markets' Philadelphia office, told Philly.com that he liked that the soup company had refocused on selling more hearty soup in places where it is popular.\n\nCampbell has announced a line-up of three new soups based on foods that fans love to eat when they watch the games.
