The current model stipulates that the athlete, his or her parent or the university can pay for the insurance.\n\nAs it stands, each athlete\u2019s insurance is acquired on a case-by-case basis according to the states, conferences and universities where the athlete competes. The case for a change is being spearheaded by former Rep. and Oklahoma football player J.C. Watts in conjunction with Marsh, an insurance brokerage and risk management company.\n\nThe new plan, outlined in Solomon\u2019s report, would include the following protocols:\n\nEnsure no out-of-pocket expenses for players and their family for injuries that occurred while participating in college sports. Schools often pay a lot of these costs, but there are no requirements and some athletes get saddled with thousands of dollars in medical bills from injuries sustained in college.\n\nProvide health coverage to former athletes related to college sports injuries. The coverage would extend to the age of 26, which would be consistent with current Affordable Care Act requirements.\n\nServe as the athlete\u2019s primary medical coverage during college eligibility.\n\nLower the cost of comprehensive basic injury, dental, vision and catastrophic health care coverage.\n\nProtect athletes from substantial and unexpected medical expenses, and help universities\u2019 ability to respond in those cases.\n\nAdd additional support to athletes through family travel benefits, financial literacy and career counseling programs, lifetime scholarships, and compatible cost of attendance stipends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one that says you should pay a player to play college football, but I don\u2019t think a college athlete should have to pay to attend the University of Oklahoma when you don\u2019t have the type of benefits these players should have,\u201d Watts told Solomon. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the time they\u2019re at Oklahoma but after they\u2019ve left. Stadiums have gotten bigger (and) weight rooms have gotten bigger (while) the benefits have largely stayed the same.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA has not been eager to support the plan, according to the report.\n\nThere is concern over whether the plan would be repetitive of the benefits already provided. But numerous athletic directors are behind the model, which may cause the NCAA to eventually support a comprehensive plan that will remove the variations in medical coverage from school to school.\n\n\u201cWe want to be collaborative with them on it,\u201d Tom McMillen, president of the athletic director\u2019s association and supporter of the proposed model, told Solomon. \u201cObviously, the NCAA is a major player and there will have to be discussions there.\u201d\n\nFollow @JordanGame6\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Division 1A Athletic Directors' Association is exploring options to reduce medical insurance costs for athletes by joining together in a new model.
