Most Upper East Side parents give their nannies at least 10 days off and two to five sick days, the survey results show.\n\nWeinstein said parents on the Upper East Side will give at most two weeks of vacation and offer other perks like a Starbucks gift card, food or birthday gifts.\n\n\"Some nannies have burnout,\" she said. \"If you have somebody good, you want to do everything you can to keep them happy.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "A survey&nbsp;shows that most people don&#39;t pay for their nanny&#39;s&nbsp;insurance but when they do, they pay big.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160517/upper-east-side/most-ues-parents-dont-pay-for-their-nannies-health-insurance-survey", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2016/03/nanny-1458857909.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo New York", "description": "A survey&nbsp;shows that most people don&#39;t pay for their nanny&#39;s&nbsp;insurance but when they do, they pay big.", "title": "SURVEY: Most UES Parents Don't Pay For Their Nannies' Health Insurance"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfo", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Upper East Side,Business & Economy,NYC Kids,nanny,nanny survey,nannies,Limor Weinstein,Upper East Side", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "business-economy,nyc-kids", "tags": "nanny,nannies,nanny-survey", "places": "upper-east-side", "people": "limor-weinstein"}}, "article_summary": "\u25ba READ MORE: UES Parents Don't Do Background Checks on Nannies Before Hiring93 percent of parent's don't pay insurance for their nannies.\nOthers who said they provide health insurance, pay from $5,000 to $7,800 a year, with a couple of outliers.\nView Full Caption Shutterstock/akov FilimonovUPPER EAST SIDE \u2014 The majority of Upper East Siders do not pay for their nanny's health insurance, but the few who do pay top dollar, according to a DNAinfo survey.\nMost Upper East Side parents give their nannies at least 10 days off and two to five sick days, the survey results show.\nNanny specialist Limor Weinstein said it's not common for parents to pay insurance for their nannies, but those who do are usually paying on the books and treat their nannies as official employees."}
