On the other hand, universal drug testing at some high schools across the country has been met by students and parents, sometimes, as an insult to wholesome American children from good families. \"Even though drug testing sounds good, based on the science, it's not working,\" said Dr. Daniel Romer, of the University of Pennsylvania Annenberg Public Policy Center in Philadelphia.\n\nMost often, schools drug test students pursuing extracurricular activities, whereas those most at risk of using illicit substances might not bother with sports and academics. Shutterstock\n\nAt best, drug testing programs might motivate some students to abstain from illicit substances such as marijuana, particularly as a prelude to a favored sports season. However, little evidence shows drug testing as effective in lowering the rate of substance use among high schoolers, with prevention efforts often targeting the wrong students. \"So as a prevention effort,\" Romer said, \"school drug testing is kind of wrong-headed.\"\n\nIn the study, Romer and his colleagues interviewed 361 students, one-third of whom said their schools tested for drugs. But beyond drug testing, they asked students to rate their schools according to criteria such as \u201cclear rules\u201d and respectful interactions among students and teachers. Interestingly, a difference emerged after a year between those students who\u2019d rated their schools as mostly positive versus mostly negative. Students in \u201cpositive environments\u201d were 20 percent less likely to smoke dope, while also 15 percent less likely to go for a cigarette.\n\nHowever, no amount of \u201cpositivity\u201d at school affected alcohol use. At both points in the study, two-thirds of the students told researchers they drank alcohol, a prevalence Romer explained as \u201cnormative\u201d behavior in American society. \"The whole culture uses alcohol,\" he said. \"And you're fighting something that has widespread marketing behind it.\u201d\n\nAmerican adolescents are saturated by sports-related ads featuring young adults partying with alcoholic beverages, particularly on a January Sunday with NFL playoff games on television. Romer described underage drinking, as opposed to lesser uses of other substances, as a real problem for parents and school administrators. \u201cAnd right now we\u2019re not doing enough to address it.\u201d\n\nSource: Sznitman, S.
