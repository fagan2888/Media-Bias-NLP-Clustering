Photo from Wexler's Deli\n\nThis week two topics are dominating the conversation of Westside Jews: the election and Wexler\u2019s Deli. And they are not as unrelated as you think.\n\nThe California primary is less than two weeks away, on June 7, a Tuesday. And Wexler\u2019s Deli opens at 6th Street and Santa Monica Blvd in Santa Monica on May 27, a Friday.\n\nThe lead-up to the primary has brought in a steady stream of candidates and fundraisers. But going strictly by the number of tweets, Instagram posts and emails over the past week, I\u2019d say Wexler\u2019s is getting more buzz.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I drove by Wexler\u2019s deli that opens next Friday,\u201d my friend Bryan texted. \u201c(I\u2019m foaming at the mouth just thinking about it) we should all go next week \u2014 can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nEater LA did a breathless curtain-raiser. LA Weekly tweeted out a picture of chef and co-owner Micah Wexler with his face semi-hidden behind the counter, as if his full glory won\u2019t be revealed to us mortals until this week. MSNBC gave the deli an on-air shout-out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal? There are many delis west of the 405. Izzy\u2019s, less than a mile away, has been around for 40 years \u2014 you\u2019ve seen Larry David hold kvetch there on many \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d episodes. Fromin\u2019s, on Santa Monica Boulevard a few blocks from the new Wexler\u2019s location, has been a mainstay of the Elders of Brunch for years. What\u2019s the big tsimmis with Wexler\u2019s?\n\nIn a word: authenticity.\n\nFrom the moment Wexler and his business partner, Mike Kassar, opened their first small outlet in the revitalized downtown Los Angeles Grand Central Market, authenticity set Wexler\u2019s apart. They smoked their own lox, cured their own pastrami, pickled their own pickles. Their breads and bagels are co-crafted with local artisanal bakers. If pickled herring was on the menu, guess who pickled it?\n\nDelis that return to the techniques of handcrafted food had opened in other cities \u2014 Miles End in New York, Wise Sons Jewish Deli in San Francisco, to name a couple \u2014 but never before in L.A. One reason is L.A. didn\u2019t lack for delis, many of them classic. Another reason, as Wexler himself explained to me, is that it\u2019s very difficult, expensive and time-consuming.\n\nBut it\u2019s also the reason Wexler\u2019s is a success. Authenticity. Coming of age at a time when much of life is virtual \u2014 from texting to sexting, the millennials, in particular, yearn for something real. That\u2019s where food comes in \u2014 it\u2019s the one big thing left that can\u2019t be digitized. It\u2019s something they can literally sink their teeth into. The more their world is coming to them as-if, the more they demand their food be true.\n\nOn May 15, when Sandor Katz, author of \u201cThe Art of Fermentation,\u201d led a workshop on DIY sauerkraut in the Grand Central Market basement, just below Wexler\u2019s, guess how many people showed up? 50? 100? Try over 1,000 \u2014 most of them young.\n\nI volunteered as an assistant to Katz and helped walk giddy 20-somethings through techniques familiar to their great-great-grandparents, lost to their moms and dads.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d a young woman asked as I handed her a finished jar of pounded cabbage and salt. \u201cSo cool!\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s why everyone is talking about Bernie and Donald, too.\n\nThe two candidates who are the real story of Election 2016 are not polished politicians. To the overwhelming percentage of millennials who\u2019ve voted for Sanders and turned out to his rallies, that\u2019s what attracts them to the man. He screams authenticity \u2014 especially when he screams. True, Bernie has been a professional pol most of his life, and Donald Trump is anything but a rube. But you can describe each of them using words that just as easily describe the kind of food millennials love: raw, unfiltered, homemade, salty, sour, tough. In a world of political tenderloins, they are brisket.\n\nNow, if you\u2019ve read this column before, you know what I think of Trump. His authenticity is a ruse. Don the Con, aka Con Man Trump, aka Conald Trump is none of what he claims to be \u2014 not anti-gun or anti-abortion or pro-middle class or pro-Israel. He knows far better than his gullible followers that there will be no wall, no deportations, no end to NAFTA or Obamacare or the Iran deal.\n\nBy contrast, Bernie believes the things he says. He may have a less-than-illustrious Senate record, but he\u2019s creating a grass-roots movement by aiming for the treetops \u2014 and perhaps, if he knows how and when to turn his true believers into effective activists, he will have accomplished something big.\n\nThat leaves us with Hillary Clinton. She\u2019s a brilliant woman with deep experience and a long record of accomplishment, whether you agree with her or not. Polls show a majority of Americans think she\u2019s not trustworthy or honest. Millennials disdain her for her lack of, yup, authenticity.\n\nOne could make an argument that Hillary\u2019s travails are more about her inability to project the real Hillary than they are about the real Hillary. But, in any case, that\u2019s her task \u2014 to get raw and real at a time when those are the flavors people crave.\n\nDisagree?
