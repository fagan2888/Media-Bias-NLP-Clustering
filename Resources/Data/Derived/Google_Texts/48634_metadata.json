And there are others like her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s ageless,\u201d says Kristin Thomas, 35, who was a student in Jones\u2019 classroom in 1985-86. Now, her daughter, Rileigh, is one of Jones\u2019 students.\n\n\u201cShe was Pinterest before there was Pinterest,\u201d says fellow first-grade teacher Michelle Bates. \u201cYou will never meet another teacher who seldom speaks in a public setting, but, buddy, if she does, you had better be listening because it is important and it needs to be said.\u201d\n\nJones, the unassuming, honest \u201ccenters queen\u201d loves this 6-year-old age of discovery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a magical year,\u201d Jones says. \u201cIt\u2019s a year of firsts. They write, they learn to count money, tie shoes, ride bikes. ... So many firsts. I\u2019ve never wanted to leave this grade.\u201d\n\nShe says her first-graders really like to have their own desks, a big step up from kindergarten tables. They constantly wiggle loose teeth, love story time on the carpet after lunch, incessantly sharpen and resharpen pencils to hear the buzz and can hardly wait for Bubblegum Fridays.\n\nIt\u2019s also a year in which kids remember successes.\n\n\u201cYou just see the lightbulb come on,\u201d Jones says. Especially with reading, which is Jones\u2019 passion. She says first-graders tend to take off with reading after Christmas.\n\nLove and guidance\n\nAt this point her career, teaching the children of past students has become commonplace in this small community.\n\nThomas says, \u201cI never had a doubt we\u2019d live here,\u201d but having Jones as her daughter\u2019s teacher is just icing on the cake.\n\nJones and other Nolensville Elementary School teachers inspired Thomas, the daughter of Williamson County school board vice chairman Gary Anderson, to become a teacher herself. Thomas teaches at Page High School.\n\nThomas and Steltmann still remember the days when Jones would have the girls in her class over to her house for a slumber party. \u201cI think we were the last class to be able to do that,\u201d Steltmann said.\n\nDespite changes to curriculum, technology and testing, Jones says some things never change.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still just 6,\u201d she says. \u201cThey need love and guidance. Love them, make them feel secure and they will learn. That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nThat guidance includes training the children to add \u201cma\u2019am\u201d after a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno.\u201d And gently correcting behavior.\n\n\u201cYou knew she loved you, but she was not afraid to put you in your place,\u201d says Steltmann, who, back in the day, had a problem with swiping candy from Jones\u2019 desk.\n\n\u201cMrs. Jones finally figured out that I was taking it. And she told me, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to take you to jail.\u2019 Steltmann says as she remembers her 6-year-old self. \u201cShe scared me so much that I never stole again.\u201d\n\nTime is right\n\nWhile Jones, 54, laughs about her sense of honesty, she shies away from saying anything negative about her reasons for retiring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just time,\u201d she says.\n\nShe\u2019ll tell you that part of it because she will get full benefits after 30 years of teaching. And also because she wants to spend more time with her 23-year-old son, Daniel, who has Hunter Syndrome, a genetic disease that affects organs and development.\n\nHe\u2019s doing well but needs care. She\u2019d love to do volunteer work with him through her church, Epworth United Methodist, and elsewhere.\n\nAnother part of her reason to retire includes what she calls a very broad curriculum that just doesn\u2019t go deep enough. .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bits and pieces. Like introducing adverbs and prepositions,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so many skills at one time, but they still have to learn to read.\u201d\n\nWhat she\u2019s seeing more of these days are bright first-graders who still get their b\u2019s and d\u2019s backward. Or they hold a pencil oddly, or don\u2019t cut well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so many little things,\u201d she says, things that just can\u2019t be taught in the classroom anymore for lack of time.\n\nThat\u2019s why Jones plans to volunteer with her beloved first-grade team of teachers as a reading helper. Volunteering there also means she gets to see her friends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s done working,\u201d says Jessica Blackburn, friend and fellow NES teacher for 30 years. \u201cShe has a lot of passions.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s being surrounded 6-year-olds, maybe it\u2019s her deep and sustaining friendships at school, or raising two boys, but Karen Jones really doesn\u2019t look much different than she did 20 years ago.\n\nHer future plans include Thursday mornings at Starbucks, which has become one of the regular spots former NES staff meets. Another place, for quite a few NES staff each year, is an annual summer trip to Gulf Shores, Ala.\n\n\u201cNo photos and no husbands allowed,\u201d Jones says with a laugh.\n\nReach Vicky Travis at 615-881-7216 and on Twitter @VTravis1.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1n9h3JT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "After 31 years, Nolensville Elementary School first-grade teacher has decided to retire.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "After 31 years, Nolensville Elementary School first-grade teacher has decided to retire.", "title": "Beloved teacher moves on to next chapter", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2014/05/18/beloved-teacher-moves-next-chapter/9240839/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After 31 years, Nolensville Elementary School first-grade teacher has decided to retire.", "title": "Beloved teacher moves on to next chapter", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/mrsjones2.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/williamson", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/mrsjones2.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/mrsjones2.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/209496ef8e15ec974055f2b972cb017799a2d254/c=0-0-3264-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/mrsjones2.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5366816a2be01ce320de9a1b7d4fcd3d9671846/c=0-306-3264-2142&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/mrsjones2.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-05-17T23:02:43-05:00", "shorthed": "Teacher preps for next chapter", "articleid": 9240839, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd81f7b80aef18fc9ff3cd911b276728a9998bb7/c=0-306-3264-2142/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/mrsjones2.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ddfec6da1e1c49c540a50418fed8521c9471641/c=944-0-2321-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/18/mrsjones2.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Beloved teacher moves on to next chapter", "pageclass": "article", "author": "Vicky Travis"}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcab\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShe\u2019s so genuine and doesn\u2019t want recognition for anything,\u201dSteltmann, 32, has continued a friendship with Jones ever since she was a student in Jones\u2019 class in 1988.\nGenerations of learners can talk about the talent, love and gifts of this Nolensville Elementary School first-grade teacher who, after 31 years, has decided to retire.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s done working,\u201d says Jessica Blackburn, friend and fellow NES teacher for 30 years.\nThomas says, \u201cI never had a doubt we\u2019d live here,\u201d but having Jones as her daughter\u2019s teacher is just icing on the cake.\nJones and other Nolensville Elementary School teachers inspired Thomas, the daughter of Williamson County school board vice chairman Gary Anderson, to become a teacher herself."}
