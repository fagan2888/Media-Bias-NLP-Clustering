Even in the fourth election cycle after passage, nearly every single GOPer running for office has publicly promised to repeal the legislation if given the chance. On Tuesday, the GOP-controlled House voted for the fourth time to totally dismantle the health care reform law, largely to allow freshman lawmakers the opportunity to cast their own anti-Obamacare votes.\n\nHowever, Republican opposition has not been entirely unwavering. Indeed, more than a half-dozen potential GOP presidential aspirants have records that are littered with embraces of particular Obamacare provisions:\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE: The firebrand New Jersey governor welcomed Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion in his state, calling it \u201cthe smart thing to do for our fiscal and public health.\u201d Unlike some other Republican governors who were hesitant about the large federal subsidies, Christie argued that they would \u201cprovide health insurance to tens of thousand of low-income New Jerseyans, help keep our hospitals financially healthy and actually save money for New Jersey taxpayers.\u201d It is estimated that Christie\u2019s support for Medicaid expansion will result in 300,000 low-income New Jersey residents receiving health insurance.\n\nMIKE PENCE: The Indiana governor and trendy pick for the GOP nod embraced a modified form of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion earlier this year. (The plan would enroll some low-income Indianans in a local market-based alternative to Medicaid.) \u201cI have long believed that a society can be judged with how it deals with the most vulnerable,\u201d Pence said when announcing the move to take millions in Obamacare funds, noting that as many as 350,000 Indiana residents could gain health coverage as a result. Indiana is currently waiting for a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the move.\n\nALLEN WEST: The controversial former congressman from Florida is a possible dark-horse candidate for the Republican nomination. However, if West runs, he will have to defend remarks he made to ThinkProgress in 2012 defending some of the key tenets of Obamacare. The Tea Party favorite voiced support for the young adult coverage provision \u2014 \u201cIf people want to keep their kid on their insurance at 26, fine\u201d \u2014 protections for people with previous illnesses \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure no American gets turned back for pre-existing conditions\u201d \u2014 and bolstering Medicare Part D \u2014 \u201cKeep the donut hole closed, that\u2019s fine\u201d \u2014 all of which are key elements of Obamacare.\n\nSCOTT WALKER: Another leading contender for the nomination, Gov. Walker has been as adamant an Obamacare critic as there is, with Wisconsin coming in dead last in state spending per capita to conduct Obamacare outreach. However, after President Obama prevailed in the 2012 election and it soon became clear that Obamacare would remain law, Walker began encouraging state agencies to help Wisconsinites transition onto Obamacare plans. He told the Washington Examiner earlier this year, \u201cEven though I\u2019m obviously not a supporter (of Obamacare), I don\u2019t want people to fall between the cracks.\u201d\n\nRICK PERRY: In 2011, while running for the GOP presidential nomination, Gov. Perry of Texas argued during a debate that, \u201cIf we can get the federal government out of our business in the states when it comes to health care, we\u2019ll come up with ways to deliver more health care to more people cheaper than what the federal government is mandating today.\u201d Two years later, instead of touting Texas\u2019 existing high-risk pool program, Gov. Perry signed a bill in 2013 to abolish the existing program and instead encourage high-risk individuals and those with pre-existing conditions to enroll in Obamacare\u2019s federal marketplace. In addition, Perry was caught last year quietly requesting funds from the law \u2014 estimated at around $100 million \u2014 to help elderly and disabled Texans.\n\nJOHN KASICH: Though Republicans have long implored to their base that they can and will repeal Obamacare, the Ohio governor dismissed the idea during a rally just before the 2014 election. \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Kasich declared. He criticized his Party\u2019s opposition to expanding Medicaid as \u201creally either political or ideological,\u201d but, \u201cI don\u2019t think that holds water against real flesh and blood and real improvements in people\u2019s lives.\u201d Kasich was one of the first Republican governors to embrace Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, even going around the state\u2019s Republican legislature. The move provides health care for nearly 300,000 low-income Ohioans.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "They may say they want to repeal it, but that's not the whole story.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "They may say they want to repeal it, but that's not the whole story.", "title": "GOP Presidential Hopefuls Want To Have It Both Ways On Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/02/04/3605983/2016-obamacare-nice-things/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-Supreme-Court--e1415756577529.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They may say they want to repeal it, but that's not the whole story.", "creator": "@smkeyes", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-Supreme-Court--e1415756577529-321x214.jpg", "title": "GOP Presidential Hopefuls Want To Have It Both Ways On Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-Supreme-Court--e1415756577529.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-Supreme-Court--e1415756577529.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-04T08:51:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "MIKE PENCE: The Indiana governor and trendy pick for the GOP nod embraced a modified form of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion earlier this year.\nOn Tuesday, the GOP-controlled House voted for the fourth time to totally dismantle the health care reform law, largely to allow freshman lawmakers the opportunity to cast their own anti-Obamacare votes.\nThe move provides health care for nearly 300,000 low-income Ohioans.\nWalker has been as adamant an Obamacare critic as there is, with Wisconsin coming in dead last in state spending per capita to conduct Obamacare outreach.\nRepealing Obamacare has been the defining goal of the Republican Party over the past several years."}
