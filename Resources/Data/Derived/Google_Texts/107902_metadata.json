Rice, to hear why the administration had to respond militarily to a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia hung up, took a phone call from another red-state Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and together they rejected their president\u2019s reasoning. Within days, they were circulating new language calling for a diplomatic solution. Republicans joined the effort, Secretary of State John Kerry eventually endorsed a similar approach, and with the American public dubious about intervention, the drive toward a military strike fizzled.\n\nIt has been that way all year for Mr. Manchin, a centrist Democrat from an increasingly Republican state who has shown an impulsive, almost reflexive, willingness to reject the position of his leaders and try to entice fellow senators to a middle ground. Now he is trying to delay parts of the new health care law, the latest effort by Mr. Manchin, a former governor and the grandson of an Italian immigrant, to engage on virtually every issue flaring up on Capitol Hill, just as he did in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything going on in any part of the state that he wasn\u2019t involved in,\u201d said State Senator Jack Yost, a Democrat who had his share of clashes with a governor more inclined to bipartisanship than some in his party always liked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that he has his hands in everything there, too.\u201d\n\nAs he nears the three-year mark in the Senate, Mr. Manchin has found himself sometimes on the president\u2019s side, and sometimes a thorn in his side. In a state where Mr. Obama got just 36 percent of the vote in 2012, that is just fine, said Gil White, who served in the Legislature for 14 years as a Republican before working for the governor as his chief legislative liaison. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Joe has anything to worry about regarding his West Virginia base,\u201d Mr. White said.\n\nMr. Manchin\u2019s latest gambit \u2014 to delay key parts of the president\u2019s health care law and force significant changes \u2014 may prove his most significant so far.\n\nIt has fed Republican hopes that a nearly united Democratic front backing the Affordable Care Act may be cracking. It has spooked White House and health insurance company officials who worry that his push for legislation to reinstate canceled insurance plans will undermine the law and hurt the insurance market, and that his push to delay penalties on those who fail to buy insurance and to extend the enrollment period will undermine efforts to ensure that young adults enter the market at the same time those with higher health risks do. And his call to redefine part-time workers under the law as those who work fewer than 40 hours a week, not 30, could significantly raise the Affordable Care Act\u2019s cost to the federal government.\n\nMr. Manchin said he had discussed his concerns with the White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, who has counseled Democrats to be patient before calling for any such changes. But the West Virginian shows no sign of backing down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m respectful. I want my president to do well,\u201d he said of a commander in chief who is unpopular in his state. But, Mr. Manchin added firmly, \u201cI have never been against something unless I had a better idea,\u201d and he says he believes penalizing people for not buying insurance from a website they are struggling to gain access to is a bad idea.\n\nTo some of his colleagues, his iconoclasm, industry and impulsiveness can be taxing. He springs his latest enterprise on the public with little or no consultation with leadership \u2014 or even staff. But Mr. Manchin\u2019s jovial penchant for taking on serious tasks without seeming terribly serious brings senators along.\n\n\u201cYou rarely see any senator get involved in more issues so quickly and yet so effectively,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the Senate\u2019s No. 3 Democrat.\n\nMr. Manchin, who once fired a rifle at the president\u2019s \u201ccap and trade\u201d energy bill in an ad, proved an unlikely ally at the start of 2013 as Mr. Obama sought a bipartisan deal on background checks for gun purchases. Mr. Manchin broke down in tears in his office as the parents of children slain in Newtown, Conn., pleaded for action. His background check bill, written with Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, nearly kept a sweeping gun safety bill on track. But the effort fell short. He has swerved away from the administration and his Senate leaders.\n\nHis push for a diplomatic resolution in Syria helped deflate Mr. Obama\u2019s drive toward military action. Mr. Manchin undermined his own Senate leadership when he embraced a student loan bill that set interest rates based on Treasury bond rates, not a fixed, subsidized number. By gathering a bipartisan group of former governors in the Senate, he won that battle, helping secure a rare win for House Republicans who mirrored his approach.\n\nTwo years of near-constant Manchin pestering helped persuade the Food and Drug Administration last month to tighten regulations on prescription painkillers that have ravaged his rural state. During October\u2019s 16-day government shutdown, he cut a deal with the Fisher House Foundation, a charitable organization focused on veterans and military families, to help pay for death benefits for the families of slain service members, which had been suspended.\n\nHe was the first Democrat to join three Republicans trying to find a negotiated solution to the budget crisis, though Mr. Obama was holding firmly to his line that he would not negotiate.\n\nOn the explosive issue of the health care law rollout, he has teamed with a Republican, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, to draft a bill delaying fines until 2015 on people who fail to buy insurance. He joined Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Republicans, and Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, to raise the part-time worker threshold. He was among the first to join Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, on a bill to force insurers to reinstate policies they canceled in recent months because they failed to meet the law\u2019s coverage standard.\n\n\u201cIf you turn on the TV today, 10 times an hour, any news station has the president saying: \u2018If you like your insurance you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep him.\u2019 Well, we\u2019re finding out that might not be 100 percent accurate, might be 90 percent accurate, not 100 percent,\u201d he said in a folksy drawl straight from Farmington, W.Va., the coal-country hamlet he grew up in.\n\nHailing from a state that is drifting away from the national Democratic Party, he knows he has to represent those sensibilities. \u201cPeople can shake your hand, look you in the eye and see your soul,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know if you\u2019ve BSed them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131113140227, "twitter": {"description": "The latest gambit by Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia was an attempt to delay key parts of President Obama\u2019s health care law.", "title": "Senator Manchin Takes On Democratic Party Leaders in Pursuit of a Middle Ground", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/us/politics/senate-democrat-joe-manchin-takes-on-party-leaders.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/14/us/MANCHIN/MANCHIN-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "A Democrat Takes On Party Leaders, Seeking a Middle Ground", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 13, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Manchin  Joe III,Obama  Barack,Senate,Democratic Party", "news_keywords": "Senate,Democrats", "PT": "Article", "author": "JONATHAN WEISMAN", "thumbnail_150": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/14/us/MANCHIN/MANCHIN-thumbLarge.jpg", "per": "Manchin, Joe III;Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JONATHAN WEISMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "dsk": "U.S. / Politics", "lp": "The latest gambit by Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia was an attempt to delay key parts of President Obama\u2019s health care law.", "tom": "News", "thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/14/us/MANCHIN/MANCHIN-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The latest gambit by Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia was an attempt to delay key parts of President Obama's health care law.", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 700, "CG": "us", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "dat": "November 13, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "org": "Senate;Democratic Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "14manchin", "utime": 20131114121743, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/us/politics/senate-democrat-joe-manchin-takes-on-party-leaders.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/14/us/MANCHIN/MANCHIN-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The latest gambit by Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia was an attempt to delay key parts of President Obama\u2019s health care law.", "title": "Senator Manchin Takes On Democratic Party Leaders in Pursuit of a Middle Ground"}, "pdate": 20131113, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000002550246, "cre": "The New York Times", "emailThisHash": "sUddH/xtetQv4FeBecjYqA", "hdl": "Senator Manchin Takes On Democratic Party Leaders in Pursuit of a Middle Ground", "SCG": "politics", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e57\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Manchin broke down in tears in his office as the parents of children slain in Newtown, Conn., pleaded for action.\nMr. Manchin said he had discussed his concerns with the White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, who has counseled Democrats to be patient before calling for any such changes.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that he has his hands in everything there, too.\u201dAs he nears the three-year mark in the Senate, Mr. Manchin has found himself sometimes on the president\u2019s side, and sometimes a thorn in his side.\nHailing from a state that is drifting away from the national Democratic Party, he knows he has to represent those sensibilities.\nHis background check bill, written with Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, nearly kept a sweeping gun safety bill on track."}
