The company's main brands are Weld-On, Water-Tite, Test-Tite, Guy Gray TrueBro and Studor. IPS' management team also invested in the deal.\n\nNautic says it expects IPS to benefit from the real estate recovery, and that the company will work to develop new products. The firm has more than $2.5 billion in assets under management, and generally makes equity investments between $25 million and $75 million.\n\nThe firm's recent acquisitions include All Metro Health Care Services Inc., a home-care company that Nautic bought in September, and Custom Window Systems Inc., which the firm picked up in August.\n\nGE Capital and LStar Capital provided financing for the deal. Robert W. Baird & Co. acted as IPS' financial adviser.\n\nSlow gains in the real estate recovery have spurred several companies to make building products and related acquisitions. Other deals have come from Lone Star Funds, which bought HeidelbergCement AG's brick and roof-tile business for $1.4 billion in December, and Builders FirstSource Inc.'s (Nasdaq: BLDR) December deal for Empire Truss Ltd.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/real_estate/nautic-acquires-ips-adding-to-building-products-m-254690-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/weld-on.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Nautic Acquires IPS, Adding to Building Products M&A"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc8a\"", "article_summary": "Nautic Acquires IPS, Adding to Building Products M&AThe target is a building products company that sells cement, plumbing and adhesive productsProvidence, Rhode Island-based private equity firm Nautic Partners LLC has acquired IPS Corp. for an undisclosed amount.\nSlow gains in the real estate recovery have spurred several companies to make building products and related acquisitions.\nIPS, headquartered in Compton, California, provides cements, specialty plumbing products and adhesives.\nNautic says it expects IPS to benefit from the real estate recovery, and that the company will work to develop new products.\nThe firm has more than $2.5 billion in assets under management, and generally makes equity investments between $25 million and $75 million."}
