Plaintiffs include private businesses, Catholic Charities affiliates, Catholic dioceses and colleges and universities, including the University of Notre Dame and EWTN, the Register\u2019s parent company.\n\nDoerflinger said that without relief from either Congress or the courts, \u201csome organizations are going to have to choose between their convictions and their ability to offer health benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a terrible outcome of a law that was supposed to expand access to health care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe defeated resolution would have put to rest those legal challenges, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., made clear Monday that the Senate would not accept any bill passed by the House to fund the government that touched the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe House returned with another compromise that would delay the individual mandate to buy insurance for one year \u2014 President Barack Obama has already delayed the employer mandate for that same period \u2014 and require both Congress and the White House to give up their own federal health plans and sign up for the multistate plans offered on the state exchanges.\n\nThe Senate also rejected that proposal, leading to the Oct. 1 shutdown of the federal government.\n\n\n\nCongress Gets Abortion Plans\n\nWhile a government shutdown loomed in the congressional fight over funding the ACA, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced on Sept. 30 that it will allow members of Congress and their staffs to purchase multistate health plans that include abortion coverage. Under this arrangement, the federal government will pay 75% of the costs of those health plans.\n\n\u201cThis decision honors the spirit of the Affordable Care Act, which is significantly improving health care for women,\u201d said Reps. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., both abortion-rights supporters.\n\nBut the new OPM rule appears to run afoul of the 1983 Smith Amendment, which prohibits federal funds to pay for abortions or \u201cadministrative expenses in connection with health plans\u201d that provide \u201cany benefits or coverage for abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., told the Register. \u201cIt fits a pattern of the Obama administration disregarding laws that they don\u2019t agree with.\u201d\n\nOPM stated it \u201cdoes not administer the terms of the health-benefits plans offered on an exchange.\u201d However, it said it would take administrative steps to make sure that abortions were paid from individual, not government, funds.\n\nBut the very act of using federal funds to make sure that taxpayer dollars remained segregated from the multistate plan\u2019s abortion premium was a violation of the Smith Amendment, according to Doerflinger.\n\n\u201cWe have said that to obey the federal law, OPM must not subsidize or have any involvement with federal employees\u2019 health plans if those plans cover elective abortions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the status quo now for all federal employees.\u201d\n\nStill, Smith said his 1983 legislation \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more clear.\u201d But he said the larger issue was that \u201cthe law does not apply to this White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president disregards the plain, unambiguous, bright line-in-the-sand text of the United States Code [of laws] to do whatever he wants and whatever suits him and his people in the White House,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat puts all of our laws at risk.\u201d\n\nObamacare\u2019s Subsidized Abortion Plans\n\nThe full impact of the ACA on the U.S. abortion industry is only beginning to come into focus. According to a new study by the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, the ACA could provide abortion coverage through multistate plans offered on state health exchanges for as many as 111,500 women and girls seeking abortions each year. That number represents 2% of potentially 5.57 million women between the ages of 15-44 newly eligible for either the Medicaid expansion or the federally subsidized private insurance policies from the state exchanges.\n\n\u201cWhat our study examined was the maximal impact of Obamacare fully implemented,\u201d said Chuck Donovan, CLI\u2019s president.\n\nDonovan said that, barring Congress taking corrective action, the only way to sweep abortion clean from the state health exchanges would be for states to pass laws removing abortion as a covered benefit.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard to get these laws passed and keep abortion out of the exchanges, but 23 states have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some of them, of course, won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAbortion is mainly a cash-only business, and the Guttmacher Institute notes that private insurance paid for only 12% of abortions in 2008, although 30% of women having abortions also had private insurance.\n\nHowever, former Planned Parenthood facility operator Abby Johnson told the Register she believes the ACA may end up shifting the model for how the abortion industry does business.\n\n\u201cThis is exciting for Planned Parenthood, because if this is going to be a government-subsidy program similar to Medicaid, then that money is guaranteed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe federal Hyde Amendment prohibits the spending of federal Medicaid money on abortion procedures except in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. The law does not prohibit states from using their own Medicaid funds to subsidize the cost of elective abortions, and 17 states do.\n\nThe Money Motive\n\nJohnson, a Catholic convert with a pro-life ministry that helps abortion workers get out of the industry, pointed out that health-insurance companies are under pressure to create savings and will be far more willing to reimburse abortion as a cheaper procedure than childbirth. The abortions will be fully covered by the mandatory monthly abortion surcharge charged to customers in these plans \u2014 if there is not enough money, insurance companies will have to increase the abortion surcharge, driving up the cost of premiums.\n\nJohnson expected that, with guaranteed money for abortions, the price of abortions will also increase.\n\n\u201cAbortionists will be able to charge whatever they want, and our tax dollars will subsidize that fee,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Rep. Smith, the looming expansion of abortion through taxpayer-subsidized plans is a reminder of the critical role the Stupak Amendment could have played in keeping abortion out of the ACA in all areas involving federal money.\n\nThat amendment, initially passed by the House but later dropped from the final version of the ACA due to resistance, would have specified that federal funds could not be used to pay for abortions or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes abortion coverage, except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother.\n\n\u201cIt was as airtight as statutory language can be,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt would have been hard for the president to overcome that, had it been enacted.\u201d\n\nPeter Jesserer Smith is a Register staff writer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood and other players in the U.S. abortion industry could profit from tens of\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "Planned Parenthood and other players in the U.S. abortion industry could profit from tens of thousands of taxpayer-subsidized abortions.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Abortion Mandate Gets Ready to Go", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/obamacares-abortion-mandate-gets-ready-to-go/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/ObamaPP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/obamacares-abortion-mandate-gets-ready-to-go/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/ObamaPP.jpg", "description": "Planned Parenthood and other players in the U.S. abortion industry could profit from tens of thousands of taxpayer-subsidized abortions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Abortion Mandate Gets Ready to Go"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, abortion, conscience protection, contraception mandate, first amendment to the u.s. constitution, health care, obamacare, president barack obama, u.s. conference of catholic bishops", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce886\"", "article_summary": "Under this arrangement, the federal government will pay 75% of the costs of those health plans.\nCongress Gets Abortion PlansWhile a government shutdown loomed in the congressional fight over funding the ACA, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced on Sept. 30 that it will allow members of Congress and their staffs to purchase multistate health plans that include abortion coverage.\n\u201cThat puts all of our laws at risk.\u201dObamacare\u2019s Subsidized Abortion PlansThe full impact of the ACA on the U.S. abortion industry is only beginning to come into focus.\n\u201cWe have said that to obey the federal law, OPM must not subsidize or have any involvement with federal employees\u2019 health plans if those plans cover elective abortions,\u201d he said.\nBut the very act of using federal funds to make sure that taxpayer dollars remained segregated from the multistate plan\u2019s abortion premium was a violation of the Smith Amendment, according to Doerflinger."}
