Travelers at Denver International Airport waited in long lines Sunday after Southwest’s computer system experienced technical problems.

The airline warned passengers flying Monday to arrive two hours early and print boarding passes before coming to the airport.

The Dallas-based company said it was using back-up systems to check-in travelers lacking printed or mobile boarding passes but technology problems that began Sunday morning were continuing. Southwest said about 450 of its 3,600 flights had been delayed.

Representatives for Southwest did not say what caused the problem or how long it would take to resolve. Spokesman Brad Hawkins said there was “absolutely no indication now” that the problems were the result of hacking.

Throughout the morning and early afternoon, employees at DIA and other airports were manually writing some airline tickets, officials said.

A Denver Post reporter who was at the airport Sunday morning said the check-in area was chaotic. Lines stretched well into the central terminal.

Last month, American Airlines experienced computer problems that prevented passengers from checking in and briefly halted flights on select routes. Airline officials said there was no indication that its system had been hacked.
