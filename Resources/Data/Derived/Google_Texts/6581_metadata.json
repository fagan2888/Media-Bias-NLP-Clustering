The lawmakers, wearing stickers that proclaimed \u201cACA works,\u201d touted the law as one of the strongest \u201cpillars of economic and healthcare success\u201d in legislative history.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe fact is we wrote an iron-clad constitutional bill so let us take credit,\u201d said Pelosi to cheers from the 100-person crowd. POLITICO was given exclusive access to the event. \u201cI hope you all take a great deal of personal satisfaction in what you did to make it happen and because of you\u2026. 17 million more Americans are insured. The quality of care has increased, the cost overtime is decreasing. It is a remarkable fulfillment.\u201d\n\nObamacare has faced a steady stream of court challenges, but the Supreme Court has twice sided with President Barack Obama\u2019s administration to rule that the federal government can impose a levy on individuals who don\u2019t purchase health insurance and that tax subsidies are available to individuals in any state.\n\nThe most recent decision, on the tax subsidies, came down in June.\n\nSenior Democrats have stood behind Obama\u2019s signature achievement, even as the law\u2019s popularity plummeted after it passed in 2010. Republicans capitalized on Obamacare\u2019s early troubles during the 2012 and 2014 elections, forcing some vulnerable Democrats to distance themselves from the law.\n\nAt the event, Pelosi said it was a \u201ccourageous\u201d vote for some Democrats that she argued was now paying off as more Americans get insured. The California Democrat praised Reid, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy and former Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) for their work to push the healthcare law forward.\n\n\u201cNancy, We did this together,\u201d Dingell shouted from the back of the room.\n\nReid said the two Supreme Court decisions were a \u201cstamp of approval\u201d that Democrats passed a significant piece of legislation.\n\n\u201cI feel so fulfilled about having a stamp of approval on two separate occasions from the Supreme Court and now maybe, maybe, finally\u2026. the naysayers, the Tea Party-driven Republicans, will leave the American people alone and let hem enjoy their healthcare,\u201d Reid said.\n\nBoth Pelosi and Reid thanked the attendees for their work on the healthcare law.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t of happened without you,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe guests included Democratic staffers from the House and Senate who helped craft the bill and industry supporters like the AARP. Reps. Louise Slaughter of New York, Xavier Becerra of California, Jared Polis of Colorado, Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, Maxine Waters of California and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut all attended, as did former Reps. Bart Stupak, George Miller, Rush Holt and Bart Gordon. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell and former secretary Kathleen Sebelius also attended.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Reid and Pelosi cheered on the Affordable Care Act just weeks after the Supreme Court's ruling.", "title": "Top Dems host party to celebrate Obamacare rulings", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/obamacare-rulings-democrats-party-120488.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/22/150722_reid_pelosi_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Congress,Health Care,Democrats,Nancy Pelosi,Supreme Court,Harry Reid,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Reid and Pelosi cheered on the Affordable Care Act just weeks after the Supreme Court's ruling.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Top Dems host party to celebrate Obamacare rulingsCongressional Democrats celebrated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold a core tenet of Obamacare during an intimate party on Wednesday hosted by the party\u2019s two senior-most lawmakers.\nthe naysayers, the Tea Party-driven Republicans, will leave the American people alone and let hem enjoy their healthcare,\u201d Reid said.\n\u201cI feel so fulfilled about having a stamp of approval on two separate occasions from the Supreme Court and now maybe, maybe, finally\u2026.\nReid said the two Supreme Court decisions were a \u201cstamp of approval\u201d that Democrats passed a significant piece of legislation.\nBoth Pelosi and Reid thanked the attendees for their work on the healthcare law."}
