Or, if the turns rekindled a dormant but unextinguished flame, the soon-to-be 16-year-old would reconnect with the sport she loves even though it robbed her of so much.\n\nOh, she fell Saturday. Over and over.\n\nEach time she pitched into the snow, she shook with laughter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny. It\u2019s like slow motion. I\u2019m falling. I\u2019m still falling,\u201d she said as National Sports Center for the Disabled ski instructors Ronnie Meadows and Yuka Kaneko propped her bucket-seated monoski back upright on the snow at Winter Park ski area. \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nKailyn\u2019s passion for skiing had blazed as the promising young freeskier climbed the ranks of the national halfpipe and slopestyle scene in recent years.\n\nThat fire dimmed in April when, warming up for a national competition, she overrotated a backflip on the Copper Mountain slopestyle course and landed on her neck. Even though she hasn\u2019t walked since that day, she never let that skiing flame go cold.\n\nOn Saturday \u2014 her first time back on snow since the day everything changed \u2014 that fire glowed as bright as ever.\n\nFor her return to skiing, she wore a T-shirt buried beneath her layers. It read: \u201cI am a skier.\u201d She arced graceful turns between several sudden, snowy face-plants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this day,\u201d she said. \u201cSo fun. It\u2019s nice to be doing something like this again. I haven\u2019t been on snow in forever. It\u2019s nice just doing it. Being outside. Getting tired. Being sore.\u201d\n\nThe relief was evident for her father, Mitch, who traveled the country with his daughter so she could compete in freeskiing contests and keeps videos of her top performances on his phone.\n\n\u201cStoke is stoke no matter how good you are or what you are doing,\u201d Mitch said.\n\nThat thrill and love for skiing can be the same for a veteran skier throwing jaw-dropping tricks in expert terrain as it is for a first-timer crashing down a green run. As of Saturday afternoon, Kailyn has been both of those skiers in the past year.\n\nMitch was nervous heading to Winter Park from his home in Eagle. While he suspected that Kailyn \u2014 who always excelled at every athletic endeavor \u2014 would take to sit-skiing quickly, he harbored a fear that it might not click. The frustration could be too much.\n\nSeeing her excited to at least try was enough for him to count the day as an overwhelming win before she even hit the slopes.\n\n\u201cComing into this, I didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Mitch said. \u201cI just wanted to see her out here. Just being out on the hill, riding on the lift, watching everyone skiing.\u201d\n\nKailyn was ready to fail and still love her new approach to skiing.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m going to be terrible,\u201d she said at the beginning of the day, as instructors outfitted her with a new ride. \u201cI always think about when I first started snowboarding. I hated it so much. It was the worst experience. But then I started to like it. Nothing is really fun when you don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d\n\nKailyn chose to ride a dual ski to start the day. Beneath a fiberglass molded, amply padded seat, a pair of hourglass-shaped skis roll from edge to edge like skis under a skier\u2019s boots. It\u2019s a more stable and forgiving ride than the monoski, which only has one ski and requires better balance moving from edge to edge.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try the two skis first,\u201d Kailyn said. \u201cJust to get a sense of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nGood idea, replied National Sports Center for the Disabled supervisor Jeremiah Baltzer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best way to get back out there and start having fun as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nBarely halfway down the beginner-dappled Marmot Flats run, Kailyn was linking turns. The high-fiving, cheerful instructor Meadows said it was time for her to graduate to the monoski.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cYou\u2019re ready for the next step.\u201d\n\nMitch woke early Saturday to go buy a brown-bag spread for lunch. Turkey sandwiches on bagels. A bag of Cheetos and strawberries with a can of whipped cream.\n\n\u201cI wanted it to be just like the old days,\u201d he said as Kailyn and her younger sister, Kiara, crowded a small table with their gear and food.\n\nShifting from her chair into the monoski \u2014 a sleek rig atop a purple K2 Empress powder ski Kailyn bought early last season for big snow days \u2014 Meadows makes sure Kailyn is cool with her wrapping her arms around Kailyn\u2019s body to hoist her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to invade your space,\u201d Meadows said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kailyn said, \u201cmy space was invaded a long time ago.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a glimpse of the new Kailyn. The fiercely independent teen who prided herself on her strength and resilience has yielded a bit. She needs some help and asks for it often, but her determination remains as vibrant as ever.\n\nThat\u2019s the most important thing to rebuilding a skier, said Scott Olson, the assistant coach at the National Sports Center for the Disabled and coach for the New Zealand Paralympic ski team.\n\n\u201cIn a monoski, it\u2019s all the same. It\u2019s about creating the same angles. As long as that person has a passion for skiing and enjoys themselves out there, they can do amazing things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be about having fun. Skiing is about having fun.\u201d\n\nNot a problem for Kailyn. She was grinning all day. As were her dad and sister. Their smiles said it all: They are back.\n\nKailyn barely hits the ground before she was wrestling with her ski-mounted outriggers, fighting to regain her ski position.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t used to falling. But she was unfazed.\n\n\u201cThis is so fun,\u201d she said. \u201cOne more time?\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or @jasonblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kailyn Forsberg returns to slopes for first time since April crash", "title": "Kailyn Forsberg returns to slopes for first time since April crash", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/kailyn-forsberg-returns-to-slopes-for-first-time-since-april-crash/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__Kailyn-Forsberg1p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__Kailyn-Forsberg1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T01:16:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:31:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kailyn said, \u201cmy space was invaded a long time ago.\u201dThat\u2019s a glimpse of the new Kailyn.\nOn Saturday \u2014 her first time back on snow since the day everything changed \u2014 that fire glowed as bright as ever.\nKailyn barely hits the ground before she was wrestling with her ski-mounted outriggers, fighting to regain her ski position.\nWINTER PARK \u2014On a windy and cold morning in the mountains, family and friends gathered for a ski day that could have gone two ways for Kailyn Forsberg\u2019s return to the snow.\nEven though she hasn\u2019t walked since that day, she never let that skiing flame go cold."}
