The Women's Place, which offers gynecological services to women, has announced its offices in Fayetteville and North Syracuse will be closing March 31.

The Women's Place offices, located at North Medical Center in North Syracuse and Fayetteville's Northeast Medical Center, are operated by St. Joseph's Physicians, an affiliate of St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center.

St. Joseph's Physicians is consolidating its services, leading to the closing, said Betsy Bedigian, speaking for the group.

"We have services available throughout the organization, through our maternal health center and other practices,'' she said. "We are optimizing the resources we currently have."

A total of six physicians provided services at the offices. Some have retired, some will stay with the St. Joseph's network and others are taking a different path, Bedigian said.

The two offices have been open for more than a decade. Bedigian said she isn't sure how many patients this will affect.

"We are notifying patients and helping them select other caregivers,'' she said.
