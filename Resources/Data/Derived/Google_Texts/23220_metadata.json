It served as a reminder of Obama\u2019s calm and focus while under pressure. He was steadfast in his belief that a peaceful resolution with Iran was possible as others pushed for military responses to perceived threats to American security.\n\nRather than succumb to the unconscionable acts of disrespect and betrayal by other major world and U.S. leaders, the president doubled down on his belief that the negotiations with Iran were not only a \u201cgood thing\u201d but also one of the best options available in quelling the possibility of a nuclear threat in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off, ask them a simple question,\u201d Obama said as he addressed a crowd of a few dozen journalists after reaching the agreement on Thursday. \u201cDo you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world\u2019s major powers is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East?\u201d\n\nThe question is a biting one. One that reminds Americans that while the environment within their own borders is relatively peaceful, soldiers overseas have not yet been able to come home.\n\nSoldiers are still active in Iraq and thousands of troops are still in Afghanistan, despite the formal end of combat in December of 2014.\n\nWhile members of Congress from both political parties had joined forces with foreign leaders to express disdain and a disheartening lack of trust in the president\u2019s foreign policy amid negotiations, arms-proliferation experts at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace also expressed how please they were with the framework.\n\nAccording to these experts, the president\u2019s own proclaimed skepticism of Iran and acknowledgement of a severe lack of trust were evident in the parameters of the deal.\n\n\u201cGeorge Perkovich, Carnegie\u2019s vice-president, said the deal\u2019s provisions to monitor the entire Iranian nuclear supply chain will give the US and its allies enhanced visibility to prevent a so-called \u2018sneak-out\u2019\u2014a surreptitious Iranian path to a bomb,\u201d The Guardian reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very positive development and represents significant progress,\u201d Perkovich said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nCritics who targeted the \u201clack of specificity on what happens to Iran\u2019s stockpile of 9,700 kg of low-enriched uranium\u201d as a reason to publicly defile and disrespect the president during ongoing negotiations were discredited by these experts who found no reason to be overly concerned with such specifications.\n\nCarnegie analyst James Acton was also \u201cunconcerned about the 1044-plus centrifuges Iran will be allowed to keep at its underground Fordow facility\u201d because the \u201cframework bars Iran from enriching uranium in those centrifuges.\u201d\n\nWhile the original deadline for the negotiations passed earlier this week, the deal was still enough to cause White House staffers to embrace one another while others partook in celebratory fist bumps.\n\nThe president, on the other hand, was one of the few who didn\u2019t seem to be in a celebratory mood.\n\nHis tense demeanor and stern disposition were evidence that Obama hardly quite as na\u00efve or passive as foreign powers like Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu suggested.\n\nHe was aware of the fact that Iran was an enemy of the U.S. and that an agreement built on trust and confidence in one another would be meaningless.\n\n\u201cThis deal is not based on trust,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s based on unprecedented verification.\u201d\n\nWhile the deal earned a passing grade from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, experts said the agreement perfect. U.S. powers hope to present a \u201cphased\u201d sanction relief plan while Iran wants to end the sanctions regime all at once in hopes to recover from its woeful economic state.\n\n\u201cI would anticipate that will be one of the obstacles vigorously negotiated over the coming months,\u201d Carnegie Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour noted, according to The Guardian.\n\nSadjadpour also emphasized the importance of shifting attention toward Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamanei, as he is expected to address the negotiations during his Friday sermon.\n\nThe push back was predictable, especially from Republicans, who chronically disrespect and refuse to support any of the president\u2019s positions. But there can be no denial: After more than a decade of various diplomatic powers attempting to address Iran\u2019s nuclear policy, it was Obama made the substantial gains.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "After months of being berated\u00a0and subjected to widespread doubt, President Barack Obama crafted an historic\u00a0deal with Iran over its nuclear policy, a monumental accomplishment considering the stakes and the challenge.
