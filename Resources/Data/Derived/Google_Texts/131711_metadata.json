McDonald's Sales Drop As Consumers Turn To Healthier Alternatives", "article_keywords": ["consumers", "menus", "food", "drop", "alternatives", "sales", "reign", "turn", "healthier", "fast", "way", "soda", "sustainable", "mcdonalds", "quarter", "chains"], "article_url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/reign-fast-food-over-mcdonalds-sales-drop-consumers-turn-healthier-alternatives-342202", "article_text": "Adult and childhood obesity rates are at a high, and we don\u2019t seem to be slowing down when it comes to big portions and the pride of fast food in America.\n\nYet something strange appears to be happening: Last year, McDonald\u2019s sales plummeted in their third quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, McDonald\u2019s sales in the U.S. fell by 2.6 percent, and the company cited difficulties in staying relevant as one of the main factors behind it.\n\nThat\u2019s possibly because fast food may be on its way out, and sustainable, healthy food may be on its way in.\n\nMore and more, the average consumer is becoming educated about what\u2019s in their food: from hormones and antibiotics, to trans fats and preservatives. The genetically modified organism (GMO) debate has also sparked controversy, and spurred major chains like Chipotle to remove GMO-laden ingredients from their menus. More and more research shows that drinking too much soda is killing you, and Dairy Queen is just one example of several fast food chains that have pulled soda from their kids menus, replacing it with healthier options.\n\nAnd fast food companies that were once kings, like McDonald\u2019s and KFC, now have competition in \u201cfast-casual\u201d chains like Chipotle and Panera, which focus on fresh, in-house made ingredients. New initiatives like the Daily Table grocery store are aiming to bring cheap, healthy vegetable options to poorer neighborhoods who are often priced out of all the organic foods.\n\nThe world is changing, and it\u2019s up to the fast food chains to decide whether they\u2019ll re-design themselves to meet the growing needs of consumers. If not, they may very well get washed away by newer, more sustainable, and more health-minded food initiatives.\n\nBrought to you by euroclinix.co.uk", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "reign, fast, food, over, mcdonalds, sales, drop, consumers, turn, healthier, alternatives", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Will fast food chains keep up with America\u2019s changing attitude about the way we eat?", "title": "Is The Reign Of Fast Food Over?
