FORT COLLINS — The CSU women’s volleyball team improved to 22-1, tailgating for Saturday night’s Border War between CSU and Wyoming is in full swing, and it’s also “Pink Out” for breast cancer awareness here at Hughes Stadium. The color scheme — brown for Wyoming, green for Colorado State and gold thrown in on both sides — is a bit jarring.

It looks as if fans are heeding CSU officials’ recommendation to leave earlier and arrive earlier than for the Utah State game last week, also a scheduled 5 p.m. start.

Over on campus, the nationally No. 6-ranked CSU volleyball team beat Utah State this afternoon — it started at noon to allow for possible doubleheader planning — at Moby Arena to improve to 22-1 for the season and 10-0 in the Mountain West.

Here’s sports editor Mike Brohard’s match story in our partner paper, the Loveland Reporter-Herald. It highlights features libero Jaime Colaizzi, the subject of my recent feature.
