The index represents an alternative to technology companies that rely purely on patients opinions of their appointments with individual practices that tend to focus on things like time, the personality and professionalism of the staff and personal feelings about the experience.\n\nThe company initially developed predictive analytics tools to help emergency rooms to improve efficiency by monitoring and analyzing ER operations and gather data to develop comparisons. The idea is to give staff a better idea of what to expect and offer more immediate feedback on what\u2019s happening inside the ER.\n\nThe headline on the Time article is a bit misleading. The analytics tools it is using is intended to take some of the bias out of the grades unlike a thrilled or unhappy customer review you would typically see on Yelp or any other individual review of a hospital or physician practice.\n\nThe article highlights how highly regarded hospitals like Massachusetts General and Cedars- Sinai Medical Center come away with less than stellar grades. But after a quick search of other hospitals, I found a relatively low profile hospital St Elizabeth Medical Center in Kenton County, Kentucky earns an A-.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor each hospital it shows how it compares with other which hospitals in the state, how it scored on four criteria for incoming, admitted and discharged patient flow and how often patients get frustrated. It also extracts data from the HCAHPS survey of patient satisfaction. The pie chart breaks down responses to each of the questions such as room cleanliness, nurse and physician communication, and noise levels at night.\n\nThe ability of companies like analyticsMD to use a variety of criteria to produce these grades allows them to offer a fuller picture than individual reviews and makes them more powerful. One downside is that it suggests each hospitals face the same challenges, which just isn\u2019t true. One hospital might have much more challenging patients or a busier ER than the next.\n\nThe index isn\u2019t designed to be relevant for someone figuring out which primary care physician to use in their region. But the company\u2019s approach does make one wonder how far off these kind of analytical tools are for people seeking a more objective assessment beyond reviews driven by opinion rather than results.\n\nPhoto: BigStock Photo", "article_metadata": {"description": "This health IT startup's analytics index grades hospital performance, efficiency using CMS and other publicly available data.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "This health IT startup's analytics index grades hospital performance, efficiency using CMS and other publicly available data.", "title": "This hospital performance benchmarks index offers deeper dive than typical ratings sites", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-Hospital-7444951.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-24T13:02:00-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/05/hospital-performance-analytics-index-trump-patient-reviews/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-Hospital-7444951.jpg", "description": "This health IT startup's analytics index grades hospital performance, efficiency using CMS and other publicly available data.", "card": "summary", "title": "This hospital performance benchmarks index offers deeper dive than typical ratings sites - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,analyticsMD, California, health IT, hospitals, Silicon Valley, Startups, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Health IT", "tag": "Startups", "published_time": "2015-05-23T12:51:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-24T13:02:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4333\"", "article_summary": "The index isn\u2019t designed to be relevant for someone figuring out which primary care physician to use in their region.\nOne hospital might have much more challenging patients or a busier ER than the next.\nThe company initially developed predictive analytics tools to help emergency rooms to improve efficiency by monitoring and analyzing ER operations and gather data to develop comparisons.\nThe article highlights how highly regarded hospitals like Massachusetts General and Cedars- Sinai Medical Center come away with less than stellar grades.\nBut after a quick search of other hospitals, I found a relatively low profile hospital St Elizabeth Medical Center in Kenton County, Kentucky earns an A-."}
