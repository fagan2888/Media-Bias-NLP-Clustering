How they're finding the funds is a new one too. They're adding a 3% charge onto diners' tabs to compensate for medical insurance.\n\nBill Chait\u2014who also owns popular restaurants like Rivera, Sotto, and Petty Cash\u2014thought long and hard before adding the surcharge onto the bill, but ultimately decided it would be worth the criticism\u2014and the restaurant is getting plenty of it on Yelp.\n\nSays KPCC:\n\n\u201cI would be lying to you if I didn\u2019t tell you this has been an aspiration to solve this issue over the years, so you don\u2019t get ruined by rising health care costs,\u201d said Chait. Under Obamacare, businesses like Republique with more than 50 full-time employees have to offer affordable health care benefits or pay fines. (This week, that mandate was delayed again, to 2016)\n\nThat's particularly crucial to Republique, whose 80-plus workers are all fulltime, from the bartenders down to the dishwashers.\n\nChait got the idea from San Francisco, where in 2011, restaurants in the City collected more than $14 million in health care surcharges. However, the program became controversial because it was discovered that only about a third of the money went towards health care, according to a report by the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement.\n\nHe promises his customers that won't be the case at Republique, and that the money will go exactly where it should: to the dedicated service workers that make his restaurant empire a reality.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LAist", "description": "Bill Chait -- who also owns popular restaurants like Picca, Rivera, Sotto, and Petty Cash -- thought long and hard before adding the surcharge onto the bill, but ultimately decided it would be worth the criticism, of which the restaurant's policy is getting plenty of on Yelp.", "title": "L.A.
