Paul LePage to \u2014 of all people \u2014 Ed Muskie.\n\nLePage\u2019s supporters envision him inheriting the transformative role played half a century ago by Muskie, the Democrat whose leadership propelled his party to four decades at the top of Maine\u2019s political food chain\n\nMixing a \u201cdamn the torpedoes\u201d public persona with his aggressive agenda, LePage is establishing a doctrine that Republicans believe will change Maine\u2019s political landscape for decades.\n\nA political doctrine is defined as \u201ca policy, position or principle advocated, taught or put into effect concerning the acquisition and exercise of the power to govern or administrate in society.\u201d\n\nEight years of the \u201cLePage doctrine\u201d will reverberate well beyond his time in office and are likely to weigh heavily on the Republicans\u2019 choice to run as his successor. It also will carve out a new course for the Maine GOP as the party strives to hold onto the political momentum that LePage has so effectively wrested from Democrats, who maintained it \u2014 with few exceptions \u2014 since Muskie\u2019s heyday.\n\nA little more than halfway through his tenure, what does the \u201cLePage doctrine\u201d look like as a work in progress?\n\nHe wields executive power in ways that no Maine governor has in decades.\n\n\u2014 In 2014, when state revenues weren\u2019t matching budgeted expenses, LePage refused to issue a supplemental budget bill and for months did not allow executive branch commissioners to testify to legislative committees. He weathered months of attacks from Democrats, who argued he was abdicating his constitutional responsibility. However, LePage was able to draw attention to the faults he saw in a compromise biennial budget that the Legislature enacted in 2013 over LePage\u2019s veto (he vetoed the supplemental budget, too). That budget used temporary tax increases to balance the books and scale back LePage\u2019s proposal to eliminate municipal revenue sharing. LePage said in his veto letter that Mainers couldn\u2019t afford higher sales and use taxes.\n\n\u2014 During his first term, LePage defied the will of a majority of Maine voters more than once when he refused to issue voter-approved bonds, using them as pawns to make the Legislature bend to his will. He did it in 2012, demanding an end to what he called out-of control government spending; in 2013, demanding that the Legislature agree to his plans for a $100 million prison bond and to pay off Medicaid debt to hospitals; and in 2014, when he wouldn\u2019t release tens of millions of dollars in bonds until the Legislature put $60 million in the rainy day fund. With the exception of the $100 million prison bond, LePage was successful on all of these fronts.\n\n\u2014 LePage staunchly opposed tax increases during his entire first term and said during both of his campaigns that he wouldn\u2019t support any tax increases whatsoever. Yet this year, in his biennial budget proposal, LePage caused jaws all over Maine to hit the floor when he advocated for increases in a variety of taxes, from raising and expanding the sales tax to allowing cities and towns to tax large nonprofit organizations. LePage argues that a corresponding cut in the income tax will yield a net decrease in Maine\u2019s tax burden, but his Republican colleagues, to date, have not shown enthusiasm for the plan.\n\n\u2014 One of the issues LePage has taken the most heat over was shooing international energy conglomerate Statoil out of Maine in 2013. Statoil was developing plans to test new floating wind turbine technology in the Gulf of Maine and possibly invest more than $100 million here until LePage stepped in and unraveled the deal. This move by LePage supports his overall opinion that wind power is too expensive and won\u2019t help Maine lower energy costs. Last month, LePage\u2019s most recent appointment to the Public Utilities Commission, Carlisle McLean, cast the deciding vote to reconsider the terms of two long-term wind energy purchasing deals which the PUC had preliminarily approved in December. This particular needle is moving in the direction LePage wants it to.\n\nHe pushes the boundaries of his authority.\n\n\u2014 LePage, who was the mayor of Waterville before being elected governor, has repeatedly tried to force his will on areas of government where he has no statutory authority, such as towns and cities. His persistence in cutting municipal revenue sharing, which he has called municipal welfare, is part of an effort to force towns and cities to reduce spending. His oft-repeated refrain is that local control is great but expensive.\n\n\u2014 Displeased with a bill enacted last year, over his veto, to fix a range of problems with county jails, LePage has simply refused to comply with the new law. Even though it gives him authority to appoint the majority of the Board of Corrections and thus control the board by proxy, LePage has refused to make any appointments. That resulted in the dissolution of the board and the resignations of its two staff members earlier this year. And it completely thwarted efforts to reform the county jail system, leaving lawmakers with the task of finding a solution he\u2019ll agree to by the end of June. All indications are that LePage will again achieve what he wants, which is to transfer oversight of county jails \u2014 along with funding responsibilities \u2014 back to the counties.\n\n\u2014 Since his re-election, LePage has intensified efforts to assert dominance over Maine Attorney General Janet Mills, a Democrat with whom he has clashed frequently and notably. Mills, for the most part, has been as aggressive against LePage and his initiatives as he has been against her. She has refused to legally represent LePage\u2019s efforts to sue the U.S. government over Affordable Care Act provisions and refused to defend his cuts to General Assistance for immigrants. Possibly complicating the situation is that Mills is being mentioned by some as the possible Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, which she has not ruled out. LePage, in turn, has said he will propose to make the attorney general and state treasurer elected by statewide vote and has for months refused to issue financial orders that would allow Mills to fill vacant positions in her office.\n\n\u2014 LePage has no authority over the state\u2019s public higher education institutions, but in January he called for the ouster of long-time Maine Community College System President John Fitzsimmons and then said that the system\u2019s trustees would feel his \u201cwrath\u201d if Fitzsimmons didn\u2019t leave. That threat was legitimized by the fact that LePage has proposed to flat-fund community colleges while giving the university system a modest funding increase. He has said openly that the flat-funding proposal results from what he says has been Fitzsimmons\u2019 failure to implement programs that LePage favors. Fitzsimmons resigned, and the system is launching a national search for his replacement.\n\nIs this the way effective chief executives should act?\n\n\u2014 \u201cAny good executive will try to stretch the bounds of their authority,\u201d said Jim Melcher, a political science professor at University of Maine at Farmington. \u201cAny president will try to use the powers of their office assertively. How much the governor seems to seek conflict with other people is what\u2019s distinctive, especially for a governor of Maine. \u2026 You can debate about whether or not [LePage\u2019s initiatives] are good things, but he\u2019s changed state government, how it works more than any other governor in my memory.\u201d\n\n\u2014 If LePage has a modern-times rival in terms of instituting controversial changes as governor, it was probably Democrat Ken Curtis, whose first term started in 1967. Curtis led the implementation of Maine\u2019s income tax in 1969, even though Republicans controlled the House and Senate. Ironically, LePage is trying to repeal the income tax.\n\n\u2014 LePage is not the only recent governor who has challenged other branches of government and risked irritating his party\u2019s loyalists. Democratic Gov. John Baldacci exerted his influence on local governments when he tried to consolidate public school administrations. When financial times were tough, he didn\u2019t always conform to traditional Democratic principles. In his second term, he angered many of his supporters when amid a national financial crisis, he led a successful effort for state employees to pay a portion of their personal health insurance premiums for the first time in years. He also froze their salaries.\n\n\u2014 Independent Gov. Angus King challenged norms \u2014 and still does as Maine\u2019s junior U.S. senator \u2014 with the very fact that he is not enrolled in a political party. King also went against labor unions who otherwise were supportive of him when he instituted a \u201cTotal Quality Management\u201d program in state government, which relied on increased use of technology and angered the unions.\n\nOK, so what is the \u2018LePage doctrine\u2019?\n\nAfter more than two decades combined in the Maine Legislature and Congress, Baldacci governed by pulling his allies together to come up with solutions. As someone whose government experience was shaped by the emphasis on legislative process, his style relied on government by committee to reach collaborative solutions.\n\nWithout a party to do groundwork for his initiatives, King had to build State House alliances to achieve anything. Like Baldacci, he was forced to yield some power to the Legislature as a way of avoiding stalemate.\n\nThat\u2019s not the LePage way. Years of staredown negotiations in the private sector have conditioned him to seek leverage, not consensus, when working to advance his agenda.\n\nThat experience and worldview boils the \u201cLePage doctrine\u201d down to simply: \u201cI\u2019m the CEO and I know what is best for Maine.
