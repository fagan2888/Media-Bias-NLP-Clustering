The DSH program reimburses hospitals for a portion of the costs associated with providing care to Medicare, Medicaid or underinsured patients.\n\nRedmond Regional Medical Center also is facing cuts that CEO John Quinlivan called \u201cvery material.\u201d\n\nThe federal DSH program, which has been around since 1981, has become the largest source of funds for uncompensated care to these health care facilities.\n\nThere are two types of DSH programs \u2014 one administered through Medicare, the other administered by the state Medicaid program.\n\nKenneth Metteauer, chief financial officer at Redmond, said the state-administered program tied to Medicaid will be most problematic for many Georgia hospitals.\n\nGeorgia did not expand its Medicaid program to include the working poor, as was anticipated by the ACA. The expansion was supposed to lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured patients across the country.\n\nMetteauer said that Medicaid DSH payments to Redmond totaled $681,382 in 2015 and are at $443,876 so far this year.\n\nFMC Vice President for Finance Rick Sheerin said the latest plan from Washington is to reduce the DSH allotment budget by up to $2 billion in the 2018 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 2017. The cuts are slated to increase to $8 billion by FY 2025.\n\nThe county\u2019s public, nonprofit hospital received $4.5 mil-\n\nlion in DSH payments in FY 2012. That increased to $5.7 million in FY 2013, to $6.8 million in FY 2014 and $5.8 million in FY 2015.\n\nFMC officials anticipate getting $4.4 million for FY 2016 \u2014 which runs through Sept. 30 \u2014 and $3.4 million in FY 2017.\n\nBut Sheerin said care for uninsured and underinsured patients costs the hospital more than that.\n\nHe said unreimbursed charity care was roughly $13.5 million in FY 2015. Writing off bad debt was another $13 million, and FMC\u2019s loss on Medicaid patients was about $9.7 million. However, he noted that the total losses were down about $4 million from the previous fiscal year.\n\nStuenkel said the numbers are high, but have been fairly predictable in recent years. And officials have been preparing for the DSH cuts.\n\n\u201cThe way you post a profit in running a hospital is you get paying patients who are willing to come,\u201d Stuenkel said. \u201cThat\u2019s been our volume increase, that\u2019s really the answer.\u201d\n\nFMC reported a profit of $32.9 million for FY 2015. Stuenkel said patient volume was up 10 percent, net revenue increased $51 million but net expenses were up only $27 million.\n\nStuenkel said the hospital also has focused more on how it confirms patients\u2019 insurance and helping enroll uninsured patients who are eligible for some kind of plan.\n\n\u201cThose things we did to improve the revenue cycle had a very dramatic effect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also eliminated a lot of positions through attrition, we renegotiated supply contracts \u2014 and all of (the changes) hit in full force in a positive manner in 2015.\u201d\n\nStuenkel said the hospital did not increase its rates any more than normal to generate additional revenue.\n\n\u201cBlue Cross, United Healthcare and all the others \u2014 we have contracts with them and you can\u2019t arbitrarily increase your rates, it\u2019s a very small amount each year,\u201d Stuenkel said.\n\n\u201cAnd Medicare and Medicaid increases are set by the federal and state budgets. So to increase your revenue you\u2019ve got to do the things that we did, collect better and increase your volumes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "Floyd Medical Center is expecting to lose reimbursements of about $5 million a year under a provision of Obamacare linked to expanded Medicaid coverage.", "title": "Feds cutting payments for safety-net hospitals", "url": "http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/feds-cutting-payments-for-safety-net-hospitals/article_3fcdd548-11b3-11e6-b0c1-0b88d06cf159.html", "image": {"width": 964, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/16/61677ec6-0e60-11e6-b0fb-377a60896a29/5723eb437fe9c.image.jpg?resize=964%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Floyd Medical Center is expecting to lose reimbursements of about $5 million a year under a provision of Obamacare linked to expanded Medicaid coverage.", "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,710194472,654195704", "app_id": 551345941562032}, "keywords": "local", "news_keywords": "local"}, "article_summary": "Metteauer said that Medicaid DSH payments to Redmond totaled $681,382 in 2015 and are at $443,876 so far this year.\nThat increased to $5.7 million in FY 2013, to $6.8 million in FY 2014 and $5.8 million in FY 2015.\nThe DSH program reimburses hospitals for a portion of the costs associated with providing care to Medicare, Medicaid or underinsured patients.\nGeorgia did not expand its Medicaid program to include the working poor, as was anticipated by the ACA.\nThere are two types of DSH programs \u2014 one administered through Medicare, the other administered by the state Medicaid program."}
