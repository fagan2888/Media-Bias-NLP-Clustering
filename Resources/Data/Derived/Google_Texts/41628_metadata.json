Mark R. Warner shake hands before their debate hosted by the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce Oct. 7 in McLean, Va. (Bill O'Leary/Associated Press)\n\nAt nearly every campaign stop, U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D) boasts of his cross-party endorsement from retired Republican senator John W. Warner.\n\nAnd why not? The elder statesman\u2019s penchant for bipartisan collaboration earned him widespread support and admiration.\n\n\u201cThere is something special about the Virginia Way, and John Warner has represented that every day of his public service,\u201d Mark Warner told a University of Virginia crowd charmed by the feisty 87-year-old, who affectionately pointed his cane at the sitting senator.\n\nIf the younger Warner wins big on Tuesday, he will stand one step closer to joining his friend and predecessor in Virginia\u2019s pantheon of politicians who prevail election after election, even when the political climate is rough.\n\nBut in a difficult year, when widespread antipathy toward President Obama is fueling predictions that Republicans could take over the Senate, there\u2019s a very real flipside to consider, which is what happens if Warner doesn\u2019t win big.\n\nSen.

(Suzanne Carr Rossi/Associated Press)\n\nAll public polls predict that Warner will defeat his opponent, former lobbyist Ed Gillespie, who also served as chairman of the Republican National Committee. But surveys have narrowed considerably since summer, with Warner\u2019s lead shrinking to as little as seven points in a poll released Friday.\n\nWarner, who made millions in the cellphone industry, has prided himself on deep support from Republicans and independents, driven largely by his business experience and a reputation as a moderate dealmaker earned when he was governor a decade ago.\n\nBut being a senator in the party of Obama is a different story, and the polls show that Warner has lost significant support in rural Virginia \u2014 areas that have grown more Republican over the president\u2019s tenure. Warner is likely to get a boost from blue-leaning population growth near Washington. But Tuesday\u2019s results could mark an end to the era when politicians from either party could appeal to voters in the commonwealth\u2019s urban and rural areas alike.\n\nIt could be a day of reckoning for Warner, who has prided himself on exactly that appeal.\n\nNarrowing the gap\n\nThe stakes are high for Gillespie, too.\n\nA come-from-behind win for the longtime Republican operative would turn Virginia politics on its head. Even if Gillespie loses by a slim margin, he could parlay a loss into a position of strength to launch a future statewide campaign or assume a leadership role in a badly fractured state party that he has worked to unify.\n\nA poll from Christopher Newport University released Friday showed just seven points separating the candidates, with Warner garnering 51 percent of likely voters to Gillespie\u2019s 44 percent.\n\n\u201cEven if his campaign style is somewhat centrist, his voting record is not,\u201d said Evan Draim, a 20-year-old student from Mount Vernon who was the youngest delegate to the 2012 Republican National Convention. \u201cI think Mark Warner talks a good game, but when he\u2019s in the Senate, it doesn\u2019t hold up.\u201d\n\nMark D. Obenshain, a Republican state senator from Harrisonburg, said the poll confirms what he has felt on the ground as one of Gillespie\u2019s most active surrogates.\n\n\u201cIf there is a national move, Mark Warner may be in trouble,\u201d said Obenshain, who narrowly lost last year\u2019s attorney general race. Like Gillespie, Obenshain is widely seen as a potential contender for governor in 2017. \u201cThe question is, has it built up soon enough?\u201d\n\nTom Davis, a former GOP congressman from Northern Virginia, gave Gillespie points for uniting the party but warned Republicans to measure their expectations.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see him doing well downstate,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe problem is, when you come to Northern Virginia, you hit a kind of blue wall.\u201d\n\nStill, if Gillespie loses by single digits against Warner \u2014 whom Davis called \u201cthe strongest elk in the Democratic herd\u201d \u2014 Davis said the Republican will have earned his place as a contender in future GOP contests.\n\nGillespie was very focused on the present, however, as he rallied supporters Saturday at a campaign office in Haymarket.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to shock the world on Tuesday,\u201d he told the enthusiastic crowd. The future he\u2019s thinking about beyond Election Day, he said, is \u201cthe transition.\u201d\n\nWarner maintains a lead in every region of Virginia except the state\u2019s deeply conservative southern and southwestern regions, where the CNU poll shows his statewide margin turned on its head. That\u2019s a big shift for a candidate who won his 2001 gubernatorial bid with a now-famous effort to lure rural voters that included a turkey shoot photo op, putting his name on a NASCAR truck and playing a bluegrass jingle at campaign events.\n\nMuch has changed in the commonwealth since that race \u2014 and even since 2008, when Warner soundly defeated another former governor, Republican James S. Gilmore III, the same year Virginia elected its first Democratic president in 40 years.\n\nSince then, southwestern Virginians have replaced every Democratic lawmaker from the General Assembly with Republicans; they even ousted Rick Boucher, the region\u2019s 28-year veteran of Congress.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the president is very unpopular in Southwest Virginia,\u201d said Terry Frye, a longtime Democratic activist from Bristol.\n\nFrye said a blue strain remains in the region, driven largely by coal miners whose allegiances lay for generations with union-friendly Democrats. His wife, Aviva Shapiro Frye, who heads the state Democratic Party\u2019s rural caucus, said she has seen \u201cWe Miss Rick\u201d bumper stickers at the local Wal-Mart.\n\nThat may explain why Warner is spending much of the last weekend before Election Day in the region with rural Democrats including Boucher and Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam.\n\n\u201cHe knows where Virginia starts, and it\u2019s the mountains of southwest,\u201d Aviva Shapiro Frye said.\n\nA shift in Virginia\n\nThose allegiances have been tested by rural mistrust of Obama \u2014 notably his advocacy for tough new regulations governing coal-fired power plants. Although Warner supports the extension of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline and has taken no position on the proposed Environmental Protection Agency rules, he has campaigned for the need to combat climate change. And Gillespie has sought to exploit the Democrat\u2019s connection to the administration on environmental issues.\n\nAware of the ways Virginia has shifted \u2014 and the need to draw greater support from the state\u2019s deep-blue strongholds to offset new weakness elsewhere \u2014 Warner has campaigned differently this year. He has appealed more directly to the ideological base of his own party than he did 13 years ago. He has inserted attack lines about abortion, birth control and the push for a higher minimum wage into his debate performances, although his many television commercials have steered clear of social issues entirely.\n\n\u201cI see in Mark Warner what we hope for the country, which is we can solve our problems and we can in a bipartisan way get our act together,\u201d said Stewart Gamage, who was an intern for Linwood Holton, Virginia\u2019s first Republican governor since Reconstruction, and later worked for Democrats on Capitol Hill. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly practical at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Warner has also used his considerable fundraising lead to produce TV commercials that pound on Gillespie\u2019s background as an Enron lobbyist \u2014 widely seen as a sign that the senator is taking no chances in a tightening race.\n\nEven former Republican lawmakers backing Warner are realistic about his margin.\n\nJohn Chichester, a former state senator from Fredericksburg who helped shepherd Warner\u2019s tax overhaul through the legislature a decade ago, said: \u201cSome of the ads that have come out of the Warner campaign have not been pleasing to the ear.\u201d\n\nFormer state senator Russ Potts, another Warner Republican, praised Gillespie for the strategy of seizing on Warner\u2019s voting record as a way to connect him to Obama. (Gillespie says regularly that Warner has voted with Obama 97 percent of the time, but the Warner camp retorts that the figure represents mostly procedural votes and doesn\u2019t reflect all the votes where Obama didn\u2019t take a stand.)\n\n\u201cThe Gillespie camp has done a very effective job \u2014 even though I don\u2019t agree with a lot of the things their message says \u2014 of tying him to Obama,\u201d Potts said.\n\nGillespie has also seized on questions over Warner\u2019s call to the son of state Sen. Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell) to discuss job options \u2014 including a federal judgeship and private-sector employment \u2014 for the lawmaker\u2019s daughter. Puckett\u2019s resignation threw control of the General Assembly to Republicans and hurt Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s goal of expanding Medicaid health coverage to low-income Virginians under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAt the end of the day, John Warner said Mark Warner deserves a second term and the commonwealth needs his clout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not knocking his opponent or anything,\u201d the elder statesman said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve had a good race, and Virginia needed it. . . . But [Gillespie] does not have 10 years of being in Virginia. The knowledge of how to deal with the General Assembly and how to deal with the governor\u2019s office and how to deal with the state agencies is invaluable.\u201d\n\nLaura Vozzella contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The longtime politician has changed his strategy as the polls indicate a commonwealth shifting allegiances.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The longtime politician has changed his strategy as the polls indicate a commonwealth shifting allegiances.", "title": "Incumbent Warner pulls out all the stops as Va.
