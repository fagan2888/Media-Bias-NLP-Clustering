Last week, the GAO found that 11 fake applications were re-enrolled in Obamacare earlier this year and continued to get subsidies. The applications were re-enrolled without new documentation.\n\nOpponents of the healthcare law said the latest findings are indicative of rampant mismanagement with the program, while supporters countered that the GAO's undercover investigation isn't complete.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government and the states have no idea what happened to billions of dollars given to create Obamacare's exchanges, according to a federal watchdog.\nThe Government Accountability Office charged the Obama administration and many state-run healthcare exchanges with not adequately tracking federal funding, according to a report in the libertarian Reason magazine on Monday.\nThe GAO report, which is still in draft form, comes as the administration is taking heat for not properly screening fake Obamacare applications.\nThe watchdog's latest finding focuses on grant funding for state-run marketplaces from September 2010 to March 2015, Reason reported.\nNeither the states examined by the GAO nor the administration detailed how grant funding for information-technology projects was spent.\nAlso, the states and the administration didn't track how much of $2.78 billion in Medicaid matching funds was used to fund exchange operations or development, according to Reason, which did not name the states implicated in the draft report.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Washington Examiner.
