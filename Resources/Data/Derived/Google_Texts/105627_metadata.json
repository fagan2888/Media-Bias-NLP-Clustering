As of 2012, more than 1.5 million living veterans served in more than one war, according to the Census Bureau. While a plurality of veterans, 9.6 million, are age 65 or older, nearly 1.8 million veterans are under the age of 35. Alaska is the state with the highest percentage of veterans, with 13.6 percent of its adult population having served in the military.\n\nSAYING GOODBYE TO THE GREATEST GENERATION - Memories of service to the country remain still strong even as reunions for World War II veterans become sparsely attended. Sixty-eight years after the end of the world\u2019s most destructive conflict, the AP has moving details as Americans consider what the nation is losing as the number of veterans of the greatest generation dwindle.\n\n\u201cDad, you can't remember what you ate yesterday, but you remember everything about World War II.\u201d \u2013 Susan Frymier, daughter of 92 year-old veteran B-25 bomber pilot Paul Young.\n\nBecause no one has ever said it better - Watch the video of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s speech commemorating the Allied invasion of Normandy, via RCP. \u201cHere, in this place where the West held together, let us make a vow to our dead.

OBAMACARE NUMBERS TO BE REVEALED - The Obama administration has promised to release figures on how many paying customers ObamaCare attracted in October, the first month of the new entitlement program. Officials aggressively downplayed once rosy expectations for the numbers citing the technical problems with the Web site. Even with millions desperate to find coverage after losing their existing policies under the law, enrollment is expected to be direly low. Other factors: sticker shock and public confusion over the requirements and penalties under the law. If the numbers are very low, it will be difficult for the administration to refuse calls from Democrats and Republicans to delay the fines for those who do not enroll.\n\nDowntime and delays for Healthcare.gov - In addition to its daily scheduled 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. daily maintenance, customers on ObamaCare\u2019s Web site may find delays in the application process through Tuesday as technicians prepare for the end-of-month re-launch, officials have warned.\n\n[Watch Fox: Rep.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who is leading the charge to broker a deal with Iran, responded to French skepticism, saying he wants to keep the pressure on.

Netanyahu told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that it\u2019s an opinion held by many of America\u2019s allies in the region: \u201cThere are many Arab leaders in the region who are saying this is a very bad deal\u2026 And you know when you have the Arabs and the Israelis speaking in one voice, it doesn't happen very often, I think it's worth paying attention to it.\u201d\n\nSYRIA REBELS CONCEDE ON TALKS - The leaders of some of Syria\u2019s rebel forces have agreed after weeks of battlefield reversals and a worsening outlook for victory to join talks with the Syrian government if it allows humanitarian aid to begin to flow to rebel-held communities.

Scott Berg\u2019s new doorstop-sized biography of Wilson, the father of modern Democratic liberalism. Shlaes being the author of the definitive biography of the anti-Wilson, President Calvin Coolidge, may have something to do with the unsparing nature of her review for The National Interest: \u201cThat Wilson could not recognize the damage he perpetrated hardly constitutes an excuse for historians to downplay it. The discussion over what variety of Protestant or narcissist Wilson was has been long, interesting and stimulating, but the next biographer would do well to focus on his policies in a more thorough and sustained fashion. America\u2019s early progressives, presidents and others, require at this moment not canonization but invigilation.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Chris Christie, R-N.J., is quickly becoming the establishment favorite for the presidential sweepstakes of 2016. But not without significant pushback from a large portion of the party. See the NYT write up.\n\nThe battle for the heart of the GOP will be ever-present ahead of the first caucus in Iowa 2016. Expect the pushback to Christie's full-court Sunday show appearances to materialize very soon.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.\n\nCHRISTIE IN A MELLOW(ER) MOOD - Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., came storming out of his Tuesday re-election with an unprecedented media blitz, even hitting Michael J. Fox\u2019s sitcom and scheduling a quadruple blast of Sunday shows. Perhaps sensitive to accusations of being overweening, Christie struck a somewhat milder tone than what Americans have become accustomed to from him. Christie did not respond to criticism from fellow potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., telling \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace, \u201cI\u2019m not getting into that Washington game. That\u2019s why people hate Washington, D.C.; that kind of garbage.\u201dChristie took a neutral tone on a potential presidential bid but told those in the GOP considering a run to \u201cget the job done.\u201d Watch the interview here.\n\nTHEY\u2019RE JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, HILLARY - New Republic Editor Noam Scheiber considers the influence Sen.

Supporters of Bevin tell The Hill there is a \u201c50-50 chance\u201d the group could wade into the race, potentially delivering millions of dollars to bombard Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. While McConnell has the support of former Club for Growth President Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., Bevin has received the backing of the Senate Conservative Fund, founded by former Sen. Jim DeMint. The survivor of the costly Republican contest will likely go on to face Allison Lundergan Grimes, who faces no serious primary opposition and for whom national Democrats are amassing a giant war chest.\n\nTEA PARTY EXPRESS: LAW DIDN\u2019T LET US TO HELP CUCCINELLI - \u201cA comment last week misstated Tea Party Express\u2019 support for Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli.
