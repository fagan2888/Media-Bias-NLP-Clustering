Here are five examples:\n\n1. \"The issue which has energized me to get into this race is the recent attempt by certain Republican legislators to repeal NJ's ban on assault weapons.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat quote attributed to Christie -- contained in the biography \u201cChris Christie: The Inside Story of His Rise to Power\u2019\u2019 -- is from April 1993 when Christie announced that he would challenge incumbent state Sen.r John Dorsey in the Republican primary. Christie in an interview on Fox News Tuesday night said he couldn\u2019t recall it, telling \"Special Report\" host Brett Baier, \"I don't remember saying that...so, we'll see.\" Christie continued, \u201c\"That's ... 22 years ago? I don't remember. I could've ... it doesn't sound like me.\"\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share NJ Governor Chris Christie responds to a question regarding ammunition magazine legislation at the town hall meeting held at the YMCA in Mount Laurel.\n\n2. \u201cI do not remember that, and so it's not something that was part of my recollection. I think if it had happened, I would remember it, but, you know, there could be things I forget, too.\"\n\nChristie said that to reporters on the campaign trail in New Hampshire Sunday when asked for his reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s comments that he saw \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey, referring to Arab and Muslim Americans, cheering as the World Trade Center came down on 9/11. Christie was offered the job of U.S. Attorney for New Jersey the day before the attacks.\n\n3. \u201cWhen he got the contract, I knew nothing about it. I didn\u2019t know him. I had no relationship with him. Nor did I have any influence or knowledge of who was going to run the concessions at World Trade Center 1, nor quite frankly, do I care.\u2019\u2019\n\nThis one is about Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Christie said this in a radio interview on Jan. 15 during the storm over the gifts he received from Jones after Legends Hospitality, co-owned by Jones, had been awarded a World Trade Center concessions contract by the Port Authority. A 2013 Port Authority press release on the contract stated: \u201cThe Board\u2019s vote followed yesterday\u2019s call from Governors Cuomo and Christie to endorse the award of a contract to Legends to bring a world-class observation deck to what will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.\u2019\u2019\n\n4. \u201cThe notion that I would eliminate, change, or alter your pension is not only a lie, but cannot be further from the truth. Your pension and benefits will be protected when I am elected governor.\"\n\nChristie said that in a 2009 letter to law enforcement officers during his first campaign for governor. Patrick Colligan, the head of the state\u2019s police union, said earlier this month, \"We would appreciate Gov. Christie holding to the sacred trust promise he made when he was a candidate for governor in 2009 and meeting his obligation to fully fund the pension system.\"\n\n5. \"We just won a major court decision supporting the pension reforms that we put into place in 2011.\"\n\nChristie said that in an ABC News interview in June. But the court \u2018s finding was that the reforms were unconstitutional. Christie\u2019s lawyers argued the state couldn\u2019t be held to making payments promised under the 2011 law.\n\nBob Jordan 609-984-4343, bjordan@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
