He isn\u2019t trying to sell gold, silver or freeze-dried food. He was managing partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an assistant to Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and wrote well-regarded books on international finance.\n\nAnd he isn\u2019t alone in issuing warnings.\n\n\u201cWe expect the bottom to fall out by the second quarter of 2014,\u201d Trends Research Institute founder Gerald Celente predicted last October.\n\nBecause the dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, America is, in effect, the real world bank. Soon there\u2019ll be a run on it, though, because our massive deficits have eroded foreign investors\u2019 faith in the safety of the dollar, Mr. Means said.\n\nThe run on the bank \u201cwill start suddenly, build quickly and snowball,\u201d Mr. Means said. \u201cInterest rates will skyrocket, businesses will fail, unemployment will go to record levels.\u201d\n\nIt will start when we add \u201canother trillion dollars or so\u201d to our debt, Mr. Means wrote in The Washington Times Oct. 25, 2012. The national debt \u2014 $16.3 trillion when he wrote those words \u2014 is $17.3 trillion now.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board has financed much of our debt by, in effect, printing money. This has kept interest rates near zero, which has been good for banks and the stock market but has clobbered savings and investment and slowed economic growth.\n\nThe Fed must stop \u201cquantitative easing\u201d before all our seed corn is consumed. But when it does, \u201cinterest rates will go up and the economy will go down,\u201d Mr. Celente said.\n\nThe decline in manufacturing orders in January was the steepest in more than 30 years, the latest evidence the U.S. economy is \u201cexhausted,\u201d said David Goldman, who used to oversee bond research at the Bank of America. A little nudge could push it into recession.\n\nObamacare could provide that nudge \u2014 in March.\n\nThe entire health-care industry will be at risk if the Obamacare website isn\u2019t working better by mid-March, said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in December, in explaining why there isn\u2019t enough time to select a contractor to fix it through the normal bidding process.\n\nHealthcare.gov is like \u201cthe facade of a house with nothing behind it,\u201d said Larry Kocot of the Brookings Institution. People no longer have (much) difficulty accessing it. But the \u201cback end\u201d \u2014 the portion of the website that calculates subsidies and passes on to insurance companies information about enrollees \u2014 remains under construction.\n\nMany experts doubt the \u201cback end\u201d can be fixed in time. After the CMS document was made public, Moody\u2019s downgraded the outlook for the health insurance industry to \u201cnegative.\u201d\n\nObamacare has a problem more fundamental than its website. If sign-ups continue at January\u2019s pace, enrollment will fall about 1.4 million short of the 7 million the Congressional Budget Office estimated by the March 31 deadline.\n\nTo arrive at her figure of 1.146 million signups in January, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius counted those who\u2019ve filled out a form but who haven\u2019t paid their first month\u2019s premium, a prerequisite for actually being enrolled. At least 20 percent haven\u2019t paid, according to some reports.\n\nEnrollments fell 29 percent in January from December, with the pace of signups slowing as the month wore on. If enrollments were to continue to decline at that rate, then by the deadline, only a little more than 4 million may be signed up \u2014 far short of what\u2019s required to make Obamacare viable.\n\nAll of the world\u2019s largest economies are struggling. China is about to prick a credit bubble much larger than the one that subprime mortgages created here.\n\nDeflating so large a bubble gently is tricky, writes Patrick Legland and Wei Yao of Societe Generale. A misstep by China\u2019s rulers could send a deflationary tsunami through world equity markets.\n\nSome folks are passing around a chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since July of 2012 that also shows the average for the year and a half before the 1929 crash. They\u2019re eerily similar. The parallels may not continue. If they do, the charts indicate we\u2019re about two months away from the big plunge.\n\nBeware the Ides of March.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Our Economy Is About to Implode | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/02/23/the_end_may_be_near_thanks_to_obamacare_121687.html", "image": "/articles/topicons/jack_kelly.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Our Economy Is About to Implode | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Our Economy Is About to Implode | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Obamacare,economy,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cd8\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Means isn\u2019t a doomsayer who\u2019s predicted 11 of the last two recessions.\nFor the United States, and the world economy, the Ides will be around March 4 this year, predicted Grady Means in October 2012.\nThe run on the bank \u201cwill start suddenly, build quickly and snowball,\u201d Mr. Means said.\nSoon there\u2019ll be a run on it, though, because our massive deficits have eroded foreign investors\u2019 faith in the safety of the dollar, Mr. Means said.\nBut when it does, \u201cinterest rates will go up and the economy will go down,\u201d Mr. Celente said."}
