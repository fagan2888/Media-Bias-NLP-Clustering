And normally judges don\u2019t reward people standing before them by letting them take a bag of chips from a snack basket for their good deeds.\n\nBut Denver is doing things differently in a special Recovery Court designed to rehabilitate the city\u2019s most troubled offenders.\n\nIt is a brilliant idea with a goal of targeting the most frequent offenders in Denver\u2019s criminal justice system, those who are in and out of jail dozens of times a year for mostly low-level public-nuisance offenses.\n\nBy combing through data from the city\u2019s jail and hospital and marrying that information with wrap-around social services, the city is setting up a smart way to try to rehabilitate some of the Denver\u2019s usual suspects.\n\nCity officials used arrest records and court appearances to identify the top 300 offenders \u2014 the chronically homeless who averaged 36 court cases over a seven-year period. An analysis found this group costs the city about $11 million a year to arrest, jail, adjudicate and treat at Denver Health.\n\nThrough a pilot project, the city\u2019s Crime Prevention & Control Commission is trying to find a better way to deal with these offenders and possibly rehabilitate them.\n\nThe program, run through Denver County Court , pulls people out of jail, gets them into court-supervised probation, puts them into temporary housing, offers them help with their addictions and provides them with daily supervision from a crack team of caseworkers from the Mental Health Center of Denver. Among the caseworkers is former Denver Broncos safety Tyrone Braxton.\n\nThe offenders must want the help, be willing to enter drug and alcohol treatment, have no other resources, and basically be at the end of their ropes.\n\nOfficials say the program could save the city millions spent on jail time, court costs and hospitalizations.\n\n\u201cThe numbers look really good,\u201d said Denver County Judge James Breese, who runs the court. \u201cWay fewer missed court days, fewer jail bed days. And there are a number of people who are really on track to pull out of this. Some never will, but I think a third can become normal citizens.\u201d\n\nCurrently, 40 people are in the four-step program. So far, no one has graduated past Phase II. But some are close.\n\nOne, a 30-year-old former drug-addicted prostitute, had been piling up arrests through her adult life. (Her name is being withheld out of privacy concerns.) No program had been able to help \u2014 until now.\n\nAt a recent court hearing, the woman looked presentable with neatly combed hair and wearing business attire.\n\nShe has been clean and sober for months. She is doing regular volunteer work, gets regular drug and alcohol counseling, and is taking culinary arts classes through the Mental Health Center of Denver. She must still attend weekly Recovery Court dates. On a recent Wednesday, the woman sat with the other participants on wooden courtroom benches in the downtown Denver jail. They waited their turn to speak to Judge Breese about their progress.\n\nWhen a caseworker calls a name to approach the judge, everyone applauds.\n\nIf they have done well, Breese praises them and lets them grab chips or bottled water from the basket.\n\nIf they had troubles, there is a different response. Some have had a hot UA (urinalysis) or missed counseling sessions. The punishment could range from withholding a visit to the basket to being remanded back to jail.\n\nWhen the 30-year-old woman appeared before Breese, he beamed. \u201cYou look great,\u201d Breese said.\n\nShe has passed the program\u2019s first phase and is thriving in the second phase \u2014 proving she can maintain a sober lifestyle.\n\nShe told the judge her children are showing more respect. She is enjoying her cooking classes and clearly seems on the rebound. She then walked with purpose from the courtroom to the applause of her peers, head held high and a bag of chips in her hand.\n\nShouldn\u2019t this be what the criminal justice system is about? Punish people who deserve it and rehabilitate those who need the help. In less than a year, the program has shown success \u2014 fewer arrests, fewer days in jail and fewer hospital visits.\n\nRecovery Court costs the city about $1,045 per person every month \u2014 an expense being paid through grants and general funds. Compare that to the $3,300 per person the top 300 cost the city every month to arrest, jail, adjudicate and provide health care.\n\n\u201cThis is a high-needs population,\u201d said Regina Huerter, director of the Crime Prevention and Control Commission. \u201cWe are going to pay one way or another. So why not be smart about how we pay for them?\u201d\n\nIn the six months before starting the recovery program, the 40 participants had been booked into jail a total of 95 times. After six months in the program, the same 40 had been booked 49 times, usually when Judge Breese remanded them. There have been successes and failures. Some participants have prospered, while others have returned to jail.\n\n\u201cOne-third have never gone back (to jail), knock on wood,\u201d said Cindy Laub, management analyst with the Crime Prevention & Control Commission \u201cProbably a third have gone back once or twice for a short stay. And we have others who are so highly needing more intense services than the case managers can provide.\u201d\n\nThe program has also reduced hospital visits. Six months before entering the program, 36 of the participants accounted for 347 visits to Denver Health\u2019s detox facility. After six months in the program, the same 36 had logged just 100 visits. All participants have signed up for the Affordable Care Act, and are now registered for other federal benefits.\n\nIn the past, the city would jail them and then send them out on the streets, where they would have the same problems and get re-arrested.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t addressing the underlying issues,\u201d Huerter said. \u201cWe are now trying to identify what they need and remove those barriers and get them to the right services.\u201d\n\nToward the end of a busy day in Recovery Court, a caseworker called out a new name. The 65-year-old man was still in custody, wearing a prisoner-issued jumpsuit. He was a candidate for the program \u2014 one of the 300 who are constantly being arrested.\n\nA look at his crime record shows a man deeply in trouble, with arrests since the early 1970s: robberies, assaults, drug possession, DUIs, trespassing. If he accepts the challenge of Recovery Court, he would be interviewed by a University of Denver student to assess his needs, released from jail, given a motel room, provided a caseworker and scheduled for drug and alcohol counseling.\n\n\u201cIf you agree to this, it means going to classes, meeting with your counselor,\u201d Breese said. \u201cWe will monitor you to make sure you aren\u2019t doing drugs and alcohol. We will try to give you treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to give you a chance.\u201d\n\nThe man said he was down and out and ready to drop out and wanted to change.\n\n\u201cWelcome aboard,\u201d said Judge Breese as the courtroom broke into applause.\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer@denverpost.com.
