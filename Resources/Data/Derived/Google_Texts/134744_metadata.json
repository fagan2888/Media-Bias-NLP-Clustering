That number stood at 47 percent a month after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden first leaked information on secret surveillance practices.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who say U.S. policies have not gone far enough stands at 50 percent today, up from 35 percent a month after the Snowden leaks.\n\nThe poll found 62 percent are very concerned about the threat of Islamic extremists, while 22 percent are somewhat concerned.\n\nFifty-six percent believe the government is doing a good job of reducing the threat of terrorism \u2014 down 16 points since last year.\n\nForty-two percent believe the government is not doing a good job of reducing terror threats, the second highest figure for that question since the 9/11 attacks more than a decade ago.\n\nThe poll comes as President Obama is slated to outline the U.S. strategy against ISIS during a prime-time address Wednesday.\n\nA Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released late Tuesday showed Americans taking a more hawkish stance, with 61 percent saying it was in the nation\u2019s interest to fight ISIS. The poll also found President Obama with his lowest foreign policy approval rating, at 32 percent.\n\nThe Pew poll surveyed 2,002 people and has a margin of error of 2.5 percent.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "More now say anti-terror policies don't go far enough to keep Americans safe.", "description": "More now say anti-terror policies don't go far enough to keep Americans safe.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "More now say anti-terror policies don't go far enough to keep Americans safe.", "title": "Poll: Concerns over civil liberties, security flip", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217292-poll-concern-for-civil-liberties-and-security-flips", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217292-poll-concern-for-civil-liberties-and-security-flips", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-10T14:05-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Terrorism, Barack Obama,,ISIS, ISIL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-10T14:05:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/217292-poll-concern-for-civil-liberties-and-security-flips", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "More now say anti-terror policies don't go far enough to keep Americans safe.", "card": "summary", "title": "Poll: Concerns over civil liberties, security flip"}, "dcterms.title": "Poll: Concerns over civil liberties, security flip"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTThe poll found only 35 percent believe anti-terrorism policies have gone too far in restricting the civil liberties of people in the United States.\nThe poll found 62 percent are very concerned about the threat of Islamic extremists, while 22 percent are somewhat concerned.\nThe poll comes as President Obama is slated to outline the U.S. strategy against ISIS during a prime-time address Wednesday.\nFifty percent of people believe the government's anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the United States, according to a new poll, a 15-point shift since last year.\nSimilarly, the number of people who say U.S. policies have not gone far enough stands at 50 percent today, up from 35 percent a month after the Snowden leaks."}
