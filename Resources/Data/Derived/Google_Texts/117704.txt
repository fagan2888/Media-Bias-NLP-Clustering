SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - The South Dakota Symphony Orchestra opens its 2015-2016 season next weekend at Sioux Falls’ Washington Pavilion.

The orchestra will boast nearly 100 members for its Oct. 3 performance of Gustav Mahler’s “Tragic” symphony. Music Director Delta David Gier says the work is one of the most exciting and challenging pieces of music ever written.

The 2015-2016 season marks the 94th for the orchestra. It also marks the launch of the new Crescendo Program, which offers $10 tickets to all Classical Series performances to anyone under the age of 35 and free tickets for children with the purchase of an adult ticket.

Community members who have never attended a symphony orchestra performance before can receive a complimentary ticket to their first Classical Series concert.
