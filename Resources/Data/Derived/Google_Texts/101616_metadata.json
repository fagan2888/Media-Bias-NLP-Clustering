With veterinarian bills growing, the family was searching for a way to be able to afford keeping their new member of the family. In doing so, they found a way to also help others finding themselves in a similar situation.\n\n'Pro-Bone-O Boutique' was born as an idea to raise funds for a local veterinarian clinic that provides services to customers at no cost. The family runs the secondhand-goods store out of their garage. It operates entirely on donations and all proceeds go to helping others afford medical procedures for their pets.\n\nSondra's husband, Caleb, told us about their plans for the future, \"We want to move into a Zeeland store front and start helping people with their vet bils... that they cant afford so hopefully less animals get put to sleep because of money.\"\n\nUntil then, they are planning a neighborhood sale April 17th & 18th in the Wrestling Winds Subdivision in Zeeland.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ZEELAND, Mich. -- A family is\u00a0helping to raise funds for a pro-bono veterinarian clinic after finding and falling in love with a \u00a0dog this past winter.
