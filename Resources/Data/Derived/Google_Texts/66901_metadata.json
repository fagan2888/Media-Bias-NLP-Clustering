Only 9.4 percent of high school students reported using traditional cigarettes in 2014. Although a shift from cigarettes to e-cigs is advantageous for electronic cigarette companies, one must wonder if it\u2019s equally beneficial for a former cigarette smoker\u2019s health or if they\u2019re just swapping one bad habit for another?\n\nAsapSCIENCE pooled all available data on e-cigs to answer a question that\u2019s on the minds of almost every tobacco (and marijuana) user: Between vaping and smoking, which is better for your health? With over 4,000 chemicals, including 43 carcinogenic compounds, cigarette smoking would seem to be the obvious answer. However, things get a bit more complicated after accounting for what could be hiding in eLiquid \u2014 the fluid responsible for the nicotine solution and flavoring found in e-cigs.\n\nThe majority of eLiquids contain water, nicotine, flavorings, and a base. Since this liquid is not regulated by any federal authority, what can be found in eLiquid varies by company. For example, some eLiquid manufacturers use glycerin, an organic compound that is commonly found in vegetables. Others use diacetyl, which has been tied to abnormal lung function over time. Speaking of time, health care professionals are still unsure what dangers await e-cig smokers due to how new they are.\n\nSo which is safer: vaping or smoking? Clearly the compounds found e-cigs are generally deemed less harmful than the cancer-causing agents found in traditional cigarettes, but less harmful doesn\u2019t necessarily mean safe. Smoking cessation, on the other hand, is safe and, according to the recent study, smokers are 60 percent more likely to quit with the help of an electronic smoking device.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "smoking, vs, vaping, vaporizers, may, lessen, damage, associated, smoke, inhalation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "AsapSCIENCE answers the all-important question: Between vaping and smoking, which is better for your health?", "title": "Smoking vs. Vaping: Which Is Healthier?
