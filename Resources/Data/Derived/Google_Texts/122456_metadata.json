When did you become interested in firefighting?\n\nA. My dad took me to the local fire station for the annual pancake breakfast when I was 13, and after that I started hanging around the station and became a Fire Explorer, which is a division of the Boy Scouts. I started riding on a fire engine at 15.\n\nWhat were your next steps?\n\nAt 18, I became a reserve firefighter in Orange County and attended the Basic Fire Academy at Santa Ana College, graduating at 20 with a degree in fire engineering. Then I moved to Riverside County and attended its live-in academy for 12 weeks. Over the years I became a fire engineer and fire captain, which requires additional training.\n\nWhat kind of fires do you fight, and where?\n\nI\u2019m part of a four-person fire engine crew assigned to municipal fire stations around the county, but I also fight wildfires. We\u2019re usually working with our seasonal firefighters on these.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat is your schedule like?\n\nWe work for three days and then have four days off, unless we\u2019re fighting a wildfire. Then we work 24 hours on, followed by 24 hours off; we rest as we can. We have M.R.E.s (meals ready to eat) back at the fire engines to hold us over until we get a regular meal.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most memorable wildfire you\u2019ve fought?\n\nThe 2003 Cedar Fire that burned over 250,000 acres in San Diego County. It started in a rural area and burned almost to the Pacific Coast. Fifteen people lost their lives and over 2,500 buildings were lost.\n\nWhat have you learned about fires in the last 20 years?\n\nThat each one is different and has its own attitude. You have to be on your toes at all times and be mindful of your crew.\n\nWhat do you like most about your job?\n\nIt sounds like a clich\u00e9, but firefighters really are a family. We have such a close bond because of the work we do. There\u2019s never been a day where I have not wanted to go to work. Every day is different; answering a 911 call never gets old. There\u2019s nothing like seeing the relief on someone\u2019s face when we arrive.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140906093003, "twitter": {"description": "A fire captain for California\u2019s forestry department says his interest in firefighting began early.", "title": "An Early Spark of Interest", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/jobs/an-early-spark-of-interest.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003087557"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/07/business/7-VOCATION/7-VOCATION-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/jobs/an-early-spark-of-interest.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003087557", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/jobs/an-early-spark-of-interest.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "jobs", "hdl_p": "An Early Spark of Interest", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/jobs/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 6, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Mohler  Michael,Fires and Firefighters,California,Careers and Professions,Wildfires,Forests and Forestry,Riverside County (Calif)", "news_keywords": "California,Wildfires", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Patricia R.
