REUTERS/Michelle Nichols\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Trials of an experimental vaccine developed by the Canadian government and licensed to NewLink Genetics will begin swiftly in healthy volunteers in Europe, Gabon and Kenya, under a program with funding from the Wellcome Trust.\n\nA $5 million grant from the medical charity will allow several global partners, overseen by the World Health Organization (WHO), to gather essential safety data for the so-called rVSV-EBOV vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine is already undergoing initial testing in the United States and is one of two to have been injected into people in clinical trials. The other, from GlaxoSmithKline, is also being tested in Europe and Africa.\n\nWellcome said on Wednesday that 335 volunteers would be vaccinated in total in the new trials, starting with 20 in Germany, followed by 100 in each of Gabon and Kenya, and then 115 in Switzerland.\n\nCanada has donated 800 vials of the vaccine, which was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, to be used in the trials.\n\nThe WHO said the death toll from the world's worst Ebola outbreak in West Africa was likely more than 5,000 out of nearly 14,000 cases and the death rate was running at 70 percent, although it was better for people in treatment centers.\n\nDrugmakers are racing to develop Ebola vaccines but they face a series of hurdles if they are to get millions of doses ready for use next year as hoped.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Clara Ferreira Marques)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "canadian, ebola, vaccine, be, tested, europe, gabon, kenya", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Ebola vaccine produced in Canada will be tested on healthy volunteers in Europe, Gabon, and Kenya.", "title": "Canadian Ebola Vaccine To Be Tested In Europe, Gabon, Kenya", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/canadian-ebola-vaccine-be-tested-europe-gabon-kenya-308258", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/29/ebola-vaccine.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Ebola vaccine produced in Canada will be tested on healthy volunteers in Europe, Gabon, and Kenya.", "title": "Canadian Ebola Vaccine To Be Tested In Europe, Gabon, Kenya", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/canadian-ebola-vaccine-be-tested-europe-gabon-kenya-308258", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/29/ebola-vaccine.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/29/ebola-vaccine.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-29T11:28:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-29T11:28:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Ebola vaccine produced in Canada will be tested on healthy volunteers in Europe, Gabon, and Kenya."}, "article_summary": "A billboard with a message about Ebola is seen on a street in Conakry, Guinea October 26, 2014.\nREUTERS/Michelle NicholsLONDON (Reuters) - Trials of an experimental vaccine developed by the Canadian government and licensed to NewLink Genetics will begin swiftly in healthy volunteers in Europe, Gabon and Kenya, under a program with funding from the Wellcome Trust.\nCanada has donated 800 vials of the vaccine, which was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, to be used in the trials.\nThe vaccine is already undergoing initial testing in the United States and is one of two to have been injected into people in clinical trials.\nThe other, from GlaxoSmithKline, is also being tested in Europe and Africa."}
