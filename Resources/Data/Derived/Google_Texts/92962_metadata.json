Mark Amodei, R-Carson City, is photographed in his Washington office on July 29, 2014. (Photo: Jocelyn M. Augustino for USA TODAY )\n\nMost members of Congress keep awards and honorary certificates in their Capitol Hill offices. Rep. Mark Amodei has preserved his favorite piece of hate mail.\n\nIt\u2019s a printout of an email from an angry constituent who didn\u2019t like one of Amodei\u2019s bills. The subject line reads: \u201cAre you insane?\u201d and the message concludes with the sentiment, \u201cYour job is over, cupcake!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sensitive staff glued a candy heart with the word \u2018cupcake\u2019 on it and gave it to me to cherish for eternity,\u201d Amodei said, chuckling after showing it to a couple of visitors from Nevada. \u201cWe need to learn to laugh at ourselves a little more here in Washington.\u201d\n\nIn a city consumed by bitter partisan politics, the Carson City Republican\u2019s self-deprecating humor has won him friends among lawmakers of both parties and helped the former state assemblyman and senator pass nearly a dozen bills during his first full term in Congress.\n\nDemocrats who serve with the 56-year-old congressman said they find the wise-cracking conservative lawyer to be a refreshing change from the hostile tea party-style Republicans who have swept into office in recent years. Even Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has called Amodei \u201chilarious\u201d and fun to be around.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s likeable, he\u2019s easy to work with, and he doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously,\u201d said Rep. Jim Moran, a liberal Democrat from northern Virginia who serves on the House Appropriations Committee with Amodei. \u201cBut he takes his job seriously.\u201d\n\nAmodei has won House approval of five of the 18 bills he introduced in this session of Congress. The House is expected to pass six more of his bills \u2014 a package of Northern Nevada lands legislation \u2014 in September.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s excellent for somebody so early in their career, especially when you consider the fact that Congress has gotten so little done overall,\u201d said Eric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\nAmodei has been in office nearly three years. He won a special election in September 2011 to replace Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., who held the House seat before being appointed to replace former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev. Ensign resigned amid a sex scandal. Amodei was re-elected to the House in 2012.\n\nOne of the major reasons that Amodei has been successful is that his legislation tends to be bipartisan and aimed at solving local problems, Herzik said.\n\nCase in point, Herzik said, is the Yerington bill, which would transfer more than 10,000 acres of public lands to the city of Yerington to develop a copper mine in exchange for making 48,000 acres of the Wovoka forest into a national wilderness area.\n\nAmodei championed the bill in the last Congress, when Yerington was part of his district. In this Congress, Yerington became part of the district represented by Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford.\n\nTogether, Amodei and Horsford worked to push the bill through the House Natural Resources Committee, where is was approved at the end of July. Amodei convinced the Republican majority to create more federal wilderness area while Horsford convinced environmentally conscious Democrats to support the mine.\n\nRep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who has served on the Natural Resources Committee with Amodei and worked with him on Lake Tahoe restoration and wildfire prevention, said Amodei is unique among the newer Republican members because he knows how to negotiate and compromise with Democrats.\n\nAmodei said he learned those skills serving in the Nevada State Assembly from 1996-1998 and the Nevada State Senate from 1998-2010. He was president pro tempore of the state Senate from 2003-2008.\n\n\u201cIt definitely makes a difference that Congressman Amodei served in the state legislature,\u201d Garamendi said. \u201cHe knows the legislative process. With many of the newer conservative members, it\u2019s \u2018my way or get out.\u2019 He\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\nDespite Amodei\u2019s collegial style, the congressman should not be mistaken for a moderate, Democratic Party officials said.\n\n\u201cCongressman Mark Amodei has been a lockstep vote for the most reviled Congress in modern history \u2014 whether it\u2019s shutting down the government, ending the Medicare guarantee or giving tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class \u2014Mark Amodei has proven time and again that he is part of the problem, and out of touch with Northern Nevada values,\u201d said Tyrone Gayle, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nAmong Nevada members of the U.S. House, Amodei voted with his party the most often, earning him a 2013 party unity score of 96 percent from the non-partisan CQ Weekly magazine. Reps. Dina Titus, a Democrat, and Joe Heck, a Republican, both had party unity scores of 93 percent. Horsford earned a party unity score of 92 percent.\n\nJust before Congress adjourned for its August legislative recess, Amodei joined fellow House Republicans in voting to sue Democratic President Barack Obama for delaying a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires employers to provide medical insurance to their workers.\n\nRepublicans see the delay as an example of Obama overstepping his executive authority. Democrats say the vote was a political stunt by Republicans in an election year.\n\n\u201cInstead of focusing on issues that the American people are urging us to act on, House Republicans decided to sacrifice precious taxpayer resources on a partisan stunt that does nothing to help working families,\u201d Horsford said.\n\nHowever, that same week, Amodei defied his GOP leaders as one of only 11 Republicans to oppose a bill to end an Obama administration program that stops the deportation of some undocumented immigrants. The legislation passed but has no chance of advancing in the Democratic controlled Senate.\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program allows young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to gain legal status if they are in school, have graduated from U.S. high schools or served honorably in the U.S. military, and have lived in the country at least five consecutive years since June 2007.\n\nAmodei\u2019s spokesman, Brian Baluta, said the congressman thought the Republican bill would create more confusion about U.S. immigration policy \u2014 confusion that Amodei believes would end if the House would pass an immigration reform bill.\n\nThe congressman said the failure of Congress to pass immigration reform is his biggest frustration. He has said he would support a bill to offer a way for undocumented immigrants in the United States to earn citizenship. House leaders say they will not take up immigration legislation this year.\n\n\u201cWe need to vote on something,\u201d Amodei said. \u201cHow the hell do you defend nothing?\u201d\n\nAmodei will likely have a chance to make that point again in the new Congress that convenes in January.\n\nThe congressman is expected to win re-election easily in November. The non-partisan Cook Political Report lists Amodei\u2019s seat in Nevada\u2019s 2nd Congressional District as \u201csolid Republican.\u201d The non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report lists the seat as \u201csafe Republican.\u201d\n\nAmodei will face Democratic challenger Kristen Spees \u2014 an attorney from Incline Village \u2014 and Independent American Party candidate Janine Hansen in the Nov. 4 election.\n\nIn the meantime, Amodei said he will spend the few remaining legislative weeks of this year focusing on trying to get his Nevada-centric bills passed.\n\nIn addition to the Nevada lands package, Amodei is pushing for a House vote on the Nevada Native Nations Lands Act, which transfers federal land to a half dozen Indian tribes in the state to use for economic development, housing and cultural preservation.\n\nThe bill, already approved by the Natural Resources Committee, also includes a provision to sell about 275 acres of federal land to Elko County to create a motocross, bicycle, off-roading or stock car racing area.\n\nAmodei also is hoping the Senate will pass two spending bills already approved by the House that include his provisions to bar discrimination against casino cities such as Reno by federal agencies planning government meetings and conferences.\n\nThe congressman used his spot on the House Appropriations Committee, which he was appointed to in December, to insert the measure into the spending bills after the legislation stalled in another committee. If the Senate fails to pass the spending bills, Amodei said he will push for the anti-discrimination provision to be included in whatever compromise spending deal is worked out at the end of the year.\n\nA 2010 scandal involving employees of the General Services Administration led to a federal blacklisting of casino cities and resorts. GSA employees attending a conference near Las Vegas spent more than $800,000 on activities that included hiring a mind reader and a clown. The lavish spending was done in the midst of the recession.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take a hands-on approach to solving problems,\u201d Amodei said. \u201cI want to get things done. I don\u2019t care much for the political quarterbacking that goes on here. I can talk about issues all day without ever needing to talk about Republicans or Democrats.\u201d\n\nRep. James Renacci, R-Ohio, lives in a Capitol Hill apartment next to Amodei\u2019s and said other lawmakers could learn something from watching the Nevadan work a room full of politicians.\n\n\u201cWhen he walks across the House floor, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a Democrat or a Republican, he is joking around with them and saying hi to them,\u201d Renacci said. \u201cEverybody knows him and sees him as someone they can work with.\u201d\n\nAmodei said he\u2019s trying to avoid getting sucked into the partisan Washington drama that\u2019s broadcast back home to Nevada every day from the cable news networks.\n\n\u201cPeople need to calm down around here and talk to each other,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to be a Fox News alert.\u201d\n\nContact Erin Kelly at ekelly@gannett.com\n\nRep.
