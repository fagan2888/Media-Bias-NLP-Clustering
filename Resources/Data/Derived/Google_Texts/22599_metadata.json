(Photo: Timothy D. Easley)\n\nIt pays to prevent the flu.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t just help you avoid a week or two of misery, it saves you \u2014 and your employer \u2014 lots of money. And it\u2019s easier than ever to avail yourself of what doctors say is the best defense against the virus: the flu vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe flu can be a life-threatening illness, and it may be more risky for a chronically ill person, an elderly person or young people in the community,\u201d says Paul Schulz, system epidemiologist for Norton Healthcare in Louisville, Ky. \u201cAnd even if you don\u2019t worry much about the medical aspect, I would think people would worry about the economics and lost work.\u201d\n\nAn estimated $10.4 billion is spent annually on direct costs for hospitalizations and outpatient visits for adults who get the flu, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And lost earnings account for an additional $16.3 billion each year.\n\nA recent CDC study in the journal Vaccine looked at 282 kids under the age of 5 in three U.S. cities and found parents had medical expenses for their flu-stricken children ranging from $300 to about $4,000 for doctor\u2019s office and emergency room visits. They also missed between 11 and 73 hours of work.\n\nConsumers can get immunized not just at doctors\u2019 offices, but quickly in drugstores, supermarket-based clinics and, increasingly, even workplaces.\n\nGetting the flu \"really is miserable no matter how long it takes,\" says Papatya Tankut, vice president of pharmacy services for CVS Health.\n\nCVS encourages people to get flu shots ASAP because it takes at least two weeks for the immunity to build up. A CVS study this summer found two-thirds of employed Americans would go to work even if they had flu-like symptoms.\n\nAnnette Mazzoni, left, a nurse at the Norton Brownsboro Hospital, gives a flu shot to Joe Thompson Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015, in Louisville, Ky. (Photo: Timothy D. Easley)\n\nThe prospect of missing work was on 32-year-old Galina Goldentul\u2019s mind when she got a flu shot recently at Norton Brownsboro Hospital in Louisville. She\u2019s a part-time production artist and mother of a preschooler, and says with her limited hours, \u201cIt\u2019s really important to work the days I\u2019m supposed to.\u201d\n\nPlus, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility not only to protect myself but those around me.\u201d\n\nEach year, the CDC says, 5% to 20% of the U.S. population gets the flu, hospitalizations for flu-related complications total 226,000 and 3,000 to 49,000 people die.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder and harder to have a good excuse\u201d not to protect yourself, Schulz says. The Affordable Care Act requires flu vaccines to be covered by insurance without a co-pay or co-insurance, so anyone who has a new plan \u2014 rather than one grandfathered in under the pre-ACA rules \u2014 should be able to get it for free. The uninsured pay about $15 to $32 per shot.\n\nJoe Thompson, manager of volunteer services at Norton, says he knows how important it is to get vaccinated; his daughter's 2010 bout with flu developed into pneumonia and put her in the pediatric intensive care unit for three days. On a recent morning, he got a shot at Norton Brownsboro from nurse Annette Mazzoni, who says immunization doesn't just keep workers safe.\n\n\u201cIf we vaccinate as many employees and volunteers as possible,\u201d she says, \u201cwe can keep it out of the community.\u201d\n\nIf you don't like shots, there's FluMist Quadrivalent vaccine.

Here are the choices:\n\nHigh-dose vaccine. Has four times the antigens for to give those 65 and older \u2014 at greater risk of developing severe forms of the flu \u2014 additional protection.\n\nHas four times the antigens for to give those 65 and older \u2014 at greater risk of developing severe forms of the flu \u2014 additional protection. Quadrivalent vaccine. Standard flu vaccines protect against three different viruses, but the quadrivalent vaccine protects against four. CVS recommends people check with their insurers about costs and coverage.\n\nStandard flu vaccines protect against three different viruses, but the quadrivalent vaccine protects against four.

Available to children as young as 2 and for healthy adults through age 49, flu vaccines including Quadrivalent can also be given through the nose. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says children younger than 9 may need two doses during the same flu season.
