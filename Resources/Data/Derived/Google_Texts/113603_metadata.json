Michael Hayden on Sunday criticized the Obama administration's deal with Iran saying it will only delay, not derail the country's nuclear program.Hayden told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry \"hit the pause button, rather than delete button.\"\"Practically the worst of all possible outcomes, because now what you have here is a nuclear capable state,\" Hayden said.\"I think frankly that is Iran's bottom line, so what we're negotiating on is how much time we're putting between their nuclear capability and a nuclear weapon, a nuclear reality,\" Hayden said.\"And my fear is, this interim agreement, which doesn't roll back much of anything at all, becomes a permanent agreement,\" Hayden said.The six-month agreement between the U.S. and other nations requires Iran to limit its nuclear activities in exchange for some relief on sanctions.Hayden said the agreement contradicts the U.S. alignment with Sunni Muslims and Israelis in the region, and that it will take \"an awful lot of hand holding\" to convince our allies this is the correct course of action.Former Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte also appeared on CNN and said that the U.S. should not consider lifting sanctions until after all of the demands to roll back the nuclear program have been met.\"I think what worries a number of people is that we might get salami-sliced and that the Iranians will engage in dilatory tactics and then seek some more momentary relief from sanctions,\" Negroponte said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hayden,iran,israel,nuclear,deal", "pubdate": "2013-11-24T11:21:51", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Former CIA Director Gen.
