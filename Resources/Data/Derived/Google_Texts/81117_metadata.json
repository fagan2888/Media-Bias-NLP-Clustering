Maui Memorial had the highest rates of preventable conditions.\n\nBrandt Farias, the vice president of marketing at Hawaii Pacific Health, said Pali Momi has made changes to reduce the rates of hospital-acquired conditions and would not be subject to the penalty based on current data. However, the government analyzed data from 2012 through 2014.\n\nThe penalties are based on the government\u2019s assessment of several conditions such as hip fractures, bedsores, infections caused by surgeries and catheters.\n\nMedicare estimates the penalties will cost hospitals $364 million nationwide. This is the second year of the Hospital-Acquired Conditions Reduction Program, mandated by the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe sanctions are the toughest Medicare has enforced on hospital safety.\n\nChad Blair/Civil Beat\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Civil Beat News", "description": "The federal government is punishing three Hawaii hospitals for having high rates of avoidable infections.
