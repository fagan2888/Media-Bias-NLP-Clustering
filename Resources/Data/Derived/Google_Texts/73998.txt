While soccer fans worldwide are busy rooting for their favorite teams in the FIFA World Cup 2014, or at least watching the remaining games all the way to the finals, EA Sports has been busy with the details of one of the most highly anticipated video games: "FIFA 15."

Electronic Arts, creator of several popular sports video games, has announced the release dates and on which platforms the game will be available. "FIFA 15" will be available for most gaming platforms and consoles, including Sony's PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PS Vita and PSP. It will also be available for Microsoft's Xbox One, Xbox 360 and on the PC, as well as Nintendo's Wii and 3DS. As expected, EA will not release it for the Wii U.

While the much-awaited game will be available on handheld gaming devices, such as the PS Vita and 3DS, these versions will not enjoy all the features of the full version, such as game updates. However, they will enjoy the legacy edition of the game with new squads and updated players.

It was also no surprise that the franchise will cease to cater to Sony's PlayStation 2 despite previously releasing versions for the rather old yet iconic gaming console. The PlayStation 2 provided a stable platform for the FIFA gaming franchise for a solid 14 years.

According to reports, "FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends" will be exclusively available for Xbox One, while no reports indicate content exclusive to the PlayStation 4. This edition's cover art was leaked last week, and the game has been confirmed as exclusive to Microsoft's next-gen console.

FIFA 15 will be available in the United States on Sept. 23 and in the U.K. on Sept. 26.
