Darryl Owens, D-Louisville, would require the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to operate a state healthcare exchange that would be substantially similar to kynect, and to keep the expanded Medicaid program.\n\nIn a speech on the Senate floor on Friday, Stivers outlined how, in his words, 5,400 jobs that were to have come about with the advent of kynect, have failed to materialize even though they were promised by the administration of former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear.\n\n\u201cThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reports since the implementation of Obamacare, which is a provision of the federal government under the President of the United States, projects that we have lost 3,500 jobs in the healthcare industry,\u201d Stivers said.\n\nStivers pointed out that House Bills 5 and 6 are still sitting in the House, and he wants to see the bills come to the House floor for a discussion as well as the Senate to find out where every legislator stands on the issue.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have those discussions, but more importantly, the public deserves to know where everybody stands on this issue,\u201d Stivers said.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s session, Stivers reiterated his promise to hear the bills on the Senate floor, if passed by the House.\n\n\u201cI would surmise is what they\u2019re doing is just pandering and playing to a political base even though they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s good,\u201d Stivers said.\n\nAs for people who feel that they have benefited the state healthcare exchange, Stivers says there will be alternatives available for them to continue to get help.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bevin is working with the HHS to get a waiver,\u201d Stivers said. \u201cYou see that there is money put in the second year of the budget to help do the transition. There are many alternatives than this, what I call a conglomeration of mistakes.\n\nStumbo said it was interesting that Stivers is attacking Obamacare when Gov. Bevin is redirecting Kentuckians to the federal healthcare exchange.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Sen. Stivers wants to debate Obamacare while his governor\n\nis pushing Kentuckians to Obamacare by requiring them to go to the federal exchange which is Obamacare,\u201d Stumbo said. \u201cHe\u2019s dismantling our Beshearcare here in Kentucky that Kentuckians were so happy to have.\u201d\n\nFormer Gov.
