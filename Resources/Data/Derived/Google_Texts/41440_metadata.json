A total of 54 percent of millennials want to keep the law, as opposed to 32 percent who favor repeal.\n\n\"If they show up, they could influence\" the outcome of the race, Adams said.\n\nOn the other hand, she said, adults age 50 to 64 were the group most likely to favor repealing Obamacare, and to say their insurance situation has worsened over the past year. Half of the respondents in that age group favor repeal, while 42 percent favor keeping the law intact.\n\nThe survey also showed the persistence of a a wide partisan split on the issue. A total of 74 percent of self-identified Democrats favored keeping the law, which was proposed by a Democratic president. And 77 percent of Republicans want the law repealed.\n\nThe overall findings mean that \"health care will certainly be a hot-button issue during the 2016,\" Adams said. \"Positive and negative emotions are still strong five years after the Affordable Care Act was passed, and two years after the initial enrollment period.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "A strong majority say the Affordable Care Act will play an important role in their vote, but split on their opinion on the law.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "A strong majority say the Affordable Care Act will play an important role in their vote.", "title": "Voters: Obamacare will affect presidential ballot", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/09/voters-say-obamacare-will-affect-their-presidential-choice.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/01/102722424-465254514.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A strong majority say the Affordable Care Act will play an important role in their vote.", "title": "Voters say Obamacare will affect their presidential choice", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/09/voters-say-obamacare-will-affect-their-presidential-choice.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/01/102722424-465254514.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, Politics, US: News, Bankrate Inc, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-10-09T11:12:51-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T20:04:58-0400", "tag": "Bernie Sanders"}, "pageNodeId": 103066410, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Clinton, presidential election, health insurance, influence"}, "article_summary": "Half of the respondents in that age group favor repeal, while 42 percent favor keeping the law intact.\nA total of 54 percent of millennials want to keep the law, as opposed to 32 percent who favor repeal.\nOn the other hand, she said, adults age 50 to 64 were the group most likely to favor repealing Obamacare, and to say their insurance situation has worsened over the past year.\nThe overall findings mean that \"health care will certainly be a hot-button issue during the 2016,\" Adams said.\nA total of 74 percent of self-identified Democrats favored keeping the law, which was proposed by a Democratic president."}
