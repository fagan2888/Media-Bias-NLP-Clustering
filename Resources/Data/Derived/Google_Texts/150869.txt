On the eve of the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment for 2015, Humana announced today that it has added two Birmingham hospitals to its exchange network.

St. Vincent's Birmingham and St. Vincent's Medical Center East will join Humana's Birmingham exchange offerings, according to Humana spokesman Mitch Lubitz.

The hospitals join two other hospitals on Humana's Birmingham network: Brookwood Medical Center and Trinity Medical Center.

Humana offers plans on the exchange in three counties: Jefferson, Shelby and Madison.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama and UnitedHealthcare are the other two insurers on Alabama's federal exchange, which opens for individual and family market enrollment Saturday and ends Feb. 15.

BCBS and United offer plans in all 67 of the state's counties.

The St. Vincent's hospitals will be in the Humana network beginning Dec. 1.
