And we must remain calm when we talk about the health of our country.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cYou can\u2019t be knocked for a loop just because somebody is playing politics.\u201d\n\nIn an indication of Democratic jitters\u2019 over Obamacare, on Friday 39 of Pelosi\u2019s House Democrats joined with 222 Republicans to vote for a bill sponsored by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., that would allow health insurance firms to continue to sell insurance plans next year that don\u2019t comply with Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements.\n\nThe 39 Democrats included several who are in toss-up races such as Rep. Ron Barber of Arizona and Rep. Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire. Explaining why those Democrats voted for the Upton bill, Pelosi said, \u201cWhen the Republicans put forth a political initiative, people respond to it politically.\u201d\n\nAppearing on CNN's State of the Union, Assistant Democratic Leader Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina said that \u201cwhat you saw in those 39 people -- and maybe nine people had real serious concerns -- the fact of the matter is about 30 of them, and I've talked to them, were insulating themselves against sound bites\u201d in next year\u2019s election campaign \u201cand that's part of the problem.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cOne of our big problems in Washington is that we tend to react to sound bites a little bit too often and, therefore, we tend to speak in sound bites.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats to recapture the majority in the House which they lost in the landslide election of 2010.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u201cis a very important pillar of economic and health security for the American people\u201d and \u201cis right up there with Social Security (and) Medicare, affordable care for all Americans as a right, not a privilege,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nIn states such as Kentucky and her own state of California, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s working very well.\u201d\n\nPelosi said she stands by what she said before the bill passed, \u201cI stand by what I said there: when people see what is in the bill they will like -- and they will.\u201d\n\nThe California Democrat said the software problems that plague the enrollment website Healthcare.gov are \u201cterrible,\u201d but \u201cwill be fixed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe fumbled the rollout on this health care law,\u201d Obama said at a press conference Thursday. The troubled debut of the enrollment process has not only created problems for tens of thousands of Americans seeking insurance coverage, but has fed a growing sense of unease among congressional Democrats as they look to the 2014 elections and at Obama\u2019s waning popularity.\n\nObama repeatedly pledged \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,\u201d but that pledge turned out to be false for many Americans who bought coverage in the individual market. Their plans don\u2019t comply with the minimum benefit requirements of the ACA and they got cancellation notices.\n\nObama said Thursday that he knew \u201chow upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans, particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked, they could keep it. \u201c\n\nTo ease the transition, Obama said he has decided to allow insurers to extend into next year current insurance plans that would otherwise be canceled. \u201cAmericans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some state insurance commissioners quickly rejected his idea. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said allowing individual insurance plans that don\u2019t comply with ACA requirements to continue into 2014 \u201cthreatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s unclear if insurance companies can un-cancel thousands of policies that they are cancelling due to the ACA requirements.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC News\u00a0House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats are not losing confidence in President  Barack Obama\u2019s ability to make the Affordable Care Act work and don\u2019t fear  Obamacare\u2019s effect on their chances in next year\u2019s elections.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/pelosi-says-democrats-will-stand-tall-2014-support-obamacare-f2D11607585", "site_name": "NBC News", "image": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif", "type": "article", "description": "By Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC News\u00a0House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats are not losing confidence in President  Barack Obama\u2019s ability to make the Affordable Care Act work and don\u2019t fear  Obamacare\u2019s effect on their chances in next year\u2019s elections."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "By Tom Curry, National Affairs Writer, NBC News\u00a0House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats are not losing confidence in President  Barack Obama\u2019s ability to make the Affordable Care Act work and don\u2019t fear  Obamacare\u2019s effect on their chances in next year\u2019s elections.", "title": "Pelosi says Democrats will 'stand tall' in 2014 in support of Obamacare - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/og-nbcnews200x200.gif"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-17", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/pelosi-says-democrats-will-stand-tall-2014-support-obamacare-f2D11607585", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,Other"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd69f4\"", "article_summary": "Alluding to the nervousness some congressional Democrats are expressing about the debut of Obamacare, Pelosi said \u201cWhat I love about health care professionals is that they\u2019re calm.\n\u201cTo ease the transition, Obama said he has decided to allow insurers to extend into next year current insurance plans that would otherwise be canceled.\nTheir plans don\u2019t comply with the minimum benefit requirements of the ACA and they got cancellation notices.\nObama repeatedly pledged \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,\u201d but that pledge turned out to be false for many Americans who bought coverage in the individual market.\n\u201cAmericans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan,\u201d he said."}
