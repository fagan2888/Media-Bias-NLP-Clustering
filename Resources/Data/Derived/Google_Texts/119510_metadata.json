The OECD released final international tax recommendations in October.\n\nA spokesman for Treasury said Monday that the department is \"proud to have played a leading role in developing the BEPS recommendations to help address tax avoidance by multinational corporations.\"\n\nBEPS stands for Base Erosion and Profit Sharing, the name OECD gave to its project of developing the taxation recommendations.\n\n\"We are fully committed to implementing the BEPS project, and these proposed country-by-country reporting regulations are an important step,\" the Treasury spokesman continued. \"Standardized country-by-country reporting and other documentation requirements will give tax administrations a global picture of where profits, tax, and economic activities of multinational enterprises are reported. This process has strong confidentiality protections built in, and Treasury and the IRS will ensure that countries meet these important standards.\u201d\n\nThe proposed regulations were prepared by Treasury with the IRS.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that the information required under these proposed regulations will assist in better enforcement of U.S. tax laws,\u201d the agencies said in the preamble to the proposed rules.\n\nSome lawmakers and business groups have been concerned that the country-by-country reporting requirements could jeopardize sensitive business information.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin BradyIRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says Report: Pacific trade pact would boost growth, jobs and incomes Puerto Rico debt becomes constitutional fight on the right MORE (R-Texas) said that he would review the proposal.\n\n\u201cNew country-by-country reporting requirements on U.S. companies must be limited and should not make it even harder for our companies to compete,\u201d he said in a statement, adding that Congress will not let Treasury move forward with policies \u201cthat enable foreign governments to misuse information reporting and exploit American companies.\u201d\n\n\u2014Updated at 7:51 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The proposed regulations were prepared by Treasury with the IRS.", "description": "The proposed regulations were prepared by Treasury with the IRS.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Naomi Jagoda", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The proposed regulations were prepared by Treasury with the IRS.", "title": "Treasury proposes new multinational reporting rules", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/263963-treasury-proposes-new-multinational-reporting-rules", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/263963-treasury-proposes-new-multinational-reporting-rules", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-21T17:35-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Kevin Brady,Treasury, IRS", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-21T17:35:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/263963-treasury-proposes-new-multinational-reporting-rules", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The proposed regulations were prepared by Treasury with the IRS.", "card": "summary", "title": "Treasury proposes new multinational reporting rules"}, "dcterms.title": "Treasury proposes new multinational reporting rules"}, "article_summary": "\"We are fully committed to implementing the BEPS project, and these proposed country-by-country reporting regulations are an important step,\" the Treasury spokesman continued.\nSome lawmakers and business groups have been concerned that the country-by-country reporting requirements could jeopardize sensitive business information.\n\"Standardized country-by-country reporting and other documentation requirements will give tax administrations a global picture of where profits, tax, and economic activities of multinational enterprises are reported.\nThis process has strong confidentiality protections built in, and Treasury and the IRS will ensure that countries meet these important standards.\u201dThe proposed regulations were prepared by Treasury with the IRS.\nThe Treasury Department released a proposal on Monday that would require certain companies to annually report information relating to income and taxes on a country-by-country basis."}
