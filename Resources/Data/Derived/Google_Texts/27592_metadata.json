On the mid-season finale of \u201cScandal\u201d (spoilers ahead, for those who aren\u2019t caught up), Mellie filibusters in front of the Senate for nearly a full day in order to ensure that Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding isn\u2019t considered discretionary, and Olivia aborts Fitz\u2019s child. Even with the trigger warning at the beginning of the episode, viewers were surprised with where the plot took them.\n\nAll of this aired just eight days before a gunman attacked a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It occurred in the midst of a lawsuit against the state of Texas for trying to remove Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funding. And it tackled a real-life issue that has been discussed with increasing fervor since the fall\u2014defunding Planned Parenthood altogether. Planned Parenthood remains front-page news, which is rare for an organization that has been around for nearly one hundred years. Yet it stays relevant, and will continue to stay relevant in mainstream media as long as the country is polarized by the subject of abortion. So, here\u2019s a breakdown of all the latest Planned Parenthood stories, and what they mean for the future of the organization and healthcare.\n\nIs Planned Parenthood going to be defunded?\n\nIn short, as of right now, it\u2019s hard to say whether Planned Parenthood will still be funded next year.\n\nThere are two ways that Republicans could go about trying to defund Planned Parenthood. There is a bill that just passed the Senate that would both remove federal funding from Planned Parenthood for one year and repeal part of the Affordable Care Act. This bill had already passed in the House of Representatives. However, given that it\u2019s part of a bill to repeal Obamacare, President Obama is expected to veto it.\n\nSo, if that doesn\u2019t work, it is possible that the defunding would be tacked onto the spending bill that has to pass by December 11 in order for the government to continue functioning.\n\nWhy defund Planned Parenthood?\n\nThe woman\u2019s health organization has been under fire since several videos were released in July 2015 that imply that baby parts are sold by the organization. Since then, it has been proven that these videos were manipulated by an anti-abortion organization, but the damage had already been done. The president of Planned Parenthood has since had to testify before a congressional hearing, and the threat to defund the organization has become very real.\n\nWhat would happen if Planned Parenthood is defunded?\n\nIf Planned Parenthood is defunded, the results could be disastrous. While it is anyone\u2019s right to decide what side they fall on in the ongoing and ever-relevant debate about abortion, that is only a fraction of the work that Planned Parenthood clinics do across the country. According to its own statistics, 80 percent of its work is focused on preventing unintended pregnancies. Aside from that, it also provides 4.5 million STI tests and treatments each year, including nearly a quarter of a million HIV tests. When Planned Parenthood was defunded in rural Indiana, there was an explosion of HIV in the county. For many women, Planned Parenthood is the only source of STI testing, birth control, and other women\u2019s health services available to them. Defunding Planned Parenthood would take those services away from the five million people who visit clinic locations each year.\n\nArguments for Defunding Planned Parenthood\n\nOn the flip side, the government funds that are funneled into Planned Parenthood each year have many other worthy recipients. Jeff Duncan, a Representative from South Carolina, said that the Boys and Girls Club, for example, only gets a fraction of the funds that Planned Parenthood gets each year. There is also the argument that there should be less government-sponsored programs all together, and Planned Parenthood is just another program that should be funded in another way.\n\nHowever, no matter how it\u2019s stated, it comes down to this\u2014pro-lifers, and even some pro-choicers, don\u2019t think that the government should fund any organization that has anything to do with abortions, even if it is illegal for federal funds to pay for abortions themselves. In this belief system, Planned Parenthood shouldn\u2019t be a government-funded agency, and therefore defunding the organization would free up tax dollars for other uses.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with Planned Parenthood in Texas?\n\nGreg Abbott, the governor of Texas, announced in October that the state was going to remove Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funds. In return, Planned Parenthood and ten patients are suing the state of Texas in the hopes of stopping officials from cutting off the Medicaid funds that allowed the patients to be treated at Planned Parenthood locations. Texas is the fourth state, following Alabama, Arkansas, and Louisiana, to be involved in such a lawsuit this year.\n\nAbbott made his announcement after the uproar that the July 2015 videos caused. The videos depicted supposed Planned Parenthood officials discussing selling aborted fetal parts for research, including staff members at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which is located in Houston, Texas.\n\nDoes Planned Parenthood stand a chance of winning the lawsuit?\n\nThis lawsuit could go either way.\n\nIn Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas, the state had to stop proceedings to remove Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funds until officials looked into the matter more closely. This means that there is a chance that the removal is unconstitutional, or breaks some kind of law for restricting federal funds. Federal health officials did warn the Texas Health and Human Services Commission in October that removing Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funding could be a violation of United States law.\n\nThis is also not the first time that Planned Parenthood has sued the state of Texas. In 2012, Texas Republicans removed Planned Parenthood from the Texas Medicaid Women\u2019s Health Program. The state of Texas argued that the federal government gave individual states the right to decide how to allocate federal Medicaid funds, and Planned Parenthood eventually lost the lawsuit.\n\nAs of November 23, 2015, the state of Texas had not yet received legal papers in the lawsuit. Once papers are received, the case will likely end up in front of a federal judge.\n\nWhat about the shooting in Colorado Springs?\n\nOn Friday November 27, 2015\u2013Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving best known for shopping deals\u2014there was a fatal shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Three were left dead and nine injured in the shooting, and one of the deceased was a police officer. After a five-hour standoff with police, the shooter was taken into custody.\n\nAs of right now, the exact motive for the shooting is unknown. Robert L. Dear was arrested and appeared at a hearing on Monday November 30 wearing a security smocked designed to prevent suicides. Allegedly, when Dear was arrested, he uttered \u201cno more baby parts,\u201d but police have not been forthcoming with any other information.\n\nHow does this affect where Planned Parenthood stands?\n\nThe spotlight right now is on the potential Presidential candidates. None of the Republican candidates specifically addressed the attack until Saturday, a full day after the events took place, and then, it was on Twitter, and the statements were vague. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders released supports of sympathy. President Obama, meanwhile, stated his continued frustration with gun violence in the U.S.\n\nThe Senate voted this week on the bill that will defund Planned Parenthood, and while it was successful, it goes before President Obama now. Additionally, Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, has stated that Republicans are no longer planned to force a government shutdown over the defunding of Planned Parenthood, something they had been threatening to do in early November. However, how the status of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding remains to be seen.\n\nHow is all of this related to a prime-time television show?\n\nShonda Rhimes is not a woman who shies away from controversial issues, as the midseason finale of \u201cScandal\u201d clearly showed us. It is Rhimes\u2019 relevancy that strikes a nerve with viewers. She was able to show a scenario playing out in the Senate\u2013which is exactly where the bill that may defund Planned Parenthood for a year sat at the time\u2013when a Republican junior Senator from Virginia filibusters so that funding for Planned Parenthood is not downgraded to discretionary. Not only that, but we see Olivia Pope\u2013a strong woman, a character with gumption\u2013in the most vulnerable position a woman can find herself in: on a bed with her feet in stirrups and a doctor between her legs. Put the two women together in a single episode, and you leave your audience with a powerful image.\n\nAfter the episode aired, Planned Parenthood released this statement:\n\nTonight, the millions of people who tune into Scandal every Thursday night learned that our rights to reproductive health care are under attack. Never one to shy away from critical issues, Shonda Rhimes used her platform to tell the world that if Planned Parenthood lost funding for contraception counseling, STI testing, cancer screenings, and safe, legal abortion\u2014millions of people would suffer. And this episode wasn\u2019t the first time one of Rhimes\u2019 characters had an abortion, yet tonight we saw one of our favorite characters make the deeply personal decision that one in three women have made in their lifetime. We applaud Shonda Rhimes tonight\u2014and every Thursday night\u2014for proving that when women are telling our stories, the world will pause and watch. We just hope those in Congress\u2014and throughout the nation\u2014who are steadfast on rolling the clock back on reproductive health care access are taking note.\n\nBut, further proving the contentious nature of this issue, the conservative Media Research Counsel released their own statement the day after the episode aired:\n\nHollywood\u2019s liberal values permeate movies and television. Last night\u2019s episode of ABC\u2019s Scandal was pretty much an hour-long advertisement for Planned Parenthood. In the most disturbing scene, the main character has an abortion to \u2018Silent Night\u2019 (a hymn celebrating the birth of Jesus) playing in the background. This is Hollywood\u2019s moral depravity on full display.\n\nThis particular episode was an interesting juxtaposition when considered side-by-side with what is currently happening in Texas and Colorado Springs. Rhimes showed women making powerful statements about the importance and commonplaceness of women\u2019s health organizations like Planned Parenthood. In the current contentious political climate, \u201cScandal\u2019s\u201d arc showed a fictional look at some very real issues.\n\nConclusion\n\nPlanned Parenthood will likely always be in the news; such is the case when something as polarizing as abortion is involved. Religious and moral beliefs will cause the country to be split in two on the issue, as has been the case since Planned Parenthood opened its doors one hundred years ago. As long as the issue is relevant, we will continue to see media portray the issue in different lights, both in fiction and in mainstream media. And it is likely that Planned Parenthood and the news surrounding it will stay relevant for a while.\n\nResources\n\nPrimary\n\nPlanned Parenthood: Planned Parenthood at a Glance\n\nAdditional\n\nTexas Tribune: Planned Parenthood Sues Texas Over Medicaid Removal\n\nLos Angeles Times: Planned Parenthood Sues Texas Over Medicaid Funding\n\nThe New York Times: What Defunding Planned Parenthood Would Really Mean\n\nDenver Post: What We Know about the Planned Parenthood Shooting in Colorado Springs\n\nRefinery 29: Scandal Season 5, Episode 9 Recap: The Women Take a Stand\n\nEntertainment Weekly: Scandal Abortion Shock: ABC Hit Slams Planned Parenthood Defunding\n\nNPR: After Planned Parenthood Shooting, Obama Again Calls for Action on Guns\n\nThe New Yorker: The Planned Parenthood Shooting and the Republican Candidates\u2019 Responses\n\nThe New York Times: For Robert Dear, Religion and Rage Before Planned Parenthood Attack\n\nThe New York Times: No Shutdown Expected on Planned Parenthood\n\nThe New York Times: Planned Parenthood Sues Texas in Dispute of Funding for Clinics\n\nHuffington Post: Indiana Shut Down Its Rural Planned Parenthood Clinics and Got an HIV Outbreak\n\nSlate: The GOP Argument for Defunding Planned Parenthood is Incoherent\n\nThe Wall Street Journal: Republicans Look for Votes to Defund Planned Parenthood, Repeal Parts of Health Law\n\nThe Atlantic: \u2018Scandal\u2019 Gracefully Tackled Abortion in Its Midseason Finale\n\nRefinery 29: Planned Parenthood \u201cApplauds Shonda Rhimes\u201d for Last Night\u2019s Episode of Scandal\n\nDaily Signal: Why Haven\u2019t GOP-Led States Defunded Planned Parenthood?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "colorado springs shooting, congress, defund planned parenthood, obamacare, planned parenthood, president obama, scandal, senate, shonda rhimes, business, companies, economy, industry, education, entertainment, arts, books, headlines, humor, legal, lifestyle, culture, nation, politics, religion, science, environment, sports, technology, internet, weird news, world", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Planned Parenthood's Continued Relevancy\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/lawstreetmedia.com\\/issues\\/law-and-politics\\/planned-parenthoods-continued-relevancy\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-04 11:35:59\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-08 10:09:49\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":49325,\"author_id\":\"7509\",\"author_name\":\"Amanda Gernentz Hanson\",\"author_display_name\":\"Amanda Gernentz Hanson\",\"tags\":[\"Colorado Springs Shooting\",\"Congress\",\"Defund Planned Parenthood\",\"Obamacare\",\"Planned Parenthood\"],\"categories\":[\"Law\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/lawstreetmedia.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/Planned-Parenthood.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "Law Street (TM)", "description": "Planned Parenthood has been in the news a lot lately--here's a breakdown of all the important stories we should be following.", "title": "Planned Parenthood's Continued Relevancy - Law Street (TM)", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 5616, "identifier": "http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/Planned-Parenthood.jpg", "height": 3744}, "updated_time": "2015-12-08T10:09:49-04:00", "url": "http://lawstreetmedia.com/issues/law-and-politics/planned-parenthoods-continued-relevancy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Law Street (TM)", "description": "Planned Parenthood has been in the news a lot lately.
