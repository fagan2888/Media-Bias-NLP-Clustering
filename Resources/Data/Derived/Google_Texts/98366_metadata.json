(Photo: Courtesy photo )\n\n\"I also scanned in buttons, foliage, barbed wire,\" she said. \"My scanner has seen it all.\"\n\nShe created designs with women and humor as inspiration.\n\n\"I am very much inspired by trying to look at life from a humorous point of view,\" she said. \"I think it is important we not take ourselves too seriously. And laughter is so good for the soul.\"\n\nShari Jenkins Schmit recently sold her greeting card company to Leanin\u2019Tree, a Colorado-based greeting card company.

After meeting with the company, she decided to sell her business and will continue to do some designs.\n\nPart of her decision to sell is so that she can focus on her new project. Her husband Mike recently was transferred back to Great Falls and the couple bought The Collins Mansion.\n\nYears of operation as a bed and breakfast left the historic home in need of some restoration.\n\n\"Our goal is to open the home up for public tours in two years, which will be the 125th anniversary of when the mansion was built,\" Schmit said.\n\nGreat Falls native hired as director of Small Business Development Center\n\nJason Nitchke is the new director of the Small Business Development Center, which is hosted by the Great Falls Development Authority. He replaces Rebecca Engum, who will take on a new role recruiting manufacturing businesses to the area.\n\nNitschke and his wife, Andrea Fisher-Nitschke, worked in the Great Falls television industry for several years before moving to St. Louis in 2011.\n\nJason Nitschke is returning to Great Falls with his wife Andrea and daughter Logan to be the director of the Small Business Development Center.

The multilevel department store was a downtown anchor and its move to the Holiday Village Mall in 1991 is still referred to as a distinct blow to commerce in the area.\n\nNow 80, years later, the iconic retailer will no longer have a brick and mortar presence in the Electric City.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1sbfHFx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Montana entrepreneur sells her card business to Leanin' Tree", "og": {"site_name": "Great Falls Tribune", "description": "Montana entrepreneur sells her card business to Leanin' Tree", "title": "The Buzz", "url": "http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/money/2014/09/19/great-falls-native-hired-run-small-business-development-center/15908471/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greatfallstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Montana entrepreneur sells her card business to Leanin' Tree", "creator": "@GFTribune", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9b15c36d654b399521e8c2a58dd20146eea853a/c=0-320-1128-1448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreatFalls/2014/09/21/bbb.jpg", "title": "The Buzz", "site": "@GFTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=863095595", "fb": {"app_id": 137930962930704}, "article": {"author": "GFTrib_JBlack"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd143f\"", "article_summary": "Sears opened in Great Falls eight decades agoThe announcement that Sears is closing its Great Falls store in mid-December came earlier this week.\nShari Jenkins Schmit recently sold her greeting card company to Leanin\u2019Tree, a Colorado-based greeting card company.\n\"I had taken a Photoshop class when I lived in Great Falls, so I started creating.\"\nThe couple, who now have a 1-year-old daughter Logan, decided to try to relocate back to Great Falls, which is Nitschke's hometown.\nNitschke and his wife, Andrea Fisher-Nitschke, worked in the Great Falls television industry for several years before moving to St. Louis in 2011."}
