Press Secretary Josh Earnest did his best to spin the defeat as a victory, albeit one slightly marred by a \u201cprocedural snafu.\u201d Those under no obligation to protect Obama\u2019s image, however, felt differently. Vox\u2019s Jonathan Allen reported that the president\u2019s trade agenda was possibly already dead.\n\nIn the time since, the White House and its Republican allies in Congress have opted for a Plan B, which will require Obama to (arguably) break a promise and to muscle through the Senate a less-bipartisan version of a bill that had trouble passing already. Oh, and they\u2019ll have to do this despite the fact that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton looks like she\u2019s going to follow the Democratic Party\u2019s base and remake herself as a free-trade skeptic. All that aside, though, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a cinch.\n\nBut while the ultimate fate of the TPP is still unclear, there\u2019s one element of this ongoing fight within the Democratic Party that you should expect to see more of in the years to come. It\u2019s not the rise of a more combative labor movement, though that\u2019s certainly part of it. And it\u2019s not the decline of the party\u2019s neoliberal wing, though that\u2019s happening, too. No, it\u2019s something much less important, but much more amusing: the wails of outrage and self-pity from moderate Democrats who resent the party\u2019s once docile, but now ascendant, liberal base.\n\nTrue, as it became apparent that the House TPP vote was going to be closer than the moderates and the White House predicted, there were some murmurs of discontent. But it wasn\u2019t until a Thursday report from Politico that we heard the pro-TPP crowd really using its outside voice. The article was analytically suspect \u2014 among other curiosities, Rep. Steny Hoyer, the decidedly moderate minority whip, seems to be presented as a liberal \u2014 but it was also well-reported. More importantly, it reflected the worldview, biases and delusions of corporate America\u2019s friends in Washington, which is Politico\u2019s stock-in-trade.\n\nFor example, despite the fact that, as Steven Greenhouse reported for the Guardian, the alliance against the TPP was basically comprised of the Democratic Party\u2019s entire base, Politico focuses exclusively on organized labor. And once you read the rest of the article, you can see why: it\u2019s the only framing pro-TPP Dems can use without sounding out of touch. Unions are easy to demonize as \u201cspecial interests,\u201d after all. If you\u2019re talking about faith groups, civil liberties advocates, consumer protection organizations, liberal economists and more, on the other hand, it\u2019s hard to use that talking point without sounding like a Republican.\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason why Politico\u2019s Democratic sources kept the focus on unions: because unions, for all their troubles, are still better than the rest of the liberal coalition at wielding their financial clout. And because the unions followed a strategy of threatening to withhold donations for \u2014 or even launch primary campaigns against \u2014 Democrats who voted for the TPP. Business-friendly Democrats know how conservative activists use a similar approach to keep squishy Republicans in line. They\u2019ve seen it work; and they don\u2019t like it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Moderate Dems are reeling from their TPP defeat.
