They just put our overzealous federal government back in its constitutional place.\n\n\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor is an international congregation of Roman Catholic nuns who have devoted their lives to caring for the elderly poor. Since the order's 1839 founding in France, its mission has been to give dignity and love to the frail and weak in the very last stage of their lives.\n\n\n\nWhen Obamacare became the law of the land, it demanded that the sisters purchase insurance policies for the order's employees that cover the cost of contraception, abortive drugs and sterilization. But the nuns could never do so because their vow is to advance the dignity of life for every person, including the unborn.\n\n\n\nThe Little Sisters sought a religious exemption from the rules, but, according to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal group that defended the sisters in court, the government said the nuns were not religious enough to be exempt. The government insisted the Obamacare exemption applied only to churches and church-controlled ministries.\n\n\n\nThe government threatened massive fines against the 27 retirement homes the sisters operate in the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at a cost of $100 per employee per day, or $70 million in fines per year. This amount represents one-third of the Little Sisters' operating budget and would have severely hampered the sisters' ability to care for the elderly poor.\n\n\n\nSo, in 2013, the sisters sued the government.\n\n\n\nThey argued their constitutional right to practice their faith freely was being obstructed by our ever-growing government. The federal court in Denver ruled against them. Thankfully, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued an injunction that temporarily stopped the fines.\n\n\n\nThe sisters appealed the federal court ruling. They lost again in 2015, before the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Little Sisters then filed a petition to the Supreme Court. Finally, last week, the Supreme Court gave the sisters a huge win.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Becket Fund, \"The Supreme Court unanimously overturned the lower court rulings against the Little Sisters, ordered the government not to fine the Little Sisters, and said the lower courts should provide the government an opportunity 'to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates the petitioner's religious beliefs.'\"\n\n\n\nWhat is most puzzling about the whole situation is that none of this was necessary. President Obama acknowledged \"the government can continue to provide these services without the Little Sisters and their health plan,\" according to the Becket Fund.\n\n\n\nSo why did our government attack the sisters who have dedicated their lives to caring for the elderly poor?\n\n\n\nIt beats me, but it is a textbook case of why I and others worry about the erosion of our country's most basic freedoms as our overzealous government extends its tentacles more deeply into every aspect of our everyday lives.\n\n\n\nIn the current state of affairs, it takes the incredible fortitude of a group of selfless nuns to protect and restore our freedoms.\n\n\n\nThey fought the good fight against a mighty foe so they may continue to practice their faith freely in what is supposed to be the freest nation on Earth.\n\n\n\nTom Purcell (www.TomPurcell.com) is a syndicated columnist.\n\nFollow Us", "article_metadata": {"KeyWords": "Waterbury, Newspaper, Waterbury Republican-American, News, Sports, Weather, Connecticut, CT, Conn, Naugatuck Valley, Watertown, Woodbury, Southbury, Torrington, Cheshire, Middlebury, Wolcott, Oxford, Bethany, Prospect", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "Description": "The Republican-American Newspaper, Waterbury, Connecticut", "robots": "noarchive"}, "article_summary": "Little Sisters in fight for freedomBy Tom PurcellGod bless the Little Sisters of the Poor.\nThis amount represents one-third of the Little Sisters' operating budget and would have severely hampered the sisters' ability to care for the elderly poor.\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor is an international congregation of Roman Catholic nuns who have devoted their lives to caring for the elderly poor.\nThe Little Sisters then filed a petition to the Supreme Court.\nPresident Obama acknowledged \"the government can continue to provide these services without the Little Sisters and their health plan,\" according to the Becket Fund."}
