Bail was raised to $10 million Tuesday for a former Los Angeles Police Department officer accused of gunning down a man at a nightclub.

The bail amount for Henry Solis, 27, was originally set at $2 million. Prosecutors asked for the bail increase, saying they feared Solis' family might be able to post the lower amount, raising the possibility he might flee again.

He is due back in court June 30 for arraignment.

Solis, arrested last month after authorities said he fled to Mexico with help from his father, faces one count of murder and one count of assault with a firearm, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. The complaint includes a special allegation that Solis personally discharged a handgun.

Solis was arrested and returned to Southern California after evading authorities for more than two months. He was sought in the shooting death of 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez following a dispute at a Pomona nightclub in March.

His return came on the same day a jury in Texas found his father, Victor Manuel Solis, guilty of making false statements to the FBI to prevent authorities from finding his son.
