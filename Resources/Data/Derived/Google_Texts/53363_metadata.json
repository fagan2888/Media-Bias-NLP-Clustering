Peering through a window, he thought he saw a fallen mannequin. Once he realized it was the corpse of Kurt Cobain, the twenty-seven-year-old lead singer of the grunge band Nirvana, Smith called a local Seattle radio station before calling the police.\n\nThree days earlier, Cobain, fleeing drug treatment, binging on heroin and valium, had shot himself in the head. The troubadour of trauma for the twentysomethings\u2019 recently christened \u201cGeneration X,\u201d Cobain felt crushed between the edginess of his art and the machinery marketing his music. Modern popular culture now specialized in domesticating musical outlaws so they could afford luxuries like the $1.5 million home Cobain and his wife, Courtney Love, had purchased that January. \u201cThe worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I\u2019m having 100% fun,\u201d Cobain wrote in his suicide note.\n\nWhile suicide rates had steadily averaged thirty thousand annually since the 1950s, teen suicide had tripled and suicide awareness had surged. Discussing once-taboo topics like this one fed demands to legalize assisted suicide for the elderly and the infirm. In 1990, Dr. Jack Kevorkian aided in his first public assisted suicide. He was arrested but acquitted. The practice had not yet been outlawed. In 1991, Kevorkian lost his medical license but continued crusading for this right, as a journalist, Derek Humphry, wrote \u201cFinal Exit: The Practicalities of Self-Deliverance and Assisted Suicide for the Dying.\u201d This how-to guide eventually sold more than 1 million copies.\n\nKurt Loder, the MTV news anchor better suited to reporting on bands premiering than young legends buried, broke into regular programming to announce Cobain\u2019s death. MTV\u2019s producers pompously compared the following days of round-the-clock coverage to covering John Kennedy\u2019s assassination. As millions watched MTV all night, burned Cobain\u2019s signature flannel shirts in the park near Seattle\u2019s iconic Space Needle, lit candles in memory of their tortured hero, many feared that the voice of the next generation had been stilled. \u201cHe was a geek and a god,\u201d one fan told USA Today. \u201cI really dug him.\u201d Bill Clinton asked Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam whether to address the nation about Cobain\u2019s death; Vedder said no, he feared encouraging copycats.\n\nIt was not just that Cobain\u2019s was another musical Cinderella story, a child of divorce who was bullied in school, recorded his first album for $606.17, and saw his band\u2019s second album, \u201cNevermind,\u201d sell 10 million copies. It was not just that \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d and other Nirvana hits mixing depressing lyrics with sometimes surprisingly catchy tunes became anthems of angst for the surprisingly troubled masses. Cobain and his grunge group Nirvana helped make Seattle \u201cthe New Liverpool,\u201d according to Rolling Stone. With equally gloomy bands like Pearl Jam, Mudhoney, and Soundgarden, Nirvana mixed hard rock, punk, and metal to create the \u201cSeattle Sound,\u201d expressing this New Nihilism. \u201cI know there was nothing healthy about singing \u2018Rape Me,\u2019\u201d one Nirvana fan wrote. \u201cKurt didn\u2019t offer any solutions, he just railed against the ugliness and made it his home.\u201d\n\nGrunge\u2014a label of disputed origins and elastic meaning\u2014quickly metamorphosed from a musical style originating with young, edgy Seattle-based bands to a lifestyle appealing to America\u2019s army of alienated and apathetic Peter Pans. The flannel shirts and leather jackets, ratty sweaters and torn jeans, long hair and layers of clothing, were purposely unglitzy, defiantly un-Eighties. Even the drug of choice switched from upscale cocaine to blue-collar marijuana. The grunge look professed to be carefree, despite its uniformity. It purported to be casual, despite how hard people cultivated it, especially after the budding designer Marc Jacobs\u2019s spring/summer 1993 grunge collection. Most practically, it protected against Seattle\u2019s cold weather.\n\nGrunge, along with gangsta rap\u2019s prison chic, punk\u2019s masochism, and heavy metal\u2019s exhibitionism, helped mainstream the use of tattoos, body piercing, and even some limited body cutting, as vehicles for self-expression and individuation. Kurt Cobain\u2019s left forearm sported the brand of the small independent record label K, \u201cto try and remind me to stay a child,\u201d he said. The range of rockers\u2019 tattoos, expressing friendship, longing, sentiments, politics, and sheer delight in oneself, illustrated the range of emotions that had as many as 20 million Americans tattooed by 1995. One hip San Franciscan told Newsweek these \u201cidentity bracelets\u201d kept young people feeling bohemian, even when they sold out. New Agers sold tattoos to \u201cbridge between the physical and the spiritual.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m adorning my temple . . . ,\u201d said one regular, who added more tattoos week by week, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing you have that can\u2019t be taken away from you.\u201d A Sunset Strip biker tattooist scoffed: \u201cWe\u2019re not into that cosmic stuff.\u201d\n\nFreethinking child psychiatrists preached tolerance, defining these acts as the Nineties\u2019 version of the World War II graffitist\u2019s \u201cKilroy Was Here,\u201d affirming the autonomous self in a volatile age. As America individuated, Dr. Andres Martin of Yale suggested, marking the body asserted power and established permanence. To cultural conservatives like John Leo of U.S. News & World Report, these \u201cmodern primitives\u201d were repositioning \u201cthe sadomasochistic instinct . . . to look spiritually high-toned.\u201d In the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville considered American individualism surprisingly uniform and conformist. In post-1960s\u2019 consumerist America, the grunge rebellion, like most others, had been commodified, mass-produced, ritualized, and thus sanitized.\n\nThis commercialized, neutralized rebellion celebrating America the contingent, the evanescent, the depressing, imperiled Bill Clinton\u2019s sweeping ambitions. This New Nihilism countered Clintonian bonding agents like responsibility and community. This nihilism was kinder, gentler, more indulgent, less harsh, less soulless than the original European version. Nevertheless, there still would be a certain lack of faith in the future, in community, in ideals and big ideas. As individualism and libertinism often made family ties disposable, as big ideas seemed less important with the era of big government ending, Americans\u2014 along with many Westerners\u2014seemed to be rejecting many of the basic social and ideological givens that had structured society for so long\u2014and that all humans need. Clinton wanted young activists, not young defeatists. In 1994, the Seattle-style apathy of the young who allied with Clinton culturally combined with the Washington-based antipathy of those who abhorred Clinton culturally and politically to imperil his presidency.\n\nSeattle: A Capital of Horizontal America\n\nAmerica\u2019s twenty-first largest city, inhabited by 516,259 in 1990, Seattle could lay claim to being the capital\u2014or in Seattle\u2019s true progressive spirit\u2014a capital of the new horizontal America emerging. Seattle would be hailed as America\u2019s grunge capital, America\u2019s coffee capital, the headquarters of Gen X, the new hometown of one of America\u2019s most popular sitcoms, \u201cFrasier,\u201d and, perhaps, America\u2019s funkiest city. Such defining firms as Microsoft, Starbucks, and Amazon would be headquartered in this, America\u2019s leading \u201clatte town,\u201d or its suburbs.\n\nCities have their moments. Seattle\u2019s combination of intensity, intimacy, angst, and ennui, worked particularly well in the 1990s. The Seattle Sound reflected the city\u2019s gritty but wholesome, alienated yet oddly engaged, dynamic. If the World War II veterans were quintessentially Midwestern, wherever they lived, and Baby Boomers fused the Northeast with Southern California, alienated Gen Xers reflected a Northwestern vibe, as loose bolts from around America collected in that corner of the country. In 1993\u2019s three-hankie, Oscar-nominated feel-good movie, Tom Hanks plays a widower who moves to the Northwest from Chicago. Before he finds love with the perky Meg Ryan, thanks to his flamboyantly cute if meddlesome son who turns to a talk radio therapist for advice, Hanks, in mourning, is \u201cSleepless in Seattle.\u201d\n\nDouglas Coupland captured this Seattle Sensibility in his epoch-defining 1991 novel \u201cGeneration X.\u201d Coupland lived in Vancouver most of his life, which was like Seattle but with national health care and a tendency to end declarative sentences with \u201cay\u201d and a question mark. In an increasingly national and homogenized America, popular culture was less about place and more about the collective experiences in the space the mass media shaped. Oozing what he called \u201cBoomer Envy,\u201d Coupland described young shiftless people with \u201cMcJobs\u201d\u2014 enduring \u201cLow pay, low prestige, low benefits, low future\u201d\u2014experiencing \u201cMid-Twenties\u2019 Breakdown,\u201d resenting that \u201cOur Parents Had More,\u201d as America underwent \u201cBrazilification,\u201d with the gap growing between rich and poor. The \u201cLessness\u201d was economic and cultural. These socially, emotionally, and culturally deprived young people fought consumerism by insisting \u201cI am not a Target Market\u201d while succumbing to it, seeking deeper connections even as their \u201cDivorce Assumption\u201d and their \u201ccult of aloneness\u201d viewed all relationships as disposable, a logical conclusion with half of all marriages dissolving. They were overwhelmed by too much technology (i.e., \u201ccryptotechnophobia\u201d), too much choice (i.e., \u201coption paralysis\u201d), and too much freedom (i.e., \u201cterminal wanderlust\u201d).\n\nThe Bored and the Shiftless, in Movies and on TV\n\nBy 1994, many critics tired of Coupland\u2019s kvetching. His third book \u201cLife After God,\u201d a short story collection, evoked contempt from one reviewer for rehashing the same \u201cself-pitying, small-scale ennui of Generation X.\u201d Still, while Coupland showed that Generation X could be an entertaining and lucrative literary subject, the inevitable generational movies mostly failed commercially. \u201cSlacker\u201d (1991), \u201cSingles\u201d (1992), \u201cReality Bites\u201d (1994), and \u201cClerks\u201d (1994) were clever, ironic, evocative. In \u201cReality Bites,\u201d a young Ethan Hawke plays Troy Dyer, a coffeehouse guitarist struggling between subversive idealism and nihilistic cynicism. When a friend wonders \u201cwhy things just can\u2019t go back to normal at the end of the half hour like on \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d or something,\u201d Troy replies: \u201cWell, \u2019cause Mr. Brady died of AIDS.\u201d Robert Reed, who played the all-American 1970s father, died as a closeted gay man with HIV.\n\nUnfortunately, movies about bored, shiftless drifters left viewers bored and restless. Ben Stiller, the twenty-eight-year-old director of \u201cReality Bites,\u201d wanted to make \u201ca movie about personal relationships,\u201d not define a generation that didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be pigeonholed as Generation X.\u201d Stiller\u2019s forty-nine-year-old producer, Michael Shamberg, however, admitted he sought a sequel to his defining yuppie movie from 1983, \u201cThe Big Chill.\u201d\n\nBored, shiftless drifters played much better in short bursts on TV. As the 1990s began, The Cosby Show\u2019s warm fuzzy family franchise ended, as did \u201cCheers\u2019s\u201d warm fuzzy community franchise. \u201cThere\u2019s room on TV for a dysfunctional family you can laugh at,\u201d said Matt Groening, the cartoonist who created America\u2019s first successful prime-time cartoon since \u201cThe Flintstones.\u201d Television publicized the American dystopia with crude, cynical, selfish characters modeling the New Nihilism. \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d inverted the Donna Reed\u2013Brady Bunch squareness of Nick at Nite. Instead, the central character Bart, an anagram for Brat, reveled in being an obnoxious, defiant ten-year-old. His sister Lisa would call her brother, \u201cthe spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Clinton talked responsibility and hope.
