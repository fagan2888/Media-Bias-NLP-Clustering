I’m pro-life because an innocent human being should be able to get a chance at life rather than not existing at all.

In the United States, the consequence for taking or harming a bald eagle is $5,000 or one-year imprisonment for the first conviction. But the government has no problem with helping women get abortions under certain circumstances.

What makes a bird so much more important than a human being?

If anything, both should be of equal value and worth.

I understand the need for an abortion if it is a truly life- threatening situation for the mother or the baby. However, if there are no harmful threats, then there should be no need for an abortion.

In cases of rape and incest, I understand why some women wouldn’t want the child. It’d be a constant reminder of what the mother experienced. However, that memory is going to be engraved in her mind forever, regardless if she has the baby or not. You can’t forget something that traumatic.
