Nikiya Harris Dodd, D-Milwaukee, wants to expand medical malpractice legislation in the state to avoid such a scenario.\n\nWisconsin law does not allow parents to sue on behalf of their adult child for wrongful death. Harris Dodd is seeking co-sponsorship for a bill that would allow parents to sue for wrongful death due to medical malpractice for their child up to age 27.\n\nAt a briefing on Oct. 15, Harris Dodd announced she is calling her bill \u201cErin\u2019s Law,\u201d dedicated to 20-year-old Erin Rice who died after a misdiagnosed case of bacterial pneumonia in 1999. Her parents were not able to sue the UW Health doctor responsible for her death because Erin was already of adult age.\n\n\u201cI am proud to draft this bill as one step in the right direction to making families whole,\u201d Harris Dodd said at the briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we give Wisconsin families who have faced such tragic circumstances the right to have their questions answered.\u201d\n\nMark Grapentine, senior vice president of government relations at Wisconsin Medical Society, said Harris Dodd likely set the age at 27 because it would be in accordance with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s policy of allowing children to use their parents\u2019 insurance up to that age.\n\nBut there are many other gaps in medical malpractice law, Ann Jacobs, president of Wisconsin Association for Justice said. She said this bill addresses one portion of that.\n\n\u201cWhat Erin\u2019s Law seeks to do is close one very small part of that gaping hole, and that is to allow parents of unmarried children who are between the ages of 18 and 27 to sue if somebody kills their child,\u201d Jacobs said.\n\nGrapentine said if someone is injured or dies from medical malpractice, they can sue for either economic or non-economic damages.\n\nHarris Dodd\u2019s bill deals only with non-economic damages, also known as suing for the loss of society and companionship. Grapentine said such cases are often difficult to sue for because it is hard to create a standard for emotion-based damages in court.\n\nGrapentine said Wisconsin Medical Society is wary of Harris Dodd\u2019s legislation because they do not want to expand the potential exposure of physicians in the lawsuit industry world.\n\nGrapentine said Wisconsin has a fairly well-regarded ability to provide all economic damages that a medical liability claimant can get if they prevail in courts.\n\n\u201cWe have a medical liability environment in Wisconsin that is envied by much of the rest of the nation because we don\u2019t have to deal with a lot of junk lawsuits or attempted shakedowns to get a settlement,\u201d Grapentine said.\n\nGrapentine said Wisconsin has the \u201cWisconsin Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund,\u201d which almost all physicians must participate in. It is an umbrella insurance fund that does not limit the amount of economic damages that an injured patience can be covered by, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other fund like it in the country that has mandatory participation and unlimited economic damages exposure,\u201d Grapentine said.\n\nBut Jacobs said the fund has flaws. She said Wisconsin ranks last in the nation in terms of people being compensated for medical malpractice.\n\nJacobs said there are a vast number of issues in current medical malpractice law in Wisconsin. For one, she said patients or their families have a difficult time getting a case in the first place because they are so expensive that attorneys are reluctant to take them. That is because there is a cap on the amount of damages that can be received in non-economic medical malpractice cases. Another issue is the limits on who can file a lawsuit, which is what Harris Dodd is trying to address.\n\nJacobs said by addressing such a narrow part of medical malpractice law, more Republicans might support Harris Dodd\u2019s legislation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Badger Herald", "description": "Experts discuss complexities in medical malpractice law, how Wisconsin is unique.", "title": "Senator drafts bill to allow parents to sue for child\u2019s wrongful death up to age 27", "url": "https://badgerherald.com/news/2015/11/02/senator-drafts-bill-to-allow-parents-to-sue-for-childs-wrongful-death-up-to-age-27/", "image": "https://badgerherald.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/exa/img/misc/social-thumb.png", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "State of Wisconsin", "published_time": "2015-11-02T06:00:27-0600", "modified_time": "2015-11-01T17:46:19-0600"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@badgerherald", "creator": "@EmmaPalasz", "description": "Experts discuss complexities in medical malpractice law, how Wisconsin is unique.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senator drafts bill to allow parents to sue for child\u2019s wrongful death up to age 27"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Wisconsin law does not allow parents to sue on behalf of their adult child for wrongful death.\nHarris Dodd is seeking co-sponsorship for a bill that would allow parents to sue for wrongful death due to medical malpractice for their child up to age 27.\nAnother issue is the limits on who can file a lawsuit, which is what Harris Dodd is trying to address.\nSen.
