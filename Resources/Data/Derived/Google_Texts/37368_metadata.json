So how -- I don't know how we could support 'em.\"\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Koch Industries and one of the most powerful and controversial figures in politics said he and his brother David Koch have also turned down pleas to join the \"Never Trump\" movement, which aims to deny the real estate mogul the nomination.\n\nInstead Koch said he and his brother plan to stay out of the party's nomination fight.\n\n\"We haven't put a penny in any of these campaigns, pro or con,\" Koch said. \"That's not what we do. What we're trying to do is build alliances to make the country better.\u201d\n\nKoch, author of the book \"Good Profit,\" said he would only consider contributing to either Trump or Cruz if they backtrack on some of their most controversial promises. That includes one of Cruz's favorite lines of his campaign stump speech -- to carpet bomb ISIS in the Middle East and \"make the sand glow.\"\n\n\"That's gotta be hyperbole, but I mean that a candidate -- whether they believe it or not -- would think that appeals to the American people,\" Koch said. \"This is frightening.\"\n\nKoch also slammed Trump's rhetoric towards Muslims, saying his proposal of a temporary travel ban was \"antithetical.\"\n\n\"What was worse was this 'we'll have them all registered,'\" Koch said. \"That's reminiscent of Nazi Germany. I mean -- that's monstrous as I said at the time.\"\n\nKoch went so far as to say the GOP nightmare of another Clinton presidency might be a better alternative to the remaining Republican candidates at this point.\n\n\"It's possible,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charles Koch says he won\u2019t \u201cput a penny\u201d into trying to stop Donald Trump, that there are \u201cterrible role models\u201d among the remaining Republican presidential candidates, and that his massive political network may decide to sit out of the presidential race entirely.", "language": "english", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Charles-Koch-Why-I-didnt-try-to-stop-Donald-Trump-376891841.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/charles+koch+abc.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Charles Koch says he won\u2019t \u201cput a penny\u201d into trying to stop Donald Trump, that there are \u201cterrible role models\u201d among the remaining Republican presidential candidates, and that his massive political network may decide to sit out of the presidential race entirely.", "title": "Charles Koch: Why I didn't try to stop Donald Trump"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Charles Koch says he won\u2019t \u201cput a penny\u201d into trying to stop Donald Trump, that there are \u201cterrible role models\u201d among the remaining Republican presidential candidates, and that his massive political network may decide to sit out of the presidential race entirely.", "title": "Charles Koch: Why I didn't try to stop Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Charles-Koch-Why-I-didnt-try-to-stop-Donald-Trump-376891841.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/charles+koch+abc.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Charles Koch: Why I didn't try to stop Donald Trump", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Charles Koch Why I didnt, try to stop Donald Trump"}, "article_summary": "\"You're role models and you're terrible role models.\nABC NewsCharles Koch says he won\u2019t \u201cput a penny\u201d into trying to stop Donald Trump, that there are \u201cterrible role models\u201d among the remaining Republican presidential candidates, and that his massive political network may decide to sit out of the presidential race entirely.\nKoch went so far as to say the GOP nightmare of another Clinton presidency might be a better alternative to the remaining Republican candidates at this point.\n\"These personal attacks and pitting one person against the other -- that's the message you're sending the country,\" Koch said in an exclusive interview with ABC News that aired Sunday.\nKoch also slammed Trump's rhetoric towards Muslims, saying his proposal of a temporary travel ban was \"antithetical.\""}
