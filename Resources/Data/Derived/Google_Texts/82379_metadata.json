Critics of the show have called the conduct of the league\u2019s coaches unsportsmanlike and even dangerous. Since its premiere, two of the league\u2019s coaches have been suspended.\n\nThe show follows five hard-hitting, full contact teams in the \u201cRookie\u201d division of the Texas Youth Football Association in the San Antonio region during the 2013 season. It purports to show how coaches and parents teach discipline and dedication through football. However, after just a couple of episodes, some viewers believe that the league emphasizes unhealthy competition more than anything else. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re watching child abuse\u2026 sanctioned child abuse,\u201d ESPN Analyst and author Tom Farrey told ABC News. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that this kind of coaching is effective in building athletes over the long-term.\u201d\n\nTwo coaches, Charles Chavarria and Marecus Goodloe, were suspended after the league witnessed their behavior on the show, ABC News reported. Chavarria allegedly encouraged one of his players to hit an opponent with his helmet, an act that is extremely dangerous and banned in football environments including the National Football League (NFL). He was suspended for the rest of this year\u2019s season. Goodloe, on the other hand, was suspended for just six games. He\u2019s accused of encouraging his players to use profanity during the game. Both coaches apologized for their actions, citing the intensity of the environment. \u201cI\u2019m definitely apologetic for that. It was a bone head moment and a bad decision on my part,\u201d Goodloe said.\n\nBut what makes an 8-year-old\u2019s football game so intense that it causes adults to act out?\n\nPerhaps the famous Texas football culture is to blame. But watching the show, it\u2019s hard to ignore how much the adults actually care about the kids in the league \u2014 even if they have an extremely tough way of showing it. It\u2019s because, as they see it, they\u2019re investing in these children\u2019s future. As TIME points out, there\u2019s an undeniable passion that the parents and coaches in the league all have. They genuinely believe they\u2019re giving the tiny football players tools to become successful as they grow older. When one coach was reminded that he was talking to little kids, he replied, \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s our mindset. If we allow them to keep making excuses, that they\u2019re just 8-year-olds \u2014 they\u2019re not 8-year-olds! They\u2019re growing boys!\u201d\n\nFriday Night Tykes airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Esquire.\n\nSee more US News from ABC|ABC World News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "friday night tykes, esquire network, injuries, hard hits, age 8", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The reality show \"Friday Night Tykes\" is coming under fire for the unhealthy behavior that the coaches and parents encourage in its young, impressionable football players.", "title": "Texas Football Players Face Foul Language And Hard Hits \u2014 At Age 8 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/friday-night-tykes-texas-youth-football-players-face-injuries-foul-language-and-hard-hits-age-8", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/05/shutterstock9475798.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The reality show \"Friday Night Tykes\" is coming under fire for the unhealthy behavior that the coaches and parents encourage in its young, impressionable football players.", "title": "Texas Football Players Face Foul Language And Hard Hits \u2014 At Age 8 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/friday-night-tykes-texas-youth-football-players-face-injuries-foul-language-and-hard-hits-age-8", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/05/shutterstock9475798.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/05/shutterstock9475798.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-05T15:43:27-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-05T15:51:30-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The reality show \"Friday Night Tykes\" is coming under fire for the unhealthy behavior that the coaches and parents encourage in its young, impressionable football players."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9a7\"", "article_summary": "If we allow them to keep making excuses, that they\u2019re just 8-year-olds \u2014 they\u2019re not 8-year-olds!\nBut what makes an 8-year-old\u2019s football game so intense that it causes adults to act out?\nThey genuinely believe they\u2019re giving the tiny football players tools to become successful as they grow older.\nChavarria allegedly encouraged one of his players to hit an opponent with his helmet, an act that is extremely dangerous and banned in football environments including the National Football League (NFL).\nFriday Night Tykes, a reality show that airs on the Esquire Network, is drawing criticism for the way the show\u2019s stars, 8- and 9-year-old football players, are taught to play the game."}
