While it is often shocking to see it added up for one year\u2013to quote Rachel from Friends\u2013\u201cwho\u2019s is FICA and why is he getting all my money?\u201d\u2013it is important that we not forget all the hidden taxes we pay on everything from cellphone bills to alcohol. Each day we pay taxes that are built into the price of items we purchase, without even knowing it.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt may come as a surprise, but each month when you pay your phone bill, you\u2019re also paying a ton of extra taxes and charges. Cell phone bills are loaded with mysterious sounding fees for things like the \u201cTelecommunications Services Excise Tax Surcharge\u201d and the \u201cFederal Universal Service Fund,\u201d which fund Federal Communication Commission programs. All told, these taxes add up to about 12 percent of each month\u2019s cell phone bill. So, if you pay $100 per month for your cell phone, you\u2019re also paying an extra $144 each year in hidden taxes.\n\nAlcohol is taxed with so-called \u201csin taxes,\u201d or extra taxes on activities the government deems inappropriate \u2013 smoking and gambling also come with these hidden fees. The federal government taxes spirits at $13.50 a gallon. On top of that, states also tax alcohol at various rates. Washington, which has the highest tax of any state, takes $35.22 for each gallon sold, while Missouri, on the other end of the spectrum, takes $2.00 a gallon. Depending on what state you\u2019re in, and how much you buy, you could be looking at paying an additional 33 percent in alcohol tax.\n\nJust like alcohol, gasoline comes with built-in taxes from both state and federal governments. The U.S. federal excise tax on gasoline is just over 18 cents per gallon. States also take anywhere from eight to 50 cents per gallon \u2013 an average of about 27 cents for the country as a whole. With the average price of gasoline at around $1.83, that means you pay almost 25 percent in gasoline tax every time you fill up your tank.\n\nHidden cable taxes also hit Americans particularly hard. Cable bills have gone through the roof in the last ten years, in part because of the extra fees we have to pay. On average, about 12 percent of each month\u2019s cable bill goes to paying these hidden taxes.\n\nTo paraphrase Ben Franklin \u2014 the only things certain in this life are death and taxes. We all expect to pay things like income and sales taxes, and we can see them reflected on receipts and paychecks. But the hidden taxes are a little bit tougher to swallow, and they\u2019re driving up costs for stuff we buy every day. So, the next time someone complains about how high their taxes are this tax season, tell them that the taxes they see are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAlfredo Ortiz is the President and CEO of Job Creators Network", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pull the Curtain Back on Hidden Taxes", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Pull the Curtain Back on Hidden Taxes", "title": "Pull the Curtain Back on Hidden Taxes - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/IRS-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/01/pull-the-curtain-back-on-hidden-taxes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pull the Curtain Back on Hidden Taxes", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/IRS-Getty.jpg", "title": "Pull the Curtain Back on Hidden Taxes - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,tax", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2016-02-01T10:21:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Alcohol is taxed with so-called \u201csin taxes,\u201d or extra taxes on activities the government deems inappropriate \u2013 smoking and gambling also come with these hidden fees.\nBut the hidden taxes are a little bit tougher to swallow, and they\u2019re driving up costs for stuff we buy every day.\nEach day we pay taxes that are built into the price of items we purchase, without even knowing it.\nOn average, about 12 percent of each month\u2019s cable bill goes to paying these hidden taxes.\nSo, if you pay $100 per month for your cell phone, you\u2019re also paying an extra $144 each year in hidden taxes."}
