Police in southwest Missouri have issued an Amber Alert for a 6-month-old boy believed to have been kidnapped by his parents more than a week ago.

The Anderson Police Department issued the alert Friday evening for Mitchell Farris, who's been missing since Jan. 2. Police say the boy's great-grandfather had custody of him.

Police say the father, 34-year-old Preston Farris, took the child from the great-grandfather's apartment.

Farris is believed to be traveling with the child's mother, 30-year-old Anastasia McDaniel.

Police described Preston Farris as a 5-foot-10 white male weighing 230 pounds, with brown hair. McDaniel is a 5-foot-8, white female weighing about 200 pounds, with red or strawberry blond hair.

Police say they may be driving a red 2004 Ford Freestar minivan with the Missouri license plate UH7D2R.
