At least they are heading to a website that\u2019s been running smoothly.\n\n\u201cThe process on New York\u2019s website is so easy,\u201d said Keith Stiles of Midtown.\n\nStiles, 51, said he got his plan on the New York exchange, and is delighted \u2013 a subsidized plan, meaning lower cost, more coverage.\n\n\u201cEighty-six dollars a month and the coverage is incredible,\u201d Stiles said.\n\nBut what if you\u2019re Tina Discepola of Ardsley? Her plan was canceled because of Obamacare. It appeared it would be reinstated after President Barack Obama did an about -face and said if you like your plan you can keep it.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo has indicated New York State will not be following the president\u2019s plan to re-issue policies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually had good success with our program, so we don\u2019t need to change it now because we are not having those types of issues,\u201d Cuomo said.\n\nIndeed, the New York exchange has not had the problems of the federal plan, as of last week signing up some 48,000 people, almost twice what the feds have.\n\nBut critics note nearly 50 percent go to Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIf we are putting more people on Medicaid we are not really accomplishing the goal of healthcare reform. The goal of healthcare reform is to provide quality health insurance,\u201d said Yevgeniy Feyman of the Manhattan Institute.\n\nMany are finding cheaper plans on the New York website, but some say that\u2019s because New York\u2019s rates are already sky-high due to Obamacare-style reforms that date to the 1990s.\n\n\u201cIn \u201893, Cuomo administration enacted new regulations in New York\u2019s insurance market that effectively tanked any hope of having an individual market. Young people left the market. Sicker, older people stayed in. The Pataki administration made it worse by requiring minimum benefit requirements,\u201d Feyman said.\n\nSo what\u2019s next for the people with canceled plans in New York? Discepola\u2019s insurance company didn\u2019t know. It told her to call back Monday.\n\nGov. Cuomo did leave himself some wiggle room.\n\n\u2018If it\u2019s causing a problem for someone we will certainly look at it, but we don\u2019t have those problems in New York,\u201d Cuomo said.\n\nOfficials said that they expect a surge in enrollment after Thanksgiving, and then they hope to get a sense of the demographics \u2014 if they will get the young, healthy people who will make the plan thrive.\n\nIf have a healthcare experience you\u2019d like to share, tweet us: @brennanwcbswlny.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York's healthcare exchange has fared much better than the national website, and has many satisfied customers.
