While the debate over the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, continues and challenges of providing and obtaining employer-sponsored health care coverage persist, there is no doubt that health care remains the most important benefit offered by companies, according to a new survey of employees and employers.

The Express Employment Professionals staffing firm found 84 percent of people surveyed recently placed health care at the top of the three most important benefits offered by employers. Health care was followed by retirement plans (66 percent) and paid time off (62 percent).

EEP surveyed 1,500 employers, HR/hiring managers and non-management employees in February. Employees (82.6) were more likely than employers (73 percent) to place a higher importance on health care coverage.

According to a 2013 employer health benefits survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 57 percent of U.S. companies offer health benefits to their workers, unchanged from the previous year. The size of a company, however, generally dictates the level of coverage.

Only 45 percent of employers with three to nine employees offered coverage, but virtually all employers with 1,000 or more workers offered coverage to at least some of their employees, Kaiser found.

“It may be hard and it certainly is expensive, but employer provided health insurance remains an important part of an employer-employee relationship," said Bob Funk, CEO of EEP and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. "Employers want to provide it and employees have come to expect it.”
