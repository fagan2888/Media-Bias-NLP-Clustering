The Obamacare rollout is a disaster for progressive politics, says Kirsten Powers.\n\nLeading up to Election Day 2008, candidate Barack Obama declared, \u201cWe are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.\u201d Conservatives heard a menacing threat. For liberals, it was a rallying cry. The battle was on.\n\nObama quickly became an effective advocate for the view that government is a critical part of the solution to society\u2019s problems. So effective that he won reelection in the midst of a struggling economy. Even Republicans had to admit the 2012 face-off had ended with a rejection of the conservative creed that government is the problem. In an election postmortem, Newt Gingrich told Bloomberg News that conservatives were \u201cprofoundly wrong\u201d in their reading of public sentiment and must \u201crethink our assumptions.\u201d He said, \u201cPart of it is a greater willingness to have government activism than most conservatives thought.\u201d\n\nObama and liberals were winning the argument. Then came the epic incompetence of the last few weeks. The rollout of the insurance exchange that is central to the success of the Affordable Care Act has been nothing short of a disaster. This failure is a double whammy: it puts the future of Obamacare in even greater peril while placing Obama\u2019s case for activist government on life support. If the government can\u2019t build a functioning website to support the most important initiative of the president\u2019s administration, then how can it be trusted to do anything?\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told The Wall Street Journal that the botched launch of the $400 million website was \u201canother challenge that\u2019s no worse than the near-death experiences\u201d the health-care law has seen over the past three years. But it is a million times worse, because it\u2019s self-inflicted. This time, Obama can\u2019t blame Republicans.\n\nThe administration had to know it had only one shot to launch the exchanges, and it blew it. The damage it has caused was captured in a Washington Post\u2013ABC News poll released Monday. Fifty-six percent of those surveyed believed the \u201cwebsite glitches\u201d are \u201cpart of a broader problem with the health care law.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat makes it worse is that officials knew they weren\u2019t ready, and they went forward anyway. The Associated Press reported that \u201cWebsite builders saw red flags for months.\u201d The Washington Post recounted, \u201cDays before the launch of President Obama\u2019s online health \u00adinsurance marketplace, government officials and contractors tested a key part of the Web site to see whether it could handle tens of thousands of consumers at the same time. It crashed after a simulation in which just a few hundred people tried to log on simultaneously. Despite the failed test, federal health officials plowed ahead.\u201d Sebelius admitted Monday that the website \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough testing, specifically for high volumes, for a complicated project.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat have they been doing for the last few years? The administration has claimed that it can\u2019t be helped that setting up an insurance exchange is so complex. Sebelius even lamented that she wished she had \u201cfive years\u201d to finish this project. Who needs five years to build a website? This isn\u2019t a search for the cure for cancer.\n\nIn the week leading up to the launch of the exchanges, Obama assured Americans that using the health insurance hub would be as easy as buying a plane ticket online. Apparently he wasn\u2019t in on what was happening behind the scenes. Sebelius told CNN that the first the president heard of problems was in \u201cthe first couple of days\u201d after the site went live October 1. If this is true, then either the president didn\u2019t ask about the site\u2019s capabilities or someone lied to him. If the former is true, then he has an incredible lack of imagination and curiosity. If the latter is the case, then why hasn\u2019t anyone been fired?\n\nTrue to form, the Most Transparent Administration in History has not been particularly forthcoming about the problems the site faces. At firs, it claimed these were just minor glitches caused by unexpectedly high traffic. The president famously compared these glitches to those that Apple has experienced in the past. He might be interested to know that Apple fired the manager responsible for the last major snafu the company encountered.\n\n\n\nObamacare supporter Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) complained Thursday on MSNBC that the administration \u201c[hasn\u2019t] leveled with the United States Senate. They haven\u2019t briefed us on what they think are the underlying problems. They were supposed to do so yesterday, and canceled the meeting.\u201d\n\nHe called for a consideration of a one-year delay of the individual mandate and demanded: \u201cThe administration needs to tell us what is going on\u2026[they need] to level with the American people. There needs to be fuller, fairer, more straightforward, and complete accounting for what's going on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "kirstenpowers"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, Barack Obama, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201310251700, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Obamacare rollout has been a disaster for progressive politics, says Kirsten Powers.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Obama Cant Blame the Republicans This Time", "tags": "entity:organization/republican_party,entity:person/barack_obama,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obama Can\u2019t Blame the Republicans This Time\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/25/obama-can-t-blame-the-republicans-this-time.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/25/obama-can-t-blame-the-republicans-this-time/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46090680.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/25/obama-can-t-blame-the-republicans-this-time\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-25T17:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Kirsten Powers\",\"tags\":[\"republican_party\",\"barack_obama\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Republican Party, Barack Obama, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Kirsten Powers", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2013-10-25T17:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/kirsten-powershtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/25/obama-can-t-blame-the-republicans-this-time", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The Obamacare rollout has been a disaster for progressive politics, says Kirsten Powers.", "title": "Obama Can\u2019t Blame the Republicans This Time", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/25/obama-can-t-blame-the-republicans-this-time.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/25/obama-can-t-blame-the-republicans-this-time/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1382720404848.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/k/kirsten-powers", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ff1\"", "article_summary": "This time, Obama can\u2019t blame Republicans.\nObama quickly became an effective advocate for the view that government is a critical part of the solution to society\u2019s problems.\nEven Republicans had to admit the 2012 face-off had ended with a rejection of the conservative creed that government is the problem.\nIn the week leading up to the launch of the exchanges, Obama assured Americans that using the health insurance hub would be as easy as buying a plane ticket online.\nThe administration has claimed that it can\u2019t be helped that setting up an insurance exchange is so complex."}
