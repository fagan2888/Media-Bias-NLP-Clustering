Toronto designated pitcher Scott Copeland for assignment to clear a roster spot.\n\n\u201cFor right now, we\u2019re down a middle infielder for at least two weeks,\u201d Anthopoulos said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great glove, he\u2019s a right-handed bat, a good teammate, as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki out at least 2 weeks because of shoulder injury", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki out at least 2 weeks because of shoulder injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/13/troy-tulowitzki-out-at-least-2-weeks-because-of-shoulder-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913_121939_troy-tulowitzki.jpg", "height": 412}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913_121939_troy-tulowitzki.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-13T12:15:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:33:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce00a\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 Toronto All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki will miss at least two weeks because of a cracked left shoulder blade.\n\u201cFor right now, we\u2019re down a middle infielder for at least two weeks,\u201d Anthopoulos said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great glove, he\u2019s a right-handed bat, a good teammate, as well.\u201d\nTo provide additional infield depth while Tulowitzki recovers, Toronto acquired Gold Glove second baseman Darwin Barney from the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday for a player to be named or cash.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very small crack,\u201d Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos said Sunday."}
