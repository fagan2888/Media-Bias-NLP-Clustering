There are plenty of associate\u2019s degrees that lead to decent paying jobs and can ultimately give you a good return on your college investment \u2014 potentially even better than a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nBelow are some of the two-year programs that represent excellent job opportunities according to data on average salaries and projected job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The title of the degree may vary slightly by institution, so we are listing them with respect to the careers they enable.\n\nNote: The BLS wage data is from 2012; projections are slightly overstated as they also reference a ten-year period from a 2012 study. The job openings include replacement needs as well as projected growth.\n\nRegistered Nurse \u2014 RNs are almost always in demand, and that is likely to increase with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, expansions in medical services, and an aging population. There are over a million projected job openings in the field through 2022 with a median salary of $65,470.\n\nDental hygienist \u2014 Similarly to nurses, dental hygienists are in significant demand. They perform cleanings and other preventative tooth care, as well as assisting dentists with fillings and procedures that are more complex. Median salaries are just over $70,000, and BLS expects 113,500 job openings through 2022.\n\nEngineering technician \u2014 This field has multiple specialties with their own degree programs and projections, including aerospace, electrical/electronic, avionics, geological/petroleum, mechanical, electromechanical, and industrial technicians. The tasks vary widely by field but they all involve engineering support functions, anything from design to troubleshooting to repairs to field work. Median salaries are between $45,000 and $62,000, and the collective job projections through 2022 are near 90,000.\n\nRespiratory therapist \u2014 Respiratory therapists tend to work with the extremes of the age spectrum, from the elderly with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other respiratory ailments, to premature babies with lungs that have not completely developed. Median salaries are $55,870 according to BLS, and over 40,000 job openings are expected through 2022.\n\nComputer network support technician \u2014 Somebody\u2019s got to do the dirty work of keeping complex computer networks running. Why shouldn\u2019t it be you? Median salaries in the field are just over $59,000 and there are almost 40,000 job opportunities projected by 2022.\n\nWeb developer \u2013 Given the massive growth of Internet sites and mobile apps, there is a strong need for good web developers. Projected job openings exceed 50,000 by 2022, and median wages are $62,500.\n\nDiagnostic sonographer \u2014 Most of us think of sonography as the ultrasound images taken during pregnancy, but there are other medical uses for the technology that keep the demand high. Median salaries are relatively high at $65,860 and there are 35,300 expected job openings through 2022.\n\nAir traffic controller \u2014 Air traffic controllers draw the highest median salary available for an associate\u2019s degree at $122,530, with 11,400 job openings expected through 2022. It is also a high-stress, high-burnout position \u2014 but if you have the correct temperament, it is the most lucrative of the associate\u2019s degree positions.\n\nIf you are curious, you can find out all the BLS job projections, typical wages, and necessary degrees, experience, and training on the BLS website. The data is quite comprehensive, covering occupations from accountants to zoologists.\n\nEven if the occupations above do not strike your fancy, you may find a different occupation that a two-year degree would accommodate \u2014 perhaps a veterinary technician or a draftsman? The choice is yours.\n\nRelated stories:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A college degree is a standard ticket to higher-paying jobs, but that degree does not necessarily have to be a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.
