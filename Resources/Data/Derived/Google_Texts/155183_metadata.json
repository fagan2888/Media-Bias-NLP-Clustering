Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy of the\n\nDenver \u2014 He's a stat stuffer.\n\nPoints, rebounds, assists, steals, dunks and blocks \u2014 he can do all of that.\n\nSo if Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo struggles for a few games, it's noticeable.\n\nThe 20-year-old has slumped since returning from the all-star break, shooting just 36% from the field (22 of 61) in the six games the Bucks have played.\n\nThat's a big contrast from the 63.3% he shot in four games in early February when he was named the Eastern Conference player of the week.\n\nBut there's more to it than that. He had as many turnovers (five) as points in the Bucks victory over Philadelphia on Wednesday at home.\n\nIn Utah on Saturday night, Antetokounmpo did not take a shot in the first half as the Bucks got off to another slow start and fell behind. He wound up going 4 of 5 for eight points while adding five rebounds, four assists and three steals in the Bucks' 82-75 loss to the Jazz in Salt Lake City.\n\n\"I've got to find a rhythm,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Because of the trade we lost a little bit of rhythm.\n\n\"I've just got to try to get everybody involved when I've got the ball. If that doesn't work, I've got to go back to my old move and start attacking the basket more and more and more.\"\n\nIt's clear a feeling-out process is underway as the Bucks are adjusting after the departure of Brandon Knight and the arrival of 23-year-old point guard Michael Carter-Williams.\n\nThe trade deadline deal brought the Bucks three new players in Carter-Williams, backup point guard Tyler Ennis and center Miles Plumlee. They must learn new teammates and a different style of play under Bucks coach Jason Kidd.\n\nErsan Ilyasova, healthy again, is back in the starting lineup at power forward and that is another adjustment. A reshuffled bench featuring Jerryd Bayless, Jared Dudley, O.J. Mayo and John Henson is trying to find a groove.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo is still making an impact. In the first game of the road trip in Los Angeles on Friday, the \"Greek Freak\" had 13 points, eight rebounds and four assists while getting to the foul line for eight attempts.\n\nHe played 36 minutes against the Lakers and followed with 34 minutes the following night against the Jazz.\n\n\"It's like a new pitcher in this league,\" Kidd said. \"You get around the rotation the first time, but then guys start making adjustments.\n\n\"I think he's letting the game come to him and he's not forcing things. That's what we like. But he's got to get a couple more touches and still be aggressive, looking to get to the basket and making plays for his teammates.\"\n\nAntetokounmpo has scored in double figures in 41 of 59 games after accomplishing that feat only 23 times last season. He scored in double figures in 12 straight games before the five-point game against the 76ers, when he hit just 1 of 6 shots.\n\nEarlier this season he became the youngest Bucks player to reach the 1,000-point mark, at 20 years and 44 days. And his 27-point, 15-rebound game against Houston on Feb. 6 made him the second-youngest NBA player to put up those numbers in a game in the last 30 years, behind only LeBron James.\n\nAntetokounmpo has worked hard on his medium-range jump shot and is using it more in game situations, although he still is hesitant. At times he dribbles into crowds and loses the ball.\n\nYet he often delivers amazing passes and continues to make spectacular plays. Witness his soaring putback dunk against the Jazz after a missed jumper by Khris Middleton.\n\n\"It's not about confidence,\" said Antetokounmpo, who will take on any challenges the coaches give him.\n\nThe Bucks are 2-4 since returning from the break and will have a chance to stop their mini-slide when they face the slumping Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night at the Pepsi Center. They beat the Nuggets, 89-81, in Milwaukee on Feb. 20.\n\n\"We've got to figure it out,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"It's going to be hard, but we're going to continue trying.\n\n\"Brandon (Knight) was our best player. We've got to find guys to keep up what Brandon did. But that doesn't mean everybody has to change his game.\n\n\"We've got to keep our game the same. We're going to figure it out, though.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "Giannis Antetokounmpo struggling to find his rhythm", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/bucks/giannis-antetokounmpo-struggling-to-find-his-rhythm-b99453696z1-294595691.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99453696z.1_20150301205405_000_ga1a5cq4.1-1.jpg", "height": 1279}, "type": "article", "description": "Forward Giannis Antetokounmpo has slumped since returning from the all-star break, shooting just 36% from the field in the six games the Bucks have played.", "title": "Giannis Antetokounmpo struggling to find his rhythm"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99453696z.1_20150301205405_000_ga1a5cq4.1-1.jpg", "description": "Forward Giannis Antetokounmpo has slumped since returning from the all-star break, shooting just 36% from the field in the six games the Bucks have played.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Giannis Antetokounmpo struggling to find his rhythm"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Earlier this season he became the youngest Bucks player to reach the 1,000-point mark, at 20 years and 44 days.\nThe Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo is shooting just 36% since returning from the all-star break.\nSo if Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo struggles for a few games, it's noticeable.\nAntetokounmpo has scored in double figures in 41 of 59 games after accomplishing that feat only 23 times last season.\nAntetokounmpo has worked hard on his medium-range jump shot and is using it more in game situations, although he still is hesitant."}
