Part II of an interview with Rick Moran's brother Terry Moran of ABC News

On tonight’s episode of the RINO Hour of Power, you can hear the second part of a conversation with my brother Terry Moran of ABC News. We discussed his coverage of Katrina, the wars, and his special report on the effects of Alzheimer’s disease on families and society. We also discussed the state of journalism today and how it’s changed over the years. Joining me live will be Jeff Kropf, a political pro from Oregon. We’ll look into the recent prisoner swap that has Washington in an uproar.

We stream live from 8:00 - 9:00 PM Eastern time. A podcast will be available shortly after the end of the show. You can join us live by clicking the icon below or by clicking here.
