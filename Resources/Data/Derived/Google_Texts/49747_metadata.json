Ted Cruz of Texas talks with the Rev. Gaylon Wiley, who helped lead his father to God in the 1970s. They met outside Patterson Park Community Center where Cruz stopped Monday on his bus tour of the Southeast.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz told a throng here Monday the country is \"in crisis,\" but he is bringing words of \"hope.\"\n\n\"America is waking up. I'm here to tell you now: Help is on the way,\" Cruz said to an overflow crowd of more than 500 Republican supporters at Patterson Park Community Center on his Cruz Country Bus Tour throughout what he calls the Southeastern Conference primary.\n\nConsidered a thorn in the side of Washington Republicans and Democrats alike, Cruz jumped to 13 percent from 6 percent in the NBC/SurveyMonkey poll gauging the popularity of GOP candidates after last week's debate in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nCruz refused afterward to address the popularity of real estate magnate Donald Trump, who is leading a heavy field of candidates in most polling with more than 20 percent.\n\n\"The simple reality is there's nothing the media likes to talk about more than the politics of personality, of one Republican throwing rocks at another. I'm not interested in playing that game, and I don't think the American people are interested in it,\" Cruz said to reporters.\n\nAmericans are interested in finding good-paying jobs, getting health care in the wake of \"Obamacare,\" and regaining constitutional rights, which are under assault by the federal government, he said.\n\n\"And across the globe, radical Islamic terrorism is on the rise and American's national security's been profoundly endangered,\" Cruz said. \"The focus of our campaign is on reigniting the promise of America, getting back to the common-sense principles that built this nation, free-market principles and constitutional liberties that made America great.\"\n\nCruz briefly address the potential of a third-party candidacy, saying, \"I think it'd be terrible to happen, so I hope it doesn't.\" Trump refused during the debate to rule out a third-party candidacy, a scenario that could siphon Republican votes away from the party's candidate and give a Democratic candidate the White House.\n\nDespite falling into the middle of the Republican candidates, a fiery Cruz exuded confidence Monday, telling the audience, if elected, on his first day he would rescind \"every illegal and unconstitutional\" executive order by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe U.S. senator from Texas called the Department of Justice the \"most lawless\" he had ever seen. Besides rescinding Obama's orders, Cruz said he would have the Department of Justice investigate and prosecute Planned Parenthood, whose leaders were seen on video allegedly discussing the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nWith the event sounding at times like a tent revival with numerous speakers invoking God and country, the candidate said he would stop \"persecution of religious liberty\" across the nation. He made note of a case joined by the Little Sisters of the Poor, one of nearly 50 religious groups fighting the Affordable Care Act over a provision requiring employers to provide insurance coverage to employees for contraception.\n\nCruz drew thunderous applause when he said he would \"rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal,\" which he called the single greatest threat facing America today. Cruz said Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and the nuclear agreement designed to limit its nuclear weapon capability would funnel $100 billion to the country to arm \"radical Islamic terrorists.\"\n\nIn addition, Cruz said he would begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, in spite of the Arab world's opposition.\n\n\"The single biggest difference between me and the others on that stage (in Cleveland), with me you can trust I will do exactly what I say,\" Cruz said.\n\nThe son of a Cuban refugee said he would create a flat tax enabling Americans to file their taxes on a piece of paper the size of a postcard. The Internal Revenue Service's 90,000 employees could be sent to the country's Southern border, he joked, because anyone trying to sneak into the nation from Mexico would turn back if they saw those IRS workers waiting.\n\nCruz told the story of how his father, Raphael Cruz, left their family during his early childhood but then found God with the help of the Rev. Gaylon Wiley, changed his life immediately and returned to take care of his wife and child.\n\nWiley, now a semi-retired minister in Lebanon, just happened to be in the crowd and said afterward he was proud to play a role in the Cruz family's life, saying he was merely \"delivering the mail\" when he spoke with the elder Cruz in a Houston, Texas home one night in the 1970s.\n\n\"We're grateful today that God took a little toe-headed, hawg-slopping boy from West Texas, had the privilege of moving him to Houston to meet Ted Cruz and know today that he'll make us a great president,\" Wiley said, moments before he and his wife, Betty, gave Cruz a big hug.\n\nJimmy Turner, a Murfreesboro attorney who contributed to Cruz's campaign when he started it, said he thinks Trump's star will \"fade\" and he'll be out of the race in a couple of months, putting Cruz in a stronger position as state primary battles near.\n\n\"Just as a conservative, he seems to be in line with all of the beliefs that I have, both politically, spiritually and just as a man,\" Turner said. \"And so far he has been a politician, a senator, who has said what he's going to do. He actually follows through with that, which is rare.\"\n\nWriter Sam Stockard can be contacted at sstockard44@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Sen.
