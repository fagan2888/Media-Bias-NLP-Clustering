BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) â€” A man accused of harassing relatives of a teacher killed in the Newtown school massacre is set to return to court to disclose whether he will accept a plea deal or go to trial.

Matthew Mills, of Brooklyn, New York, is accused of approaching a sister of slain Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher Victoria Soto in November and angrily claiming the shootings never took place.

Soto was among six educators and 20 first-graders killed on Dec. 14, 2012.

Mills is due back in Bridgeport Superior Court on Monday. He was charged with interfering with police and breach of peace in November in Stratford at a road race honoring Soto.

Prosecutors have offered Mills a suspended sentence with probation. He would also have to stay away from the Soto family.
