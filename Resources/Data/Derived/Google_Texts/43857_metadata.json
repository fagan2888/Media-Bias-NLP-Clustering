The brief focuses on health plan performance as it relates to the Medical Loss Ratio, and the related rebates due to consumers.\n\nThe MLR provision was established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requiring health insurers who fail to spend specified percentages of their health care premium income to pay their customers rebates. In 2013, health plans reimbursed customers $335 million, equating to approximately $80 per family receiving a refund. In 2014, health plans reimbursed customers $478 million equating to approximately $129 per benefiting family.\n\nMLR premiums and rebate figures were aggregated for all health plans that reported doing business in each state. For 2014, California led the country with $98 million in MLR rebates, followed by Florida's $60 million. In addition, MFA assessed the Individual, Small Group and Large Group Comprehensive market segment's Adjusted Premiums, MLR Rebates and Weighted Average MLR for leading health companies. 2014 MLR Rebates paid for the Individual segment were $238 million which is .5% of the $51.5 billion collected in premiums. MLR Rebates for the Small Group segment were $142 million, or .2% of the $70.2 billion and rebates for the $203 billion Large Group segment were $90.5 million. Overall, the rebates paid to consumers were a relatively small portion of industry premiums.\n\nSubscribers to Mark Farrah Associates' Health Coverage Portal and the SHCE and MLR Data have access to this dataset with the benefit of NAIC company codes mapped to HIOS codes used for government reporting by health plans. MFA will continue to analyze and report on important ACA related topics with valuable insights about the health care industry in future Healthcare Business Strategy reports.\n\nTo read the full text of \"A Brief Analysis of the 2014 Medical Loss Ratio & Rebates Results \", visit the Analysis Briefs library on Mark Farrah Associates' website.\n\nAbout Mark Farrah Associates (MFA)\n\nMFA is a leading data aggregator and publisher providing health plan market data and analysis tools for the healthcare industry.
