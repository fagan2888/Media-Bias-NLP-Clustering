Komen foundation\n\nLAFAYETTE, Ind. (WLFI) \u2014 The YWCA of Greater Lafayette Women\u2019s Cancer Program is getting almost $200,000 from the Susan G. Komen Foundation to continue serving women in 13 Indiana counties.\n\nCancer program coordinator Heidi Kauffman said the Komen grant is down from previous years. This is due to women getting their mammograms covered under the Affordable Care Act and costs are far less for the YWCA. This means low-income women are more in need of money to pay for doctor-visit deductibles after a breast lump is found.\n\nKauffman said since more women have health insurance, the money they do raise can be used in other areas like outreach and education.\n\n\u201cThose southern counties have always been more of a challenge for us, like we had less flexibility of spending and it just frees you when you have the back-up of the dollars when you go out and do outreach,\u201d said Kauffman. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act will pay for your screening mammogram, which is great. We just want people to be able to call us if they are needing diagnostics.\u201d\n\nKauffman said they are still covering the cost of mammograms for those who don\u2019t have insurance. To date, the YWCA of Greater Lafayette has received more than $1 million from the Komen Foundation.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAFAYETTE, Ind.
