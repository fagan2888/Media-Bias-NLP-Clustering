He made a 7-foot birdie putt on the third hole of a playoff Sunday to beat Jason Dufner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so satisfying in so many ways to get it done,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling, and maybe some validation.\u201d\n\nOnly days after officially overtaking injured Tiger Woods at No. 1, Scott bogeyed four of his first nine holes in the first round at Colonial. Midway through his final round, Scott had a double bogey that dropped him three strokes off the lead.\n\n\u201cMaybe added a little pressure for myself, trying to play like a No. 1. But I think the important thing was I realized that didn\u2019t mean playing perfect, and I certainly didn\u2019t play perfect all week,\u201d Scott said. \u201cBut the way you come back and get it done, and I felt like I certainly played like one of the best players in the world out there on the back nine.\u201d\n\nThe Australian certainly did in with consecutive birdies in the playoff.\n\nThe major champions parred No. 18 to start the playoff before matching birdies at the 17th hole. Dufner, who won the PGA Championship last year, hit his approach pin high on 17 to 4\u00bd feet, but 2013 Masters champ Scott drained a 14-foot birdie before Dufner putted.\n\nDufner, who made a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 18 in regulation, slid a 40-footer past when he and Scott played the 18th hole for the second time during the playoff. Scott then made the 7-footer for his 11th PGA Tour victory, 5\u00bd weeks after the 33-year-old Scott got married.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to beat him. He\u2019s a great player. It\u2019s tough to concentrate, he\u2019s so good looking, too,\u201d Dufner said. \u201cI thought maybe I could sneak one in there on 17, but he topped me.\u201d\n\nScott and Dufner both shot 4-under 66 to finish at 9 under, the highest winning score at Colonial since 1999. They started the final round part of a seven-way tie for 11th place, but only two strokes behind a quartet of leaders.\n\nTo stay No. 1 in the world ranking, Scott had to be in the top 13 at Colonial after Henrik Stenson finished in a five-way tie for seventh place in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.\n\nThe win at Colonial, which came with $1,152,000 and a plaid jacket, made Scott the first player to win all four PGA Tour events in Texas. He is the 15th to win both the Byron Nelson Championship (2008) and the Colonial in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nThe 11th playoff in Colonial history was the first since 2009, and the longest since Jim Colbert beat Fuzzy Zoeller on the sixth extra hole in 1983.\n\nNicholas Thompson (66) and Freddie Jacobson (67) tied for third at 8 under.\n\nDavid Toms, in the final group, led at 9 under when he made his turn. But he had three bogeys over the next five holes and finished with a 70.\n\nToms ended up 7 under with Brendon Todd (68), who last week got his first PGA Tour victory at the Nelson. Jimmy Walker, No. 1 in the FedEx Cup standings, shot a 70 was tied for 10th at 6 under.\n\nAbout 30 minutes after Dufner made his long birdie at No. 18 to get to 9 under, Scott made a closing par after just missing a 31-foot birdie chance that would have wrapped up the victory. It was just less than an hour later when the two went back to No. 18 to start the playoff.\n\nScott finished about the same time Toms was coming off bogey at the par-3 13th that dropped him two strokes back.\n\nScott was already 8 under after making a 6-footer at the 406-yard No. 6 hole, his fourth birdie in the round and already with a bogey at the par-4 third when he three-putted from 24 feet. His only other three-putt at Colonial came from 17 feet at the ninth hole, dropping him to 6 under.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to let this one slip,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAs always, a bit of luck involved. And to come out on top is a really satisfying feeling, and hopefully keep No. 1 for at least another week.\u201d\n\nDufner, who was also second at Colonial two years ago, gave up a stroke when he missed a par putt from less than 3 feet at the straight 615-yard 11th hole. When his 12-foot birdie chance at the 440-yard 12th hole slid a half-foot past the cup, Dufner stood momentarily and stared at the ball before tapping in his par.\n\nScott caught up with consecutive birdies on those same holes, pitching to 9 feet at No. 11 before his approach at No. 12 to 4 feet.\n\nDufner had another near miss at No. 15, where another lengthy birdie chance slid inches by the hole. Scott got to 9 under with a 39-foot birdie putt at the 453-yard 14th hole.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Adam Scott beats Jason Dufner on 3rd playoff hole at Colonial", "title": "Adam Scott beats Jason Dufner on 3rd playoff hole at Colonial", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/25/adam-scott-beats-jason-dufner-on-3rd-playoff-hole-at-colonial/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140525__adam-scottp1.jpg", "height": 504}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140525__adam-scottp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-25T19:27:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:25:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea4f\"", "article_summary": "Midway through his final round, Scott had a double bogey that dropped him three strokes off the lead.\nHe made a 7-foot birdie putt on the third hole of a playoff Sunday to beat Jason Dufner.\nScott got to 9 under with a 39-foot birdie putt at the 453-yard 14th hole.\nScott then made the 7-footer for his 11th PGA Tour victory, 5\u00bd weeks after the 33-year-old Scott got married.\nFORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 Adam Scott was a late entry into Colonial because he wanted to play while ranked No."}
