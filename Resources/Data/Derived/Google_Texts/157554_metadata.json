Earlier Wednesday, Clinton stopped at the Tremont Grille in Marshalltown for a private discussion with local activists and backers. On Tuesday, she held a similar roundtable at Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, Iowa.\n\nBoth of Clinton\u2019s public events in the state were small, low-key discussions designed to focus on the concerns of Iowans. Aides have emphasized that, in the early stages of the campaign, Clinton wants to avoid the crowds of reporters and supporters that hampered her ability during her 2008 campaign to make one-on-one connections with voters in the state.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that she wants to build on \"what works\" in President Obama's health care law.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-health-care-policy-small-business-owners-iowa", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that she wants to build on \"what works\" in President Obama's health care law.", "title": "Hillary Clinton talks health care policy in Iowa", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-health-care-policy-small-business-owners-iowa", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/469818172.jpg?itok=oSkNCkk8", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-health-care-policy-small-business-owners-iowa", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/469818172.jpg?itok=dcmlixNm", "title": "Hillary Clinton talks health care policy in Iowa", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that she wants to build on \"what works\" in President Obama's health care law."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-15T15:43:16-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "politicscarrie", "title": "Hillary Clinton talks health care policy in Iowa", "tags": "affordable-care-act,election-2016,elections,health,health-care,hillary-clinton,iowa", "published": 1, "date": "04/15/2015 15:43:16 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-health-care-policy-small-business-owners-iowa"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that she wants to build on \"what works\" in President Obama's health care law.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2016, Health, Affordable Care Act, Health Care, Hillary Clinton, Iowa"}, "article_summary": "RELATED: In Iowa, Hillary Clinton stays studiously on-messageShe expressed support for President Obama\u2019s signature health care law \u2013 saying \u201cI am committed to building on what works in the Affordable Care Act\u201d \u2013 but also acknowledged concerns that attendees had about providing health care for their employees and themselves.\nClinton added that she hasn\u2019t made a final decision herself on what kind of changes to the health care system she would support.\nAppearing at a roundtable at Capital City Fruit near Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton heard from a small group of small business owners who discussed their biggest challenges \u2013 including health care costs \u2013 as they work to maintain their companies.\nRELATED: Bill Clinton avoids campaign talk at cancer eventAnd she voiced support for policies formalizing paid maternity and paternity leave.\nBoth of Clinton\u2019s public events in the state were small, low-key discussions designed to focus on the concerns of Iowans."}
