Mrs. Claus joins in Naperville's Jingle Bell Jamboree

hello

On the last weekend before Christmas, Santa is a pretty busy guy.

So on Saturday, Mrs. Claus stepped out from her husband's rather large shadow and was the featured attraction at the Jingle Bell Jamboree at Naper Settlement near downtown Naperville.

Mrs. C was around to help decorate some winter-themed cookies and also to tell children's story during the festival that made its debut this year.

The Jamboree was created to complement Naper Lights, a large holiday-themed light display on the settlement grounds presented by the Naperville Sunrise Rotary. The Naper Lights display, which features free admission, will be open to the public from 5 to 9 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays through Dec. 31.

The Jamboree included musical performances by the Chicago Sinfonietta's Project Inclusion Ensemble and the Alena Quintet from Metea Valley High School.

Kids also got a chance to send a last-minute letter to Santa when they visited the settlement's North Pole post office. They also learned how to package a special reindeer food for the hungry fliers, to be sprinkled on lawns in anticipation of their arrival.
