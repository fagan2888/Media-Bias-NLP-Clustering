It's a case of too little, too late for the Post Office. Headlines have for years been noting the federal agency's prolonged death rattle, and a digital tracker cannot turn around such titanic governmental inefficiency.\n\n\"With a net loss of $1.9 billion\" in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, the Post Office acknowledged in May, \"this marks the 20th of the last 22 quarters it has sustained a loss.\" That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. Back in 2012, the USPS recorded net losses of $16 billion. The fact that it has also defaulted on billions of dollars of pre-funding for retiree payments in the last few years doesn't bode well either.\n\nThe most optimistic spin the agency's chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, can put on the situation is that \"the financial hole we're in is so deep, we can't fill in this hole every year even when we return to profitability.\" He said that in an interview the same day the electronic sensor proposal came out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Step 1) Attach sensors Step 2) ?????
