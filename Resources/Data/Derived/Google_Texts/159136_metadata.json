He has also been excluded from their annual grassroots summit next month in Columbus, Ohio, run by Americans for Prosperity (AFP), as well as the annual summer soiree of mega-donors and operatives in Orange County, California, which will be attended by a number of Trump's rivals.\"Continued stiff-arming by the powerful Koch network could limit Trump's ability to build a professional campaign operation to mobilize supporters ahead of primaries and caucuses,\" Politico said.In recent weeks, AFP and Concerned Veterans for America, the Koch-backed groups, have hosted events with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. The Columbus event will feature those candidates as well as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.Opinions about Trump are mixed among the Koch network of donors, Politico said. Some were offended by Trump's implication that Arizona Sen.
