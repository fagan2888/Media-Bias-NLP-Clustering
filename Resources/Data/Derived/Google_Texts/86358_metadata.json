And no one can see your toup\u00e9e,' Maher says about radio. Maher calls out Rogers radio switch\n\nLiberal comic Bill Maher said it makes \u201cperfect sense\u201d that Republican Rep. Mike Rogers announced that he will not seek reelection, instead heading for a new gig in talk radio.\n\n\u201cIt actually makes perfect sense, because the GOP has kind of become talk radio, an echo chamber where people are not interested in actually legislating or compromising or fixing America, just in screeching about how liberals have ruined it,\u201d Maher said Friday during his HBO program \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher.\u201d \u201cSo why not do it on the radio? The money\u2019s better. And no one can see your toupee.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMaher noted that other lawmakers have left office for media jobs but added that \u201cit says a lot\u201d that Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is leaving \u201cto join an already long list of conservative radio hosts.\u201d\n\nRogers made news last month when he announced that he would retire at the end of his term and join Cumulus, the talk radio company. However, Maher ribbed the Michigan congressman\u2019s remarks at the time that he was doing so to \u201cmove the needle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right, because if there is one job where you can never affect policy, it\u2019s in the branch of government that writes policy,\u201d Maher said. \u201cThe place for that is AM radio.\u201d\n\nHowever, Maher joked that Rogers is following in the footsteps of other conservatives who found success outside the Hill, including GOP 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time to quit government and go into the lucrative business of b\u2014\u2014ing about government,\u201d Maher said. \u201cIt worked for Joe Scarborough and Mike Huckabee, and, most famously of course, Sarah Palin.\u201d\n\nHe slammed the GOP.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Republicans aren\u2019t built to govern; they don\u2019t want to go to the moon, they want to howl at it,\u201d Maher said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s why just the fact of getting elected, means you\u2019re already damaged goods. Unless you go to Washington and act like the single-biggest pr\u2014- in the room all the time, you\u2019re suspect.\u201d\n\nMaher said this is the reason why Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is the only person currently in government who the base completely trusts.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the guy who bests understands that high office is just a higher form of talk radio,\u201d Maher said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The comic says it makes \u201cperfect sense\u201d that he will head for a gig in radio instead of reelection.", "title": "Maher calls out Rogers radio switch", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/bill-maher-mike-rogers-radio-105653.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2012/02/120224_bill_maher_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Radio,Talk Radio,Mike Rogers,Bill Maher", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The comic says it makes \u201cperfect sense\u201d that he will head for a gig in radio instead of reelection.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f84\"", "article_summary": "Maher calls out Rogers radio switchLiberal comic Bill Maher said it makes \u201cperfect sense\u201d that Republican Rep.
