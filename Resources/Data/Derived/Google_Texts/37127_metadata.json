The one thing that was agreed was that the Court would not simply deny the petitions for review. On Monday, at the official start of the October 2014 Term, the Court did exactly that.

Don\u2019t Count On It As late as this morning, the National Law Journal was hailing the beginning of \u201ca low-key term.\u201d Instead, the term began with global news\u2014and a chaotic scene in the press room reminiscent of the confusion over the Affordable Care Act cases and even Bush v. Gore. Not only was the Court\u2019s decision to deny certiorari in all the same-sex marriage cases a surprising one. Complicating matters was a clerical mistake that led the press office to distribute to reporters a printed list of \u201corders\u201d\u2014meaning, among other things, denials of cert.\u2014that was missing 33 pages. And the big news was in those 33 pages. A number of reporters went upstairs for oral argument, not knowing that history was being made. (I was one.) A quick explanation is in order: The Supreme Court does not have to take most cases. It has discretion over most of its jurisdiction. A party who lost a case below may petition the Court for review; the technical term is \u201cwrit of certiorari,\u201d or \u201ccert.\u201d for short. It is hornbook law that a denial of cert. has no legal meaning. It doesn\u2019t mean the Court approves of the decision below. It just means the Court doesn\u2019t want to look at the issue now.\n\nSo the Court officially gave no hint as to how it would rule when\u2014or, as of today if\u2014the same-sex-marriage issue comes before it. Unofficially, I don\u2019t see how that can be true. I don\u2019t see how today\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t signal that even within the Court, the fight is over. The reason is this: When cert. is denied, the judgment below becomes final. In every one of the marriage cases below, a federal court of appeals held that the parties before it are entitled to recognition of their marriages, or entitled to be legally married in their state or residence. Laws and state constitutional provisions limiting marriage to \u201cone man and one woman\u201d are void. In each case, either the court of appeals itself or the Supreme Court had \u201cstayed the mandate\u201d pending Supreme Court review. Today those stays began to disappear. They cannot survive. In the days and weeks ahead, couples will be allowed to marry in their states. In fact, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has announced that marriages can begin in the commonwealth as early as 1 p.m. today. So two things have changed as of 9:30 this morning, when the orders issued. First, there will soon be thousands of same-sex couples married by order of the courts. And second, the lower-court opinions, which said the Constitution provides a right for same-sex couples to marry, are now the law. I don\u2019t see how today\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t signal that even within the Court, the fight over same-sex marriage is over. That sounds redundant, but it\u2019s not. As long as cert. was pending, the lower-court opinions were in limbo. Meanwhile the issue is pending in the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and 11th Circuits. Any panel in one of those circuits must now confront a huge weight of federal authority affirming same-sex marriage. True, other circuits' decisions are not \u201cbinding\u201d; true, the Supreme Court did not give any hint of its position. But that\u2019s still a lot of contrary authority to move against.
