2016: Liberals hope that the populist-sounding Elizabeth Warren will run to the left of Hillary Clinton, whom they fear is now too rich and out of touch. But Sen. Warren’s financial records may dash their hopes.

While making presidential noises, the Democrat senator has positioned herself as the Democratic Party’s top defender of the working class.

On Wednesday, she told the AFL-CIO in its “Summit on Raising Wages” that the system is “rigged” in favor of the wealthy.

“The average family not in the top 10% makes less money today than they were making a generation ago. So who got all of the increase in income? One hundred percent of it went to the top 10%,” Warren preached, sounding like a reincarnated Eugene Debs. “All the new money earned went to the top. All of it.”

And, as it turns out, a healthy share of it went to Warren herself. She’s amassed a personal fortune bashing the rich — while insisting she’s not one of them.

Combing through her latest Senate financial disclosure filings, however, it becomes clear she is part of the same top 10% she rails against. In fact, her net worth puts her in the wealthiest 1%.

The assets of the self-proclaimed godmother of the Occupy Wall Street movement and champion of the 99% include:

 Financial assets worth between $3.7 million and $10 million.

 Real estate assets worth more than $3.1 million, including a home in Cambridge, Mass., valued at $2.4 million and a condo in Washington valued at $740,000.

 A $525,000 book advance for her new memoir, “A Fighting Chance.”

 At least 19 investment funds, including stock funds worth at least $1 million.

Her large stock portfolio is odd, given her crusading against the “excesses” and “greed” of Wall Street. And it’s downright unseemly, given her bashing of members of Congress who own stock.

“There are some wealthy individuals — I’m not one of them — but some wealthy individuals who have a lot of stock portfolios,” she told MSNBC during a 2012 campaign interview.

During a senatorial debate, she jabbed her GOP foe Scott Brown for standing “with the millionaires, not those who are out of work.” Turns out Brown was standing right next to one.

Last summer, Warren ripped then-Senate Ranking Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for blocking a government spending program she proposed. “Mitch McConnell is there for millionaires and billionaires.” Apparently he’s also there for Warren, a millionaire many times over.

Warren is even wealthy by Hill standards. Her minimum net worth alone ranks her 76th among the 535 House and Senate members combined.

Yes, a lot of senators are richer than she is. But they haven’t made a career of bashing the rich. Warren has a lot of nerve trying to pass herself off as one of the 99% for whom she claims to speak.

The former Harvard professor claims she can relate to working and middle-class families better than other politicians, including Clinton. But she’s just as out of touch.

Warren has no debt, owns two posh homes and dines at the finest restaurants. She hasn’t the foggiest notion about the pain the working and middle class are suffering from ObamaCare and other big government policies she pushes.

For all her Marxist bunkum, Warren isn’t even that altruistic. According to her 2009 tax returns, for example, she donated only 2% of her $980,670 income. She likes redistributing your money but not her own.

Warren, who falsely claimed “Native American” minority status to score a high-paying Harvard gig, is not just a fake Indian. She’s a fake populist, too.
