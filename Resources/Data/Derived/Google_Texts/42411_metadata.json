Greg Abbott said in a statement. \"The states serve as the last line of defense against an unlawfully expansive federal government.\u201d\n\nThe suit marks the latest skirmish in the growing divide between the federal government and some states over LGBT rights.\n\nTexas officials filed suit Wednesday against the departments of Justice and Education, among other federal agencies and officials. They were joined in the lawsuit by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as Maine Gov. Paul Lepage, Arizona\u2019s department of education and two school districts.\n\nTexas Atty. Gen.Ken Paxton said he filed suit after hearing from parents in Fort Worth and a school district along the Oklahoma border opposed to the directive. School officials at the Harrold Independent School District approved a policy Monday that would block the federal directive, risking the loss of $117,000 in annual federal funding, according to the superintendent, who joined Paxton at a briefing in the capital. The district includes a hundred students, he said, none of whom are transgender.\n\n\u201cThey want to make sure the safety of their children is protected,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general said he had not spoken to parents of transgender students, but added, \u201cI represent the entire state, so I\u2019m open to meeting with anybody.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina also has been battling the federal administration over transgender bathroom access, passing a law that triggered the federal directive.\n\nKaren Wireman, a mother of a transgender child, shows her support for the Fort Worth school district.

(Dallas Morning News)\n\nPaxton said that while North Carolina didn\u2019t join this lawsuit, Texas officials were \u201csympathetic to their cause.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina has been punished for its stance, as celebrities, potential employers and trade shows have boycotted the state in the wake of its stand against transgender bathroom access.\n\nPaxton said that after hearing from concerned parents and school district officials, he was not worried about a boycott in Texas.\n\nAdvocacy groups quickly condemned the lawsuit.\n\n\"This lawsuit is an attack by the Attorney General on transgender Texans, plain and simple. While ... Paxton sued the Obama administration, the real targets are vulnerable young people and adults who simply seek to live their lives free from discrimination when they go to school, work or the restroom,\" Rebecca L. Robertson, a policy director with the ACLU of Texas, said in a statement.\n\nPaxton said officials have not estimated the cost of pursuing the lawsuit, but that \u201cthe cost of defending the Constitution is always worth it.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Texas previously filed suit with more than two dozen states to block Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, a case that made it to the Supreme Court, which has yet to rule.\n\n\u201cJust like they did with issues of immigration, the Obama administration has chosen to exclude Congress entirely,\u201d on transgender access, Paxton said, accusing the president of using \u201cexecutive fiat\u201d to rewrite the law.\n\nHarrold Supt. David Thweatt said, \u201cWashington\u2019s mandate doesn\u2019t fit our schools.\u201d\n\nHe called the policy created to block the federal directive \u201cnecessary to protect the safety, dignity and security of the children.\u201d\n\nSee the most-read stories this hour >>\n\nOther opponents of the federal directive in Texas also praised the lawsuit, including Jonathan Saenz, president of the Austin-based conservative advocacy group Texas Values.\n\n\u201cOur state leaders have been forced to respond to protect the safety of our children. And we know what voters think about this: a very similar issue was pushed in Houston and the voters rejected it,\u201d Saenz said, referring to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which failed by a wide margin in November.\n\nTransgender advocates immediately condemned the lawsuit and Paxton, noting that he is facing federal securities-fraud charges on top of a similar state criminal indictment.\n\nKathy Miller, president of the Austin-based nonpartisan religious liberties watchdog group Texas Freedom Network, called the lawsuit \u201cshameful\u201d and accused Paxton of \u201cbullying transgender students in our public schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cFoolishness and fear have taken center stage,\u201d Manny Garcia, deputy executive director of the state\u2019s Democratic party, said in a statement, adding, \"Hate has no place in Texas.\u201d\n\nDena Iverson, a Justice Department spokeswoman said that, \"While the Department will review the complaint, the federal government has strong legal foundations to uphold the civil rights of transgender Americans.\u201d\n\nThis month, the Justice Department and North Carolina sued each other over the state's law curbing transgender access to public restrooms.\n\nJoin the conversation on Facebook >>\n\nALSO\n\nU.S. attorney general defends lawsuit aimed at overturning North Carolina's bathroom law\n\nAhead of California primary, Clinton focuses on Trump as Sanders seeks to prolong 'the Bern\n\nWhite House will showcase school arts program and feature Los Angeles students\n\nmhennessyfiske@tribpub.com\n\nUPDATES:\n\n9:02 p.m.: This article was updated with a comment from a Justice Department spokeswoman.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "LGBT divide grows as 11 states sue feds over transgender bathroom rule", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Texas and 10 other states are suing the Obama administration over its directive that schools must allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms corresponding to the gender with which they identify.", "title": "LGBT divide grows as 11 states sue feds over transgender bathroom rule", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-lgbt-rights-20160525-snap-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-57467af4/turbine/la-na-lgbt-rights-20160525-snap", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "LGBT, Obama, bathrooms", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/87341322", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-25", "Description": "Texas and 10 other states are suing the Obama administration over a new directive about transgender students in public schools.", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "LGBT, Obama, bathrooms"}, "article_summary": "Dallas Morning News Karen Wireman, a mother of a transgender child, shows her support for the Fort Worth school district.\nKaren Wireman, a mother of a transgender child, shows her support for the Fort Worth school district.\nTexas officials filed suit Wednesday against the departments of Justice and Education, among other federal agencies and officials.\nPaxton said that after hearing from concerned parents and school district officials, he was not worried about a boycott in Texas.\nGen.Ken Paxton said he filed suit after hearing from parents in Fort Worth and a school district along the Oklahoma border opposed to the directive."}
