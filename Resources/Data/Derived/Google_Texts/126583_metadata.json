Associated Press\n\nPresident Barack Obama last week reached out to the millennial generation as part of an effort to rally a key Democratic-leaning bloc that appears unlikely to turn out in large numbers for mid-term elections.\n\nThe White House rolled out a hefty report and Mr. Obama traveled to Los Angeles to speak at Cross Campus, a shared workspace for startups and venture capitalists, where he hailed millennials as \u201cthe best-educated, the most diverse, the most digitally fluent generation of adults in American history.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the largest generation in the United States and the most likely to vote Democratic when casting ballots. Among adults, half of millennials identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the party, compared with only 34% who say the same about Republicans, according to a Pew Research Center report.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years Millennials have remained the most liberal and least conservative of the four generations, and the only generation in which liberals are not significantly outnumbered by conservatives,\u201d the Pew report said.\n\nThat could help Democrats nationwide at a time when the party\u2019s hold in the Senate is tenuous. But enthusiasm toward Mr. Obama and Democratic candidates has waned since the last election and a poll this spring by Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics found that less than one-quarter of 18-29 year-olds said they would definitely vote in November.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no official definition, the millennial generation was, roughly, born between 1980 and the mid-2000s. Most polls look only at voting-age adults.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s 49-page report\u2014initially decorated with emojis and given a listicle-like title \u201c15 Economic Facts About Millenials\u201d\u2013highlights trends that have shaped the generation, including wide access to the Internet and high levels of education but against a backdrop of economic crisis and slow recovery.\n\n\u201cA lot of you entered into the workforce during the worst financial crisis and then the worst recession since the Great Depression,\u201d Mr. Obama noted last week.\n\nThe economy and the high cost education are two key areas and may underlie some disillusionment with current political leaders.\n\n\u201cEconomic opportunity for millennials is depressing,\u201d said Paul Dietzel, a 28-year-old Republican candidate for Congress in Louisiana\u2019s sixth district. Mr. Dietzel is running in a crowded field that includes Edwin Edwards, the 87-year-old former governor who served eight years in federal prison on racketeering charges. In a statewide race, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is trailing Republican challenger Bill Cassidy, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll released last month.\n\nMr. Dietzel doesn\u2019t have the national reach of the president, but he too sees his generation as a key demographic in this election and has been working to rally young voters by speaking on college campuses, going door to door and engaging on social media with podcasts, Facebook posts and elsewhere.\n\nTopics he talks a lot about include the Affordable Care Act, the high cost of a college education and the economy.\n\n\u201cYoung people know a bad deal when they see it,\u201d Mr. Dietzel said. \u201cThey face one of the highest youth unemployment rates in history. They can\u2019t find a job.\u201d\n\nMarilinda Garcia, a 31-year-old Republican running for a Congress in New Hampshire, echoes many of the same concerns about the economy, education costs and employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cAll of that combined has made for a confusing and a little bit frightening situation for millennials in terms of where they will go, what career they will pursue, whether they can buy a home, what their future will be like,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. Garcia said that hasn\u2019t necessarily translated into voter apathy. Fellow millennials make up the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of her volunteer campaign staff. \u201cIf you are a candidate that resonates with them, if you\u2019re offering a solution or offering a vision they relate to, you\u2019re likely to be successful,\u201d she said.\n\nTo be sure, many young candidates and voters embrace Mr. Obama and his policies.\n\nFor example, Abby Finkenauer, 25, is running for a seat in Iowa\u2019s House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cPeople are aware of the administration and a lot of the good things that have happened,\u201d she said, citing efforts on fair pay for women, cap college loan repayments and raise the minimum wage.\n\nMs. Finkenauer said 2010 midterms were \u201cabysmal\u201d for Democrats but she\u2019s been encouraged this year by turnout at campaign events and response among potential voters. In Iowa\u2019s Senate race, where Republican Joni Ernst is in a tight race with Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, younger voters could tip the balance toward Mr. Braley, she said.\n\nMs. Finkenauer also said her peers are particularly prone to vote via early and absentee ballots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot about who decides to show up and who decides to turn out,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can win in early voting, absentee voting, I think that will tip this election.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The millennials represent a highly educated and digitally fluent generation, likely to vote Democratic -- if they vote.
