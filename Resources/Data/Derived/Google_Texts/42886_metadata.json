Essex and Hudson counties had the largest decrease in documented charity care of $12.9 million and $10.6 million, respectively between 2011 and 2012 while Mercer and Hunterdon saw the largest increase of $11 million.\n\n\n\nHospitals located in cities, such as Camden, Newark, and Paterson, reported spending an average of $23.3 million -- twice as much as the $9.9 million average spent by suburban hospitals.\n\nSuzanne Ianni, president and CEO of the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, representing 16 urban hospitals, said she expects to see rates decline as the Affordable Care Act allows people with slightly higher incomes to obtain coverage through Medicaid next year.\n\n\"However, certain hospitals may have seen decreases as a result of their population health initiatives,\" Ianni said. \"Hospitals are not only investing in staff to help patients enroll in Medicaid but also in 'feet on the street' to help low income patients better manage their chronic diseases like diabetes or asthma where unmanaged patients frequently rely on the ER. That type of management could lead to a decrease in a hospital's documented charity care.\"\n\n\"It is important to note that none of these additional population health management program costs are captured in documented charity care -- so the billion in costs is actually understated,\" she added.\n\nNew Jersey residents who earn below 301% of the federal poverty level (no more than $34,470 for one person) who do not qualify for Medicaid or any other insurance are eligible to receive free or reduced rate charity care services. New Jersey hospitals are required by law to provide all necessary care regardless of a patient's ability to pay.\n\nThe report is available here.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharity care in New Jersey\n\n\n\nThese are the top 10 hospitals that provided the\n\nmost charity care to non-paying patients in 2012.\n\nStatewide, the amount increased by a modest $2.5 million.\n\n\n\nHospital Location Amount\n\nSt. Joseph's Regional Medical Center Paterson $82,936,093\n\nUniversity Hospital Newark $69,300,557\n\nJersey City Medical Center Jersey City $48,547,292\n\nNewark Beth Israel Medical Center Newark $41,932,097\n\nTrinitas Regional Medical Center Elizabeth $41,929,805\n\nCooper Hospital/University MC Camden $41,465,531\n\nBergen Regional Medical Center Paramus $32,787,641\n\nHackensack University Medical Center Hackensack $32,592,434\n\nCapital Health Regional Medical Center Trenton $31,195,703\n\nRobert Wood Johnson University Hospital New Brunswick $27,506,888\n\n\n\nSource: State Dept of Health\n\n\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Ready for Obamacare?
