"I strongly condemn today's launch of a ballistic missile by North Korea. The country has once again ignored warnings by the international community," Steinmeier said in a statement.

"The rocket launch is an irresponsible provocation, which disregards internationally-binding U.N. security council resolutions and is putting regional security on the line once again," he added.

Steinmeier said Sunday's emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council was an important signal and called on all partners to support firm steps.
