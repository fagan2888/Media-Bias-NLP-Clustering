New Hampshire\u2019s marketplace will jump from one insurer, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, to five next year, with the Maine co-op in the mix.\n\nMeanwhile, Maine\u2019s marketplace in 2015 will include Anthem, Maine Community Health Options and new entrant Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.\n\nWith more insurance companies offering plans, New Hampshire residents will likely see lower rates. A 2014 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that residents who lived in states with one or few insurance companies operating generally paid higher rates.\n\nInitially, the Maine co-op will offer plans in the four New Hampshire counties that border Maine \u2013 Rockingham, Strafford, Carroll and Coos \u2013 with plans in 2016 to expand into other New Hampshire counties.\n\nAfter capturing 80 percent of Maine\u2019s 44,000 health insurance marketplace enrollees, the Maine co-op has been praised nationally as a success story by industry experts and mentioned in the national media. Lewis met President Obama and Vice President Biden in April at a White House gathering of select co-op executives.\n\nLewis said the success in Maine was part of the reason the co-op was able to expand into New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given us a stronger position to work from,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIf we had had a lackluster performance (in Maine), we would not have been in a position to move forward.\u201d\n\nEmily Brostek, associate director of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a health care advocacy group that helped people sign up for the health insurance marketplace, said the new co-op quickly gained a positive reputation among consumers.\n\n\u201cBecause they were in Lewiston and did not have a national call center, I think they were easier to get ahold of if you had problems or questions,\u201d Brostek said.\n\nAlso, being a Maine-based company probably spurred people to choose the co-op over Anthem, Brostek said, which in 2014 were the only two insurers offering plans in Maine. Without Maine Community Health Options, Mainers would have only been able to choose among Anthem plans.\n\nRates were similar between Anthem and the Maine co-op, according to Maine Bureau of Insurance filings. Anthem officials couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI think consumers in Maine really welcomed having another player in Maine\u2019s insurance market, and having a choice,\u201d Brostek said.\n\nCurrently, New Hampshire residents do not have a choice in insurance companies \u2013 only Anthem offers plans.\n\nThe cooperatives were created as part of the Affordable Care Act to provide competition to traditional insurance companies, with federal loans to help them get off the ground. Maine\u2019s co-op received a $65 million loan, but a co-op did not form in New Hampshire.\n\nAnother co-op, Minuteman Health of Massachusetts, is also moving into the New Hampshire market, along with traditional insurance companies Harvard Pilgrim and Assurant Health.\n\nMeanwhile, cooperatives in Kentucky and Montana also are expanding operations to offer insurance in other states, according to Kaiser Health News.\n\n\u201cPeople were skeptical that the Affordable Care Act would work and that the co-ops would survive and thrive. But they have,\u201d said Rep. Drew Gattine, D-Westbrook and a member of the Maine Legislature\u2019s health and human services committee.\n\nLewis said the co-op is starting in the counties bordering Maine because the co-op already established a health care provider network in New Hampshire, so that Maine residents who live near the New Hampshire border can access health care in New Hampshire and still pay in-network costs. Out-of-network costs are typically more expensive.\n\nHe said the goal is for Maine Community Health Options to offer insurance in the marketplace to all New Hampshire residents in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe New Hampshire market is fairly comparable to Maine, and we wanted to give the people in New Hampshire additional choices,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nMore than 10 hospitals, including Concord Hospital, were excluded from the network in New Hampshire when Anthem established its provider network, according to news reports. With five companies offering plans in New Hampshire next year, that\u2019s unlikely to be the case for 2015.\n\nJoe Lawlor can be contacted at 791-6376 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @joelawlorph", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine Community Health will hire more workers and give residents in the neighboring state another insurance option next year.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Maine Community Health will hire more workers and give residents in the neighboring state another insurance option next year.", "title": "Maine co-op to offer Affordable Care insurance in New Hampshire - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2014-06-02T20:35:02-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/06/02/maine-co-op-to-offer-affordable-care-insurance-in-new-hampshire/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maine Community Health will hire more workers and give residents in the neighboring state another insurance option next year.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "title": "Maine co-op to offer Affordable Care insurance in New Hampshire - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-06-02T14:08:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-02T20:35:02-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Maine Community Health Options will no longer operate exclusively in Maine, as the health insurance co-op will begin offering plans on the New Hampshire health insurance marketplace starting in 2015.\nMeanwhile, Maine\u2019s marketplace in 2015 will include Anthem, Maine Community Health Options and new entrant Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.\nInitially, the Maine co-op will offer plans in the four New Hampshire counties that border Maine \u2013 Rockingham, Strafford, Carroll and Coos \u2013 with plans in 2016 to expand into other New Hampshire counties.\nLewis said the co-op is starting in the counties bordering Maine because the co-op already established a health care provider network in New Hampshire, so that Maine residents who live near the New Hampshire border can access health care in New Hampshire and still pay in-network costs.\nRates were similar between Anthem and the Maine co-op, according to Maine Bureau of Insurance filings."}
