Marco Rubio of Florida is expected to enter the 2016 presidential campaign on Monday. A look at key things to know about Rubio.\n\n___\n\nTHE BRIEF\n\nRubio won election during the tea party wave of 2010, but he has worked to broaden his appeal beyond the limited government, libertarian-leaning movement. At 43, he attracts younger voters \u2014 long a tricky reach for Republicans \u2014 and he would make history as the first Hispanic president. He has proved to be a strong fundraiser and in-demand campaigner, yet may find himself overshadowed in the 2016 campaign by another Floridian: one-time mentor Jeb Bush. Rubio\u2019s efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system won praise from some Republicans and scorn from others. He would head into the race needing to rebuild trust with the party\u2019s most conservative wing.\n\n___\n\nRESUME REVIEW\n\nRubio is only in his first term in the Senate, but he has been a political go-getter for years. As a third-year law student at the University of Miami, he ran Dade County for Sen. Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. He defeated an incumbent to win a seat on the West Miami City Commission, moving on to the state House two years later. In 2007, he became the first Hispanic elected speaker of the Florida House and in 2009 began his run for the U.S. Senate. In that race, he beat the establishment-favored candidate, Gov. Charlie Crist, in the GOP primary. Crist left the party and campaigned as an independent. Rubio won the three-way race against Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek with 49 percent of the vote.\n\n___\n\nPERSONAL STORY\n\nThe son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio was born in Miami. His mother worked as a maid and his father tended bar. His personal story as a first-generation American will be central in his quest for the presidency. The Cuban-American attended college in Missouri on a football scholarship before transferring to the University of Florida, where he earned his undergraduate degree. Rubio then earned his law degree from the University of Miami. He and his wife, Jeanette, a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader, have four children.\n\n___\n\nCALLING CARD MOMENT\n\nRubio\u2019s one term in the Senate has so far been defined by his painstaking work to negotiate a bipartisan bill that would have overhauled the nation\u2019s immigration system. The accomplishment cuts both ways. The bill showed Rubio\u2019s ability to work across party lines and it passed with 68 supporters, 14 Republicans among them. Among those who voted against it: Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, rivals for the GOP nomination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "White House Brief: Things to know about Sen.
