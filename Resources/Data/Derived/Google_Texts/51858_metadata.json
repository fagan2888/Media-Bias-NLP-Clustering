Wildfires love these conditions, which means more property is at risk of damage or destruction. Insurance companies are well aware of this, so they're expanding homeowners' insurance packages essentially to include firefighters.\n\nResidents in upmarket neighborhoods like Malibu or Bel Air might already know this but, for everyone else, here\u2019s the deal: homeowners' insurance for really rich people is different. AIG is one provider that offers insurance for, \u201chigh net worth individuals and their families.\u201d One of the protections is the Wildfire Protection Unit. AIG is quick to note this is not a private fire department, but in some ways it is. Patrick Titus, Operations Section Chief on an incident management team in California, said the role of the private firefighters could cause a problem.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not in the know,\u201d he said. \"They are just there as a hired service by the insurance company to take care of that piece of property, so that\u2019s where you get into the life safety issue with the public and everybody else, is them not being involved directly.\u201d\n\nTitus said it could lead to confusion among the public. A guy in a helmet and boots driving an engine to one particular house to put flame retardant on it sends a peculiar message. But he also said an insurance company's willingness to help isn\u2019t a bad thing.\n\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s never enough resources when there\u2019s a lot of fires going on,\" he said. \"So, in that regard, it\u2019s a benefit because they\u2019re in there taking care of their clients and taking care of their structures and it\u2019s one less thing we have to worry about.\u201d\n\nInsurance companies aren\u2019t doing this out of kindness. It makes business sense. Jim Salek, vice president of underwriting programs at USAA, said most of the homes they insure are everyday suburban houses, not the ones on a cliff in the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, it\u2019s less expensive to prevent,\u201d he said.\n\nSalek said this service isn\u2019t an effort to boost overall wildfire suppression. They\u2019re contract crews are only out to protect homes with their policies, which could put those crews in a tough situation if a fire makes a turn.\n\n\"So, what would happen in a specific situation? I don\u2019t know for sure,\" he said. \"But their main focus is on responding to our members\u2019 policies.\u201d\n\nUSAA contracts with a firm called Wildfire Defense Systems (WDS). All of their employees are private contractors. David Torgerson, president of WDS said they\u2019re not really set up to be first-responders to a wildfire.\n\n\u201cAlthough all these resources are trained and hired by the government to do initial attack and fight fire on the fire line, these insurer programs are more working to be more in the background,\" he said. \"They\u2019re working before the fire and after the fire doing supplemental roles to prepare the structures to be more survivable, and then check on them very quickly after the fire passes\u201d\n\nThe insurance teams aren\u2019t there to protect lives, they're there to protect property.\n\nKyle Dickman worked for the US Forest Service for a few years and now writes about fires. He said firefighting is becoming more and more privatized, but he thinks it makes sense, especially as people continue to build houses in dangerous spots.\n\n\u201cIf you make all of those choices and then expect the Forest Service or BLM or your city or county firefighter to risk their lives to save your home from a wildfire that is going to happen every year or every ten years or every fifteen years I think that\u2019s not a realistic expectation,\u201d he said.\n\nMany firefighters told Marketplace they think insurance companies getting into the game is not necessarily a bad thing, it just has to be controlled.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2015/11/25/sustainability/insurance-companies-getting-firefighting-game", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/GettyImages-488140668.jpg?itok=O_ylkDnB", "type": "article", "description": "Santa Ana winds in excess of 50 mph can spread fires quicker than ever.", "title": "Insurance companies getting into the firefighting game"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "+ZYpoQ2VWIdgwLB6pyZJ/8CjQY0L5ZBvOiNIDz0CzenLlZTtyk9rhTtCd1CP3DK7mDFLMtL2jE70Uqvqha+atA==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Many firefighters told Marketplace they think insurance companies getting into the game is not necessarily a bad thing, it just has to be controlled.\nInsurance companies are well aware of this, so they're expanding homeowners' insurance packages essentially to include firefighters.\nPatrick Titus, Operations Section Chief on an incident management team in California, said the role of the private firefighters could cause a problem.\nAIG is one provider that offers insurance for, \u201chigh net worth individuals and their families.\u201d One of the protections is the Wildfire Protection Unit.\nHe said firefighting is becoming more and more privatized, but he thinks it makes sense, especially as people continue to build houses in dangerous spots."}
