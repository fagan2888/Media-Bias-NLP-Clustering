I have 10 good ones for 2015. So here goes (with tongue sometimes in cheek) with my predictions for the upcoming year.\n\nMy first two concern the World Meeting of Families in September in Philadelphia. As a result of this big event, I see Archbishop Chaput being elevated to Cardinal Chaput. I also see Pope Francis rocking the area and the country much more than any other papal visit. If Pope John Paul was the Rolling Stones invasion, Pope Francis will be the Beatles.\n\nStaying in the area, Governor Christie will still be big news in 2015. His high-fiving with Jerry Jones will come to a bad end when he tries to have flags lowered at half-staff when Tony Romo and the Cowboys choke away the NFC title game.\n\nA further prediction is that Christie is not out of the toll booth when it comes to Bridgegate. Based upon my own interview with him in the past, he will not fare well when he dukes it out with big time Republicans in the primaries. To borrow a phrase from The Wizard of Oz, \u201cToto, we\u2019re not in Jersey anymore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Pennsylvania state politics, Attorney General Kathleen Kane will be the center of the ring of the political circus. Her incompetence, lightweight skills and bold but raw politics in everything have finally caught up with her. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has already exposed these things by challenging her effectively on corruption cases. Watch for her to continue to be marginalized in 2015.\n\nIn sports, I predict Chip Kelly comes roaring back in 2015. The end of the 2014 season was disappointing, but Kelly is a genius. He is as interesting as any coach I\u2019ve ever seen in Philadelphia. On the other hand, Sam Hinkie, head man in charge of losing for the Sixers, is not going to succeed in his \u201clet\u2019s tank and tank again in order to win big\u201d strategy. I still love pro basketball but this nonsense diminishes sports.\n\nI see a lot of pundits and oddballs predicting that this will be the year when domestic robots, drones and driverless cars break through. Oh yeah, we\u2019ll see the Expressway and other roads crawling with computers listening to traffic reports and skillfully depositing people at locations where their robot has the coffee ready. We\u2019ll see.\n\nMuch more likely than the Jetsons taking over, is that Obamacare is not home free in 2015. The case of King v. Burwell will be decided in June and I predict the Supreme Court will use it to strike down a large part of the law. Part of the motivation will be the fact that Dr. Jonathan Gruber has been exposed and he has exposed the lies the law was based on. He was outed by Rich Weinstein of West Chester who watched the Gruber videos and I think gave the Court the final push to gut this destructive law.\n\nFinally, I predict that my radio show from nine to noon on Talk Radio 1210 will continue to be boots on the ground for the biggest stories in the Delaware Valley and also bring you the biggest guests in the country. For me, it will be an easier resolution to keep than pledging to lose ten pounds in 2015.\n\nTalk show host Dom Giordano is heard weekdays 9 AM to 12 noon on WPHT 1210-AM Radio.
