Ingham County's Health Service millage passed by voters in November is bringing in more money than necessary.

By 2020 the millage will bring in $3.4 million, which funds health services for low income individuals, but because of Obamacare and Healthy Michigan, that money might not be necessary anymore.

But, because of the supreme court case against Obamacare, and the second required Healthy Michigan federal waiver that hasn't been approved yet, the county hasn't decided what to do with the extra money.

The county could allocate it to other funds for health and human services.

"The ACA is driving a lot of changes to the way we finance and the way we deliver health care," said Ingham Health Plan's chairman Scott Lyon. "And I doubt that any of us know how that story's gonna play out over the next couple of years."

The Ingham health plan's funding is up in the air.

"All of our income levels are gone with the affordable care act, so unless there is new sources of income we will spend down our reserves and the plan will go away," Lyon said.

The commissioners have to decide whether or not they'll need that $3.4 million by 2020.

Todd Tennis is the chairman of the Ingham County Human Services Committee.

He and the other members of the board of commissioners have until June to decide whether to give some of the money back, or to give it to other health services.

"We are very interested in making sure that the voters in Ingham county who approved this millage that the money is gonna go where it is supposed to go and where it's needed," Tennis said. "And if we have a surplus at the end of this year, one of the options will certainly be to lower the levy for next year."

Lyon told me IHP is only the most basic health coverage, like preventative doctors appointments and check ups.

So he thinks the money can go to expanding IHP instead of giving it back.

Voters will know by the fall whether or not they'll get that refund, or have a lower millage all together.
