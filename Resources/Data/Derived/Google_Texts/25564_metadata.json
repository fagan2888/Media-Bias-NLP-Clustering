Attkisson recounted the story at a hearing on government transparency Tuesday in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nBy the time the Defense Department turned over the documents, her daughter was 18 and getting ready to leave for college.\n\n\u201cFOIA should be one of the most powerful tools of the public and the press in a free and open society,\u201d Attkisson said. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s largely a pointless, useless shadow of its intended self.\u201d\n\nIt was a day for reporters to leave the sidelines and testify as witnesses in a hearing called by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the committee\u2019s chairman, to shed light on the excessive impediments surrounding the Freedom of Information Act. Chaffetz is leading an investigation into excessive FOIA delays, obstructions and violations, calling for an \u201copen and transparent\u201d government.\n\nAttkisson testified along with Vice News investigative reporter Jason Leopold, Newsweek investigative reporter Leah McGrath Goodman and New York Times assistant general counsel Dave McCraw. Each shared stories about excessive delays.\n\nThe reporters complained the law, which requires the government to respond to Freedom of Information requests within 20 business days, with the option of a 10-day extension under \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d is flagrantly violated or ignored, resulting in an unprecedented backlog in requests.\n\nLeopold said fewer than 1 percent of the thousands of Freedom of Information Act requests he submitted across dozens of federal agencies have been decided within the law\u2019s legal timeframe.\n\nFederal agencies often cite lack of funding and staff as reason for the increase in backlogs, but Attkisson said blame falls on the agencies themselves. She claimed federal officials \u201cintentionally\u201d create delays not because they lack resources but rather to conceal public information.\n\n\u201cFOIA law was intended to facilitate the timely release of public information,\u201d Attkisson said. \u201cInstead, federal officials have perverted it and use it to obfuscate, obstruct and delay. The broken system is not by accident, it\u2019s by design.\u201d\n\nBeyond unusually long delays, the journalists on the panel complained of repeated instances of unnecessary redactions or rejection of requests because of misuse of the law\u2019s various exemptions.\n\nAttkisson held up entirely redacted documents from the Department of Health and Human Services with the exemption \u201c(b)5\u201d boldly printed in black across the white pages.\n\nExemption (b)5 is the most widely used. It allows government to withhold what are often referred to as \u201cpre-decisional\u201d documents\u2014a list of applicants or vendors competing for work, for instance\u2014or those that would be available only to opposing parties in a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThese are about HealthCare.gov \u2026 nothing that has to do with national security, nothing that could possibly put us in danger or help terrorists,\u201d Attkisson said. \u201c(B)5 should be interpreted very narrowly. Instead, they slap that on just about anything.\u201d\n\nThis particular exemption, Attkisson said, has become known as the \u201cwithhold it because you want to\u201d exemption among those used to receiving the bold, black stamps.\n\n\u201cThe exemptions are given much, much too broad a reading,\u201d McCraw said. \u201cCongress is in power to cut those back, and that\u2019s the single most important thing that would help.\u201d\n\nTo Attkisson, the law can only be fixed once violators are forced to face \u201cmeaningful criminal penalties.\u201d\n\nUnder today\u2019s standards, Attkisson noted, agencies avoid punishment by using taxes to pay for fines associated with violations, shifting the burden from the government to the public.\n\n\u201cThere are no repercussions for them to withhold material,\u201d Attkisson said. \u201cBut there are repercussions if they release information.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reporters told a congressional committee yesterday that FOIA has become toothless in the face of abuses of its exemptions by various government agencies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Reporters told a congressional committee yesterday that FOIA has become toothless in the face of abuses of its exemptions by various government agencies.", "title": "Attkisson: FOIA is 'Pointless, Useless Shadow of Intended Self'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150603_SharylAttkisson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-03T16:12:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1detS6y"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Reporters told a congressional committee yesterday that FOIA has become toothless in the face of abuses of its exemptions by various government agencies.", "title": "Attkisson: FOIA is 'Pointless, Useless Shadow of Intended Self'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150603_SharylAttkisson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "transparency", "published_time": "2015-06-03T15:00:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T16:12:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sharyl Attkisson, Jason Leopold, Dave McCraw, Leah McGrath Goodman, Jason Chaffetz, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Defense"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb157\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFOIA law was intended to facilitate the timely release of public information,\u201d Attkisson said.\nAttkisson testified along with Vice News investigative reporter Jason Leopold, Newsweek investigative reporter Leah McGrath Goodman and New York Times assistant general counsel Dave McCraw.\nShe claimed federal officials \u201cintentionally\u201d create delays not because they lack resources but rather to conceal public information.\n\u201cFOIA should be one of the most powerful tools of the public and the press in a free and open society,\u201d Attkisson said.\nChaffetz is leading an investigation into excessive FOIA delays, obstructions and violations, calling for an \u201copen and transparent\u201d government."}
