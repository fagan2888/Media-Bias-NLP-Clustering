A Pinellas Park company that specializes in building historical re-creations for Tampa-area museums is the focus of a TV series that debuts Saturday on History Channel’s H2 network.

“Museum Men” features Creative Arts Unlimited as its craftsmen build exhibits while relating stories about the objects, people and building techniques of various eras.

“Watching them build is like being in a time machine,” History Channel vice president Mike Stiller said in a news release. “They bring the past back to life in unforgettable ways, and that’s exactly what we’re trying to do on H2.”

The company’s 34,000-square-foot facility, at 335 Second Ave. N.E., features a comprehensive studio staffed with trained sculptors, muralists and artists.

On Saturday premiere, the team is commissioned to build a King Tut exhibit for the St. Petersburg Museum of History. To do it, they use the museum’s 3,000-year-old mummy, “Lady of the Nile,” while re-creating items from Tut’s tomb. The job has to be complete within 30 days.

The episode debuts at 10 p.m. on H2.
