Washington\u2019s Arena Stage is developing \u201cThe Originalist\u201d about Scalia with a story delving into some of the biggest issues and court dramas of this era, from gun rights to gay marriage.\n\nThe new play, which begins previews Friday and will run March 19 through April 26, promises a unique mix of politics and entertainment, reflecting arguments Americans wrestle with nationwide. For Gero, it\u2019s about capturing one compelling character while he has the rare opportunity to bring a sitting, political figure to the stage.\n\nGero shares a natural resemblance with Scalia. He has studied the justice in court, through videos and over lunch in Scalia\u2019s chambers.\n\n\u201cMy job as an actor was to find the connections. Certainly there are many, being Italian-American, being Roman Catholic, being from the Northeast. I was raised in Jersey. He was born in Jersey, raised in New York,\u201d Gero said of their chat. \u201cBy the end of the hour, I felt like I was just hanging out with Uncle Nino. I know the behavior.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t talk politics or about the play. It was simply time to get to know each other. Gero said he hopes to capture Scalia\u2019s humor and intelligence, along with his fast-talking style.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big man with big ideas,\u201d Gero said. \u201cWhen he listens, he\u2019ll close and sort of shut down his eyes in order to heighten his sense of listening, and then when he grabs onto something, he launches and there\u2019s a real energy in his upper body. So I\u2019m trying to capture that physically.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Gero has played at least one other political figure: President Richard Nixon. He has extensive credits in regional theater and has played many Shakespearean roles. His film credits include \u201cDie Hard 2\u201d and \u201cStriking Distance.\u201d\n\nScalia, the court\u2019s longest-serving current justice, declined to be interviewed about the play. Speaking at an event last month with NPR, Scalia said he doesn\u2019t plan to see a performance and was perhaps wary of how he would be portrayed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK; I mean what can they do? They\u2019re going to write what they write,\u201d he said.\n\nAll the justices have been invited to a performance, and some are expected to attend.\n\nIn the rehearsal hall, two walls are lined with pictures of Scalia like a timeline of his life since he was appointed to the court in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan. There are also images from one pivotal moment - rainbow flags waiving outside the nation\u2019s highest court. For the story set between 2011 and 2013, the decision striking down the ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriages figures prominently. Scalia wrote a fiery dissent in the case.\n\nPlaywright John Strand said his goal was to build a story around two people - Scalia and a young law clerk - who passionately disagree on all the big issues.\n\n\u201cHow could two people of opposite political viewpoints begin to understand one another?\u201d Strand said. \u201cIf we start with someone who is renowned for being on the extremes of viewpoints -whether that\u2019s accurate or not, that is his reputation - then we might have an interesting thematic situation.\u201d\n\nIn one scene, Scalia and his clerk debate gun rights.\n\n\u201cAmericans own 300 million guns, and 54 million are semi-automatics. What do you need that kind of firepower for unless you\u2019re being attacked by a T. rex?\u201d the clerk argues.\n\n\u201cIrrelevant to the Second Amendment text,\u201d Scalia says, citing the original intent of the Constitution\u2019s writers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d argue there is too much gun violence,\u201d the clerk said.\n\n\u201cThe reason?\u201d Scalia says\n\n\u201cToo many guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong,\u201d Scalia says. \u201cViolence is a trait of the human species. \u2026 Guns are in the national DNA, like it or not.\u201d\n\nLater the play delves into same-sex marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I think is on people\u2019s minds,\u201d the playwright said.\n\nMolly Smith, the show\u2019s director who married her longtime partner, Suzanne, last year in a ceremony officiated by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said marriage is a defining issue of our time. The court is taking up the larger issue of same-sex marriage April 28, just after the show closes.\n\nIn the past, theaters often avoided current issues and left that to film, but this play changes that for Smith, a self-described political animal.\n\n\u201cI think as artists if we aren\u2019t involved in the present moment, what are we doing?\u201d she said.\n\nStrand said he tried to be fair toward Scalia. He hopes audiences will be moved. He wants them to be angry, to argue but also to laugh.\n\n\u201cIt was never my intention to do a hatchet job on Antonin Scalia,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to offend, but inevitably we will. If we\u2019re really looking into these issues, inevitably we will.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Brett Zongker at https://twitter.com/DCArtBeat .", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actor Edward Gero has spent a lot of time in court over the past year - the Supreme Court to be exact - watching, studying and listening to one justice in particular, seeing how he behaves.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Actor Edward Gero has spent a lot of time in court over the past year - the Supreme Court to be exact - watching, studying and listening to one justice in particular, seeing how he behaves.", "title": "New play brings Supreme Court Justice Scalia to the stage", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/5/new-play-brings-supreme-court-justice-scalia-to-th/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/05/ea589b7150c8ea0a6f0f6a706700c74a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/05/ea589b7150c8ea0a6f0f6a706700c74a.jpg", "description": "Actor Edward Gero has spent a lot of time in court over the past year - the Supreme Court to be exact - watching, studying and listening to one justice in particular, seeing how he behaves.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "New play brings Supreme Court Justice Scalia to the stage"}, "Author": "BRETT ZONGKER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09c4\"", "article_summary": "The court is taking up the larger issue of same-sex marriage April 28, just after the show closes.\n\u2026 Guns are in the national DNA, like it or not.\u201dLater the play delves into same-sex marriage.\nHe has studied the justice in court, through videos and over lunch in Scalia\u2019s chambers.\nJustice Antonin Scalia, 79, is one of the court\u2019s most conservative, outspoken and polarizing characters, and now those qualities are providing the ingredients for a new play.\nSo I\u2019m trying to capture that physically.\u201dIn the past, Gero has played at least one other political figure: President Richard Nixon."}
