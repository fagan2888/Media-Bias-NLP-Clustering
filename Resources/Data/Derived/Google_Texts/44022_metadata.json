(politics@9news.com)\n\n\n\n\u201cEventually, people want to elect someone for a positive reason,\u201d Dean said, rejecting the notion that the presidential race will spiral in an ever more negative direction. \u201c[Clinton] is going to stick to the high road as much as she can, but she has to show she\u2019s strong, which means that when Trump does go after her she\u2019s going to have to punch him out, then turn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call it nastiness, but I think there will be a remarkable amount of one-side truth-telling by both candidates,\u201d Gingrich added.\n\n\n\nGingrich cast Speaker Paul Ryan as causing needless negative publicity for Trump by witholding support for Trump when he first became the presumptive nominee.\n\n\n\nGingrich said he\u2019s \u201cirritated\u201d by leaders in his party who are taking that approach.\n\n\n\n\u201cI watch the Bushes and Romney, all of whom if I had said what [Speaker Paul] Ryan said, all whom would\u2019ve gone crazy, but now that it\u2019s their turn to be loyal, it\u2019s their turn to be supportive, they\u2019re a long way from being the kind of people I thought they\u2019d be,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\n\n\nOut interview went longer than time allowed on TV. In the web extra below, hear Dean and Gingrich discuss whether America should embrace more than two political parties, the rift in Colorado between Clinton and Sanders supporters, the future of Obamacare, and how those who think American politics is rigged should view politicians who later work on lobbying the government:\n\nCopyright 2016 KUSA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "This week, we aim to make sense of this election year with two people who've run for President before.
