Then, lengthy interviews just published in The New York Times and The Washington Post.\n\nThe new consensus is that Trump is wildly irresponsible on matters of foreign policy\u2014a dangerous threat to global stability and U.S. national interests. Many of his policy proposals are indeed wild on many counts: irresponsible, impractical, unworkable, and illegal--the shortest route to calamity.\n\nRelated: 10 Foreign Policy Experts Who Think Trump Could Destroy America\u200b\u200b\n\nWe\u2019re going to do what to the families of known terrorists? We\u2019re going to stop buying oil from the Saudis, just like that, if they don\u2019t commit troops to the fight against the ISIS? This isn\u2019t a serious conversation, many people say\u2014and rightly.\n\nSo let\u2019s make it one. This column is no endorsement of Trump, but name-calling never counts as a counter-argument. What\u2019s at issue here? Why is the foreign policy establishment the latest constituency to declare Donald Trump a public enemy?\n\nOf the many issues on which Trump has opined, two stand out as the most important--NATO and our trans-Pacific alliances. Together they represent the twin pillars of the U.S.-led postwar order.\n\nRelated: Ex-Trump Insider: Donald Doesn\u2019t Want to Be President\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nTrump disputes the role of NATO in the post-Cold War context, calling it \u201cobsolete\u201d as currently constituted and in need of a \u201creconfiguring.\u201d In an interview with David Sanger and Maggie Haberman at The Times\u2019 last week, he said:\n\n\u201cWhen NATO was formed many decades ago we were a different country. There was a different threat. The Soviet Union was \u2026 was much bigger than Russia\u2026. So NATO is something that at the time was excellent. Today, it has to be changed. It has to be changed to include terror. It has to be changed from the standpoint of cost because the United States bears far too much of the cost of NATO.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s questions about America\u2019s trans-Pacific allies are in the same line. He thinks we should renegotiate the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty: \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not a fair deal,\u201d he says. Trump would also pull troops back from Japan and South Korea if they don\u2019t foot more of the bill, and he\u2019d consider letting both nations develop nuclear weapons:\n\n\u201cThere is going to be a point at which we just can\u2019t do this security umbrella\u201d [in the western Pacific]. \u201cIt\u2019s a position that at some point is something that we have to talk about, and if the United States keeps on its current path of weakness they\u2019re going to want to have [their own nuclear deterrent] anyway with or without me discussing it\u2026. With our Japanese relationship, if we are attacked they don\u2019t have to do anything. If they\u2019re attacked, we have to go out with full force. That\u2019s a pretty one-sided agreement right there.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Unplugged: Now He Predicts a Massive Recession and Much More\n\nTrump has flip-flopped on some of his wildest statements. We do not want a nuclear Japan or a nuclear South Korea, for instance, although India was confirmed as a nuclear power in 1998 with no great consequence. (In that case, the U.S. imposed sanctions that were more or less pro forma; the George W. Bush administration lifted them in 2001.)\n\nMistakes aside, there are truths in Trump\u2019s views on these questions that deserve consideration. NATO and Washington\u2019s Asian alliances are essential to U.S. primacy in world affairs, but both are indeed in need of a reconsideration. No one has to vote for the messenger, but shooting him is not a substitute for a necessary debate.\n\nIt has been clear since the Cold War\u2019s end Asians have to find their own equilibrium with their newly powerful next-door neighbor, China\u2014and this means as Asians, not as American allies.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the sun is setting on Washington\u2019s Pacific alliances: Not even the Chinese are suggesting that. But it does mean the U.S. must come to terms with a changing political, diplomatic, and security landscape in the Pacific. True stability requires flexibility; if it\u2019s the consistency of concrete, it will eventually crack.\n\nRelated: North Korea Lashes Out at China, Threatens a \u2018Nuclear Storm\u2019\n\nAs to NATO, Trump joins George Kennan, Henry Kissinger and many others in questioning the treaty organization\u2019s post-Cold War mission. It\u2019s no secret that its eastward thrust over the past two decades has been problematic\u2014if not a mistake altogether.\n\nWhy, then, is it suddenly a perilous breach to suggest that we reconsider NATO\u2019s role? The thought\u2019s not the problem, apparently, so much as the man who\u2019s advancing the thought.\n\nThe volleys between Trump and his legions of adversaries in the foreign policy debate are worrisome for one simple but significant reason above all. The world order is changing, and America\u2019s place in it is in a transition so complex no one can quite define it yet.\n\nNo one ever thought these realities would be delivered by Donald Trump, but he has thrown down the gauntlet. Odd as it seems and as much as he probably didn\u2019t even mean to, Trump raises important questions.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say he has to be in on the answers. But our brightest minds on the foreign policy side have to be able to accept the inevitability of change and navigate it to America\u2019s advantage and everyone\u2019s benefit. Their responses to Trump suggest they aren\u2019t there yet.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump is never short of controversial remarks and highly unlikely policy positi", "title": "Trump Is the Wrong Messenger, But He\u2019s Raised Some of the Right Issues", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/04/04/Trump-Wrong-Messenger-He-s-Raised-Some-Right-Issues", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-hedgefunds_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/04/04/Trump-Wrong-Messenger-He-s-Raised-Some-Right-Issues", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-hedgefunds_2.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Donald Trump is never short of controversial remarks and highly unlikely policy positi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "No one ever thought these realities would be delivered by Donald Trump, but he has thrown down the gauntlet.\nWhy is the foreign policy establishment the latest constituency to declare Donald Trump a public enemy?\nRelated: 10 Foreign Policy Experts Who Think Trump Could Destroy America\u200b\u200bWe\u2019re going to do what to the families of known terrorists?\nThe volleys between Trump and his legions of adversaries in the foreign policy debate are worrisome for one simple but significant reason above all.\nBut our brightest minds on the foreign policy side have to be able to accept the inevitability of change and navigate it to America\u2019s advantage and everyone\u2019s benefit."}
