Diane Black (R-Tenn.) has consistently been a staunch opponent of abortion and its leading provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood. And when Planned Parenthood published a controversial tweet over the weekend, Black couldn\u2019t sit back and let it go unnoticed.\n\n\u201cImagine \u2018life in a magical land where abortions and birth control are free and plentiful\u2019 This place exists,\u201d Planned Parenthood tweeted Sunday afternoon, including a link to a Fusion editorial that slammed the U.S. for not offering free and more accessible abortion services.\n\nImagine \"life in a magical land where abortions and birth control are free and plentiful\" This place exists. https://t.co/zdEYnLF0oT \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) December 13, 2015\n\nIn an interview with TheBlaze, Black slammed Planned Parenthood for the \u201cunconscionable statement \u2014 a magical land where we just kill babies\u201d and contended that the old pro-abortion mantra is not indicative of the movement anymore.\n\n\u201c\u2018Rare\u2019 is the point I want to get back to. That\u2019s not really what this is about. This is about abortion on demand,\u201d she said. \u201cSafe, legal and rare. The third word there is obviously not what they stand for.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Life in a magical land where abortion is rare and birth control is free and plentiful.\u2019 If that\u2019s really their mission, that\u2019s what should have been in there,\u201d Black, a former nurse, continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what their message should be; we left a word out of here.\n\n\u201cWith a single tweet, Planned Parenthood accidentally told us the truth. They effectively admitted that the abortion lobby\u2019s mantra of \u2018safe, legal and rare\u2019 abortion is a lie and that the organization\u2019s real mission is to encourage more elective abortions funded off the backs of taxpayers,\u201d Black said.\n\nThe vivacious lawmaker also criticized Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards who has largely argued that abortions are among the least of her organization\u2019s services. Appearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the wake of the contentious undercover videos released over the summer, Richards said that Planned Parenthood was all about \u201cessential services\u201d for women, such as breast exams, birth control and counseling for those with unplanned pregnancies.\n\n\u201cIs their message really about what they try to convince it is?\u201d Black said. \u201cSo what are they? Are they a clinic, agency that really wants to provide preventative women\u2019s services? To which we would all say, \u2018Absolutely, we want to be able to fund that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at Planned Parenthood and what they have said and what they do \u2014 I think there is real confusion in their message,\u201d she continued.\n\nAnd Black isn\u2019t alone in questioning the motives of Planned Parenthood \u2014 specifically after the controversial tweet.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina told TheBlaze that she plans to end taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood if elected \u2014 a sentiment her campaign has oft repeated.\n\n\u201cI will support those pregnancy centers and women\u2019s health clinics around the country that are actually serving their communities,\u201d Fiorina told TheBlaze.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood has showed their hand \u2014 they aren\u2019t pro-choice but rather pro-abortion, and want to live in a world where life is so devalued that women don\u2019t think twice about having an abortion,\u201d Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, told TheBlaze. \u201cWe would rather live in a world where abortion is unthinkable and women facing unplanned pregnancies have resources to help them in their times of need and not resort to walking through the doors of Planned Parenthood, where a dollar sign will be placed on them and their preborn baby.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Senate passed a bill to reallocate taxpayer money from Planned Parenthood with a vote of 52-47. Only two Republicans did not vote for the measure, which also repeals the Affordable Care Act \u2014 commonly referred to as Obamacare. President Barack Obama, who championed the controversial health care law, has threatened to veto the measure.\n\nBlack asked if those who voted against the reallocating of funds bill would align their vote with Planned Parenthood\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cThe contrast between the pro-abortion and pro-life point of view has never been more clear. While Planned Parenthood invites its supporters to imagine a future of \u2018free and plentiful\u2019 abortion \u2014 because apparently the loss of more than 327,000 unborn babies a year just isn\u2019t enough \u2014 we in the pro-life movement invite Americans to believe in a country where every life is cherished and where every child is given a chance to see the light of day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe must not stand for this barbarity,\u201d Black said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to a request for comment from TheBlaze. According to reproductive health nonprofit\u2019s website, abortions make up three percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s health services.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 5, "twitter": {"description": "\"Safe, legal and rare.\"  Such was the early rally cry of the pro-choice movement, but it is a mantra that is no longer emblematic of the progressive crusade, according to a conservative female lawmaker.
