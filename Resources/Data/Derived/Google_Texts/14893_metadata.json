(WOOD) \u2014 More and more people are choosing to skip a doctor\u2019s appointment and instead get their flu vaccination at a pharmacy.\n\nPharmacies won\u2019t replace the need to go to a doctor, but for some routine things like the flu shot, many people \u2014 one in five adults nationally \u2014 are choosing to go to their local pharmacy.\n\nErin Anderson took her 10-year-old son Aidan to a local Walgreens to get the shot. He wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea, but it was over almost before he could get too nervous.\n\n\u201cIt was quick and easy; could come right in when it was my schedule,\u201d Erin Anderson said.\n\nThat\u2019s the attraction and the sales pitch: There is no appointment necessary and many pharmacies have convenient locations.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re more accessible to the patients,\u201d Walgreens pharmacist Sally Ngo said. \u201cIt\u2019s again in terms of how many times we see the patients. I think we see the patients more than the doctors do.\u201d\n\nNgo pointed out she and her staff see patients sometimes weekly or monthly, and it\u2019s convenient to point out if a vaccine is recommended for a person\u2019s age group or medical condition.\n\nMany pharmacies like Walgreens have been doing immunizations for years. The preventative primary care is expected to only increase at pharmacies.\n\nWhen asked, Ngo said she thought the role of a pharmacy would probably continue to expand.\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s so many people who are going to become 65 and older,\u201d she said \u2014 meaning they\u2019re especially encouraged to get the flu shot.\n\nNgo also said the Affordable Care Act has also made it easier for people to get their flu shot. More people can get vaccines because it\u2019s preventative care that may not have been covered before, but now is. Ngo said it\u2019s also easier as a pharmacy to bill medical insurance directly for services provided at the pharmacy.\n\nOther states like California already have laws in place for pharmacists to get a special designation to prescribe certain medicines and order tests without a doctor\u2019s input.\n\nHealth officials recommend the flu shot, particularly for high-risk people like children and older adults, every year. This season, the vaccination is one way to help curb Ebola virus scares. The illnesses initially present with many of the same symptoms, so fewer flu cases means there will be fewer cases of people with Ebola-like symptoms.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nOnline:\n\nKent County Health Department on the flu\n\nMichigan Department of Community Health on the flu\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "More and more people are choosing to skip a doctor's appointment and instead get their flu vaccination at a pharmacy.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wood", "og": {"site_name": "WOODTV.com", "description": "More and more people are choosing to skip a doctor\u2019s appointment and instead get their flu vaccination at a pharmacy.", "title": "Many choose pharmacy for flu shots", "url": "http://woodtv.com/2014/10/27/many-rely-on-pharmacy-for-flu-shots/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/generic-flu-vaccine-child-b.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More and more people are choosing to skip a doctor\u2019s appointment and instead get their flu vaccination at a pharmacy.", "creator": "@woodtv", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/generic-flu-vaccine-child-b.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Many choose pharmacy for flu shots", "site": "WOODTV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Grand Rapids, MI news, weather, sports and traffic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488527284", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WOODTV.com", "google-site-verification": "nqHTbbkW32A8Ssjvec6oDik57M8cANvAMyR0LzfR1to", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/woodtv", "published_time": "2014-10-28T02:53:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-28T03:16:25+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://woodtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/28c7d45e6d62506344f0aad2af937984?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca132\"", "article_summary": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.
