Working with the University of California -Berkeley, University of California -Davis, the U.S. Forest Service and other agencies, the two tribes are working to augment the ability of the forest to support foods such as acorns, pine nuts, huckleberries, hazelnuts, raspberries, deer, elk and mushrooms, as well as make habitat more hospitable for salmon and eel.\n\nThe Karuk and Yurok Tribes traditionally managed entire watersheds and ecosystems on their ancestral lands to meet their dietary, cultural and spiritual needs. The Tribes are now working to reestablish the once rich and bio-diverse ecology of their ancestral homeland forests and waterways using traditional agroforestry management systems.\n\n\u201cBy putting fire back on the landscape, we intend to restore the currently wildfire-prone food desert into a healthy, bio-diverse, fruit, nut and wildlife-rich forest,\u201d said Karuk Department of Natural Resources Director Leaf Hillman in a statement.\n\n\u201cWise use of fire will enable both the Yurok and the Karuk Tribes to incorporate many other traditional management techniques into forest restoration as well,\u201d said Yurok Heritage Preservation Officer Bob McConnell in the statement. \u201cOnce the forests are more open, local practitioners will be better able to restore hundreds of smaller patches across the forest currently too overgrown to access.\u201d\n\nThe USDA points out that \u201ctraditional land management systems incorporated a range of burns at different intensities and frequencies, as well as a variety of pruning, gathering and hunting techniques.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all a matter of holding in reverence that which sustains us, according to tribal officials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been given clear instructions for caring for our relations; the earth, fire, water, the sky,\u201d said Lisa Hillman, Karuk Tribe\u2019s Food Security Coordinator, in the USDA statement. \u201cThese are rules to which we as a People must adhere in order to maintain the balance necessary to \u2018fix the world\u2019 each year.\u201d\n\nRead more about Re-establishing Tribal Biodiversity Through Agroforestry at the USDA\u2019s blog.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fighting fire-ravaged habitat destruction with \u2026 fire?The Yurok and Karuk tribes are working with two universities and the USDA to restore habitat, using traditional knowledge and fire.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/02/traditional-knowledge-fuels-yurok-and-karuk-habitat-restoration-project-usda-158099", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/usda_karuk-yurok-habitat.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Traditional Knowledge Fuels Yurok and Karuk Habitat Restoration Project With USDA"}, "abstract": "The Yurok and Karuk tribes are working with two universities and the USDA to restore habitat, using traditional knowledge and fire.", "keywords": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, Traditional Knowledge, Yurok, Yurok Tribe, Karuk Tribe, Karuk", "dc": {"title": "Traditional Knowledge Fuels Yurok and Karuk Habitat Restoration Project With USDA"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/02/traditional-knowledge-fuels-yurok-and-karuk-habitat-restoration-project-usda-158099", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-12-02T22:15-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Traditional Knowledge Fuels Yurok and Karuk Habitat Restoration Project With USDA"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea1f\"", "article_summary": "The Karuk and Yurok Tribes traditionally managed entire watersheds and ecosystems on their ancestral lands to meet their dietary, cultural and spiritual needs.\n\u201cWise use of fire will enable both the Yurok and the Karuk Tribes to incorporate many other traditional management techniques into forest restoration as well,\u201d said Yurok Heritage Preservation Officer Bob McConnell in the statement.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been given clear instructions for caring for our relations; the earth, fire, water, the sky,\u201d said Lisa Hillman, Karuk Tribe\u2019s Food Security Coordinator, in the USDA statement.\nIt may sound counterintuitive, but the Yurok and Karuk tribes, experts at managing watersheds and ecosystems, are working with several agencies in California to manage forests in their traditional territories and thus restore habitat that supports Native plants and wildlife.\nThe Tribes are now working to reestablish the once rich and bio-diverse ecology of their ancestral homeland forests and waterways using traditional agroforestry management systems."}
