But the senator\u2019s preoccupation with the mega-donating business titans may have gotten him into some trouble, as one taxpayer-funded post to his website could have landed Reid in some ethically dirty water.\n\nFor the last several weeks, the Kochs have been the two people Reid loves to hate, and the Senate Majority Leader has made bashing the brothers his hobby \u2013 from the Senate floor.\n\nBut while Reid\u2019s rants raised the eyebrows of political pundits and poll-watchers alike for several days \u2014 a George Washington University Battleground Poll found that a majority of Americans have no clue who the Koch brothers are \u2014 his diatribes have persisted.\n\nThe Kochs first became Reid\u2019s obsessive target after an ad from the organization Americans for Prosperity \u2014 a nonprofit funded by the brothers \u2014 aired in Michigan. The ad featured a woman named Julie Boonstra, a cancer patient who said she lost her health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, and called on Michigan residents to oust Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who is running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe ad did not make Reid happy.\n\nThe Nevada Democrat took to the Senate floor in February to denounce the ad \u2014 and the Koch brothers \u2014 and said that all Obamacare \u201chorror stories\u201d are \u201cuntrue.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Reid took to his Twitter account to rant about the brothers, saying that they were trying to deceive Americans about Obamacare.\n\nThe Koch Brothers are spending millions of dollars to deceive Americans about Obamacare. http://t.co/va4QH1glQb \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) February 26, 2014\n\nThe American people need to know about the distortions that the Kochs are trying to spread: http://t.co/kfec2Jdqa8 \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) February 26, 2014\n\nLess than a week later, Reid continued his crusade to bring down the Koch brothers. Speaking on the Senate floor, the Senate Majority Leader tried out a Koch-pun, saying that \u201cRepublicans are addicted to Koch.\u201d\n\nReid criticized his colleagues on the other side of the aisle for taking millions from the brothers.\n\nBut no Reid-rant would be complete without accompanying Twitter posts.\n\nIt's un-American when shadowy billionaires pour unlimited money into our democracy to rig the system for themselves and the wealthiest 1%. \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) March 4, 2014\n\nThe Kochs\u2019 extreme vision for America means abolishing Social Security and eliminating minimum wage laws. http://t.co/7rklSf3Dxm \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) March 4, 2014\n\nThe Senate Majority Leader even went so far as to draft an entire memo about the Koch brothers\u2019 \u201cradical agenda\u201d and attempted to spread the #AddictedtoKoch hashtag after Republicans came to the pair\u2019s defense.\n\nAs Senate Democrats took to the Senate floor on March 11 to discuss climate change, Reid found a way to denounce the brothers there, too.\n\nIt's time to stop acting like deniers \u2013 like the Koch brothers and those addicted to them \u2013 have a valid point of view. #Up4Climate \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) March 10, 2014\n\nHe then created and published a video centered on his \u201cAddicted to Koch\u201d theme, which included Republicans standing up for the brothers, and blamed the duo for the Senate\u2019s failure to pass benefits for Ukrainians and unemployment.\n\nA recess in the Senate brought an end \u2014 temporarily \u2014 to Reid\u2019s journey to end the Koch brothers. But as March turned to April, he got right back in the saddle.\n\nReid criticized Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s (R-Wis.) budget resolution for being a \u201cblueprint of modern Kochtopia.\u201d\n\nAnd, in his most recent stunt, Reid took his spot behind the podium on the Senate floor once again to request Republicans in Congress wear Koch brothers insignia, much in the same way NASCAR drivers wear the logos of their corporate sponsors (via POLITICO).\n\nReid even went so far as to commission a mockup of just what the Koch-wearing congressmen would look like.\n\nKlassy.\n\nBut one of Reid\u2019s anti-Koch actions may have violated Senate ethics rules, the Washington Examiner reported Thursday.\n\nRemember that memo outlining the Koch brothers\u2019 \u201cradical\u201d agenda? According to the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, \u201cpartisan\u201d material on members\u2019 websites is prohibited, as the sites are publicly funded. The post, which was displayed on the senator\u2019s homepage, was moved to a different page after the Examiner prodded.\n\n\u201cOfficial websites are paid for and supported by official funds,\u201d Rob Walker, former staff director for the House and Senate ethics committees, told the Examiner. \u201cOfficial funds are to be used under the terms of which they were appropriated to use for official purposes only. So you can\u2019t use official websites for campaign or partisan political purposes.\u201d\n\nLooks like Reid\u2019s Koch-fueled rage may have gotten him in a bit of trouble.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has been in a Koch-fueled rage, seizing moments left and right (mostly from the left) to bash Charles and David Koch.", "title": "Documenting Harry Reid's Koch-fueled meltdown - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/Harry-Reid-600x384.jpg", "height": 384}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/04/10/harry-reids-koch-brothers-meltdown/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "unemployment-insurance", "published_time": "2014-04-10T13:59:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-10T15:06:13+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7bd\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) March 4, 2014The Kochs\u2019 extreme vision for America means abolishing Social Security and eliminating minimum wage laws.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has been in a Koch-fueled rage, seizing moments left and right (mostly from the left) to bash Charles and David Koch.\nhttp://t.co/va4QH1glQb \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) February 26, 2014The American people need to know about the distortions that the Kochs are trying to spread: http://t.co/kfec2Jdqa8 \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) February 26, 2014Less than a week later, Reid continued his crusade to bring down the Koch brothers.\nIt's time to stop acting like deniers \u2013 like the Koch brothers and those addicted to them \u2013 have a valid point of view.\nA recess in the Senate brought an end \u2014 temporarily \u2014 to Reid\u2019s journey to end the Koch brothers."}
