Why waste our time and yours on what was shaping up as a coronation? But the ongoing and far-from-finished scandal around Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a secret home email server as secretary of state casts things in a new light. We have much more on the scandal below, but the political takeaway is fairly straightforward: her cloak of inevitability is torn. Whether as an actual rival or as a life raft for their party\u2019s presidential hopes should Clinton sink herself, Democrats increasingly want and need alternatives. And so, we give you our inaugural Democratic 2016 Power Index.\n\n\n\n1) HILLARY CLINTON\n\nToday is a perfect encapsulation of Clinton\u2019s campaign: big resources that bring big troubles. Clinton\u2019s controversial family foundation will be acting as an extension of her campaign as it celebrates a speech Clinton gave 20 years ago in China on women\u2019s rights with a dense report, public events and speeches by the candidate. Of course, since the foundation funds its work partly through gifts from countries that repress women as part of official policy, it does get a little icky. She will again be appearing in public but again failing to address the email scandal beyond an impossibly Clintonian tweet on the topic. So she gets a huge boost on visibility on her central campaign theme \u2013 that it\u2019s time for a female president \u2013 but the means by which she paid for the platform create controversy of their own.\n\n\n\n[\u201cWhat I would like, is for her to come forward and say just what the situation is because she is the preeminent political figure right now. I think from this point on the silence is going to hurt her.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d]\n\n\n\n2) JOE BIDEN\n\nThe vice president is kind of a hot mess. He boldly makes untrue statements. He nape-nuzzles other men\u2019s wives in public. He\u2019s 72, but lacks any of the campaign discipline that decades in public life ought to have brought him. And yet, he\u2019s the single biggest threat to Hillary Clinton and the automatic frontrunner if he decides to run. Aside from having Air Force Two and near-universal name recognition, he can make the best claim to Democrats for protecting and defending President Obama\u2019s legacy. And plus, the press loves Biden, a negative since his every gaffe would be amplified but a positive since he would have the best platform to call Clinton out. The two were consistently at odds during their time in the administration, and he would surely make a potent prosecutor of her claims of foreign policy expertise.\n\n\n\n[The Atlantic: \u201cThere\u2019s only one prominent Democratic contender who has traveled to all three early presidential primary states so far in 2015. It\u2019s not Hillary Clinton. Nor is it Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or even Martin O\u2019Malley.\u201d]\n\n\n\n3) ELIZABETH WARREN\n\nThe freshman senator from Massachusetts says she\u2019s not running for president, but she and thousands of her supporters say they just want Hillary Clinton to move to the left and be a \u201cprogressive warrior.\u201d But that\u2019s an empty threat without the means to punish Clinton if she doesn\u2019t oblige. Warren, who has had an audience with the frontrunner, has shown a reticence to run beyond coyness in recent weeks. It is helpful to appear not overly ambitious, but too much resistance will cause supporters to look elsewhere. Warren boasts the advantage of a campaign in waiting, but time is running out for her to make a long-shot run. While she might do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, to avoid being road-kill under the Clinton machine in the rest of the primaries, Warren needs to get busy. If she can get rolling, though, her zeal and authenticity could make her the Democratic heartthrob in a flash. Unlike Biden, Warren would also be a history-making nominee.\n\n\n\n[Union label - Warren and Biden both address the International Association of Firefighters today in Washington.]\n\n\n\n4) MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY\n\nYou can\u2019t win the game if you don\u2019t suit up and show up, and therein lies former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s cardinal advantage as a candidate. Unlike the others, he is actually on the trail and looking for donors and support. O\u2019Malley is little known and isn\u2019t broadly identified with any particular message, but as the very liberal former governor of a very liberal state, he has many policy points to please Democrats unhappy about the idea of veering from Obama\u2019s domestic doctrine. Campaigning in New Hampshire this weekend, O\u2019Malley demurred when questioned about Clinton\u2019s sketchy email account. If O\u2019Malley wants to be more than a running-mate in waiting, he will have to draw deeper distinctions with the frontrunner to show he\u2019s serious.\n\n\n\n5) JIM WEBB\n\nCandidates who are running against their parties don\u2019t usually fare well, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb looks to be no exception. Webb\u2019s cry is that Democrats have to restore faith with the blue-collar white voters who once were the party\u2019s backbone. And while he has a point to make about economic populism, and the deep embrace by Clinton of Wall Street, on the rest of the party\u2019s issue set, he is a man out of time. Whether it is abortion or gun rights, Democrats made their collective choice against the party\u2019s former base decades ago and won\u2019t be coming back.\n\n\n\nOver the horizon - Suppose Hillary Clinton actually imploded and dropped out of the race. Who else might consider a run and could reasonably get a campaign together on the double. Some names to watch would include Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Gov. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y.\n\n\n\n[What would you say? - Give us your take on the Dem field and we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House select committee investigating Benghazi, said that there is a period of missing Hillary Clinton emails from her time as secretary of State spanning several months. \u2018There are gaps of months, and months and months,\u2019 Gowdy said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u2018Face the Nation.\u2019 \u2018If you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya \u2013 she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand \u2013 we have no emails from that day. In fact, we have no emails from that trip,\u2019 Gowdy said\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nOn your own, Hill - \"If they screwed up on the emails, if we find out they skipped over her emails . . . then that will be a problem for them, it\u2019ll be a scandal.

Jeb\u2019s tougher push and the biggest threat to his overall nomination remains winning over the social conservative and libertarian wing of the party. A point that stretches beyond Iowa\u2019s corn fields and is underlined in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which found a divide among conservative GOP primary voters with \u201c48% saying that could see themselves backing Mr. Bush and 45% saying they couldn\u2019t.\u201d But the biggest concern for Bush remains the durability (so far) of conservative support for Gov. Scott Walker. To win, Bush needs conservatives divided in their loyalties and for his potential top rivals to keep pulling each other down the ladder.\n\n\n\n[Des Moines Register: \u201cBush did six events plus several one-on-one meetings in two markets \u2014 Des Moines and Cedar Rapids \u2014 in 24 hours.

Did you commute to work in the dark again? Not surprising since the government mandated that you wake up an hour earlier this morning (and every day until Nov. 1). The rationale for the creation and expansion of Daylight Savings Time was to save energy. The original idea was said to be Ben Franklin\u2019s, but it became part of the mainstream American experience under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Wilson famously tried to keep the regime in place after the war, but Congress overruled him, even overriding his veto. The practice returned during World War II and was maintained by some local governments after the war. The time-shifters fought and won a long battle, eventually pushing through legislation in 1966 that required states to adopt uniform standards and gave the federal government authority over starting and stopping Daylight Savings Time. Today, every state except Arizona and Hawaii obeys. But does it work? Nope. WaPo passes along a study from time-zone-crazy Indiana that revealed that the shift wastes energy. Why? Because whatever electricity people are saving by having more sunlight in the evening is outstripped by the energy used for heating in the chillier, earlier mornings and cooling in the evening.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
