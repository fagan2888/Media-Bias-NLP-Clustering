A constant theme of the 2016 Democratic nomination race popped up again Sunday on ABC’s This Week: the massive enthusiasm for Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) compared to the tepid crowds and poor honesty numbers for frontrunner Hillary Clinton.

Panelist and author John Heilemann said the Clinton campaign should be worried about the numbers Sanders is drawing, such as the 15,000 people who came out to see him Saturday in Washington.

“You cannot look at the enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders and not be worried if you’re the Clinton campaign, and you can’t look at her internal numbers, especially on honest and trustworthy … He could beat her in Iowa,” Heilemann said. “He could beat her in New Hampshire.”

Clinton’s own campaign has acknowledged this possibility, something that seemed unthinkable when the race began. A recent poll showed Sanders just six points behind Clinton in New Hampshire, and Iowa is the site of Clinton’s crushing loss to Barack Obama in 2008 that began the latter’s catapult to the nomination.

Heilemann said he felt Sanders couldn’t beat Clinton in the long haul but added it would be terrible for her campaign if Sanders managed to top her in those early states.

Democratic strategist and Clinton supporter Donna Brazile acknowledged the impact Sanders is having.

“Bernie Sanders is really hot,” she said. “He’s hot right now. Hot in terms of the passion of the Democratic Party, the passion of independents.“

She went on to say she felt Clinton would re-gain the momentum she’s lost since her announcement during the Democratic debates. The first one is scheduled for Oct. 13 in Nevada, and both Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley have criticized the lack of debate opportunities against the front-running Clinton.
