Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said on Saturday that he doesn’t know whether President Obama is a Christian, repeating a response that sparked a firestorm months ago.

“I don’t know,” the 2016 Republican presidential candidate said at the biannual Koch brothers donor network conference in Dana Point, Calif., according to Time magazine , when asked whether he has tried to find out.

“I presume he is,” he added

Walker drew criticism in February after saying in separate interviews that he doesn't know if President Obama loves America or if he is a Christian.

"I don't know," Walker told The Washington Post when asked if Obama is a Christian.

“I’ve actually never talked about it or I haven’t read about that,” Walker added.

Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster later clarified Walker's February remarks.

“Of course the governor thinks the president is a Christian,” she said. “He thinks these kinds of gotcha questions distract from what he’s doing as governor of Wisconsin to make the state better and make life better for people in his state.”

“As someone who is a believer myself, I don’t presume to know someone’s beliefs about whether they follow Christ or not unless I’ve actually talked with him,” Walker said on Saturday, according to Time.

“He said he is, and I take him at his word.”
