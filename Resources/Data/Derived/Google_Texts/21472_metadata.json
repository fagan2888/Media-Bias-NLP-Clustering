Now the question is, \"what next?\"\n\nIn the past, newly elected majorities have been tempted to try and pass as many bills as possible in the first 100 days. This strategy implies that the GOP majority will be a failure unless they immediately vote to reverse every single policy mistake from the last six years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t fall into this trap. Instead, they should carefully develop a strategy for the three areas that have the biggest impact on the economy and that Americans care most about: Promoting patient-centered health care reform, ending the Obama administration\u2019s economically disastrous energy policies, and bringing fiscal sanity to the federal budget.\n\nThese are Americans for Prosperity\u2019s core issues, and for good reason: the American people said that healthcare and the economy were the most important issues in the election. We saw that first-hand over the past twelve months. In key battleground states, we spent the last year talking and listening to Americans about what they see\u2014and what they want\u2014in Washington. During this time, we knocked on 2.5 million doors and made some 7 million phone calls, connecting with Americans who want a change in Washington.\n\nWe learned that Americans want an effective and accountable government that maximizes personal freedom and facilitates economic growth. That\u2019s not what they see in Washington\u2019s recent track record.\n\nTake the example of health care. ObamaCare is still wildly unpopular\u2014the latest poll shows that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of it and only 36 percent like it, a whopping 19 point difference. Why? Because it empowered government bureaucrats at the expense of individuals and families. It cancels Americans\u2019 health care plans, forces us to buy insurance we may not want or may not be able to afford, and empowers the IRS to penalize us if we don\u2019t follow Washington\u2019s orders\u2014all this while spiking costs and limiting choice. Passing legislation to repeal harmful policies like the medical device tax and the individual mandate is a first step in alleviating these problems.\n\nCongress should also pursue health care reforms that promote better health for individuals and families, not just universal health insurance. This means leaving some issues to state legislatures and governors, which know their states\u2019 health needs better than bureaucrats in Washington. It means removing bureaucratic impediments to innovation so lifesaving medicines and devices can make it to the market. And it means eliminating the regulations that restrict individuals\u2019 health care choices and increase costs. Ultimately, every reform should give individuals and families more control over their own health care.\n\nCongress should adopt the same approach with energy policy. The administration\u2019s regulatory agenda is harming the economy and hurting Americans\u2019 quality of life without actually helping the environment.\n\nAfter President Obama failed to convince Congress to pass his global warming agenda in his first term, he directed the Environmental Protection Agency to do the job instead. The agency has since released dozens of costly regulation, most notably a preliminary rule that will lower the country\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent over the next 15 years. A recent study found that this would shutter enough electricity generation to power 44 million homes, threatening the reliability of our electricity system, causing double digit percentage increases in electricity bills for our citizens and costing consumers and businesses at least $41 billion a year in higher prices and lower incomes.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: The environment won\u2019t be better off. A climate model developed and funded by the EPA predicts that the regulation will only prevent 0.02 degrees Celsius in global warming over the next 85 years. That paltry improvement isn\u2019t worth the cost that consumers will pay at the pump, in their bills, and at the store.\n\nCongress should curtail the EPA\u2019s actions and empower states, not the federal government, to protect the environment in a way that serves their unique interests and natural resources. Congress should also recognize that innovations in technology and energy generation, not government mandates, are the best long-term solution to future environmental improvement. Such innovation won\u2019t happen if the Obama administration\u2019s energy policies survive.\n\nFinally, Washington must address the runaway government spending that\u2019s handicapping America\u2019s economic growth. Whether it\u2019s the hundreds of duplicative and unnecessary federal programs, billions in subsidies and handouts for special interests, or a record national debt of nearly $18 trillion, every American knows that D.C. isn\u2019t spending our hard-earned taxpayer money wisely. Federal tax revenues in fiscal 2014 hit a new record of $3.013 trillion\u2014yet Washington lawmakers claim they still don\u2019t have enough. Instead of bringing America closer to bankruptcy, Congress should pass balanced budgets that reform wasteful and inefficient programs. Taxpayers can\u2019t afford to keep funding a boom in Washington that\u2019s a bust for the middle class.\n\nEnding Washington\u2019s spending binge will also boost the economy. While bureaucrats and Wall Street have seen a windfall in recent years, average Americans are still bringing home less income than before the recession. In the coming weeks, Americans for Prosperity will spell out specific economic policy goals for Congress to tackle over the next two years.\n\nAnd we will hold Republicans accountable on this issue. They must present Obama with a federal budget that cuts waste, reforms federal programs, and fixes our broken tax code. If they can\u2019t do this, it will send a message to the American public that no one in Washington is serious about reform. Americans are sick of the disastrous over-spending from the past two Presidents\u2014Washington must finally practice the same responsible spending habits as the taxpayers who pay D.C.\u2019s bills.\n\nThe American public chose a new direction on November 4. They repudiated the Obama administration\u2019s failed big government policies and Harry Reid Harry ReidPuerto Rico debt relief faces serious challenges in Senate McCain files B amendment to boost defense spending Dems to GOP: Cancel Memorial Day break MORE\u2019s inaction in the Senate. Now it falls on Republicans to push positive reforms in the areas that Americans care most about. Americans for Prosperity will hold Congress accountable every step of the way\u2014we won\u2019t let Washington ignore what Americans told us in the build-up to Election Day.\n\nPhillips is the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy organization.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The American people said that healthcare and the economy were the most important issues in the election.", "description": "The American people said that healthcare and the economy were the most important issues in the election.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The American people said that healthcare and the economy were the most important issues in the election.", "title": "What Washington should focus on in 2015", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/224238-what-washington-should-focus-on-in-2015", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/224238-what-washington-should-focus-on-in-2015", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-16T09:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Tim Phillips", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-16T09:00:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Harry Reid,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/224238-what-washington-should-focus-on-in-2015", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The American people said that healthcare and the economy were the most important issues in the election.", "card": "summary", "title": "What Washington should focus on in 2015"}, "dcterms.title": "What Washington should focus on in 2015"}, "article_summary": "Now it falls on Republicans to push positive reforms in the areas that Americans care most about.\nCongress should also pursue health care reforms that promote better health for individuals and families, not just universal health insurance.\nAnd it means eliminating the regulations that restrict individuals\u2019 health care choices and increase costs.\nIn key battleground states, we spent the last year talking and listening to Americans about what they see\u2014and what they want\u2014in Washington.\nThis means leaving some issues to state legislatures and governors, which know their states\u2019 health needs better than bureaucrats in Washington."}
