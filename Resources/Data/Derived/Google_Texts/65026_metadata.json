The fees were often buried on subscribers' bills, though, and difficult for them to spot.\n\n\u201cThis should have and in fact did ring alarm bells at AT&T,\u201d Ramirez said, yet the company did nothing to stop the charges and in fact made it more difficult to get a refund, she claimed.\n\n\u201cFor too long, consumers have been charged on their phone bills for things they did not buy,\u201d FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis $105 million settlement is going to put money back into the wallets of consumers who were victimized by the practice,\u201d he added. \u201cMillions of AT&T customers will be able to reclaim moneys that were fraudulently taken out of their pockets.\u201d\n\nThe settlement is the largest ever FCC enforcement action, the largest ever cramming settlement and the first joint enforcement action of the FCC, FTC and the nation\u2019s attorneys general.\n\nAn AT&T spokesman said the company employed \u201crigorous protections\u201d to protect people from unauthorized charges, and in December agreed to stop billing people for third-party texting services,\n\n\u201cThis settlement gives our customers who believe they were wrongfully billed for [messaging] services the ability to get a refund,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nRegulators have been putting a new focus on cramming in recent months. Wednesday\u2019s action was the seventh the FTC has announced since last year.\n\nThe FTC has leveled similar charges against T-Mobile, but the company has fought back and accused the agency of taking a \u201csensationalized legal action.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, about 20 million people a year are charged unauthorized fees on their cellphone bill, Wheeler said.\n\n\u201cStay tuned about the other wireless providers,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition to the monetary payment, AT&T has also agreed to notify all of its customers about the settlement and their options for a refund. It has also committed to obtaining customers\u2019 permission before adding any other companies\u2019 charges to their phone bills in the future.\n\nEarlier this year, the Senate Commerce Committee released a report blasting the \u201cwidespread\u201d practice of bogus cellphone charges.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jay Rockefeller Jay RockefellerLobbying world Overnight Tech: Senators place holds on FCC commissioner Overnight Tech: Senate panel to vote on Dem FCC commissioner MORE (D-W.Va.) congratulated the two agencies on Wednesday\u2019s action and told them to stay on watch.\n\n\u201cSelf-regulation has proved ineffective at protecting consumers against both landline and wireless cramming, and I urge the enforcement community to remain vigilant as third-party wireless billing practices continue to evolve,\u201d Rockefeller said in a statement.\n\nThis story was updated at 12:53 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The company will also pay $25 million in penalties and fees.", "description": "The company will also pay $25 million in penalties and fees.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The company will also pay $25 million in penalties and fees.", "title": "AT&T to pay $80 million in cellphone refunds", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220137-att-to-pay-105-million-over-cellphone-charges", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220137-att-to-pay-105-million-over-cellphone-charges", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-08T12:06-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, cramming,Jay Rockefeller,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-08T12:06:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220137-att-to-pay-105-million-over-cellphone-charges", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The company will also pay $25 million in penalties and fees.", "card": "summary", "title": "AT&T to pay $80 million in cellphone refunds"}, "dcterms.title": "AT&T to pay $80 million in cellphone refunds"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb8f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis $105 million settlement is going to put money back into the wallets of consumers who were victimized by the practice,\u201d he added.\nAT&T has agreed to pay $105 million to settle changes that it illegally billed millions of customers for charges they never requested and didn\u2019t want.\nADVERTISEMENTIn addition to those refunds, the wireless giant will pay $20 million in penalties and fees to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and $5 million to the FCC.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) jointly announced the settlement on Wednesday, which will result in $80 million worth of refunds to customers who were unfairly charged, the agencies said.\n\u201cToday\u2019s settlement... underscores the time-tested principle of consumer protection,\u201d FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a press conference announcing the settlement."}
