An early morning fire at the Denver Diner sent employees and customers into the street, and burned through the roof, but there were no serious injures Sunday.

The Denver Fire Department responded to a call from the 24-hour Diner at Speer Boulevard and Colfax Avenue at 1:38 a.m., Department spokesman Mark Watson said.

Two firefighters suffered minor injuries while fighting the blaze and were taken to a hospital for observation, Watson said.

The fire appears to have started in the kitchen area, Watson said.

“The bulk was in the roof and kitchen area. It took about 25 minutes to get under control.”

The fire is under investigation but arson is not suspected.

“There is significant damage to the kitchen area and roof,” Watson said.
