PETERSBURG, Florida \u2014 When a Florida jury awarded $115 million to Hulk Hogan, Gawker Media\u2019s head honcho signaled that he had seen the ruling coming.\n\nMoments after the verdict was announced Friday night, the company\u2019s founder Nick Denton issued a statement saying he \u201cknew the appeals court will need to resolve the case.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Gawker had long assumed that the jury, selected from the area where Hogan grew up and currently lives, might be inclined to rule in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. But the verdict clearly sent shockwaves through the company. One senior source at Gawker conceded it was \u201cmuch worse than anybody expected.\u201d\n\nGawker\u2019s enemies celebrated the ruling, which appeared to bring financial ruin to an online news organization they would prefer to see vanquished from cyberspace.\n\nBut it might be premature to dance on Gawker\u2019s grave. Attorneys for the company are confident that they can land a more favorable decision on appeal, and many legal experts agree.\n\nAt first glance, the $115 million ruling does indeed look apocalyptic for Gawker.\n\nDenton, for his part, certainly never took the case lightly. The spectre of the lawsuit is what prompted him to sell a minority stake in Gawker earlier this year, a first for a company that had been proudly independent.\n\nHogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, had sued Denton, former Gawker.com editor A.J. Daulerio and the site\u2019s parent company for $100 million over the publication of excerpts from his sex tape in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t keep $100 million in the bank, no,\u201d Denton said last summer.\n\nThe six-person jury \u2014 comprising four women and two men \u2014 decided to award Hogan $15 million more than that. The amount could possibly swell. Those same jurors will return to the St. Petersburg, Florida courthouse on Monday to determine whether to impose punitive damages.\n\nComplicating the matter for Gawker is a Florida state law that requires appealing parties to post a bond for the full amount of monetary damages. That requirement is capped at $50 million, a burden that would obviously still be onerous to Gawker. Denton told Politico Media last year that the company made $6.7 million of profit on $45 million of net revenue in 2014.\n\nGawker will likely appeal the bond, but eschewing the requirement might be tricky.\n\n\u201cI would expect that this issue will be litigated, and they might receive some relief, but in the end if a Florida jury finds them liable a Florida judge really has no reason to treat them with kid gloves on the issue of the bond,\u201d said Charles H. Rose III, the director of Stetson University College of Law\u2019s Center for Excellence in Advocacy in Gulfport, Florida.\n\nTo avoid posting the bond \u2014 or at least to get it substantially reduced \u2014 Gawker will first need to ask the judge who presided over the trial, Pamela Campbell.\n\nCampbell has repeatedly ruled against Gawker throughout the case, raising doubts that she will grant relief from the bond requirement. Assuming she doesn\u2019t, Gawker will then turn to the Second District Court of Appeals, which has been a far more hospitable venue to the defendants than Campbell\u2019s court.\n\nThe appeals court, based in Lakeland, Florida, has already reversed a number of Campbell\u2019s rulings in the case, most notably her 2013 injunction requiring Gawker to remove the video. Earlier this week, the court overturned Campbell\u2019s previous ruling to seal an enormous number documents pertaining to the case. Gawker believes those records could well have tilted the trial in its favor, and will bolster its chances on appeal.\n\nMark Spottswood, an assistant professor at Florida State University\u2019s college of law, said that past rulings from the appeals court suggest Hogan \u201cmay still have an uphill battle\u201d to collect the damages.\n\nThe court has indicated it\u2019s sympathetic to Gawker\u2019s position: that the publication of excerpts from the tape is protected by the First Amendment due in part to how much Hogan talked about his sex life in public..\n\nFor example, the court said in a 2014 opinion it was \u201cclear\u201d that Gawker\u2019s video and accompanying commentary addressed \u201cmatters of public concern\u201d due to the controversy surrounding the sex tape, which was partly \u201cexacerbated\u201d by Hogan himself.\n\nLen Niehoff, a professor who specializes in civil procedure at the University of Michigan Law School, said a losing party in Gawker\u2019s position will generally ask for both a stay of judgment and an appeal.\n\nIn cases that implicate the First Amendment, Niehoff said stays play an important role because \u201cappellate courts typically have a duty to review the result very carefully.\u201d\n\nNiehoff said the verdict has potential to set a \u201cdangerous\u201d precedent \u201cwhere a celebrity can make his sexual exploits an open book then sue for invasion of privacy when a media entity wants to add a chapter.\u201d\n\nThat could loom large in the case\u2019s next chapter.\n\n\u201cI think that Gawker\u2019s central argument has substantial legal appeal, even if a jury doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d Niehoff said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ST.
