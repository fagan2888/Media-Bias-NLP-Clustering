This will be the eighth major budget commission since 2010. Until now, every single one of them has failed for the same reason: taxes. And if nothing changes, this one will fail too.\n\nBut something should change: Democrats should admit the obvious. For the time being, they\u2019ve lost on taxes. And you know what? That\u2019s okay. At least, it could be, if they were willing to admit it and smartly negotiate the terms of their surrender.\n\nFor Democrats, the idea behind sequestration -- the across-the-board spending cuts that came about from the 2011 debt-ceiling debate -- was that the defense cuts would be so objectionable to Republicans that it would force them to cut a deal that raised taxes.\n\nDemocrats made a mistake. Protecting defense spending isn\u2019t a top priority for today\u2019s Republican Party. There are exceptions among the old guard, of course. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham hate sequestration. Appropriators like Rep. Hal Rogers desperately want it lifted. But the old guard long ago lost control of the Republican Party. The Obama administration is much more anxious over the defense cuts than your average House Republican.\n\nMost elected Republicans see sequestration as a huge victory for them. So do crucial unelected Republicans. \u201cSequester is the big win,\u201d Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and the enforcer of the Republican anti-tax pledge, said. \u201cIt defines the decade.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat's Congress going to do about the meat-ax cuts we're facing? Who knows! (Flickr / Martin Cathrae)\n\nRefusing to raise taxes is what it means to be a Republican\n\nIt\u2019s not that Republicans like sequestration\u2019s cuts. They loathe them. The policy takes an ax to the one part of government where Republicans like to spend -- defense -- and exempts Social Security, Medicaid, food stamps, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies and Medicare beneficiaries. That is to say, it exempts pretty much every program that Republicans think is to blame for the debt while slashing away at the one governmental function Republicans actually admire.\n\nBut it does one thing Republicans love: It locks in $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction without a dime in new tax revenue. And they intend to hold onto that win for dear life.\n\nTo put it plainly, Democrats aren\u2019t going to persuade Republicans to lift sequestration in return for a mix of entitlement cuts and tax increases. It doesn\u2019t matter that those tax increases will come in the form of ending certain tax breaks. It doesn\u2019t matter that Paul Ryan\u2019s budget said these tax expenditures are \u201csimilar to government spending.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that raising taxes on the rich is popular.\n\nAt this point, the Republican opposition to taxes has nothing to do with policy. It has nothing to do with the economy. It\u2019s religion. It\u2019s dogma. It\u2019s identity. Refusing to raise taxes is what it means to be a Republican in this day and age.\n\nThe worst mistake Democrats could make would be to become the mirror image of Republicans on the tax issue. Republicans are cannibalizing everything they care about -- defense, deficit reduction, their chances of retaking the Senate -- to keep taxes low. The Republican obsession with taxes is an opportunity for Democrats to exploit, not an example for them to mimic.\n\nThe core question for the American economy isn\u2019t taxes. Or spending. It\u2019s growth. That\u2019s true even if all you\u2019re worried about is the deficit. As Larry Summers wrote, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s numbers suggest that \u201can increase of just 0.2 percent in annual growth would entirely eliminate the projected long-term budget gap.\u201d\n\nThe budget debate, in other words, should be a growth debate. And Democrats\u2019 top priority shouldn\u2019t be higher taxes. It should be growth -- and, to be sure, the distribution of that growth.\n\nThink how happy you two could be! (Olivier Douliery/ABACAUSA.com)\n\nThree reasons Democrats should abandon taxes\n\nWhen the budget commission sits down, Democrats should expand the playing field.\n\nFirst, they should realize that sequestration is the best opportunity they\u2019ll ever have to cut defense spending, and that a dollar in defense cuts is exactly as effective as a dollar in new revenue at relieving pressure on social services. Why Democrats have decided that cutting the incentives rich people have to donate to charity, buy big homes or live in blue states is so much better than cutting defense spending escapes me.\n\nSecond, Democrats should realize the objective need for tax increases is less than it was in 2011. As they note, the deficit has fallen, and fast. Health-care costs are down. The CBO\u2019s budget projections are much sunnier than they were a few years ago. Democrats like to argue that this makes the Republicans\u2019 monomaniacal pursuit of spending cuts a bit ridiculous. But it does the same to their insistence on tax increases.\n\nThird, they should see their leverage clearly: Republicans badly want entitlement cuts, but they don\u2019t want them enough to trade for taxes. They badly want to replace sequestration, but not enough to trade for taxes. And they badly want tax reform -- but, again, not enough to trade for higher taxes.\n\nOne answer to that is to keep sequestration in place until something changes. That\u2019s basically the answer Democrats have come up with. But it\u2019s a terrible answer. It\u2019s bad for growth, bad for government, and bad for the people who depend on government programs.\n\nDemocrats should use their leverage to get something they actually want. Immigration reform and infrastructure investment are obvious places to start. They mean vastly more to the economy and to people\u2019s lives than slightly higher taxes on rich people. And they\u2019re things that many in the Republican Party want, too.\n\nThere\u2019s precedent for these kinds of wide-lens deals: The 1997 Balanced Budget Act was all spending cuts, but part of the bargain was that Republicans agreed to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nToday\u2019s Republican Party might simply say no to these kinds of broader deals. If so, then at least Democrats tried every compromise possible, and it\u2019s that much clearer that Republicans simply refuse to make any concessions at all.\n\nBut if Democrats don\u2019t try because they refuse to admit that sequestration was a strategic error, and taxes aren\u2019t going to go up for the next few years -- well, that\u2019ll just mean piling one mistake on top of another.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sorry, Democrats, but you've lost on taxes.
