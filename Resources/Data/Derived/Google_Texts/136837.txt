In case you missed it…..

An interesting tidbit about Obamacare showed up in the pages of The New York Times over the weekend — namely that prison inmates are signing up for the newly minted health insurance program in droves.

The story points out that single and childless inmates who spend more than 24 hours in the prison infirmary are eligible to have major costs covered under Medicaid, thus allowing states to transfer those costs to the federal government.

Then, when those inmates are released from jail, they can maintain that coverage when they are released — particularly useful among a group that has a high rate of disease, mental illness and addictions and often meets the low-income requirements, or 138% of the poverty level.

Roughly 35% of those now eligible for Medicaid under new provisions of the Affordable Care Act are those with a criminal record and have spent time in jail, the story says. That could help reduce recidivism, some experts say, though opponents of the health-care law are likely to use the finding as another reason to be against the initiative.
