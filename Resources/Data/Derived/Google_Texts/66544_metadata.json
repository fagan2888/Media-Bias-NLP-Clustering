The USCCB noted the rule\u2019s insufficient legislative support and the likelihood that it \u201cwould infringe upon the religious and moral convictions of health care providers, insurers, and other stakeholders\u201d in comments submitted jointly with nine other organizations, including representatives from the National Association of Evangelicals, the National Catholic Bioethics Center, Family Research Council and the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, among others.\n\nAs it stands, the proposed HHS rule will not immediately affect religious schools and colleges because the rule is implementing a part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d that only regulates health facilities and programs, Scruggs told the Newman Society. But that does not mean that religious institutions are out of the woods yet.\n\n\u201c[T]he rule could apply to hospitals or programs run by universities, like a Catholic hospital,\u201d he suggested.\n\nUnder the proposed regulations, an employer involved in health services who also receives financial aid could be required to \u201ccover some services related to gender transition in the health plan that it offers to its own employees\u201d or even violate a nursing home patient\u2019s privacy by forcing them to \u201cshare a bedroom with a member of the opposite sex to whom they are not married,\u201d according to the USCCB comments.\n\nHowever, ADF explained in their comment to HHS that only Congress, not an agency of \u201cunelected administrators,\u201d has the power to reinterpret and expand Obamacare, and the proposed rule will not hold up in court:\n\nHHS provides no bases [sic] for changing Title IX\u2019s long-standing and well-accepted meaning, especially when that change will violate people\u2019s constitutional right to privacy and to religious freedom. The proposed rule, therefore, will lead to unnecessary lawsuits \u2026 and will waste taxpayer dollars in the process. This comment \u2026 proposes that HHS follow a better course for its proposed rule \u2014 actually follow what Title IX says.\n\nIn Canada, Catholic schools are already grappling with transgender and gender identity policies forced upon them by the government, potentially foreshadowing the struggles for U.S. Catholic schools down the road.\n\nOne priest in the Diocese of Saskatoon in Saskatchewan, Canada, told the Newman Society last week that policies or programs embracing gender identity in Catholic schools will \u201cinevitably hurt students who are trying to live the Catholic faith.\u201d\n\nCatholic Education Daily is an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society.
