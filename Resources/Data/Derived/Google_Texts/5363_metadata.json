The Daily Beast's Josh Rogin reports:\n\nThe administration has now reported to Congress three times under the War Powers Resolution about U.S. military force in Iraq; the first report was filed Aug. 8 and the most recent was filed Sept. 1. The reports notified Congress that the U.S. was waging war in Iraq for four distinct reasons: to protect American personnel in Erbil; to save the Yazidi minorities trapped on Mount Sinjar; to protect the Mosul Dam; and to save the people of the Shiite town of Amirli. The War Powers clock expires Oct. 8, with a possible extension to Nov. 8. But the administration could argue that each new notification resets the clock and gives the president ongoing authority to attack in Iraq. To most in Congress, that\u2019s disingenuous at best, because the strikes are all part of the same operation and are all against the same foe in the same country. \u201cIt\u2019s called the War Powers Act, not the Single Attack Powers Act. Technically you are not restarting the 60-day clock,\u201d said a senior Senate aide involved in the debate. During Obama\u2019s war on Libya in 2011, he used military strikes well past the 60- or even 90-day deadline. Then he tried to claim there were no \u201chostilities\u201d in Libya, to nullify the War Powers Resolution. This time around, Obama\u2019s lawyers were more clever. \u201cThe Libya episode taught him the lesson you can trust on 60 to 90 days, so instead they are trying to press the reset button on the clock,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIn the end, the administration wants to hang this on the president\u2019s authority under Article 2 (of the Constitution). The problem is, some of these strikes don\u2019t fall under Article 2.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a legal shell game,\u201d a senior GOP senate aide said.\n\nAnd war isn't the only policy arena where Obama is playing legal shell games to justify his unilateral policy making. At the very same press conference where he promised to destroy the Islamic State, Obama again promised to act unilaterally on immigration. \"My expectation is that fairly soon, I'll be considering what the next steps are,\" Obama said in response to a question about when he will act on the issue.\n\nEarlier reports suggest that the \"next steps\" Obama is considering include granting temporary amnesty to as many as 8 million illegal immigrants. This despite the fact that Obama once told amnesty activists, \"the president doesn\u2019t have the authority to simply ignore Congress and say, we\u2019re not going to enforce the laws that you\u2019ve passed.\"\n\nObama has also indicated that, despite never receiving authorization from Congress, he will also use taxpayers funds to bailout insurance companies that are losing money on Obamacare.\n\nObama never has to face the voters again. Only Congress has the power to check Obama's unprecedented use of executive power through the use of the appropriations process. And there are indications they will do so after November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From war, to immigration, to health care, President Obama is ignoring Congress entirely..05/27/2016 2:05:17AM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "From war, to immigration, to health care, President Obama is ignoring Congress entirely.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Obama Has Declared Himself King", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/09/05/obama-has-declared-himself-king-n1887933", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/248/d11976bd-35f4-4e1f-82cd-9583fa512ad2.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "From war, to immigration, to health care, President Obama is ignoring Congress entirely.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Obama Has Declared Himself King", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/09/05/obama-has-declared-himself-king-n1887933", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/248/d11976bd-35f4-4e1f-82cd-9583fa512ad2.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Has Declared Himself King, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s called the War Powers Act, not the Single Attack Powers Act.\nPresident Obama promised to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d the Islamic State Friday, but do not expect him to ask permission from Congress anytime soon.\nThe War Powers clock expires Oct. 8, with a possible extension to Nov. 8.\nAt the very same press conference where he promised to destroy the Islamic State, Obama again promised to act unilaterally on immigration.\nThen he tried to claim there were no \u201chostilities\u201d in Libya, to nullify the War Powers Resolution."}
