Minorities fought for the privileges of unlimited debate and unfettered amendments protected by the filibuster.\n\nThis time, the Republicans crossed a line. They goaded the Democratic majority into a short-sighted and tragic action. Republicans blocked so many of President Obama\u2019s nominations that Democrats became desperate to \u201cmake the Senate work again.\u201d The argument that President Obama\u2019s appointments of Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Judge Robert Wilkins to fill three existing vacancies on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal amounted to \u201cpacking the court\u201d was blatant and transparently absurd.\n\nThe Democrats used the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d to bulldoze the Senate\u2019s cloture rule at least as it applies to judicial and executive branch nominations. This was accomplished first by voting to take up the reconsideration of the cloture vote on the Millett nomination. Cloture had failed on October 21 by a 55-38 vote. At the time, 60 votes were necessary in order to invoke cloture and end debate. This time, once the Senate voted to reconsider the cloture vote, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) raised a point of order that \u201cthe votes on cloture under Rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote.\u201d The President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) declared, \u201cUnder the rules, the point of order is not sustained.\u201d\n\nThe majority leader appealed the ruling of the chair. Under Senate precedent, an appeal of a ruling related to a cloture vote (even if cloture has not yet been invoked) is a \u201cnon-debatable\u201d matter. This is crucial. If the appeal had been debatable, it could itself have then been filibustered by the Republicans. Since it was not, the Senate majority was able to overturn the presiding officer\u2019s ruling, thus establishing a new precedent in the Senate that cloture to end debate and confirm judicial nominations except for the Supreme Court and executive branch nominees could be accomplished by simple majority votes.\n\nThis was an unprecedented action. Many Democrats, including Majority Leader Reid, maintained that the Senate has changed the effect of rules using this same procedure many times.\n\nHowever, all of those previous occurrences were changes in precedents of a different type. The issue raised by those points of order addressed interpretations of ambiguities in the rules. This \u201cnuclear\u201d action required the Democratic majority to vote to create a new precedent contradicting the clear language of Rule XXII. The Democrats (all but three of them) voted to interpret the words, that the \u201cquestion is decided in the affirmative by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn\u201d as meaning \u201ccloture under rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote.\u201d They voted that three-fifths means simple majority. They voted to declare that black is white. All of the previous decisions were analyzing issues that were grey.\n\nWhat does this change mean for the future of the Senate? Senator Carl Levin during the floor debate said it exactly correctly, \u201cOverruling the ruling of the Chair, as we have now done, by a simple majority is not a one-time action. If a Senate majority demonstrates it can make such a change once, there are no rules which bind a majority, and all future majorities will feel free to exercise the same power\u2014not just on judges and executive appointments but on legislation.\u201d\n\nI do not believe that the elimination of the filibuster for judicial nominations now that the precedent is established can long exclude Supreme Court nominations. The first time that a president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee is filibuster, this precedent will be rolled out and the rule changed.\n\nThe elimination of the filibuster for legislative matters will only await an issue important enough to the Senate majority\u2013 lifting the debt ceiling to avoid default for example or in a Republican Senate, the repeal of Obamacare. In the long run, now that there is a precedent to use this brand new simple majority precedent, majorities will do what majorities do. That is, take control.\n\nBefore long, the Senate will then be a majoritarian body like the House of Representatives tightly controlled by its majority party. In the House, the minority is rarely consulted, speech can be severely limited and amendments are often not permitted at all.\n\nAlthough no senator to my knowledge has been calling for the outright elimination of the filibuster, there are many outside the Senate who do. They argue that democracy is majority rule, so giving complete control to the Senate majority is a good thing. However, democracy requires a balancing of majority rule with the protection of the rights of the minority. The Senate has been unique for more than 200 years in its protection of the privileges of the minority, particularly the rights to debate and to offer amendments.\n\nPast majority leaders of both parties have argued for the protection of these privileges through the right to filibuster. Republican Majority Leader Howard Baker referred to the use of budget procedures to circumvent the filibuster and end debate as a \u201cbreak of faith with the Senate\u2019s historical uniqueness as a forum for the exercise of minority and individual rights.\u201d Republican Bob Dole called the filibuster, \u201c\u2026one of the hallmarks of our Democracy.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Mike Mansfield declared that \u201c[T]hose who complain\u2026 are complaining against\u2026 the ever-present fact of frustration, the frustration of working in this body, the frustration of half a loaf, the frustration of compromise that of necessity is always with us\u2026Yet less than absolute power to achieve one\u2019s will is also an essential of democracy.\u201d Democrat Robert Byrd declared, \u201cThe filibuster has become a target for rebuke in this efficiency-obsessed age in which we live\u2026 It does, however, take more than a little thought to understand the true purpose of the tactic known as filibustering and to appreciate its historic importance in protecting the viewpoint of the minority\u2026 In many ways, the filibuster is the single most important device ever employed to ensure that the Senate remains truly the unique protector of the rights of the people that it has been throughout our history.\u201d Majority George Mitchell said, \u201c[T]he right of unlimited debate is a rare treasure which you must safeguard. Of course, it can be, and it is, abused. But that is the price that must be paid, and the privilege is worth the price.\u201d Tom Daschle argued, \u201cThe Senate\u2019s longstanding institutional checks on the majority make it easier for the minority to block initiatives than for the majority to pass them\u2026 activists have accused \u2026 senators of subjecting legislation and nominees to \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 filibusters, claiming the founders never envisioned a cloture requirement. The former allegation is both false and hypocritical\u2026 The latter statement\u2014that the founders never anticipated cloture\u2014is correct, since the founders never provided any means to cut off debate\u2026 The founders envisioned a Senate that would vigorously protect the rights of the minority against a reactionary majority.\u201d\n\nBut, perhaps the strongest defense was made by Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson who said, \u201cIf I should have the opportunity to send into the countries behind the iron curtain one freedom and only one, I know what my choice would be. I would send to those nations the right of unlimited debate in their legislative chambers\u2026 If we now, in the haste and irritation, shut off this freedom, we shall be cutting off the most vital safeguard which minorities possess against the tyranny of momentary majorities.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the Senate can find a way to reverse course and limit the damage. Given the slippery slope to ever-greater majority power, it will be difficult if not impossible to find a way back.\n\nRichard A.
