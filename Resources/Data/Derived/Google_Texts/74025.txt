Santa Fe Indian Market 2014 officially takes place August 23-24, but we're well into the phenomenon called "Market Week. Numerous Market-related events are underway, including the Native Cinema Showcase. Tonight, starting at 5 pm, Allan Houser will be honored at the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture in an event that is open to the public (though not free; admission is $100); at 8 pm the masters of electric pow wow A Tribe Called Red will play a set on the MIAC's Museum Hill. The agenda for tomorrow (Friday) includes the Best of Show Ceremony and Luncheon, State of the Arts Symposium, and a snear preview of award-winning art. Visit SWAIA.org for the full schedule.

In general, the streets of Santa Fe are abuzz with American Indians rocking their Native style, old friends reconnecting, and no shortage of art lovers visiting the Santa Fe Railyard to peruse the new Indigenous Fine Art Market (which officially opens today and runs through Saturday.)
