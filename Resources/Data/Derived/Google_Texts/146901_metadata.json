The game is rigged in sugar\u2019s favor for three main reasons: We are born to like it, it is everywhere, and it is addictive.\n\nWe taste sugar and our pleasure sensors fire like crazy. When our ancestors were running around in loincloths, that genetic predisposition helped them survive, as sweet foods provided valuable energy and were less likely to be poisonous than bitter foods.\n\nNow, sugar is everywhere, and Americans are downing a lot of it, on average nearly 17 teaspoons daily. Our ancestors might find it odd that now we have to hunt to find a packaged food that doesn\u2019t have added sugar.\n\nOn top of that, more and more research reveals that sugar stimulates the brain and causes dependence and withdrawal the same way addictive drugs do. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to shun sugar altogether or that bringing cupcakes to school is akin to giving cocaine to a bunch of fourth-graders.
