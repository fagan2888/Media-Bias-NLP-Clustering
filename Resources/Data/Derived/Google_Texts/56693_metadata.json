Council members currently earn $206.97 per meeting for up to 52 meetings per year, with the maximum pay being $10,762.44. Adding the base salary would put City Council members above $20,000 a year.\n\nWhat supporters say: Offering a higher salary and health insurance will make it possible for people from more diverse economic backgrounds to serve on City Council. Adding a base salary also reflects the large amount of work council members do outside of meetings.\n\nWhat opponents say: Serving on council should be essentially a volunteer position, and raising the pay moves it closer to being a job. Others believe the pay increase isn't large enough to make a difference in the types of candidates who can afford to serve.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948173/boulder-question-2r-amending-charter-provisions-regarding-compensation", "sailthru.author": "Camera staff", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28948173:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-10T18:18:27-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall Section 7 of the Charter be amended pursuant to Ordinance No. 8052 to add an annual salary for council members in the amount of $10,000, with an annual increase equal to the percentage increase in the consumer price index and to add health benefits equivalent to those received by city employees?", "title": "Boulder Question 2R: Amending charter provisions regarding compensation for council members", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948173/boulder-question-2r-amending-charter-provisions-regarding-compensation", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-10-10T18:18:36-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-09T18:28:27-0600", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "byline": "Camera staff", "pubDate": "2015-10-10T18:19:09-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-10T18:18:27-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Question 2R: Amending charter provisions regarding compensation for council members", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Election", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall Section 7 of the Charter be amended pursuant to Ordinance No. 8052 to add an annual salary for council members in the amount of $10,000, with an annual increase equal to the percentage increase in the consumer price index and to add health benefits equivalent to those received by city employees?", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948173/boulder-question-2r-amending-charter-provisions-regarding-compensation", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall Section 7 of the Charter be amended pursuant to Ordinance No. 8052 to add an annual salary for council members in the amount of $10,000, with an annual increase equal to the percentage increase in the consumer price index and to add health benefits equivalent to those received by city employees?", "title": "Boulder Question 2R: Amending charter provisions regarding compensation for council members"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf40\"", "article_summary": "Adding the base salary would put City Council members above $20,000 a year.\nCouncil members currently earn $206.97 per meeting for up to 52 meetings per year, with the maximum pay being $10,762.44.\nAdding a base salary also reflects the large amount of work council members do outside of meetings.\nOthers believe the pay increase isn't large enough to make a difference in the types of candidates who can afford to serve.\nWhat supporters say: Offering a higher salary and health insurance will make it possible for people from more diverse economic backgrounds to serve on City Council."}
