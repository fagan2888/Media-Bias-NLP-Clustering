Rick Scott\u2019s integrity and the state\u2019s ongoing fight against same-sex marriage in a brisk and mostly civil debate Monday with her general-election challengers, Democrat George Sheldon and Libertarian Bill Wohlsifer.\n\nTopics included the medical-marijuana ballot proposal before voters this fall, the federal Affordable Care Act, the restoration of civil rights for felons, consumer protection, utility rate hikes, the expansion of gambling and the \u201cstand your ground\u201d self-defense law.\n\nThis was the only debate planned among the attorney general candidates, who made no apparent gaffes and offered mostly party-line positions on where they would take the office over the next four years.\n\nAired only Central Florida, the one-hour, tape-delayed event \u2014 held before no audience \u2014 was available Monday night on Bay News 9 in the Tampa area and News 13 in Orlando.\n\nThe candidates were often limited to between 30 seconds and 1 minute for their responses.\n\nThe nearest the candidates came to a dust-up was when they were asked about handling public corruption.\n\nSheldon said he\u2019d have the office look into the governor\u2019s personal finances, based on a report by the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times that Scott provided different information on his state-required financial disclosure forms compared to the information submitted to the IRS and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cI would call on the attorney general to begin to look at the discrepancy with Gov. Scott,\u201d Sheldon said.\n\nBondi shot back that Sheldon\u2019s comments were \u201chow a politician talks, not an attorney general.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo imply that our governor is corrupt, that is not appropriate for any candidate to say that, nor an attorney general to say that, based on a newspaper article,\u201d she continued.\n\nThe issue of same-sex marriage took on additional significance in the debate as the U.S. Supreme Court earlier in the day cleared the way for same-sex marriage in several states by declining to hear appeals.\n\nFlorida was not among those immediately impacted by the action. But Bondi, whose office is defending the state\u2019s gay-marriage ban in four cases, has maintained the state was awaiting the U.S. Supreme Court to settle the question of whether Florida\u2019s voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional.\n\nBondi said Monday there are additional cases that could reach the top federal court and \u201cwe\u2019re going to be reviewing everything in Florida to see what to do next.\u201d\n\nHowever, Wohlsifer and Sheldon said the state should end the fight.\n\n\u201cThe challenge has gone on too far,\u201d Wohlsifer said.\n\n\u201cGovernment ought to get out of the business of telling people who they can love,\u201d Sheldon said.\n\nSheldon and Wohlsifer also backed the proposed medical-marijuana constitutional amendment and the restoration of rights for many felons who have completed their sentences.\n\nBondi touted her efforts to crack down on human trafficking and synthetic drugs while saying she would carry out the medical-marijuana amendment if it is supported by voters but envisions \u201ca pot clinic on every corner.\u201d\n\nBondi also labeled Sheldon a \u201cWashington insider\u201d and \u201ccareer politician.\u201d\n\nSheldon, a former state lawmaker most recently was acting assistant secretary at the federal Administration for Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nSheldon said Bondi has done little to protect utility customers, should \u201cbeef up the Medicaid fraud unit,\u201d and that he would push to change jury instructions regarding the controversial \u201cstand your ground\u201d law.\n\n\u201cThe Trayvon Martin case, the movie theater shooting, the shooting because of the loud music, none of those were \u2018stand your ground\u2019 defenses and yet the jury was instructed on \u2018stand your ground,\u2019 \u201d Sheldon said.\n\nThe self-defense law has been a flashpoint since the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. While Zimmerman did not ask for \u201cstand your ground\u201d legal immunity, much of the debate following the shooting centered on the law. Zimmerman said he shot the unarmed black teenager in self-defense and was later acquitted of second-degree murder charges in Martin\u2019s death.\n\nWohlsifer, who has received just a few percentage points in some recent polls, said there may be a need for some \u201ctweaking\u201d to the \u201cstand your ground.\u201d law, but also backed the rights of gun owners.\n\nBondi called for the debate moments after Sheldon defeated state Rep. Perry Thurston of Fort Lauderdale in the Aug. 26 Democratic primary. Sheldon, who lags behind Bondi in fundraising and in polls, requested up to five debates.\n\nThis report is by Jim Turner with The News Service of Florida.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attorney General Pam Bondi defended Gov.
