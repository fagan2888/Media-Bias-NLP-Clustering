“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” typically tapes earlier in the day, but news broke of the horrific terrorist attacks that have left 127 people dead in Paris.

According to those who attended the taping, Colbert broke the news to the audience. One audience member said Colbert re-recorded the intro without the jokes remarking that Colbert was visibly “shaken.”

Stephen Colbert paused in the middle of taping TLS to tell us what happened in Paris. So surreal to get such horrific news in that setting. — erin chack (@ErinChack) November 14, 2015
