What if the president pitched Obamacare on Xbox Live?

Thank goodness the video game didn’t experience any glitches when he came around.

Playing off the White House’s efforts to market Obamacare to youth, a YouTube group named Game Society Pimps has taken the voice of the president to Xbox Live. It directed a video that was uploaded Sunday of the first-person shooter game “Titanfall,” which pitted a gamer under the handle HealthcareGOV — voiced by Obama impersonator Jason Stephens — against an unsuspecting group of youngish-sounding players. During the game, “Obama” fielded questions on his gaming strategy, current events, and pop culture.

When he asked the group a few questions of his own about signing up for health insurance, we got the nutshell of Millennial disinterest in Obamacare.

“Do you guys have any questions about the Affordable Care Act, or about my presidency, or about me?” he asked.

“How turnt up do you get on the weekends?” one user responded.

After replying with a couple of quips about the Drug Enforcement Agency and Colorado, Stephens-as-Obama went on to talk about the Kennedy assassination and took a question about deporting Justin Bieber.

The YouTube group known for its “machinima” — using computer graphics, often those from video games, to create a cinematic work — has posted videos with the same premise this year. The fake president has taken his HealthcareGOV handle and handle on Obamacare knowledge to online meet-ups of “Call of Duty” and “Grand Theft Auto.”

The “Titanfall” edition is mostly PG-13 for some language and suggestive dialogue.
