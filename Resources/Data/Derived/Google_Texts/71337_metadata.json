There are a number of institutional reforms that can be implemented to check the spending that drives this growth in debt. Entitlement reform is essential, as rapidly burgeoning growth in entitlements is driving the growth in spending. The latest increase in the debt ceiling gives us some time to reach an agreement that reflects real reform, and there are sufficient assets available that default is not a concern.\n\nThe Increasing Federal Debt\n\nThe origins of the federal government's statutory debt limit can be traced back to 1917, when the country borrowed money to finance World War I.[i] Limitations on federal borrowing were intended to control congressional spending by limiting the amount of debt that the federal government could accumulate. Policymakers have routinely pushed the debt limit ever higher ever since. Indeed, the limit has been increased almost 20 times since 1993,[ii] and the federal debt has ballooned from less than $5 trillion to $19 trillion. That figure continues to rise, thanks to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which passed in October and suspended the debt limit until March 16, 2017.[iii]\n\nIt is ironic that the suspension of the debt limit was part of a deal to increase spending above the Budget Control Act of 2011's intended spending caps (for the second time). Despite the popular perception of Republicans and Democrats caught in gridlock, the truth is that after the political dust settles, the end result is always the same: a bipartisan agreement on more spending and more debt.\n\nThis needs to change. According to the most recent 10-year fiscal forecast from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), \"federal outlays remain near 21 percent of GDP for the next few years\u2014higher than their average of 20.2 percent over the past 50 years . . . [and] if current laws generally remained the same, growth in outlays would outstrip growth in the economy, and outlays would rise to 23 percent of GDP by 2026.\"[iv]\n\nCBO projections also show that federal debt held by the public will reach 76 percent of GDP by the end of 2016\u2014a full two percentage points higher than 2014. It is also expected to grow from $14 trillion this year to $24 trillion by 2026.\n\nThat's probably an underestimate since it is a projection based on the assumption that policymakers will keep their promises to cut spending and raise taxes. Based on Congress's termination of the sequester years ahead of schedule and its historical propensity to spend more and more each year, such an assumption is unlikely to come true. The projections also assume that the economy will grow at current projected rates and without any recessions. This, too, is unlikely, since the country tends to go into recession every five to six years.\n\nDeficits are also going to go up to $544 billion from last year's $439 billion. Over the coming decade, the size of the federal deficit will double to reach an annual gap of almost 5 percent of GDP. CBO predicts that deficits will total $9.4 trillion. That's up $1.5 trillion from its August report. It also notes that under the alternative scenario budget projection, spending will increase to 21.9 percent of GDP in 2020, to 25.8 percent in 2030, and to 30.4 percent in 2040.\n\nThe expansion of mandatory programs\u2014such as Medicare, Medicaid, Affordable Care Act subsidies, and Social Security\u2014is the driving force behind this spending growth and our exploding debt. These entitlements will trigger even higher levels of debt in the years outside the 10-year budget window.\n\nUnfortunately, as the debt grows, the interest payments on that debt will grow as well. If the United States does not change course, interest on the debt will end up as one of its biggest budget items. Our unfunded liabilities keep going up, too. The net present value of the promises made to the American people for which the United States does not have the money to pay is roughly $75.5 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nHigh debt levels are problematic. As CBO explained a few years ago:\n\nSuch high and rising debt later in the coming decade would have serious negative consequences: When interest rates return to higher (more typical) levels, federal spending on interest payments would increase substantially. Moreover, because federal borrowing reduces national saving, over time the capital stock would be smaller and total wages would be lower than they would be if the debt was reduced. In addition, lawmakers would have less flexibility than they would have if debt levels were lower to use tax and spending policy to respond to unexpected challenges. Finally, a large debt increases the risk of a fiscal crisis, during which investors would lose so much confidence in the government's ability to manage its budget that the government would be unable to borrow at affordable rates.[v]\n\nThese numbers are important to keep in mind when discussing the next debt ceiling deadline. Indeed, when March 2017 comes around we can expect that Washington will once again have the same debate it has had for the last few years about whether or not to raise the debt ceiling and under what circumstances. On one side you will find those who want to raise the limit without questions asked. On the other side, you will find those who will demand reforms in exchange for yet another increase in the debt ceiling.\n\nContinuing to pass debt ceiling increases without proper spending reforms would be irresponsible. It is also irresponsible to signal to the international community that the US government could possibly default on its debt obligations while Washington works through whether it will raise the debt limit before or after it formulates a plan to reduce government spending.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Fundamental spending reform needed.", "title": "The Solution to the Debt Ceiling Debacle", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2016/02/02/debt-ceiling-solution", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14544406754295.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14544406754295.jpg", "description": "Fundamental spending reform needed.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Solution to the Debt Ceiling Debacle"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Government Spending", "published_time": "2016-02-02T20:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/veronique-de-rugy"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Policymakers have routinely pushed the debt limit ever higher ever since.\nOn the other side, you will find those who will demand reforms in exchange for yet another increase in the debt ceiling.\nThe Increasing Federal DebtThe origins of the federal government's statutory debt limit can be traced back to 1917, when the country borrowed money to finance World War I.\nIndeed, the limit has been increased almost 20 times since 1993,[ii] and the federal debt has ballooned from less than $5 trillion to $19 trillion.\nThat figure continues to rise, thanks to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which passed in October and suspended the debt limit until March 16, 2017."}
