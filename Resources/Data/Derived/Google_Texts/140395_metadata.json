The female accuser told the jury that the defendant \u201ccouldn\u2019t know that I was uncomfortable because I was laughing,\u201d during the encounter in the school\u2019s equipment room. \u201c I was trying to be cool.\u201d But five days later, she went to the police.The male defendant said \u201cI thought she was having a great time.\u201d Last week, the jury rendered a mixed verdict, acquitting him of felony rape though finding him guilty of lesser charges.Regardless of the sentence he faces, his life has been irreversibly harmed by the rape charge and trial. Yet there will be many more trials like this, thanks to the warriors for political correctness.They have pushed to remove force as the standard for rape, and they\u2019ve succeeded in nearly half the states already, including New Hampshire, where this trial occurred.Sometimes, a young man will come on too strong, but the young woman will go along and only later claim it was nonconsensual. In states without a standard of force, he could be convicted and sent to prison for years. In New Hampshire, had the defendant been convicted, he would have faced a mandatory 10 to 20 years.That\u2019s a draconian punishment for what may be mixed signals between sexual novices. Let\u2019s face it. Maturing heterosexual males are wired to pursue women for sex. And maturing females learn, often through trial and error, how to respond.When young women want sex, they learn to tilt their head or smile. And when they don\u2019t want sex, they need to learn to firmly push away, convincingly say no, or just get up and leave. In the absence of force (or intoxication) there is nothing stopping them except their confusion.Forcing a woman to have sex is already rightly illegal. But there\u2019s no reason to outlaw seduction. Many women don\u2019t want their partner to obsequiously ask \"May I?\u201d before making every move, from reaching into her blouse to walking her into the bedroom.But the PC sex police insist that government should enforce their version of modern bedroom etiquette. Deborah Tuerkheimer, a law professor at Northwestern, claims that having to prove sex was physically forced is \u201cwoefully out of step with modern conceptions of sex.\u201d Erin Murphy at NYU Law agrees, calling current laws \u201coutdated.\u201d Alarmingly, state after state is capitulating to their agenda.This new murky standard \u2014 lack of \u2014 runs the risk of outlawing male boldness and \u201cmen being men.\u201d It\u2019s emasculating.Anne Coughlin, law professor at University of Virginia, says the law needs to be made \u201ccompatible with evolving sexual mores.\u201d Whose mores? It\u2019s no different from outlawing dominatrixes or bondage or even gay sex. Don\u2019t outlaw my kind of sex and I wont try to outlaw yours.None of this is the government\u2019s business. It\u2019s insulting to assume women can\u2019t make their wishes known and fend off unwanted sex, in the absence of force.To support their demands for changes in state laws, the PC police point to an epidemic of rape. But the statistics are exaggerated.Former Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s Justice Department redefined rape in its official crime data, removing the use of force. These FBI statistics now include incidents in which there is no force \u2014 not even bodily contact. It\u2019s laughable.Making suggestive remarks is now counted as low grade sexual assault.To see how crazy it can get, the sex police have already imposed a wacky standard called \u201caffirmative consent\u201d at many colleges, including all campuses in New York State and California.Sex partners there have to ask, each step of the way, \u201cMay I unbutton your blouse?\u201d and \u201cMay I kiss you?\u201d and wait for an answer or risk expulsion or worse. Now some activists are pushing to make that the law for everyone. That\u2019s scary.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "rape, st paul, sex", "pubdate": "2015-09-02T08:31:06", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The St. Paul\u2019s School rape trial should raise red flags about the rush to rewrite state laws on sexual assault.", "title": "Rape Case Underscores PC Police Run Amok", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/McCaughey/rape-st-paul-sex/2015/09/02/id/673155/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=fdec78fa-033a-4cdb-a29c-28c6887e564e&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/McCaughey/rape-st-paul-sex/2015/09/02/id/673155/", "title": "Rape Case Underscores PC Police Run Amok", "description": "The St. Paul\u2019s School rape trial should raise red flags about the rush to rewrite state laws on sexual assault.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1441182666, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "rape, st paul, sex", "article": {"section": "McCaughey", "published_time": "2015-09-02T08:31:06"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/McCaughey/rape-st-paul-sex/2015/09/02/id/673155/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The St. Paul\u2019s School rape trial should raise red flags about the rush to rewrite state laws on sexual assault."}, "article_summary": "And maturing females learn, often through trial and error, how to respond.When young women want sex, they learn to tilt their head or smile.\nIn states without a standard of force, he could be convicted and sent to prison for years.\nBut the statistics are exaggerated.Former Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s Justice Department redefined rape in its official crime data, removing the use of force.\nDon\u2019t outlaw my kind of sex and I wont try to outlaw yours.None of this is the government\u2019s business.\nMaturing heterosexual males are wired to pursue women for sex."}
