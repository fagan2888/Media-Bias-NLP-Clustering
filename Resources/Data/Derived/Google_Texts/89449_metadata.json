Sotomayor is also known as a tireless worker and an incisive questioner whose concerns, as Jeffrey Toobin has written, tend \u201ctoward the earthbound and practical.\u201d\n\nHere are six signature moments\u2014one for each year she\u2019s been on the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nMohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, Dec. 8, 2009\n\nSotomayor\u2019s first majority opinion was relatively dull stuff, involving whether a meeting between a company attorney and an employee involved in a dispute over wrongful termination fell under attorney-client privilege. (It doesn\u2019t, although the reasoning is more technical than that.)\n\nThe most interesting part is that the employee\u2019s dispute with the company stemmed from comments he had made about the company employing \u201cundocumented immigrants.\u201d Those are Sotomayor\u2019s words, whose written decision avoided the term \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nChamber of Commerce v. Whiting, May 26, 2011\n\nA 5-3 Supreme Court majority upheld an Arizona law that punished companies that hired undocumented workers, tested whether states could, through licensing, effectively supercede federal law.\n\nSotomayor wrote one of two dissenting opinions, suggesting that the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act was \u201cintended to specifically preempt any state or local laws providing civil fines and/or criminal sanctions on the hiring, recruitment or referral of undocumented aliens.\u201d\n\nJ.D.B. v. North Carolina, June 16, 2011\n\nSotomayor wrote the majority opinion in a 5-4 case about a 13-year-old North Carolina student who was suspected of being involved in a robbery and was questioned at his school. He confessed and was taken into custody without being read his Miranda rights. The fundamental issue being whether the student understood that he was free to leave while being questioned or not.\n\n\u201cTo hold \u2026 that a child\u2019s age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody,\u201d she wrote, is to \u201cignore the very real differences between children and adults.\u201d\n\nNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, June 28, 2012\n\nSotomayor joined with the majority in this landmark 5-4 decision that upheld the principal part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by declaring that the penalty didn\u2019t qualify as a tax. She did, however, disagree as to the reason why.\n\nAlthough Sotomayor did not write either the court\u2019s main decision nor a dissent, she was influential during questioning, pursuing the similar provisions that states have requiring drivers to be insured.\n\nSchuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Apr. 22, 2014\n\nIn what is currently seen as Justice Sotomayor\u2019s defining moment, she wrote a lengthy, impassioned (by Supreme Court standards) dissent of the 6-2 ruling upholding a ban on affirmative action practices in admission to public universities in Michigan.\n\n\u201cAs members of the judiciary tasked with intervening to carry out the guarantee of equal protection,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe ought not sit back and wish away, rather than confront, the racial inequality that exists in our society. It is this view that works harm, by perpetuating the facile notion that what makes race matter is acknowledging the simple truth that race does matter.\u201d\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "POLITICS/Courts, LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2014-08-08 16:12:27 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Sonia Sotomayor became the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice on Aug. 8, 2009.
