The air show taking place Saturday at Flying Electrons Field, N61-W17000 Kohler Lane, Menomonee Falls, will feature prop planes, jets, helicopters and objects you'd never expect to get off the ground. Visitors can also get a few flying tips, should this show inspire them to be pilots.

That goal isn't out of reach because Airfest 2014 features radio-controlled aircraft, which means that almost anyone can afford to own and fly his or her own jet.

Members of the Flying Electrons radio control model aviation club will gather at the field from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with the show starting around noon. Food and beverages will be available, and visitors will be eligible for raffle prizes.

The club asks for a donation of $3 for a carload of future fliers. For instructions on how to get to the field, go to the Flying Electrons website at www.flyingelectrons.com.
