A New Jersey woman died aboard a United Airlines flight from London that landed at Newark Liberty International Airport.

Police and a medical examiner were waiting when Flight 115 arrived at 9:45 p.m. Monday.

Port Authority Police spokesman Joe Pentangelo says the 23-year-old Newark resident was traveling alone.

Pentangelo says a doctor aboard the plane tried to help when the woman was found unconscious, however she died while in flight. Pentangelo says the woman may have had a pre-existing medical condition.

Pentangelo says there was no need to quarantine other passengers.

Authorities are awaiting results of an autopsy and have not yet released her name.
