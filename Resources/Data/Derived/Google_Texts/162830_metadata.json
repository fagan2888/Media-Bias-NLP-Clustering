Lee Zeldin of New York, Peter Roskam of Illinois, and Mike Pompeo of Kansas called on the Obama administration to retain economic sanctions on Tehran until the government releases the four Americans currently imprisoned in Iran.\n\n\u201cThe tyrannical regime in Tehran has once again shown the world its true colors with the sham conviction of an innocent American,\u201d the congressmen said in a statement Monday. \u201cIt is disgusting to reward a country that so brazenly violates international law and abuses our fellow citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lives of Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Robert Levinson should not be a \u2018concession\u2019 in President Obama\u2019s Iran deal,\u201d Zeldin, Roskam and Pompeo added.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner also pressed the president to freeze implementation of the Iran deal, noting that the same regime that \u201ctortured, abused, and wrongly convicted\u201d Rezaian \u201cwill be trusted to inspect itself under a nuclear deal that will give Iran legitimacy and billions in cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s gamble that a nuclear deal would lead to a more responsible Iran has already failed,\u201d Boehner said.\n\nRezaian, who was imprisoned nearly 15 months ago, has been held longer than the Americans detained during the 444-day Iranian hostage crisis. Iranian authorities have not yet announced his sentence, but reports suggest he could face 10 to 20 years in prison.\n\nPost executive editor Marty Baron called the guilty verdict an \u201coutrageous injustice,\u201d adding the publication is working with Rezaian\u2019s family and Iranian counsel to press for his immediate release.\n\n\u201cIran has behaved unconscionably throughout this case, but never more so than with this indefensible decision by a Revolutionary Court to convict an innocent journalist of serious crimes after a proceeding that unfolded in secret, with no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing,\u201d Baron said in a statement Monday.\n\nRezaian, a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, was arrested in July 2014 on accusations of \u201cspying on Iran\u2019s nuclear programs\u201d and providing the U.S. government with information on individuals and companies evading economic sanctions, a state-run news channel reported Monday.\n\n\u201cThe information that Rezaian provided to the Americans resulted in many Iranian and international businessmen and companies being placed on America\u2019s sanctions list,\u201d the network posted on its website.\n\nIranian officials have fueled speculation that Tehran may pressure the U.S. for a prisoner swap that would free Rezaian along with two other American prisoners in exchange for the release of 19 Iranians jailed in the U.S. for dodging sanctions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t particularly like the word \u2018exchange,\u2019 but from a humanitarian perspective, if we can take a step, we must do it. The American side must take its own steps,\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in September.\n\nU.S. officials have not confirmed negotiations of an exchange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian was convicted in Iran on espionage charges after being detained in Tehran for more than a year.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian was convicted in Iran on espionage charges after being detained in Tehran for more than a year.", "title": "Washington Post Reporter Convicted in Iran", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151013_PostIran_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-13T16:23:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QoPAT8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian was convicted in Iran on espionage charges after being detained in Tehran for more than a year.", "title": "Washington Post Reporter Convicted in Iran", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151013_PostIran_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-10-13T14:51:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T16:23:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jason Rezaian, Marty Baron, Washington Post, Iran nuclear agreement, Lee Zeldin, John Boehner"}, "article_summary": "Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian was convicted in Iran on espionage charges after being detained in Tehran for more than a year, Iranian media reported Sunday.\nThe verdict sparked immediate backlash from U.S. lawmakers, reviving GOP-led charges against President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Iran nuclear agreement.\nThe American side must take its own steps,\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in September.\nIranian authorities have not yet announced his sentence, but reports suggest he could face 10 to 20 years in prison.\nRezaian, who was imprisoned nearly 15 months ago, has been held longer than the Americans detained during the 444-day Iranian hostage crisis."}
