Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who proposed legislation encouraging governors to call out the National Guard for school shootings. At the time I worried that this legislative panic attack would leave us no safer, and considerably less free.\n\nThat\u2019s probably for the best, given that the massacre encouraged a flurry of policy proposals whose \u201cprospects for reducing the risks of mass murder are limited.\u201d But a year later, Newtown's legislative legacy is far less dramatic than it might have been. At the state level, nearly two-thirds of post-Newtown firearms laws actually loosened restrictions on gun owners. On the federal level, nothing much has happened.\n\nThat\u2019s the sober, and sobering, conclusion of a new article in the journal Homicide Studies, co-authored by James Alan Fox, the nation\u2019s leading criminologist studying mass killing.\n\nIn \u201cMass Shootings in America: Moving Beyond Newtown,\u201d Fox and co-author Monica J. DeLateur offer a comprehensive review of the literature, aimed at refuting \u201cmyths\u201d surrounding the problem of spree shootings.\n\nIt\u2019s a myth, for example, that a federal ban on so-called assault weapons will impede shooting sprees: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of mass murderers use firearms that would not be restricted by an assault weapons ban,\u201d mostly semiautomatic handguns. Those that used weapons covered by a renewed ban \u201ceasily could have identified an alternate means of mass casualty.\u201d\n\nEnhanced background checks are no more promising, the authors write: \u201cMost mass murderers do not have criminal records or a history of psychiatric hospitalization,\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be disqualified from purchase. They cite a recent study prepared for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which found that in only 10 of 93 cases had \u201cconcerns about the mental health of the shooter been brought to the attention of\u201d health professionals or legal authorities prior to the shooting.\n\nAttempts to identify would-be mass killers through \u201ctelltale warning signs\u201d and improved access to mental health care are also likely to fail: \u201cProfiles and checklists designed to predict rare events \u2014 such as mass shootings \u2014 tend to over-predict, producing a large number of \u2018false positives,' \" which will potentially do \u201cmore harm than good.\u201d\n\nFox, whose focus on mass killing has earned him the moniker \u201cthe dean of death,\u201d isn\u2019t likely to cheer anyone up with this counsel of legislative futility. But the good news, as the authors point out, is that mass shootings are not on the rise \u2014 and on an individual basis, the risk remains vanishingly small.\n\nPerhaps the public, in its occasional wisdom, recognizes this. A year after Newtown, it looks like the massive public support for gun restrictions never materialized; a recent Reason-Rupe poll showed 63 percent of Americans doubting that tighter gun laws would keep guns out of the hands of wrongdoers.\n\nSociologists define \u201ca moral panic\u201d as \u201can episode, often triggered by alarming media stories and reinforced by reactive laws and public policy, of exaggerated or misdirected public concern, anxiety, fear, or anger over a perceived threat to social order.\u201d Thankfully, Newtown turns out to be the moral panic that wasn't.\n\nThis column originally appeared in the Washington Examiner.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A year later, Newtown's legislative legacy is far less dramatic than it might have been.", "title": "Newtown: The Moral Panic That Wasn't", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/01/14/newtown-the-moral-panic-that-wasnt", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13896682299913.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13896682299913.jpg", "description": "One year ago, in the wake of the horrific school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in&nbsp;Newtown, Conn., the Obama&nbsp;White House&nbsp;released&nbsp;its agenda&nbsp;for \u201cprotect[ing] our children and communities by reducing gun violence.\u201d It was a report marked by a tone of grim urgency from its title onward: \u201cNow Is the Time\u201d to tighten background checks for guns, ban \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons,\u201d and fortify our schools.\nYet the president appeared comparatively restrai", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Newtown: The Moral Panic That Wasn't"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-01-14T17:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/gene-healy"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3866\"", "article_summary": "Sociologists define \u201ca moral panic\u201d as \u201can episode, often triggered by alarming media stories and reinforced by reactive laws and public policy, of exaggerated or misdirected public concern, anxiety, fear, or anger over a perceived threat to social order.\u201d Thankfully, Newtown turns out to be the moral panic that wasn't.\nAt the time I worried that this legislative panic attack would leave us no safer, and considerably less free.\nBut the good news, as the authors point out, is that mass shootings are not on the rise \u2014 and on an individual basis, the risk remains vanishingly small.\nIn \u201cMass Shootings in America: Moving Beyond Newtown,\u201d Fox and co-author Monica J.
