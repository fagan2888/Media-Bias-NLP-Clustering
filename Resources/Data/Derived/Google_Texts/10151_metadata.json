(Photo: News 12 New Jersey)\n\nA Chatham man was pronounced dead at the scene of a multi-vehicle crash involving a tractor-trailer that shut down Route 78 in both directions in Union county Saturday afternoon, State Police spokesman Sgt. Gregory Williams said.\n\nDriving an Audi A4 onto 78 west from the Garden State Parkway ramp, James Pinaire, 24, lost control of the vehicle and traveled into the path of a tanker-trailer driven by Balwinder Singh, 35, of Valley Stream, New York, Williams said.\n\nBoth vehicles then crashed with a tractor-trailer hauling mulch driven by Mario Quiroz, 53, of North Bergen in the left express lane. After the collision, the tractor-trailer came to rest on the concrete barrier. The tractor trailer, driven by Singh, caught on fire, sending a plume of smoke that was visible for miles.\n\nSingh managed to escape the burning tractor-trailer. He and Quiroz were taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. On Sunday, Singh was listed in critical condition, Williams said.\n\nThe local and express lanes on Route 78 closed at about 1 p.m. between Exit 51 for Burnett Avenue in Union and Exit 54 for Winans Avenue/Paine Avenue in Irvington, according to the state Department of Transportation. Williams said all local lanes and one express lane reopened at 2:30 a.m.\n\nThe investigation remains active, Williams said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1A3Yhd8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "One person died and two were injured in a multi-vehicle crash that closed Route 78 in both directions Saturday afternoon", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "One person died and two were injured in a multi-vehicle crash that closed Route 78 in both directions Saturday afternoon", "title": "Crash kills one on 78 west, two others injured", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/union-county/2014/12/06/route-crash/20006061/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One person died and two were injured in a multi-vehicle crash that closed Route 78 in both directions Saturday afternoon", "title": "Crash closes Route 78 in Union County", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e3341d3352970e84fe1dbc8f9b24ad1b6c9cd800/c=0-210-540-750&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/NJGroup/Bridgewater/2014/12/06/635534765726090008-78-crash.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c1a\"", "article_summary": "A multiple vehicle crash involving a tractor trailer closed Route 78 in Union County Saturday.\n(Photo: News 12 New Jersey)A Chatham man was pronounced dead at the scene of a multi-vehicle crash involving a tractor-trailer that shut down Route 78 in both directions in Union county Saturday afternoon, State Police spokesman Sgt.\nThe local and express lanes on Route 78 closed at about 1 p.m. between Exit 51 for Burnett Avenue in Union and Exit 54 for Winans Avenue/Paine Avenue in Irvington, according to the state Department of Transportation.\nThe tractor trailer, driven by Singh, caught on fire, sending a plume of smoke that was visible for miles.\nBoth vehicles then crashed with a tractor-trailer hauling mulch driven by Mario Quiroz, 53, of North Bergen in the left express lane."}
