The Walton County Sheriff's Office is encouraging residents to use a new tool to help if your child goes missing.

In 2002, the FBI created an app that allows parents or guardians to store vital information about their children right on their phone.

Parents can add things like physical identifiers, such as height, weight, hair color and a photograph of the child.

Walton County Sheriff's Deputies say having this app gives both the parents and deputies immediate accessibility to a child's profile.

The app also gives parents some tips on how to keep their children safe.

The app is free, and can be downloaded on any iphone or Android device.
