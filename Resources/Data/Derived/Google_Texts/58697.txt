State officials are trying to put a Band-Aid on their Obamacare website.

For the third straight day, New York’s new online insurance marketplace struggled again Thursday to deal with heavy Web traffic that’s making it hard for users to log in and process requests.

“We are continuing to work to improve the site’s access and navigation to handle the heavy traffic we have seen and allow New Yorkers to easily get low-cost health insurance plans,” said Donna Frescatore, executive director of the marketplace.

Frescatore said state officials have added servers and upgraded software to deal with the traffic. As of Thursday afternoon, 44,000 people had been able to navigate the site and shop for health plans.

There have been more than 39 million visits to the site since it went active Tuesday morning.
