Register here.\n\n\n\nFor a long time it was easy to discount Ted Cruz as a credible presidential candidate. As a junior senator with more ambition than power, Cruz has sought to pull the Republican party down around him, as quick to fight with his own leaders as he is the Democrats. He has often been portrayed in the media as a demagogue with a narrow base of support. Many of his colleagues in Congress, including fellow Republicans, consider him a blowhard, someone best ignored or occasionally mocked but certainly not a politician to be taken seriously.\n\nWell, the time has come to take Cruz seriously. The man who pulled off one of the great upsets in Texas politics\u2014defeating then\u2013lieutenant governor David Dewhurst in the U.S. Senate primary in 2012\u2014has joined the top tier of presidential candidates. His campaign has raised more money than any other. As of press time, he sat third in the latest Iowa polls, behind Ben Carson and Donald Trump. He seems well situated in New Hampshire and South Carolina. As Frank Bruni recently wrote in the New York Times, Cruz \u201cseems to be positioning himself as the ultraconservative fallback\u2014the rabble rouser in the bullpen\u2014if angry voters rethink Trump or Carson and want an establishment-vilifying candidate with at least some government experience.\u201d Cruz\u2019s crowd-pleasing performance at the October 28 Republican debate, in Colorado, which was praised across the media spectrum, earned his campaign a boost in fund-raising and a fresh wave of momentum. That same week, Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post proclaimed that Cruz is \u201crunning the best campaign of any presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nHe still seems too deeply unpopular with the general electorate to actually win the White House. (Presidential races are essentially likability contests, and as Cruz said in the Colorado debate, \u201cIf you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.\u201d) But that\u2019s not the point. Whether Cruz\u2019s campaign ends in the primary or the general election, the popularity of his rhetoric among the Republican grass roots should be worrisome to all Texans. That\u2019s because he has not been a senator for all Texans. Rather, he appeals to a wing of the GOP that speaks its own language.\n\nA Cruz speech on the campaign trail should come with a decoder ring. Take his appearance in late September at the Values Voter Summit, in Washington, D.C. He began with a few inside jokes. Standing next to the lectern\u2014Cruz prefers to prowl the stage with a wireless microphone on his lapel\u2014he touched the unused teleprompter. \u201cI have to ask, what are these things for?\u201d The crowd knew where he was headed\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s for Obama!\u201d called a voice from the audience\u2014and Cruz delivered the desired punch line: \u201cIs Barack Obama coming?\u201d Cruz chuckled and continued with what seemed like the opening monologue for a tea party version of the Tonight Show. \u201cYesterday, Pope Francis was in Washington. . . . I have to say the press conference was a little awkward. \u2019Cause every time the reporters addressed a question to \u2018Your Holiness,\u2019 Barack Obama answered.\u201d The crowd loved it.\n\nBut then things grew a lot less funny. \u201cIf I\u2019m elected president, let me tell you what I intend to do on the first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action!\u201d This sounds like a line only a law school class would understand, but the applauding audience clearly knew exactly what he meant. It\u2019s primarily a response to Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration but also to some of his actions on Obamacare, which Cruz has argued are illegal, though they have not been overturned in court.\n\nHe later thundered that another thing he intends to do on his first day in office is \u201cinstruct the Department of Justice and the IRS and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today!\u201d Persecution of religious liberty? No, you didn\u2019t miss a memo: the First Amendment remains in effect. This line is a catchall that covers a range of perceived persecutions of Christians, including the recent legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nCruz continued, \u201cThat means every serviceman and woman can worship the Lord God Almighty with all of his heart, mind, and soul. And his commanding officer has nothing to say about it!\u201d Now, even a reasonably serious observer of politics might have to Google this one. Cruz was seemingly referencing an effort by the Navy to kick out a Pentecostal chaplain, who spoke against homosexuality and premarital sex, for being \u201cunable to function in the diverse and pluralistic environment,\u201d according to his commander. (The Navy dropped the effort, allowing the chaplain to retire.)\n\nHis next item? \u201cRip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. . . . Under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. And if the ayatollah doesn\u2019t understand that, we may have to help introduce him to his seventy-two virgins.\u201d Having just insinuated the assassination of a sovereign country\u2019s supreme religious leader, he laughed and so did the audience.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s day one,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are three hundred and sixty-five days in a year. Four years in a presidential term. And four years in a second term. By the end of eight years, there are going to be a whole lot of newspaper reporters and editors and journalists who\u2019ve checked themselves into therapy.\u201d\n\nOh, indeed there would be. Perhaps not for the reason Cruz implies\u2014that the media is inherently liberal\u2014but because journalism is, or at least is supposed to be, a profession devoted to fact. Politics, as we have increasingly seen lately, is not, and none of the serious presidential contenders have divorced themselves from fact as often as Cruz has.\n\nAll politicians exaggerate and deliver applause lines to friendly audiences, but Cruz blows the dog whistle better than anyone. He frequently starts with an established fact and exaggerates it to the point of distortion. That\u2019s how the problems with the implementation of Obamacare, and Cruz\u2019s perfectly legitimate ideological objections to the law, became \u201cObamacare is killing jobs and our economy,\u201d as he posted on Facebook in late 2013. Whatever you think of Obamacare, this statement simply isn\u2019t true; in the two years since the law was fully implemented, the U.S. has added about five million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTake another example. In a March appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers, Cruz was asked about climate change and said this: \u201cDebates on this should follow science and follow data. And many of the alarmists on global warming, they\u2019ve got a problem \u2019cause the science doesn\u2019t back them up, and in particular, satellite data demonstrate that for the last seventeen years there\u2019s been zero warming\u2014none whatsoever.\u201d\n\nCruz once again starts with a kernel of truth. In the past seventeen years, there has been little overall warming of the planet. By itself, that claim is largely true. But the time frame isn\u2019t an accident: 1998 was one of the hottest years on record, thanks to El Ni\u00f1o, so starting there and using such a small sample size intentionally obscures the planet\u2019s warming trend. Widen the sample\u2014go back thirty or fifty years\u2014and it becomes clear that the average temperature is increasing steadily. Cruz surely knows this. Given the obvious falseness of his statement, and the venue, this seems intentionally provocative.\n\nSo does another term Cruz often employs: \u201cWashington cartel.\u201d Asked recently on Meet the Press what that means, Cruz said, \u201cI describe the cartel as career politicians in both parties who get in bed with lobbyists and grow and grow and grow government.\u201d Here again, Cruz\u2019s foundation is a basic fact: politicians often have close relationships with lobbyists, and corporations and the wealthy wield undue influence in the corridors of power. But his use of the loaded word \u201ccartel\u201d implies a criminality, even illegitimacy, as if members of Congress and lobbyists are engaged in racketeering. It plays into Americans\u2019 worst suspicions about their government. There is assuredly corruption in Washington, as ever, but that\u2019s not Cruz\u2019s real objection.\n\nWhat really bothers him is that Republican leadership won\u2019t \u201cstand on principle\u201d or \u201cdo what they promised.\u201d This essentially means they are not following Cruz\u2019s agenda of implementing a flat tax, abolishing federal departments like the IRS, repealing \u201cevery word\u201d of Obamacare, and shutting down the federal government over Planned Parenthood. But those issues are nonstarters with most Americans (except maybe the part about the IRS). A recent poll by USA Today found that 73 percent of Americans opposed a government shutdown to force the defunding of Planned Parenthood.\n\nHe calls this the \u201cRepublican party\u2019s surrender politics,\u201d which was the headline of a recent op-ed Cruz wrote for Politico in which he, displaying his rhetorical agility, at once advocated for shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood and blamed Obama for trying to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood. With Obama in the White House\u2014and not enough Republicans to override a veto\u2014the GOP had no chance for success. But Cruz portrayed the GOP\u2019s reluctance to engage in a political suicide mission as gutless, even duplicitous.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood episode felt remarkably similar to the government shutdown over Obamacare, in 2013. Despite Cruz\u2019s insistence that the GOP could succeed in defunding Obamacare, there was no way to win. The president would never agree to gut his signature legislation. This was perhaps the essential Cruz moment. He claimed that his side could win when it clearly could not. He then blamed the predictable defeat on a Republican leadership that couldn\u2019t accomplish the impossible.\n\nThis kind of approach has the GOP worried. Following Mitt Romney\u2019s loss to Obama, in 2012, the Republican National Committee produced an analysis of where the party stood. The report\u2019s authors wrote, \u201cThe Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself. We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.\u201d\n\nRather than heed that warning, Cruz is turning his party into the skid. That may help his individual political fortunes, but at what cost? We have seen the impact in Texas, where the slice of the GOP that loves Cruz has gained enormous influence. Before Cruz won his seat in the U.S. Senate, Ken Paxton was an obscure state representative, Sid Miller was out of politics, and Dan Patrick was a vocal though ineffective state senator. Now Paxton is attorney general (indicted on three felonies), Miller is agriculture commissioner (and has defended deep fryers in schools), and Patrick is lieutenant governor. By showing how to harness the passions on the right, Cruz has led the way\u2014and in Paxton\u2019s case, essentially boosted him into office by promoting his campaign. Meanwhile, our political debate has, at times, become severed from reality, dominated by one absurd issue after another, from the conspiracy theories over the Jade Helm military exercise to the threat of sharia law to the supposed widespread discrimination against Christians.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not healthy. How can there be constructive dialogue in Washington and Austin when the most energized segment of the Republican party views such compromise and collaboration as defeatist? Cruz is championing the politics of delusion, and the consequences will have a profound effect on all of us.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "Politics,", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/11/BTL-Republican-presidential-candidate-Sen-Ted-Cruz-300x300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Dave Mann", "description": "Ted Cruz is rising in the polls, but what is his real message?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "sailthru.link": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/the-ted-offensive/", "og": {"site_name": "Texas Monthly", "description": "Ted Cruz is rising in the polls, but what is his real message?", "title": "The Ted Offensive - Texas Monthly", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/11/BTL-Republican-presidential-candidate-Sen-Ted-Cruz.jpg", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2015-11-19T14:56:08-05:00", "url": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/the-ted-offensive/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.221": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/11/BTL-Republican-presidential-candidate-Sen-Ted-Cruz-220x278.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/11/BTL-Republican-presidential-candidate-Sen-Ted-Cruz.jpg", "creator": "@ContrarianDave", "description": "Ted Cruz is rising in the polls, but what is his real message?", "card": "summary", "title": "The Ted Offensive - Texas Monthly"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-10 15:33:29", "sailthru.image.100": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/11/BTL-Republican-presidential-candidate-Sen-Ted-Cruz-100x120.jpg", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "The Ted Offensive", "sailthru.image.400": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/11/BTL-Republican-presidential-candidate-Sen-Ted-Cruz-380x214.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Behind the Lines,presidential elections,Ted Cruz,Politics,Politics,", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-11-10T15:33:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-19T14:56:08-05:00"}, "news_keywords": "behind the lines, presidential elections, ted cruz, texas, politics, food", "sailthru.description": "Our junior senator is rising in the polls, but what is his real message?", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/11/BTL-Republican-presidential-candidate-Sen-Ted-Cruz-600x400.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.image.150": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2015/11/BTL-Republican-presidential-candidate-Sen-Ted-Cruz-150x150.jpg"}, "article_summary": "For a long time it was easy to discount Ted Cruz as a credible presidential candidate.\nThe Ted OffensiveOur junior senator is rising in the polls, but what is his real message?\nThe report\u2019s authors wrote, \u201cThe Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself.\nWhether Cruz\u2019s campaign ends in the primary or the general election, the popularity of his rhetoric among the Republican grass roots should be worrisome to all Texans.\nHow can there be constructive dialogue in Washington and Austin when the most energized segment of the Republican party views such compromise and collaboration as defeatist?"}
