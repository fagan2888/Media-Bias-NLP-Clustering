The new solution will enable health plans to meet new Health and Human Services (HHS) data submission and distributed data collection requirements created under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nUnder ACA, HHS will require plans to provide specific enrollment, medical and pharmacy files in a secure environment through what is has been dubbed an \u201cEDGE Server.\u201d Originally focused on health plans participating in Exchanges, the requirements apply to all health plans serving the individual and small-group insurance markets.\n\n\u201cThe clarification of the requirements has caught a lot of plans off-guard,\u201d says Dan Skari, solution general manager at TriZetto. \u201cTriZetto has more than 50 clients currently participating on the Exchanges and more than 100 additional clients participating in the individual and small-group plan market, who are turning to TriZetto to support their efforts to meet this new compliance mandate.\u201d\n\nThe Exchange solution leverages more than a decade of experience helping clients manage Medicare and Medicaid data in a similar way. While the solution is pre-integrated to TriZetto\u2019s Facets\u2122 and QNXT\u2122 core administrative systems, it is also architected to support other non-TriZetto legacy systems that will need to comply with the new requirements. TriZetto\u2019s EDM for Exchanges provides an interface from enrollment, claims and pharmacy data sources, as it generates and edits the files before populating data on an EDGE Server according to the submission and format requirements of HHS.\n\n\u201cOur clients are well-positioned to address the submission requirements for the EDGE Server with our Encounter Data Manager for Exchanges solution. TriZetto has a long history of supporting clients as they work to meet these types of encounter reporting requirements. EDM has been deployed successfully by our government program clients for more than 12 years,\u201d adds Skari.\n\nAbout TriZetto\n\nTriZetto provides world-class information technology and service solutions that help payers and providers work more efficiently and collaborate to deliver better health.
