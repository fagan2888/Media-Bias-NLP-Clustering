Tenet Healthcare Corp. will sell two hospitals and 19 physician practices to Duke LifePoint for an undisclosed sum, the for-profit healthcare provider announced on Tuesday.

Once the deal closes, Duke LifePoint will take over the 137-bed Central Carolina Hospital in Sanford and the 355-bed Frye Regional Medical Center in Hickory. In total, Duke LifePoint will manage nine hospitals in the state with the addition of the new facilities.

"As we evaluated strategic alternatives to ensure the long-term success of these operations, we chose Duke LifePoint because of their growing statewide network, impressive leadership teams and focus on quality and value," Tenet Vice Chairman Keith Pitts said in the announcement.

No services are expected to be cut at Central Carolina and Frye Regional, the companies said, and all current employees will keep their jobs.

The deal should close either at the end of the year or early in 2016.
