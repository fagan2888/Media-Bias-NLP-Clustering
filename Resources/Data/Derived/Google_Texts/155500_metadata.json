According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, 44 percent of Americans don\u2019t have three months of funds built up to deal with a job loss or emergency. This is the category I fell into.\n\nI grew up in this region 35 years ago never seeing a homeless person. Having spent a professional career traveling to the nation\u2019s and the world\u2019s largest cities, I often encountered the homeless, and like many of us, never gave them a second glance.\n\nBeing on the street in Wausau has opened my eyes to the reality of their lives.\n\nThe latest homeless count in the Wausau area found around 100 homeless people. Based on my own observation, I think that's about 25 percent of the actual number; the homeless scatter when counts occur. I\u2019ve learned that homeless individuals are very private and clannish, and do not like to be counted or identified. They are fiercely independent, and yet totally dependent on each other.\n\nMost of the homeless need real help. I\u2019ve watched as homeless individuals are arrested for small incidents, placed in jail for two days and put back on the streets. The police are not counselors and should not be asked to fill that role. Nor am I writing to denigrate North Central Health Care center, which does a fabulous job with limited finances and facilities. But merely taking these individuals off the street for a short period does nothing to improve their conditions.\n\nSimilarly, when some people finish prison sentences, they too are simply put back on the street with minimal supervision, often having received insufficient counseling in prison, or none at all.\n\nOur days are spent trying to find shelter, or for those with addictions, serving their addictions. Some are on Supplemental Security Income or some kind of disability; most are not. And many of us, me included, spend our days at the library or at job centers looking for work. We sleep where we can find shelter.\n\nBuy Photo Paul VanLieshout (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)\n\nWhat those who need care for addictions and underlying mental disease find is there is almost no consistent help. Many overindulge in their addictions, some act out, as the seriously mentally handicapped can do. This is the view most of the public has \u2014 a view based on the public actions of people who need a great deal of professional attention.\n\nMost of the people I\u2019ve encountered have an addiction either to alcohol or drugs, mental issues, or a combination of those issues. Some are fighting to pay child support and work long hours to meet their obligations. And some, like me, have no issues other than bad luck and are struggling to get back into the workforce. What is most surprising to me is that with the tremendous quality of medical care in the area, the county or city has not engaged a provider that can treat these addictions long-term and help people turn their lives around.\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reported recently on its Kids in Crisis town hall meeting in Wausau on March 8 that an estimated 3,000 children in the Wausau area need some form of mental health care. Ladies and gentlemen, say hello to your future homeless population. And unless we \u2014 all of us, including politicians \u2014 stop giving lip service to helping those with addictions and mental health issues, our police, shelters, volunteers and professionals who give so much right now are going to get run over.\n\nBuy Photo A volunteer checks a stairwell in downtown Wausau for any homeless person who might be camped out for the night during the January 2016 Point in Time Count.

Statistically, most of those with addictions have at least two relapses and sometimes more before they can break the disease. I\u2019ve often wondered what he went through, and much to my dismay, I see examples every day. The physical, mental and emotional pain these people go through is excruciating, and it sure is no picnic to watch. It is soul-crushing to watch an individual give into his addictions completely. It\u2019s a slow suicide process. And yet, given our options, we have no choice but to stand and become spectators.\n\nNot far from here in Minnesota is the Hazelden clinic, which specializes in the care and treatment of addictions and mental illness. Our challenge is to either develop, or bring, that type of facility to Marathon County.\n\nWe\u2019re good people with great hearts. We have hundreds of people today who need this. And 3,000 more we can help now for a better future for us all.\n\nPaul VanLieshout is a long-time systems analyst.
