Mullainathan is a professor of economics at Harvard University, and Shafir is a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\nReading it could help you deal with the psychological barriers that keep you from having the financial life you deserve.\n\nWhen my husband and I teach a new financial class at our church, we start not with budgeting, as some participants expect, but with discussions about behavior that impedes people from achieving their financial goals. We talk about feelings of entitlement and the lack of decision-making skills. That\u2019s how Mullainathan and Shafir approach scarcity. They explore the why behind the scarcity mind-set by using academic studies, anecdotes and vignettes.\n\n\u201cScarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much\u201d by Sendil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir.\n\nTheirs is an academic approach that is easily accessible. \u201cScarcity\u201d isn\u2019t beach reading. But it\u2019s intriguing if you want to understand the significance and consequences of scarcity.\n\nAs the authors point out, there are times when scarcity can be a good thing. When you have less money or time, it may result in a \u201cfocus dividend\u201d or heightened productivity. Scarcity can also result in \u201ctunneling,\u201d which is when you focus on one thing so much that you neglect something else.\n\nEver pay a bill late because you\u2019re too focused on deadlines at work?\n\n\u201cFocus is a positive: scarcity focuses on what seems, at that moment, to matter most. Tunneling is not: scarcity leads us to tunnel and neglect other, possibly more important, things,\u201d they write.\n\nHow do these concepts play out in our financial lives? Mullainathan and Shafir cite health insurance as an example \u2014 and given the ongoing fury over the Affordable Care Act, it makes sense to me. Why don\u2019t people who need health insurance buy it?\n\nMany will say they can\u2019t afford it. But those of us who have experienced health complications costing thousands of dollars insist that you can\u2019t afford not to have insurance.\n\nYet the scarcity of financial resources forces people to focus on immediate needs. \u201cInsurance does not deal with any of the needs \u2014 food, rents, school fees \u2014 that are pressing against the mind right now,\u201d the authors write. \u201cInstead, it exacerbates them \u2014 one more strain on an already strained budget.\u201d\n\nMullainathan and Shafir contend that applying the science of scarcity to poverty might help change people\u2019s attitudes about the poor. Their work could help people empathize more with the poor.\n\n\u201cWhen we think of the poor, we naturally think of a shortage of money,\u201d Mullainathan and Shafir say. \u201cWhen we think of the busy, or the lonely, we think of a shortage of time, or of friends. But our results suggest that scarcity of all varieties also leads to a shortage of bandwidth.\u201d\n\nBandwidth in this context is mental capacity. When money is scarce, your thoughts can become overwhelmed with your financial struggles, making it hard to make better choices. \u201cWe are emphatically not saying that poor people have less bandwidth,\u201d they write. \u201cQuite the opposite. We are saying that all people, if they were poor, would have less effective bandwidth.\u201d\n\nTheir discussion about poverty elevates it from stereotypes that the poor are just lazy or irresponsible. So understanding how the poor may be thinking can result in more effective anti-poverty programs. \u201cWhy not look at the structure of the programs rather than the failings of the clients?\u201d they ask. \u201cWhy not design programs structured to be more fault tolerant?\u201d And asking the questions isn\u2019t a substitute for personal responsibility, the professors add.\n\nI was enthralled by the research in \u201cScarcity.\u201d As I say in my workshops, you can\u2019t fix financial issues unless you know why you do what you do.\n\n\u201cThe more we understand the dynamics of how scarcity works upon the human mind, the more likely we can find ways to avoid or at least alleviate the scarcity trap,\u201d Mullainathan and Shafir write.\n\nI\u2019ll be hosting a live online discussion about \u201cScarcity\u201d at noon Eastern on Dec. 5 at washingtonpost.com/discussions.
