This upcoming school year, students can receive up to $5,775 to help pay for tuition and other educational expenses.\n\nCongress banned prisoners from Pell grants in 1994 after lawmakers argued it was unfair for prisoners to receive financial aid when many law-abiding citizens were not.\n\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan joined Lynch in the announcement at Goucher College\u2019s Prison Education Partnership at the Maryland Correctional Institute. She said the program will create \u201cexperimental sites\u201d for inmate\u2019s to receive Pell grants to \u201chelp them get job training and secure a productive life\u201d once they leave prison, the Associated Press reports.\n\nMore than 70 students from two separate prisons are enrolled in the Goucher College partnership. It is among many schools that offer degrees to people in prison as part of the Consortium for the Liberal Arts in Prison, which formed in 2009 and does not receive government funding.\n\nIn its press release, the Department of Education cited a 2013 RAND Corporation study that found incarcerated people who participated in education programs were 43 percent less likely to return to prison than prisoners who did not participate. The study also found the programs would cost-effectively save the government money because the recidivism rates would be lower.\n\nThe program is a piece of a broader Obama administration push to overhaul the U.S.\u2019s criminal justice system. President Obama commuted the sentences of 46 inmates earlier this month, traveling to a federal prison in Oklahoma days later, becoming the first sitting president to make such a visit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration announced Friday certain federal and state prisoners will be eligible for federal Pell grants to pay for college classes.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration announced Friday certain federal and state prisoners will be eligible for federal Pell grants to pay for college classes.", "title": "Obama Administration to Give Pell Grants to Prisoners", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/prisonerPellgrant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VS3qlg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration announced Friday certain federal and state prisoners will be eligible for federal Pell grants to pay for college classes.", "title": "Obama Administration to Give Pell Grants to Prisoners", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/prisonerPellgrant.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-08-01T09:24:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "President Obama, Pell grants, criminal justice reform, Department of Education, Loretta Lynch"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b10\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration announced Friday that certain federal and state prisoners will be eligible for federal Pell grants to pay for college classes while they serve out their time behind bars.\nCongress banned prisoners from Pell grants in 1994 after lawmakers argued it was unfair for prisoners to receive financial aid when many law-abiding citizens were not.\nPell grants were created in 1965 as federal financial aid for low-income college students that do not need to be repaid.\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan joined Lynch in the announcement at Goucher College\u2019s Prison Education Partnership at the Maryland Correctional Institute.\nPresident Obama commuted the sentences of 46 inmates earlier this month, traveling to a federal prison in Oklahoma days later, becoming the first sitting president to make such a visit."}
