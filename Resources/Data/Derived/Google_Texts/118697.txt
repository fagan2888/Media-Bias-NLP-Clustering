As Denver’s National Western Stock Show finished up its 108th edition Sunday, fans cheered on the pro rodeo finals, gobbled corn dogs and made deals with the fervor of opening day.

For Joanne Pepper of Lakewood, “Fan Appreciation Day,” the last of the show’s 16 days, is always her favorite.

“You don’t see as many animals, but the admission is cheap and all the vendors are ready to make deals,” she said, herding her two grandchildren through Expo Hall. “It’s just fun to look forward to.”

The $10 ticket price and a Sunday without a Broncos game on TV motivated others to help give the National Western a big send-off.

The show’s attendance reached 640,022 — an increase of 11,656 people over last year.

“We saw record numbers this weekend and are thrilled with the great turnout of stock show fans these last few weeks,” said the show’s president and CEO, Paul Andrews. “We celebrated another successful year with great weather, exciting pro rodeos, horse shows and record-number Junior Livestock Auction sales.”

It was a good show for vendors and cattlmen, too.

“It’s been a great show, but Denver always is strong,” said Tracy Hanson of Austin, Texas, who has managed a cowgirl clothing booth at the show for five years. “The National Western is the first big stock show every year, and you can kind of see how it’s going to go based on Denver. If you don’t do well here, you’re not going to do well in most other places. People in Denver are enthusiastic.”

Cattleman Mark Shealy of Barstow, Calif., talked business with his livestock manager in the Cowboy Bar, situated in the sawdust-strewn stables beneath Expo Hall. Millions of dollars in livestock deals are made between buyers and suppliers each year, he said.

“It’s a lot of fun for the kids, and it teaches city people about ranching and farming,” he said. “But for us, it’s all business.”
