He told \u201cUpFront with Mike Gousha\u201d many of the murders stemmed from non-gang-related confrontations between armed individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have the worst gun laws I\u2019ve ever worked under \u2026 I want them tightened up so we can put bad guys in jail longer,\u201d Flynn said on the program, produced in partnership with WisPolitics.com.\n\nCalling for greater accountability in other parts of the criminal justice system, Flynn said offenders are undeterred by the current laws governing firearms. He accused legislators of caving to pressure from groups like the National Rifle Association.\n\nHe also criticized efforts to increase oversight of police, spearheaded by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, saying they have ignored the \u201cholocaust of violent crime being inflicted on poor communities of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right wing could not care less how many young, dead black men I have as long as they have unfettered access to high-quality firearms,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cAnd the left wing\u2026 couldn\u2019t care less how many dead, young black men I have as long as they are not unduly inconvenienced by the police as they go about their business.\u201d\n\nFlynn said the communities afflicted by gun crime are invested in curbing violence, but said many urban areas suffer from intergenerational problems that complicate law enforcement efforts.\n\n-- U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson dismissed an early poll that showed potential 2016 challenger Russ Feingold leading the Republican by a considerable margin. He said he's focused on his role as chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it, I\u2019ll leave other people to do the evaluation; I think it\u2019s pretty much meaningless at this point in time,\u201d the Oshkosh Republican said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about doing my job.\u201d\n\nHe faced another setback last week, as his effort to challenge the Affordable Care Act in the courts was rejected by a second court that found he had no standing to sue. Johnson said the health care law will likely play a role in his campaign, arguing the mandated coverage has increased costs for many consumers.\n\nCalling President Barack Obama\u2019s extension of health care subsidies to members of Congress and their staff an \u201coverreach,\u201d Johnson said the president\u2019s actions pose a \u201creal problem for our constitutional democracy.\u201d He also criticized Obama\u2019s advocacy of lifting sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a peaceful uranium enrichment program in Iran,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey are doing it for a weapon.\u201d\n\nExpressing concern at a lack of congressional oversight, Johnson said the move to normalize relations with Iran should qualify as a treaty, requiring the approval of at least 67 senators. He warned of a potential for blackmail if Iran succeeds in creating a nuclear weapon and said the nation maintains ties to global terrorism.\n\n-- Marquette Law School Poll Director Charles Franklin said a \u201cstriking\u201d drop in Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s approval rating shows the Republican five points below his previous low of 46 percent.\n\nFranklin said widespread disapproval of the proposed cuts to education played a role, but said an overall lack of approval for the biennial budget also influenced the results. He said Republican sentiment towards the state budget is less positive than in 2013, suggesting Walker\u2019s recent out-of-state travels have impacted support.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago \u2026 he was traveling around the state, selling his policies; we have seen a lot less of him trying to do that,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cAs a result, the negative messages about the budget coming from within his own party are affecting his standing.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "UpFront with Mike Gousha", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 11:14:59 CDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "og": {"site_name": "WISN", "description": "Milwaukee's police chief says recent gun violence is because criminals have easy access to firearms.", "title": "UpFront recap: Chief says Milwaukee gun problem stems from easy access", "url": "http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/upfront-recap-chief-says-milwaukee-gun-problem-stems-from-easy-access/32464566", "image": "http://www.wisn.com/image/view/-/16296122/highRes/6/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/hx5d1l/-/UpFront----use-this-May-2013.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/upfront-recap-chief-says-milwaukee-gun-problem-stems-from-easy-access/32464566", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wisn://content/article/32464566", "iphone": "wisn://content/article/32464566", "googleplay": "wisn://content/article/32464566"}, "name": {"ipad": "wisn", "iphone": "wisn", "googleplay": "wisn"}, "id": {"ipad": 505514957, "iphone": 505514957, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wisn"}}, "site": "@WISN12News", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wisn://content/article/32464566", "app_name": "wisn", "package": "com.hearst.android.wisn"}, "ios": {"url": "wisn://content/article/32464566", "app_store_id": 505514957, "app_name": "wisn"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 99878194705}, "keywords": "WISN, Upfront, Gousha, wisconsin, politics", "google-site-verification": "i4ZqbhDql_xSQP108vpUMcxQym-PFphj-iSCavxm6tw", "news_keywords": "WISN, Upfront, Gousha, wisconsin, politics", "description": "Milwaukee's police chief says recent gun violence is because criminals have easy access to firearms."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc0f\"", "article_summary": "Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn blames a recent spate of gun violence in the city on easy access to firearms for those with criminal records.\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a peaceful uranium enrichment program in Iran,\u201d Johnson said.\nJohnson said the health care law will likely play a role in his campaign, arguing the mandated coverage has increased costs for many consumers.\nHe told \u201cUpFront with Mike Gousha\u201d many of the murders stemmed from non-gang-related confrontations between armed individuals.\nHe said Republican sentiment towards the state budget is less positive than in 2013, suggesting Walker\u2019s recent out-of-state travels have impacted support."}
