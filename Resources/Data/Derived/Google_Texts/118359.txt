The New Day troika took to the Discussion Couch Thursday morning to ponder Jon Stewart’s quip that launched a thousand internet pieces, in which the Daily Show host claimed he wasn’t voting, a statement he later walked back. Host Alisyn Camerota didn’t believe Stewart’s retraction, speculating that the normally-scripted host got caught off-guard under CNN’s truth-lights.*

The mere possibility delighted host Chris Cuomo. “He’s got a little taste of it, my brother,” Cuomo said. “How’s it taste when it’s coming your way?”

* If you’re about to point out that Camerota used to work for Fox News, the comment section’s down yonder.
