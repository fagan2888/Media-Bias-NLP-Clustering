Penrose was initially taken to the hospital when she complained of pins and needles in her back, neck, and face. She was seen by Don Hettiarachchi, who was in his first week at A & E at the hospital. He diagnosed Penrose with dehydration and gastroenteritis, discharging her with painkillers, The Guardian reported.\n\nLater in the day, her parents discovered her critically ill in her bed at home. Penrose was brought back to the hospital at 11:30 am, but was not administered antibiotics until 1 pm \u2014 around the same time she underwent a scan that revealed her body was shutting down. She died the very same day from \u201coverwhelming sepsis\u201d caused by meningococcal septicaemia. At the inquest, Hettarachchi stated that he was \u201cnot 100 percent sure\u201d of the cause of the girl\u2019s symptoms when he examined her, and when asked if he considered meningitis, responded that he did.\n\n\u201cWhen I examined her there was no rash,\u201d Hettarachchi told the inquest. \u201cThere was blotching on her face. I felt it was more viral.\u201d\n\nDr. Mark Simpson, clinical director for emergency medicine at Hull and east Yorkshire hospitals NHS trust, wrote an incident report after Penrose\u2019s death, saying there had been a \u201cfailure in care.\u201d He criticized the errors made by junior doctors and the delay in administering antibiotics. Simpson wrote Penrose would have had the best chance of survival if antibiotics had been administered the first time she went to the hospital, but he couldn\u2019t determine if she would have, in fact, lived.\n\nThe coroner adjourned the hearing, citing the need for an expert to assess if Penrose would have survived had she been given antibiotics immediately. Chief medical officer at the trust, Kevin Phillips, said there would be no comment until a verdict was reached.\n\n\u201cIt is clear, however, that this is a very tragic case,\u201d he said. \u201cOur thoughts are with her family at this difficult time, and we are very sorry for their loss.\u201d\n\nPenrose had learned she had earned a place at the University of York to study math only an hour before she died. Her family has set up a charity to honor her, known as the Ellie Penrose Fund.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "british, triathlete, ellie, penrose, dies, bacterial, meningitis, after, being, misdiagnosed", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Bacterial meningitis has tragically claimed another life, and an inquest has been made about the incident.", "title": "Athlete Dies After Being 'Inappropriately Discharged' From Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bacterial-meningitis-372416", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/05/penrose.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bacterial meningitis has tragically claimed another life, and an inquest has been made about the incident.", "title": "Athlete Dies After Being 'Inappropriately Discharged' From Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bacterial-meningitis-372416", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/05/penrose.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/05/penrose.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-02-05T13:46:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T16:40:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Bacterial meningitis has tragically claimed another life, and an inquest has been made about the incident."}, "article_summary": "British triathlete Ellie Penrose died from meningitis after a junior doctor incorrectly diagnosed her condition, reports The Guardian.\nPenrose was initially taken to the hospital when she complained of pins and needles in her back, neck, and face.\nHer family has set up a charity to honor her, known as the Ellie Penrose Fund.\nThe 18-year-old\u2019s death garnered a recent inquest, during which it was stated the woman was \u201cinappropriately discharged\u201d from Hull Royal Infirmary in Yorkshire, Britain.\nThe coroner adjourned the hearing, citing the need for an expert to assess if Penrose would have survived had she been given antibiotics immediately."}
