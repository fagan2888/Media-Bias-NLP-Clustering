What the Court has done is to further undermine the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe organization noted that, in its decision, the Court\u2019s majority held that the \u201ctax credits\u201d and individual mandate were both needed to prevent Obamacare from experiencing a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, it reasoned, Congress must have intended them to apply even in the 34 States that declined to establish an Exchange,\u201d the press statement continued.\n\n\u201cStatements by \u2018disappearing\u2019 MIT economist Jonathan Gruber that Congress deliberately intended to withhold subsidies as an \u2018incentive\u2019 for States to establish Exchanges were evidently disregarded,\u201d stated Orient.\n\nAAPS General Counsel Andrew Schlafly observed, \u201cIf the Court had applied the plain meaning of the statute, then the 34 states that declined to establish exchanges would be free to develop their own approaches without the interference by Obamacare. Instead, the Court distorted the statute to rescue an unsuccessful law.\u201d\n\nDr. Richard Amerling, associate professor of clinical medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, and president of AAPS, tells Breitbart News he anticipated the Court\u2019s decision back in March in his column at Newsmax, and that the upshot of the decision is that nothing is changed.\n\n\u201cObamacare is still a disaster, a costly scam that funnels billions of taxpayer dollars directly to the insurance industry, and that accelerates the bureaucratization of medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while we were focused on Obamacare, the Republican Congress passed MACRA [Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015], which cements into place the centralized control of medical practice through ACOs [Accountable Care Organizations], bundling, and other forms of \u2018pay-for-performance.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the Supreme Court\u2019s additional blow dealt to physicians in private practice who do not wish to be part of the medical bureaucracy, Amerling states he and his organization are down to their \u201clast line of defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging more and more physicians to opt out of Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare \u2013 which are all starting to look the same,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe must preserve a crop of independent, private physicians who will safeguard the Hippocratic practice of medicine. And we must do this while we still can.\u201d\n\nDr. Gerard Gianoli, a specialist in Neuro-otology and Skull Base Surgery at The Ear and Balance Institute in Covington, Louisiana, tells Breitbart News the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was supposed to remedy the problems of cost and access regarding healthcare.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, not only has the ACA not fixed these problems, but it has actually made them worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling today further entrenches the third party payment system that mainly benefits the health insurance companies. With all medical care running through insurance, this will continue to increase costs \u2014 as noted by requests for 25-50 percent premium increases by the private insurance companies.\u201d\n\nGianoli continues:\n\nAccess to healthcare is actually reduced by two mechanisms \u2014 narrowed networks and higher deductibles \u2014 both made worse by the ACA. The only solution to this is a president and Congress that will repeal the ACA and restore a true free market to medical care as we have seen in Refractive Eye Surgery, Cosmetic Surgery and Third Party Free Medical Practices. All three of these have reduced cost while increasing quality, unlike the current system.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing to me that so many Americans feel that free markets are the best way to minimize cost and maximize quality in every industry, except for health care,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is belied by the above examples.\u201d\n\nFurther information about self-pay medical practices can be found at Sean Parnell\u2019s website, aptly called The Self-Pay Patient.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Physicians Slam SCOTUS Decision: \u2018Keeps Obamacare on Life Support at Taxpayer Expense\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Physicians Slam SCOTUS Decision: \u2018Keeps Obamacare on Life Support at Taxpayer Expense\u2019", "title": "Physicians Slam SCOTUS Decision: \u2018Keeps Obamacare on Life Support at Taxpayer Expense\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/obamacare-pamphlet-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/25/physicians-slam-scotus-decision-keeps-obamacare-on-life-support-at-taxpayer-expense/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Physicians Slam SCOTUS Decision: \u2018Keeps Obamacare on Life Support at Taxpayer Expense\u2019", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/obamacare-pamphlet-ap.jpg", "title": "Physicians Slam SCOTUS Decision: \u2018Keeps Obamacare on Life Support at Taxpayer Expense\u2019", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations, ACOs, affordable care act, Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, free market medicine, health insurance companies, medicaid, Medicare, Obamacare subsidies, self-pay medicine, The Self-Pay Patient, U.S. Supreme Court,Big Government, Medicine, Obamacare,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "U.S. Supreme Court", "published_time": "2015-06-25T15:31:37-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The only solution to this is a president and Congress that will repeal the ACA and restore a true free market to medical care as we have seen in Refractive Eye Surgery, Cosmetic Surgery and Third Party Free Medical Practices.\n\u201cObamacare is still a disaster, a costly scam that funnels billions of taxpayer dollars directly to the insurance industry, and that accelerates the bureaucratization of medicine,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling today further entrenches the third party payment system that mainly benefits the health insurance companies.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be fixed by forcing taxpayers to pay a chunk of some people\u2019s unaffordable premiums.\n\u201cUnfortunately, not only has the ACA not fixed these problems, but it has actually made them worse,\u201d he said."}
