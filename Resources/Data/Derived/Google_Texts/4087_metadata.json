Ted Cruz praying in front of The White House yesterday.\n\nNo, he\u2019s not praying that Barack Obama will overturn Obamacare and no, he\u2019s not praying that he will occupy the presidency one day. Instead, he\u2019s alongside Rev. Rob Schenck (from Faith and Action) and Rev. Frazier White (a Democrat and Obama supporter) praying for Saeed Abedini, who has been in an Iranian prison for one year. He is being persecuted for his faith to Jesus Christ.\n\nWho says Ted Cruz isn\u2019t bipartisan?\n\nI have not only interviewed Ted Cruz many times, but I have spent time with him and his family. He is true Bible-believing Christian who is not ashamed of the Gospel. Of course the liberals don\u2019t want to hear that nonsense. They\u2019ll now be busy trying to figure out how to distort this picture in Adobe Photoshop.\n\nBelow are the words of Rev. Rob Schenck, the man who organized the prayer.\n\n\u201cIn the image you see me at the center with my prayer stole as we intercede in Jesus\u2019 name for our brother in Christ and imprisoned pastor, Saeed Abedini, who has suffered in an Iranian prison for one year because of his faithful witness to Christ. Kneeling with me on my left (the significance of the placement should be noted) is the U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party Republican from Texas. Sen. Cruz just made wall-to-wall headlines for his 20+ hour filibuster opposing Obamacare, the President\u2019s signature legislative achievement.\n\nOn my right (again, note the orientation) is Rev. Frazier White, a Democrat community organizer from my neighborhood of Capitol Hill, and a huge supporter of President Obama. At the moment the photo was taken, though, the politically polar opposite positions of the Senator and the Pastor were irrelevant.\n\nWe were bowed before the Holy, the Supernal, the highest Lord in the universe, and the One and Only Eternal King. Everything else: party labels, policy positions, job descriptions, accents, zip codes, skin color, filibusters and organizing, were all utterly and completely dwarfed. In that moment of prayer\u2013especially for a fellow Christian, a persecuted believer, whose circumstances are for most us unimaginable\u2013our political and cultural squabbles seemed petty.\n\nPastor White, Sen. Cruz, Rev. Pat Mahoney, Jordan and Anna Sekulow, myself, and so many others, were there in front of the White House to do the really and truly important business of crying out to God for one of our own that was suffering for his faith.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here\u2019s a shot of Sen.
