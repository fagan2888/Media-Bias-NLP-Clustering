With his letter, he enclosed condoms that read \u201cPrevent Abortion.\u201d\n\nWoods is a long-shot candidate running in Arizona\u2019s 5th District against Matt Salmon. Salmon is a Republican first elected to the House in 1994 who opposes abortion, gay rights, Obamacare, and raising the debt limit.\n\nWe talked with Woods about reproductive rights, getting people with disabilities involved in civic life, and why there should be more atheists in office.\n\nTakePart: What\u2019s the story behind those condoms you sent? Did you have them made specifically for the National Pro-Life Alliance?\n\nJames Woods: They had several of their local activists send a form letter from their home addresses talking about how they basically want to end legalized abortion in the United States. They\u2019re trying to take away reproductive agency of women to make their own health care decisions. I drafted a letter, had condoms made up, and sent them. I wanted to highlight that contraception is the best way to empower women to reduce the number of abortions\u2014which absolutely is a laudable goal.\n\nTakePart: How has response been? Have you gotten any criticism?\n\nWoods: Someone on the Internet said the tactic was slimy, which I find offensive. Screaming at women on the worst day of their lives with graphic signs, that\u2019s acceptable to them? But sending a condom is somehow offensive to their moral standard?\n\nThe positive response has come from a broad spectrum of people: progressive websites, feminist websites\u2014even local people who consider themselves Libertarian. Most people, even if they are personally against abortion, believe it should be legal and safe. I\u2019m pointing out fringe elements for what they are.\n\nTakePart: You\u2019re pro-choice, clearly, but are you Libertarian? Is government responsible for correcting inequality?\n\nWoods: I\u2019m a civil libertarian. I believe the government has an important role to play in everybody\u2019s life. Government should create a strong social safety net like Social Security Insurance, disability insurance, a universal health care system, and play a role in education. But I think individual freedoms are really important\u2014domestic spying and things like that need to be scrutinized.\n\nTakePart: There\u2019s been a lot of talk about the fact that you\u2019re atheist and blind. Why is it important to bring issues like these to light?\n\nWoods: So many groups are left out of the political conversation: the disabled, the LGBT community, especially the transgender community\u2014no one talks about their needs. Immigrant rights groups and nontheists aren\u2019t represented. I want to have them be part of the conversation.\n\nPersons with disabilities have a notoriously lower engagement in civil life. They vote less, they don\u2019t volunteer, and they don\u2019t donate. A lot of the reason for this is transportation. If I were going to take a bus from where I live to the State Legislature in downtown Phoenix, it would take almost three hours. It would take about a half hour by car. If I\u2019m going to speak at a public hearing, I need to have someone drive me.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t really think about disabled people, well, wait a while. Eventually almost everyone has some sort of difficulty in their lives, even if it\u2019s just age. Making things more accessible helps everyone.\n\nTakePart: Your opponent, Rep. Matt Salmon, is an entrenched politician who opposes big government. You could have chosen an easier target\u2014why run against someone so established?\n\nWoods: For that very reason. I don\u2019t understand why anyone would be in politics if they think that government shouldn\u2019t do anything. So many people have become so disenfranchised with government, they think, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Especially in my district, everyone complains about Congress, yet they keep electing the same people. You don\u2019t like the way things are run?
