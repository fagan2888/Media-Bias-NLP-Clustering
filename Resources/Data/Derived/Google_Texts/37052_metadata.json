(NASDAQ:CMTL) announced today that it will be attending the ATA 2016 Annual Conference and that it has released a new version of its VirtuMedix\u00ae virtual care delivery platform, a telemedicine application. VirtuMedix enables healthcare practitioners to offer efficient, secure virtual patient care anytime, anywhere and on any device. This upgrade provides an enhanced user interface and experience (UI/UX) for patients who can now register and validate their price group ahead of the consultation. The Doctor interface has also been enhanced to indicate if the doctor has logged into the system from a mobile device. Furthermore, the Administrator interface now allows the Administrator to see and complete the patient and doctor profiles adhering to the requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\nWith an increase in demand from new patients as a result of the Affordable Care Act, providers and caregivers need a viable, cost-effective alternative to traditional care models. The VirtuMedix virtual care platform is an efficient and seamless way to provide care to new and existing patients. VirtuMedix was designed by clinicians with a focus on simple user interfaces and best-in-class platform security.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about this upgrade to VirtuMedix which will enable our physician groups to provide telehealth consultations directly to consumers as well as employer groups with specifically contracted price options. Additionally, it allows patients to take advantage of incentives such as \u201cconsultation coupons,\u201d said Dr. Stanton Sloane, President and Chief Executive Officer of Comtech Telecommunications Corp.\n\nDr. Bobby Park, MD, a Clinical Advisory Group Member for VirtuMedix, also stated, \u201cEmployer outreach is crucial and has become a key driver of successful telehealth offerings. Towers Watson projects that 71 percent of employers will offer online urgent care services by 2017. Physicians need to partner with local companies and build a clientele base. This will in turn increase the flow of patients, bolster revenue, and extend their reach to offer services statewide.\u201d\n\nVirtuMedix will be exhibiting at Booth 1715 at the ATA 2016 Annual Conference and Trade Show from May 14-17, 2016 in Minneapolis, Minn.
