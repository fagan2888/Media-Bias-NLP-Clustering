Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who is facing a tough re-election campaign this year and whose poll numbers suggest she has been hurt by her support of Mr. Obama\u2019s troubled new health care law. Mrs. Hagan\u2019s office said she will stay in Washington because the Senate is in session, an excuse that a CNN reporter at the White House daily press briefing likened to \u201cthe congressional equivalent of \u2018I can\u2019t go, I\u2019m washing my hair.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney bristled at the analogy and said Mrs. Hagan is \u201cworking on important business\u201d at the Capitol. He said the trip focused on the economy is not \u201can issue of electoral politics.\u201d\n\n**FILE** President Barack Obama speaks to the media before meeting with his ... more >\n\nBut with Mr. Obama far less popular than a year ago, and the flaws of Obamacare still a potential campaign issue, the president\u2019s team is well aware there may be more incumbent Democrats like Mrs. Hagan who are reluctant to stand on the same stage with him. Mrs. Hagan did appear with the president in October 2011 when he stopped in Asheville, N.C., and she made it back to Washington for votes later in the day.\n\nSEE ALSO: GOP moves afoot to rein in Obama\u2019s executive powers\n\n\u201cWith her political career on the line, Kay Hagan is suddenly too embarrassed to be seen with President Obama in North Carolina,\u201d said North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Claude Pope. \u201cNorth Carolinians know that despite Kay Hagan\u2019s efforts to hide from President Obama, she voted with his liberal agenda 96 percent of the time, enthusiastically endorsed him for re-election, and has been one of the strongest supporters of the Obamacare disaster.\u201d\n\nThe president will meet with Senate Democrats privately Wednesday night to discuss political strategy ahead of his State of the Union address on Jan. 28. Mrs. Hagan is expected to attend that session behind closed doors.\n\nAs he convened his first Cabinet meeting of the new year, Mr. Obama told reporters that struggling families cannot wait while Congress dithers with competing jobs bills.\n\n\u201cWe are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we\u2019re providing Americans the kind of help that they need,\u201d he said.\n\nBut House Speaker John A. Boehner told reporters Tuesday that it is Congress that is waiting \u2014 waiting for the president to cooperate on several bills that would create more jobs, after a dismal report on last month\u2019s weak job growth nationally. He said Mr. Obama should use his phone to call Congress.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, the president\u2019s taken his eye off the ball \u2014 taken his eye off of the issue of jobs,\u201d said Mr. Boehner, Ohio Republican. \u201cIf the president\u2019s serious about wanting to improve the prospects for our economy \u2014 and higher wages and better jobs \u2014 all he has to do is pick up the phone and call Democrat leaders in the Senate and ask them to move one of these dozens of bills that we\u2019ve sent over there that would help put Americans back to work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama vowed Tuesday to take more unilateral executive action to bypass Congress, and there\u2019s fresh evidence that Democratic lawmakers in this election year would just as soon avoid the president, too.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama vowed Tuesday to take more unilateral executive action to bypass Congress, and there\u2019s fresh evidence that Democratic lawmakers in this election year would just as soon avoid the president, too.", "title": "Obama vows more executive orders to advance agenda", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/14/aide-obama-plans-more-executive-orders-advance-age/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/14/c375f3f4fc33e801480f6a70670026fd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/14/c375f3f4fc33e801480f6a70670026fd.jpg", "description": "President Obama vowed Tuesday to take more unilateral executive action to bypass Congress, and there\u2019s fresh evidence that Democratic lawmakers in this election year would just as soon avoid the presi", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama vows more executive orders to advance agenda"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Congress, Senate, Kay R Hagan, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3bb\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Obama will promote \u201ca new public-private effort to boost advanced manufacturing,\u201d according to senior presidential adviser Dan Pfeiffer.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a pen, and \u2026 I\u2019ve got a phone,\u201d Mr. Obama said at his first Cabinet meeting of the year at the White House.\nHe said Mr. Obama should use his phone to call Congress.\nWith Mr. Obama\u2019s economic agenda stalled in the House, the president will demonstrate his executive authority Wednesday during a trip to North Carolina State University.\n\u201cAnd I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward\u201d to help middle-class families."}
