It also makes her the first Latina chief operating officer in county history.\n\nTapping Madrigal and Fuller for their new jobs was among Kafoury\u2019s first acts as the county\u2019s new chairwoman.\n\nOn Thursday, she lauded the pair for their leadership during a time of turbulence at the county following former Chairman Jeff Cogen\u2019s scandal-ridden resignation last fall.\n\nAfter more than seven years working as Cogen\u2019s chief of staff, Madrigal made a quick and unexpected ascension to power last fall, when Cogen stepped down following an extramarital affair with a county manager. As his designated replacement, she was appointed to serve in his place until voters elected Kafoury in May.\n\nDuring that time, Madrigal earned praise from colleagues for maintaining day-to-day order and passing a budget that leaves the county in the better financial shape than it has been for more than a decade.\n\nMadrigal said she would strive in her new job to maintain \u201cday-to-day efficient operations\u201d while pushing county employees to work \u201cat the top of their license\u201d and providing commissioners with timely, relevant information to help them make decisions.\n\n\u201cYou showed some leadership far beyond your years,\u201d Kafoury told Madrigal during Thursday\u2019s meeting.\n\nMadrigal replaces Fuller in the chief operating officer's job. Fuller vacated the post last October to lead the Health Department on an interim basis following then-director Lillian Shirley\u2019s departure to work for the state.\n\nKafoury called Fuller \u201cone of our most experienced leaders\u201d and praised her for stepping down from her post take over the Health Department during a time of \u201cimmense uncertainty and transition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have been a department head in most places in the county, and you have a great understanding of the working of the county,\u201d Kafoury told Fuller.\n\nWith her assignment now permanent, Fuller said she would focus on implementing the Affordable Care Act, overseeing the project to build a Health Department headquarters and fighting against federal cuts to public health funding.\n\n\u201cThose are the things that are on my short list,\u201d she said.\n\n--Kelly House", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "marissa madrigal, multnomah county, multnomah county news, news", "title": "Multnomah County commissioners confirm Marissa Madrigal, Joanne Fuller in new executive posts", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Multnomah County commissioners confirm Marissa Madrigal, Joanne Fuller in new executive posts\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/06/multnomah_county_commissioners_32.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/portland_impact/photo/15243099-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13230133\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-19T19:05:36Z\", \"author\": \"Kelly House | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@breaking-news\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@politics\",\"@portland\",\"marissa madrigal\",\"multnomah county\",\"multnomah county news\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/portland_impact/photo/15243099-standard.jpg", "creator": "@Kelly_M_House", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Madrigal has been named as Multnomah County's new chief operating officer, while Joanne Fuller becomes permanent in the Health Department director's post she has held since October."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, June 19, 2014, 12:05 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/portland_impact/photo/madrigalfullerjpg-e68bca6ca7a31c37.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"house-k\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kelly House | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"8888450\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Portland News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Madrigal has been named as Multnomah County's new chief operating officer, while Joanne Fuller becomes permanent in the Health Department director's post she has held since October.", "title": "Multnomah County commissioners confirm Marissa Madrigal, Joanne Fuller in new executive posts", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/06/multnomah_county_commissioners_32.html", "image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/portland_impact/photo/15243099-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelly.house.142"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, June 19, 2014, 12:05 PM", "article_author": "Kelly House | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "Description": "Madrigal has been named as Multnomah County's new chief operating officer, while Joanne Fuller becomes permanent in the Health Department director's post she has held since October."}, "article_summary": "The Multnomah County Board of Commissioners made Marissa Madrigal and Joanne Fuller\u2019s new executive posts official on Thursday.\nMadrigal replaces Fuller in the chief operating officer's job.\nIt also makes her the first Latina chief operating officer in county history.\nTapping Madrigal and Fuller for their new jobs was among Kafoury\u2019s first acts as the county\u2019s new chairwoman.\nFuller vacated the post last October to lead the Health Department on an interim basis following then-director Lillian Shirley\u2019s departure to work for the state."}
