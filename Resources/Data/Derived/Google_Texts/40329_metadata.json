Two of these have made it to the Supreme Court (three if you count Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius). In its 2012, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius decision, the Court upheld the ACA\u2019s individual responsibility requirement but seriously undermined the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults by making it a state option. King v. Burwell, which the Court will decide in the next couple of months, threatens to withdraw tax credits from millions of Americans who live in states with federally facilitated exchanges. And dozens of cases remain challenging the federal regulation accommodating religious objections to the provision of contraceptives \u2014 an issue likely to make it back to the Supreme Court at least one more time.\n\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v. Gilead Sciences\n\nBut, as reported here recently, the wave of anti-ACA litigation seems to have crested. The federal courts have in recent months dismissed a string of cases challenging the ACA, as the courts increasingly conclude that the issues raised by these cases are political grievances, not legal claims.\n\nHowever, as the wave of anti-ACA litigation recedes, a new wave (or perhaps wavelet) of litigation is appearing\u2013 litigation claiming the protection of the ACA rather than challenging it. On May 4, 2015, Judge Stewart Dalzell of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania District Court dismissed the case of Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v. Gilead Sciences, but in the course of doing so recognized important rights under the ACA.\n\nIn this case, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and several individual plaintiffs sued Gilead Sciences challenging the high prices it charges for its Hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. In addition to a number of state law claims, the plaintiffs claimed that Gilead\u2019s pricing scheme violated section 1557(a) of the ACA.\n\nSection 1557(a) provides that \u201can individual shall not, on [the basis of any protected ground], be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any health program or activity, any part of which is receiving Federal financial assistance, including credits, subsidies, or contracts of insurance or under any program or activity that is administered by an Executive Agency or any entity established under this title (or amendments).\u201d Section 1557 further references Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and thus prohibits discrimination in ACA programs on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability.\n\nAlthough the ACA has been in place for half a decade, HHS has yet to issue regulations implementing section 1557 (although proposed regulations are currently under review at the Office of Management and Budget). But section 1557 itself provides that the enforcement provisions provided by each of the statutes cited in section 1557 apply for violations of section 1557, and the courts are beginning to enforce it.\n\nThe plaintiffs in SEPTA claimed that Gilead\u2019s pricing violated 1557 because its pricing discriminated against persons with disabilities and had a disproportionate impact on minorities. The plaintiffs asserted that Gilead discriminated against the disabled because it charged more for its drugs to people in the United States than it charged abroad, charged more for individuals who are not part of health programs or plans that received discounts, caused health plans and programs to refuse access to its drugs, and denied access itself because of \u201cexcessive and discriminatory pricing practices, contracts and policies.\u201d The plaintiffs also claimed that Gilead intentionally discriminated against minorities by being indifferent to the fact that Hepatitis C disproportionately affects African Americans and because Gilead priced its drugs so as to make them inaccessible to African Americans.\n\nJudge Dalzell began by deciding that section 1557 authorizes private lawsuits to enforce its provisions. The language used by section 1557 is the kind of language long recognized as creating private rights of action under other civil rights statutes. Moreover, section 1557 expressly incorporates the remedies found in those statutes.\n\nBut, Judge Dalzell concluded, section 1557 also incorporates the various different standards and burdens of proof that are applied under the statutes that it references and which vary based on the protected class. Applying these standards, Judge Dalzell concluded that the plaintiffs failed to state a legal claim for disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs, he concluded, neither alleged that they were disabled (that is, that their Hepatitis C limited one or more major life activities) nor that Gilead excluded them from purchasing its drugs on the basis of a disability. He further concluded that the plaintiffs had neither alleged that they belong to a protected racial class nor that Gilead had intentionally discriminated in its pricing on the basis of race. Under well established law, private rights of action are only available for intentional racial discrimination, not for conduct that has a disproportionate impact on protected racial groups.\n\nJudge Dalzell further concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims of unjust enrichment, unfair trade practices, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing in its drug pricing were preempted by federal patent law, which allows patent holders to charge whatever price they want for patented products. The judge also, however, rejected each of the state law claims as not supported by the relevant state law. Judge Dalzell thus dismissed the case.\n\nRumble v. Fairview Health Services\n\nIn another section 1557 case, Rumble v. Fairview Health Services (decided on March 16, 2015), on the other hand, the plaintiff successfully staved off a motion to dismiss. The plaintiff, Jakob Rumble had sought treatment from the emergency department at Fairview Health Services for a painful genital infection. Rumble claimed that he was subjected to discrimination by Fairview and the doctors and nurses who treated him there because he is a transgender male. He sued under 1557 for sex discrimination and under the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or sex.\n\nFor Actions Under Section 1557, Multiple Standards Or A Single Standard?\n\nJudge Susan Richard Nelson of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota concluded that the facts alleged by Mr. Rumble stated a legal claim under section 1557. First, Judge Nelson decided, consistently with an opinion letter from the director of the HHS Office of Civil Rights, that section 1557 prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. But second, the judge concluded that section 1557 does not look to each statutory scheme it references for the evidentiary and causation standards to apply for each type of discrimination, but rather \u201cthat Congress intended to create a new, health-specific, anti-discrimination cause of action that is subject to a singular standard, regardless of a plaintiff\u2019s protected class status.\u201d This is, of course, contrary to the decision of Judge Dalzel in SEPTA, who had concluded that the standards that apply to each of the separate discrimination statutes referenced in 1557 should apply for claims based on that form of discrimination in a section 1557 suit.\n\nGiven the early stage of the litigation, Judge Nelson did not consider herself compelled to determine what the correct single section 1557 standard should be. She did conclude, however, that the defendants received federal Medicare and Medicaid funds and were thus subject to section 1557, and that Rumble adequately alleged that the physician and hospital\u2019s mistreatment of him rose to the level of a discriminatory denial of medical care and constituted an adverse action in violation of the sex discrimination prohibition. Although Judge Nelson concluded that Rumble had adequately alleged intentional discrimination, she observed that the Title IX requirement that intentional discrimination be proven may not apply under the single section 1557 standard to be defined later. The court also held that Rumble had properly asserted a claim under the Minnesota Human Rights Act.\n\nFinally, the District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana recognized in passing the presence of a \u201cnon-discrimination provision,\u201d that is section 1557, in February of 2014 in granting a temporary restraining order in a case claiming that insurers had discriminated against persons with AIDS by refusing to accept Ryan White program payments to cover their insurance premiums. More cases will undoubtedly follow.\n\nThe Coming Regulations\n\nIt is possible that the soon to be released section 1557 regulations will address the question of whether section 1557 adopts the separate standards of each of the nondiscrimination laws that it incorporates or adopts a single standard to apply to all forms of discrimination. If the regulation fails to resolve this issue, it will have to be resolved in ongoing section 1557 litigation. That litigation is now underway.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/05/06/implementing-health-reform-antidiscrimination-litigation-under-section-1557-of-the-aca/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tim-ACA-slide.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Implementing Health Reform: Antidiscrimination Litigation Under Section 1557 Of The ACA"}, "description": "Implementing Health Reform: Antidiscrimination Litigation Under Section 1557 Of The ACA | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6fa\"", "article_summary": "Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v.
