Way back. Back into time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo the period from about 1988 to 1998, specifically, when silky-voiced men who could also rap a few bars performed a style of R&B known as new jack swing, often while pneumatic women gyrated in the background.\n\nSound dated? Look or, more accurately, listen beyond the image. There are no MC Hammer pants or angular afros here \u2013 just huge, soulful beats and hooks that still sound terrific in a club (a reincarnation of the site that once hosted Sydney's mighty RNB Superclub, no less), as warm-up DJ Nasser T reminds us via the likes of pre-notoriety R Kelly, Will Smith back when he was gettin' jiggy wit it as the Fresh Prince and one-hit wonders such as Bell Biv DeVoe and Heavy D.\n\nBy the mid-1990s the American quartet Blackstreet were kings of the new jack swingers, and so it is with great relief to everyone that the current line-up refuses to taint this old-school party with any material after 1997. Indeed, their worst offence on this night might not be the regular backing of scantily clad female dancers but one oversung ballad too many towards the end.\n\nEither side of those, however, the more upbeat jams from their self-titled 1994 debut and its 1996 follow-up Another Level come together especially smoothly. Both individual opportunities and multi-part harmonies show off the singers' distinct voices while the band's DJ provides grooves that all but force you to dance.\n\nNone is hotter than the inevitable finale of No Diggity (well, until it weirdly turns into Tears For Fears' Shout). But debut single Baby Be Mine also skips along nicely, Fix has the various vocals intertwining seductively with their backing, and U Blow My Mind proves its worth restoring the tempo to a sensible speed after the various excursions into \"baby making\" music, as band co-founder Chauncey \"Black\" Hannibal described the ballads. (That said, Before I Let You Go is kind of irresistible, especially when it reaches its a cappella climax.)\n\nLiving in the past is, of course, not the healthiest pastime \u2013 and it's encouraging to know Hannibal isn't exclusively doing so, given his promotion of his new Sydney R&B label Kings Cross Records via support act Lily V. But if this evening proves one thing it's that the occasional trip back in time can be a lot of fun, too.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Music", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "No one is getting jiggy with the smooth sounds of the '80s.", "title": "Blackstreet review: new jack swing quartet happy to stay well in the past", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/blackstreet-review-new-jack-swing-quartet-happy-to-stay-well-in-the-past-20150419-1mo6sq.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2015/05/18/6540484/Thumbnail98546282gh3ydwimage.related.thumbnail.320x214.1mo6sq.png1431911151172.jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "cXenseParse": {"ffx-assettype": "article", "ffx-assetid": 98546282}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msvalidate.01": "3A0F8B0A5D246EFE15A2F9F975D1E623", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "No one is getting jiggy with the smooth sounds of the '80s."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc746\"", "article_summary": "(That said, Before I Let You Go is kind of irresistible, especially when it reaches its a cappella climax.)\nNone is hotter than the inevitable finale of No Diggity (well, until it weirdly turns into Tears For Fears' Shout).\nEither side of those, however, the more upbeat jams from their self-titled 1994 debut and its 1996 follow-up Another Level come together especially smoothly.\nAdvertisementTo the period from about 1988 to 1998, specifically, when silky-voiced men who could also rap a few bars performed a style of R&B known as new jack swing, often while pneumatic women gyrated in the background.\nBoth individual opportunities and multi-part harmonies show off the singers' distinct voices while the band's DJ provides grooves that all but force you to dance."}
