Ryker Pawloski. \u201cHe respected war fighters like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t fathom,\u201d agreed Corey Smalley, who shared a metal trailer with Routh at Camp Fallujah. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the picture-perfect Marine, even though that\u2019s what he wanted to be. And the people he looked up to the most were people like Chris Kyle. He always wanted to be those people - be the people that Marines from now on will always be talking about.\u201d\n\nRouth achieved that - but not the way he\u2019d hoped.\n\nThe 27-year-old stands charged with capital murder in the Feb. 2, 2013, slayings of the former Navy SEAL and his friend, Chad Littlefield. Kyle, who by his own count made more than 300 kills, volunteered with veterans facing mental health problems. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to a shooting range after his mother asked Kyle to help her son cope with post-traumatic stress disorder and other personal demons.\n\nRouth\u2019s attorney, Tim Moore, read a text message during the trial in which Kyle described Routh as \u201cstraight-up nuts.\u201d Family members have testified that Routh came back from his military service a changed man. He was hospitalized multiple times for mental health issues and had trouble keeping a job.\n\n\u201cI noticed that he kind of lost his desire for life,\u201d his uncle, James Watson testified.\n\nMoore said that when Routh killed Kyle and Littlefield \u201che was in the grip of a psychosis\u201d so severe he didn\u2019t know it was wrong and thought \u201cit was either him or them.\u201d\n\nErath County District Attorney Alan Nash described Routh as \u201ca troubled young man,\u201d but said mental illnesses \u201cdon\u2019t deprive people from being good citizens, to know right from wrong.\u201d\n\nAfter the killings, Routh\u2019s parents described a young man haunted by what he\u2019d seen in Iraq and earthquake-ravaged Haiti, and who sought relief at the bottom of a bottle. Many combat veterans say Routh exaggerated his experiences, and scoff at the notion that he saw anything that would cause PTSD.\n\nMen who served with \u201cRouthy\u201d in Combat Logistics Battalion 8 at Camp Fallujah in 2007-2008 concede he had a drinking problem, even before Iraq. And they don\u2019t recall their unit suffering anything overly traumatic.\n\nBut they say something must have happened to turn Routh from a gung-ho Marine into an alleged double killer.\n\nShortly after the unit reached Fallujah, Routh was ordered to Balad Air Base, where he helped guard Iraqi prisoners. Although Routh had no love for the captured fighters, Smalley said he was disturbed at how they were treated.\n\nHe told Smalley some guards would use the leashed prisoners\u2019 heads to push open the metal cell doors. \u201cAnd he just didn\u2019t feel like that was called for,\u201d Smalley told the AP.\n\nAmong Routh\u2019s most vocal doubters is the Warfighter Foundation, a nonprofit group whose mission is \u201cto empower combat veterans and their families through physical, mental, and emotional rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nAnecdotes and photos posted online by the group portray Routh as short-tempered and violent. Pawloski spoke with the group - on whose site Kyle\u2019s brother is an administrator - and supplied pictures, but said the information was taken out of context.\n\nPawloski said Routh did once body-slam him to a metal floor, but also apologized afterward and \u201cfollowed me around a little, to make sure I was OK.\u201d\n\nThe Warfighters said Routh brutally beat Cpl. David Hawley over a mock \u201cWANTED\u201d poster suggesting Routh was gay. Hawley told the AP that while Routh overreacted, it was nothing more than normal horse play. \u201cI mean, it wasn\u2019t no harm, no foul,\u201d he said. They shook hands afterward.\n\nOn the witness stand, Watson said his nephew was \u201cat times\u201d easily offended and then could get mad.\n\nFormer Erath County sheriff\u2019s deputy Gene Cole testified that while Routh was in jail, he heard Routh say, \u201cI shot them because they wouldn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d Cole said that Routh also noted he\u2019d been riding in the back seat.\n\nRouth\u2019s former comrades say they are speaking out to defend the Marine he once was. There\u2019s no need, Pawloski said, \u201cto demonize Routh even more so than he already did for himself.\u201d\n\nOne familiar part of Routh that has emerged, Smalley said, was that he confessed - and asked if he could apologize to the men\u2019s families.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to have an hour to just sit down with him and talk to him,\u201d said Smalley. \u201cI would put money on it, that he wasn\u2019t in his right mind. That there was something going on that, he made an unconscious decision to make that mistake.\u201d\n\nAll three men said they lost touch with Routh after Iraq, and had no idea of the turmoil he was in.\n\n\u201cNone of us who deployed with him know what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Pawloski said. \u201cWe want to know what\u2019s wrong, and we want him to get help. Because all of us kind of have the collective feeling of, you know, we let our brother down.\u201d\n\n___\n\nStengle reported from Stephenville; Breed is a national writer, based in Raleigh, N.C.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For those who served with Eddie Ray Routh in the Iraqi desert, the man on trial for gunning down the famed \"American Sniper\" Chris Kyle and a friend is not the Marine they had come to know.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "For those who served with Eddie Ray Routh in the Iraqi desert, the man on trial for gunning down the famed \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d Chris Kyle and a friend is not the Marine they had come to know.", "title": "\u2018American Sniper\u2019 suspect\u2019s ex-comrades mourn man they knew", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/22/american-sniper-suspects-ex-comrades-mourn-man-the/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/22/53e0f48b8abede086e0f6a706700699e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/22/53e0f48b8abede086e0f6a706700699e.jpg", "description": "For those who served with Eddie Ray Routh in the Iraqi desert, the man on trial for gunning down the famed \"American Sniper\" Chris Kyle and a friend is not the Marine they had come to know.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018American Sniper\u2019 suspect\u2019s ex-comrades mourn man th"}, "Author": "ALLEN G.
