Over the years it expanded to five locations, all of which will now close, the organization\u2019s CEO Eileen Durkin confirmed Friday.\n\nC4\u2019s closure comes as lawmakers debate Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s proposals to slash $82 million from mental health programs.\n\nDurkin acknowledged the cuts would have affected C4. But she blamed a billing issue as the reason for closure. After the center upgraded their medical records system as required by the Affordable Care Act, a glitch in the way the records and billing systems were linked prevented C4 from sending out bills last fall, she said.\n\n\u201cWe went for six weeks without being able to get a bill out the door,\u201d Durkin said. That all but cut off C4\u2019s cash flow, she said.\n\n\u201cLike a lot of nonprofits, we don\u2019t have a diversified revenue stream,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe pretty much live and die by our billing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the center\u2019s 2013 annual report and tax records, however, the center received $12.8 million in federal funding, $3.9 million from the state\u2019s Department of Public Aid and $1.06 million in Medicaid and Medicare client fees. It also received $388,000 in contributions and $179,000 in public grants.\n\nDurkin said she is working with the state to place clients with other mental health programs.\n\nChildren and adolescents receive half of the center\u2019s services, adults with mental health needs get another third and the remainder are treated for substance-abuse problems, according to the center\u2019s annual report.\n\nMental health care in Chicago was already limited. The closure in 2012 of six city-run mental health clinics sent many mentally ill patients to the Cook County Jail, critics say.\n\n\u201cPeople are sad and angry and frustrated,\u201d Durkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nBrian Richardson, deputy commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Public Health, said on Friday that the department is trying to make sure clients get the help they need.\n\n\u201cThe closing of C4 is very concerning as the organization plays a valuable role in Chicago\u2019s mental health system,\u201d Richardson said.\n\nThe transition of C4 patients isn\u2019t going to be easy, according to Amy Watson, associate professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s Jane Addams College of Social Work.\n\n\u201cThe other agencies don\u2019t really have the capacity to absorb anymore clients and for some people that means going outside of their community,\u201d said Watson. \u201cIt means developing new relationships. It\u2019s not realistic. There are going to be a lot of people that aren\u2019t able to reconnect to a provider, at least not in a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nWatson said C4 served many Hispanic patients, who will have a hard time finding bilingual services elsewhere. She called C4\u2019s closure \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are going to be stacked up in the emergency rooms. You may have some people that end up in the jail . . . because there\u2019s nowhere else to bring them,\u201d Watson said. \u201cSome people may die. It\u2019s just devastating all around and it\u2019s not really going to save money. It\u2019s probably going to overall cost more money.\u201d\n\nThat increased cost would come from emergency room visits, police and jail responses, she said.\n\nCook County Sheriff Tom Dart has long called the jail the \u201clargest mental health hospital\u201d where patients are \u201ccriminalized.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis closure will dramatically exacerbate the crisis felt by those suffering from mental illness who cannot access care,\u201d sheriff\u2019s office spokesman Ben Breit said. \u201cWe expect to immediately feel the impact of these cuts on our jail population.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>One of the largest providers of mental health services to poor North Siders is closing \u2014 just as the state braces for massive mental health care", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/devastating-closure-of-mental-health-centers-to-hit-10000-patients-next-month/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Devastating\u2019 closure of mental health centers to hit 10,000"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/devastating-closure-of-mental-health-centers-to-hit-10000-patients-next-month/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "\u2018Devastating\u2019 closure of mental health centers to hit 10,000 patients next month"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05fd\"", "article_summary": "\u2018Devastating\u2019 closure of mental health centers to hit 10,000 patients next monthOne of the largest providers of mental health services to poor North Siders is closing \u2014 just as the state braces for massive mental health care cuts.\nCommunity Counseling Centers of Chicago \u2014 which cares for more than 10,000 patients, including children \u2014 is closing its doors May 31 in a move mental health care experts say will be devastating for its patients.\nMental health care in Chicago was already limited.\nDurkin said she is working with the state to place clients with other mental health programs.\nThe closure in 2012 of six city-run mental health clinics sent many mentally ill patients to the Cook County Jail, critics say."}
