Or is that a formula for what I call kinder, gentler decline? Those are the essential questions beneath the pomp and ceremony of the State of the Union. And maybe the paradoxical answer to both questions is \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m always torn when watching a State of the Union speech. I agree with the vision of America that Barack Obama laid out. Trouble is, I\u2019ve agreed with it since I first heard Bill Clinton lay out the same vision when I followed Clinton into the White House as an aide in 1993. Yet in the years since, on virtually every metric progressives care about \u2014 save for expanded health coverage, once the dust finally clears from Obamacare \u2014 the measures of a good society have gone in the wrong direction.\n\nWages are stagnant or shrinking. School rankings have sagged. College and health costs have soared. Our rates of child poverty lead the developed world. Decent jobs remain scarce. The accident of birth weighs more heavily in dictating one\u2019s destiny.\n\nAll the compelling anecdotes or special guests in the chamber don\u2019t change that.\n\nWhen I hear Obama cry that no one who works full time should live in poverty in America, it\u2019s like Groundhog day. Can I be alone in this reaction? I want to play the split screen with Bill Clinton saying exactly the same thing. It made sense then. It makes sense now. So how long does a wealthy, sane nation need to fix this? If twenty years isn\u2019t good enough \u2013 two decades in which the economy nearly doubled in size in real terms \u2013 do we need 50 years? 100?\n\nWatch President Obama deliver his annual State of the Union address Tuesday night on Capitol Hill. (The Associated Press)\n\nThe president faces obvious constraints. But is the illusion of meaningful action really the most effective strategy? I get that the White House wants to signal that it can still \u201cdo things.\u201d I know the administration wants to use issues like the minimum wage to frame the midterm elections. Maybe their choice is understandable.\n\nAnd yet the real state of the union seems inescapable. In the face of enormous economic strains on the middle class, Republicans have no ideas, and Democrats have puny \u201cpen and phone\u201d ideas. The result is little progress, paired with a rhetoric-reality gap among Democrats that\u2019s rising even faster than our concentration of wealth.\n\nConsider some of the executive actions touted by the White House. The minimum wage measure is a big deal, even if it only applies to new federal contracts (and therefore to only a relative handful of workers). It\u2019s an important effort to lay down a marker about a decent minimal reward for work.\n\nBut a \u201csummit on working families?\u201d A review of federal job training programs six years into the president\u2019s tenure? Asking CEOs to (pretty please) consider hiring the long-term unemployed? \u201cMobilizing\u201d the private sector to offer more apprenticeships? Passing the tin cup to corporate foundations to help connect schools to the internet?\n\nLook, I\u2019m all for the bully pulpit. And these measures can surely do some modest good at the margins. But it is embarrassing for the leader of a great nation to be peddling these as meaningful \u201caction.\u201d Do foreign leaders watching think, \u201cWell, they\u2019re gridlocked, but one day they\u2019ll get their act together.\u201d Or do they think we\u2019re institutionally incapable of renewal?\n\nThe endless \u201csmall ball\u201d accounts for the malaise I felt midway into the speech. Even though the president looked strong and confident \u2013 he\u2019s always impressive and commanding in these venues \u2013 I felt as if America must be tuning out, because it felt like so much of the same old blah blah blah.\n\nFederal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, who many Americans have never heard of , will have far more influence on incomes, jobs and economic growth than President Obama in the next three years \u2014 and not just here in the U.S., but around the globe as well. There\u2019s something surreal about that. Maybe it\u2019s time we asked Federal Reserve chairs to give a State of the Union too.\n\nRead more from Matt Miller\u2019s archive or follow him on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Matt Miller, obama, barack obama, state of the union, speech, affordable care act, obamacare, health care, bill clinton, child poverty, school rankings, college tuition, health-care costs, wages, minimum wage, congress, janet yellen, economy, federal reserve", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The real state of the union is inescapable", "title": "Matt Miller: The real state of the union is inescapable", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-the-real-state-of-the-union-is-inescapable/2014/01/29/4ce56c14-88a8-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/29/Editorial-Opinion/Images/State_of_Union-00ae3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The real state of the union is inescapable", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-the-real-state-of-the-union-is-inescapable/2014/01/29/4ce56c14-88a8-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Matt Miller, obama, barack obama, state of the union, speech, affordable care act, obamacare, health care, bill clinton, child poverty, school rankings, college tuition, health-care costs, wages, minimum wage, congress, janet yellen, economy, federal reserve", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "4ce56c14-88a8-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee79\"", "article_summary": "Watch President Obama deliver his annual State of the Union address Tuesday night on Capitol Hill.\nAnd maybe the paradoxical answer to both questions is \u201cyes.\u201dI\u2019m always torn when watching a State of the Union speech.\nAnd yet the real state of the union seems inescapable.\nMaybe it\u2019s time we asked Federal Reserve chairs to give a State of the Union too.\nThose are the essential questions beneath the pomp and ceremony of the State of the Union."}
