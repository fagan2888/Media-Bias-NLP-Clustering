So angry, that he took to name calling when speaking about White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.\n\n\u201cBodies are on fire in the streets of Ramadi as we are speaking,\u201d McCain said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d \u201c[ISIS] is an evil \u2014 this is a transcendent evil that the President seems to dismiss it as \u2018We\u2019re not losing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe then called Earnest an \u201cidiot\u201d for saying Tuesday, \u201c\u201cAre we going to light our hair on fire every time there\u2019s a setback against ISIL?\u201d\n\nBill Hemmer called out McCain\u2019s name-calling, and the Arizona Republican immediately retracted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll retract that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating though to hear someone say [that]. That betrays everything that America believes in and stands for.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time McCain has done his best Grandpa Simpson impression:\n\nIn march, he resorted to some creative name-calling when discussing the Iran nuclear negotiations.\n\nAs one of 47 senators that sent a letter to Iran threatening to subvert negotiations, McCain said that the issue with the situation was how President Obama was classifying the \u201cagreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a treaty,\u201d McCain said, according to The Hill. \u201cThey can call it a banana, but it\u2019s a treaty.\u201d\n\nLead image via @SINow.", "article_metadata": {"home_name": "Sun-Times National", "description": "Sen.
