We often hear that you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet, but how much Ebola, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), Chagas disease, malaria, and tuberculosis is an acceptable price to pay to maintain Barack Obama\u2019s open-borders-\u00fcber-alles policy? These are relevant questions now, especially with a recent report confirming what was always just common sense:\n\nLittle Eli Waller will never grow up to be president. The four-year-old New Jersey boy will never grow up to be anything, because enterovirus D68 took his life \u2013 quite possibly because a boy who did grow up to be president, but not really a man, invited the virus into our country.\n\nThe deadly EV-D68 epidemic in America was likely the result of Obama\u2019s insistence on flooding our country with tens of thousands of illegal-alien minors.\n\nReports Neil Munro at The Daily Caller, \u201cThe evidence includes admissions from top health officials that the epidemic included multiple strains of the virus, and that it appeared simultaneously in multiple independent locations.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t something hard to prove or disprove. All you need do is ascertain if the strain prevalent in the U.S. is the same as one found south of the border. This is simple epidemiology, and there\u2019s only one reason we don\u2019t know:\n\nThe powers that be don\u2019t want us to know.\n\nCan you imagine the revolutionary uproar that would have ensued if, just when EV-D68 was big in the news, it had been revealed that Obama\u2019s lawless abdication of his responsibility had led to American deaths?\n\nCan you imagine what would be said if it were proven that Obama has blood on his hands?\n\nAnd let\u2019s consider the EV-D68 toll to this point. As Munro writes:\n\nSo far, that virus has been found in nine people \u2014 including at least three American kids \u2014 who died from illness. It has apparently inflicted unprecedented polio-like paralysis in roughly 50 kids, and it has put hundreds of young American kids into hospital emergency wards and intensive care units throughout more than 40 states. Most of the dead have not been publicly identified.\n\nThis, not to mention the toll taken by Ebola and the others diseases brought in by Obama\u2019s strengthening diversifiers.\n\nAnd how serious is the conspiracy of silence on the EV-D68 issue? Munro reports that a \u201cseries of government researchers, health experts and academics refused to comment, or else urged self-censorship, when they were pressed by TheDC for statistical and scientific data that would exonerate Obama and his deputies.\u201d One of these is Columbia University researcher and top EV-D68 expert Rafal Tokarz, who, as he put it, \u201cwould really rather not comment.\u201d Another is Professor Lone Simonsen, research director of George Washington University\u2019s Global Epidemiology Program, whose cop-out was \u201cI would just steer away from that \u2013 it is not helpful, so why bring it up?\u201d\n\nAnswer: because if Americans know that a given policy allowed EV-D68\u2019s spread, they\u2019ll realize the policy isn\u2019t helpful and needs to be changed.\n\nBut this certainly is not helpful to Simonsen. As Munro pointed out, perpetuating the invasion of our country \u201cis a top priority for the Democratic leaders, who have the power to make life difficult for grant-dependent American scientists who discover politically damaging information.\u201d\n\nMoney, by the way, is part of the root of today\u2019s scientific evil. As to the significance of this factor, consider that BMJ.com (formerly the British Medical Journal) reported in 2012, \u201cOne in seven UK based scientists or doctors has witnessed colleagues intentionally altering or fabricating data during their research or for the purposes of publication[.]\u201d (In case you were wondering, this is how you get Al Gorleone\u2019s gaggle of greedy global-warming gangsters.)\n\nSo we have here a confluence of scientific malpractice and political malpractice. And this brings us to Munro\u2019s quoting of scientist and Enterovirus Foundation board member Nora Chapman: \u201cEpidemics happen when populations mix, or when viruses mutate and combine to overcome peoples\u2019 evolved immune defenses[.]\u201d\n\nOr when populations are mixed.\n\nAs when a president seeds various parts of the country with his carriers and redistributes disease. Hey, why keep the epidemic all in one place?\n\nBut don\u2019t expend all your energy worrying about EV-D68 \u2013 save some of it for worrying about Ebola, of which scientists now predict there will be approximately 130 U.S. cases by year\u2019s end.\n\nAnd how many next year?\n\nHow much blood will Obama have on his hands then?\n\nIf you think the ObamaCare disaster is bad, wait 'til you see the one wrought by ObamaDoesn\u2019tCare.\n\nContact Selwyn Duke, follow him on Twitter or log on to SelwynDuke.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/11/does_barack_obama_have_blood_on_his_hands.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Does Barack Obama Have Blood on His Hands?"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe24\"", "article_summary": "Can you imagine what would be said if it were proven that Obama has blood on his hands?\nHow much blood will Obama have on his hands then?\nAs Munro writes:So far, that virus has been found in nine people \u2014 including at least three American kids \u2014 who died from illness.\nThis is simple epidemiology, and there\u2019s only one reason we don\u2019t know:The powers that be don\u2019t want us to know.\nThe deadly EV-D68 epidemic in America was likely the result of Obama\u2019s insistence on flooding our country with tens of thousands of illegal-alien minors."}
