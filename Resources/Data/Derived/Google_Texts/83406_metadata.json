That\u2019s about 12 percent of the total $95.2 billion the agency was allocated to respond to hurricanes, earthquakes and other disasters \u2013 and up from about 9 percent between 1980 and 1995.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nFEMA is routinely under scrutiny for the way it spends its money, as well as the way it doles out money to disaster victims. While there seems to be little or no accountability for the failures, taxpayers too often end up on the hook.\n\nThe GAO said FEMA has not met its own goals for cutting spending; if it had, \u201cadministrative costs could have been reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d The auditors added, \u201cFEMA lacks an integrated plan with time frames and milestones to hold senior officials accountable for achieving its goals to reduce and more effectively control costs. Such a plan could help FEMA to better oversee and control these costs.\u201d\n\nLawmakers who requested the report had harsh words for the agency. \u201cThe fact that FEMA spent $12.7 billion on administrative costs is unacceptable. FEMA should be spending money on vital assistance for those negatively impacted by disasters \u2013 not on excessive administrative costs,\u201d chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security Michael McCaul (R-TX), said in a statement. \u201cTaxpayers deserve responsible and effective disaster relief and the committee will continue to monitor FEMA\u2019s management of taxpayer funds\u2026\u201d\n\nGAO has routinely flagged FEMA for ballooning administrative costs. Earlier this year, auditors issued a similar report detailing the agency\u2019s spending practices. Between 2004 and 2011, for example, administrative costs made up about 18 percent of the budget.\n\nRelated: FEMA Still Doesn\u2019t Know Where Its Money Is Going\n\nSince then, GAO said FEMA has made an effort to reduce the costs \u2013 yet there\u2019s still room for improvement. In both reports, auditors suggested FEMA developed a new strategy with goals to reduce the percentage of disaster relief spent on administrative costs.\n\nFEMA concurred with the auditors\u2019 recommendations and said it would continue to look for ways to manage administrative costs. \u201cFEMA has prioritized improving administrative cost management and made reducing disaster administrative costs a performance goal in its Strategic Plan,\u201d Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Jim Crumpacker said in a written response to the GAO.\n\nThe new scrutiny over FEMA\u2019s spending practices comes as the costs of responding to natural disasters continues to climb. As we reported earlier, the costs of responding to natural disasters has doubled in the last two decades from $100 to $200 billion, according to an estimate by Munich-Re, the world\u2019s largest re-insurance agency.\n\nAnd while auditors are questioning FEMA\u2019s administrative expenses, the agency also routinely receives criticism for the way it administers disaster aid. For example, FEMA is currently trying to recoup about $5.8 million in disaster relief it improperly doled out during Hurricane Sandy. The agency has asked storm victims who are disabled, elderly and poor to repay thousands of dollars because they mistakenly received the aid two years ago.\n\nThat was not the first time FEMA botched its administration of disaster relief. The same thing happened during Hurricane Katrina in 2005; the agency is still trying to recoup some of those funds.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A federal watchdog has raised concerns about how much of the Federal Emergency Managem", "title": "FEMA Wasted Billions on Administrative Costs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/19/FEMA-Wasted-Billions-Administrative-Costs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/19/FEMA-Wasted-Billions-Administrative-Costs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A federal watchdog has raised concerns about how much of the Federal Emergency Managem", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "FEMA concurred with the auditors\u2019 recommendations and said it would continue to look for ways to manage administrative costs.\nIn both reports, auditors suggested FEMA developed a new strategy with goals to reduce the percentage of disaster relief spent on administrative costs.\nBetween 2004 and 2011, for example, administrative costs made up about 18 percent of the budget.\n\u201cFEMA has prioritized improving administrative cost management and made reducing disaster administrative costs a performance goal in its Strategic Plan,\u201d Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Jim Crumpacker said in a written response to the GAO.\nA federal watchdog has raised concerns about how much of the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s budget is going toward administrative costs \u2013 instead of disaster relief."}
