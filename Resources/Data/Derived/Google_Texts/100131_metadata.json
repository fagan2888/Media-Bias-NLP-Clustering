Curry St. in Carson City will close next week, according to Loreen Hautekeet of the locally-owned business.\n\nMike and Loreen Hautekeet have operated the business but after nearly two decades of holding out against box store competition, she said, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare \u2014 has taken a toll and closure is the result.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the unintended consequences,\u201d she said, noting the government\u2019s role isn\u2019t helping small drug stores survive.\n\n\u201cOur last day of business will be the 11th,\u201d she said, which is next Wednesday. On Tuesday, the pharmacy at North Curry and West William streets will be conducting its 17th annual Turkey Roundup from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m.\n\nThe firm has collected frozen turkeys, non perishable food items, cash and credit card donations to help families in need at Thanksgiving and will again this year. The donations are distributed through area food banks.\n\nThough Mike\u2019s Pharmacy is closing, it\u2019s selling the pharmacy\u2019s files to the CVS Pharmacy drug store firm, according to Loreen Hautekeet.\n\nRonni Hannaman, executive director of the Carson City Chamber of Commerce, said the closure will mean the only locally-owned pharmacy left in the city will be MedCare, but Loreen Hautekeet said Mike\u2019s was the sole such locally-owned and operated outlet because MedCare actually is a Fernley firm with a Carson City store. Hannaman said Mike\u2019s not only was locally owned, but \u201chas been good to this community and has lots of friends.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike\u2019s Pharmacy at 1007 N.
