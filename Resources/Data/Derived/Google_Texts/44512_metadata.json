But even with the wide range of services, Lanning struggles to make good money.\n\nLanning isn\u2019t unique. Many horse ranches and stables across the south metro face similar hurdles. Some owners say major issues \u2014 from rising hay prices to new housing developments popping up around their once middle-of-nowhere land \u2014 are putting the future of small horse stables in question.\n\nJust over a decade ago, Lanning started HHH Ranch as a simple boarding stable. But she had to begin thinking about other ways to make money and keep her ranch profitable when the recession hit in 2008.\n\nSome boarders began leaving their horses to Lanning, unable to afford them anymore. Although she took them in, the cost of caring for 19 horses is steep. Just feeding a horse for one year costs about $1,800.\n\nThe year 2008 \u201cwas a really, really tough year,\u201d she said, watching over a small group of Special Olympics athletes practicing their routine on her horses. \u201cI was trying to make it just on board and I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe tack room at the HHH Ranch.\n\nKeeping up with costs\n\nTracy Orr, owner of Sunnyside Stables in Rosemount, started adding extra services like a horse camp and public trail rides in the past seven years to keep up with the rising cost of hay.\n\n\u201cHay prices keep climbing,\u201d Orr said, \u201cso it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nKrishona Martinson, equine extension specialist for the University of Minnesota, said it\u2019s typically more profitable for farmers to grow corn and soybeans rather than hay. Nor has climate change helped with the growth of hay crops.\n\nBut the national hay market could be stabilizing in the near future. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is predicting one of the largest crops on record in 2014, Martinson said.\n\nHay is just one of the high-priced necessities needed to care for horses. New owners generally don\u2019t understand the cost of caring for horses, Martinson said, which can include boarding and housing, training, fencing, hoof care, vet visits and more.\n\n\u201cThe expense is so great that people probably have sticker shock when they go to a barn or go to buy a 5-acre little farm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that daily cost of maintaining and keeping that animal on the farm.\u201d\n\nYear after year, the price of caring for 40 horses continued to rise for Doug Oehrlein, the previous owner of Lone Rock Stable in Rosemount. To stay in the boarding business, Oehrlein had to downsize his stock to just 10 horses and move to a new space a few miles outside of Farmington.\n\nHe\u2019s not making any more money at the new ranch than he did at Lone Rock Stable, Oehrlein said, but the smaller size makes it easier to give the horses better care, which he said can be difficult to do at times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having ten kids,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take the day off.\u201d\n\nDevelopment woes\n\nBoarders at HHH Ranch can take a quiet horseback trot through the forest behind the stables and ride past a cornfield with stalks as high as a horse, trotting up small hills to catch a picturesque sunset.\n\nWhile the serene setting may feel like it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere, neighbors live just down the gravel road, and a handful of houses are set to be built just across the street from the ranch.\n\nThough Lanning isn\u2019t worried about developers buying her land, sprawl in the area could cause some issues for her ranch, she said.\n\nChildren are more prevalent in the area with houses sprouting up nearby, she said, which causes some concern about trespassing. But Lanning said she doesn\u2019t mind having more people around her land \u201cif we all get along.\u201d\n\nOther stable owners and riders in the south metro say housing developments have put many small stables out of business, as they\u2019re unable to dole out the dollars needed to stay.\n\nMartinson said urban sprawl and rising land values are likely the largest factors reducing stables in the metropolitan area.\n\nIn Dakota County, several places have been bought out for use as farms or developments, Oehrlein said. And that could lead to fewer people in the area owning stables or getting involved in riding, he said.\n\nDespite the obstacles, the chance to work with horses and do what they love every day usually outweighs the downside for stable owners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rewarding work. It\u2019s not digging ditches, it\u2019s not meaningless,\u201d Oehrlein said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely hard work \u2026 but at the end of the day, it\u2019s still fairly rewarding.\u201d\n\nMeghan Holden is a Twin Cities freelance journalist.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The rising price of hay, coupled with new housing developments spreading into the country, is putting the future of horse stables at risk.", "title": "South-metro stables struggle to stay afloat", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/south-metro-stables-struggle-to-stay-afloat/278080251/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141237761457018.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141237761457018.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The rising price of hay, coupled with new housing developments spreading into the country, is putting the future of horse stables at risk.", "title": "South-metro stables struggle to stay afloat", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/south-metro-stables-struggle-to-stay-afloat/278080251/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141237761457018.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141237761457018.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The rising price of hay, coupled with new housing developments spreading into the country, is putting the future of horse stables at risk."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd40\"", "article_summary": "Some owners say major issues \u2014 from rising hay prices to new housing developments popping up around their once middle-of-nowhere land \u2014 are putting the future of small horse stables in question.\nMartinson said urban sprawl and rising land values are likely the largest factors reducing stables in the metropolitan area.\nMany horse ranches and stables across the south metro face similar hurdles.\nOn any given day, Dawn Lanning\u2019s ranch just outside of Hastings is active with horse riding lessons, day camps, Special Olympics training.\nAnd that could lead to fewer people in the area owning stables or getting involved in riding, he said."}
