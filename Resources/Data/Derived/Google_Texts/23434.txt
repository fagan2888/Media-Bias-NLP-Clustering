Everyone loves a good smoothie. They’re an easy way to get in your daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables and, if you’re like this writer, to make use of all the produce that’s about to go bad in your fridge. Smoothies are especially great on those mornings you’re running late but don’t want to skip a meal or settle for fast food.

The thing is, not all fruits and vegetables or milks and spices complement each other. Sometimes, smoothie recipes incorporate only fruit, which can lead to consuming too much sugar. Others don’t have enough fiber or protein to keep you full; an hour after eating, you’re back in the kitchen for a second breakfast.

Lucky for you, we searched through recipes to find ones that combine the right amount of ingredients to keep you full and energized, or even help you fight a cold or an upset stomach. Enjoy!
