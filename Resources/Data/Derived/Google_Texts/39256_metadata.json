What I was really looking for was a locale where I would not be molested by hoodlums, upright citizens or lawmen. I was particularly concerned about the later cohort because the authorities in most good-sized communities, including Minneapolis and its suburbs, frown upon camping within city limits.\n\nWhile I wasn\u2019t sure where exactly to pitch my tent, I knew where I wanted to look: the 12-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between St. Anthony Falls in downtown Minneapolis to the Coon Rapids Dam. This is the mellowest run of the Mississippi in the Twin Cities, with a fraction of the pleasure boat and barge traffic found in St. Paul.\n\nThose factors appealed to me because I prefer a measure of solitude when camping, even \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2014 and especially \u2014 when camping in the city. Also I had limited faith in my vessel (a recently acquired, leaky $400 boat) and my motor (a balky 15-horsepower Evinrude).\n\nDespite lovely weather, the river was scarcely in use as I chugged to the north. Between the Plymouth Avenue Bridge and the Broadway Bridge, I came across the only moving vessel I would encounter: a speeding ski-boat with a trio of daredevils in tow.\n\nTrolling farther upriver, I passed the stately but decaying and graffiti-adorned Northern Pacific Railroad Bridge, the oldest bridge above St. Anthony Falls. In its shadow, a brightly colored tent was barely visible amid thick vegetation. Three scruffy fellows \u2014 presumably fellow campers \u2014 were lounging along the shore, fishing poles propped up on Y-shaped sticks.\n\nI waved cheerily, assuming these guys would take note of my camping gear, my fishing rods and my dog and recognize me as a kindred frontiersman. I was met with stone faces. Were they camping out of necessity, not novelty-seeking? Were they angry that my noisy little motor was scaring the fishes? Did they not care for my looks?\n\nHesitant to invite fiasco on such a pleasant afternoon, I chose not investigate. Pressing farther upriver, I came upon the vestigial remains of Minneapolis\u2019 industrial riverfront. I paused to shoot pictures at the Aggregate Industries dock, where vast quantities of sand and gravel are shipped on barges from Grey Cloud Island, unloaded and piled into mountains. Farther north, I putted by the American Iron metal shredder, which was noisily spitting out nuggets, which are hauled downriver by barge.\n\nJust north of the new Lowry Avenue Bridge, I came to the river\u2019s northernmost barge terminal \u2014 the soon-to-be shuttered, city-owned Port of Minneapolis. The infrastructure and business model at the port seemed to be collapsing in tandem. Nothing was happening that night, except that the fabric was peeling off the exterior of the salt-storage domes. It looked like the building was molting.\n\nOnce north of the Lowry Bridge and the Port of Minneapolis, the character of the river changed dramatically. With park land and the Minneapolis Water Works occupying the shorelines, the river took on a far wilder feel.\n\nSeveral clusters of small, sandy islands dot the river here. After investigating my options, I motored up to one such island. I had picnicked there a few years earlier but it had changed. Erosion and the loss of trees (likely from the north Minneapolis tornado of 2011) had shrunk the island at the margins, while the interior \u2014 once quite open \u2014 was overtaken with buckthorn.\n\nExhausted after clearing enough of the vicious weed to accommodate my tent, I answered a call on my cellphone. Two favorite friends had just ambled to the Camden Bridge and wanted to pop over to my private island for a visit. Returning to the campsite, I put them to work setting up my tent as I built a fire \u2014 an unexpected but fine side effect of camping so close to one\u2019s home and cronies.\n\nAs the sun dropped over north Minneapolis, we talked around the fire and noshed on the sausage and crackers. The crackle of the fire competed with the steady drone of Interstate 94. The constant noise from the interstate presented the only obvious evidence that our rustic interlude was taking place in the biggest city for hundreds of miles in any direction.\n\nAfter a few hours, I drove my friends to the mainland and commenced with serious business. Channel catfish dominate this stretch of the river, so I went with the most common tactic: chicken liver on a circle hook with a couple of heavy weights, tossed into swift water. By the time the dog and I crawled into the tent, I had landed and released four nice cats.\n\nIn the morning, I boiled up some coffee, broke down the campsite and loaded the boat. I was home by 10 a.m., with no vagrancy tickets or other misadventure to stain the memory. It is true I have had better camping trips. I\u2019ve also had much worse ones. But I never had one so convenient or \u2014 with a total cash outlay of $5 for gas and $3 for chicken livers \u2014 so cheap.\n\n\n\nMike Mosedale is a freelance journalist and longtime\n\nMinneapolis resident.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Looking for a midweek getaway, a city dweller loaded his boat with fishing and camping gear and set to floating on the Mississippi.", "title": "My urban excursion: A midweek getaway on the Mississippi", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/my-urban-excursion-a-midweek-getaway-on-the-mississippi/223514011/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464030998", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464030998", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Looking for a midweek getaway, a city dweller loaded his boat with fishing and camping gear and set to floating on the Mississippi.", "title": "My urban excursion: A midweek getaway on the Mississippi", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/my-urban-excursion-a-midweek-getaway-on-the-mississippi/223514011/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464030998", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464030998"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Looking for a midweek getaway, a city dweller loaded his boat with fishing and camping gear and set to floating on the Mississippi."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc7e\"", "article_summary": "As the sun dropped over north Minneapolis, we talked around the fire and noshed on the sausage and crackers.\nTrolling farther upriver, I passed the stately but decaying and graffiti-adorned Northern Pacific Railroad Bridge, the oldest bridge above St. Anthony Falls.\nThose factors appealed to me because I prefer a measure of solitude when camping, even \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2014 and especially \u2014 when camping in the city.\nThis is the mellowest run of the Mississippi in the Twin Cities, with a fraction of the pleasure boat and barge traffic found in St. Paul.\nAlso I had limited faith in my vessel (a recently acquired, leaky $400 boat) and my motor (a balky 15-horsepower Evinrude)."}
