The patients, who ranged in age from 5 to 20, had all been classified as overweight or clinically obese, and most had been referred to the clinic for treatment by their regular pediatricians.\n\nBut that usually harmless denial can also manifest itself in a more significant\u2014and more damaging\u2014way, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics . Specifically, the study lent more support to the notion that parents of obese children often fail to see their kids\u2019 weight as unhealthy, even after a doctor\u2019s diagnosis.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain type of parental pride that grows from just the right combination of willful ignorance, unflagging optimism, and impressive mental gymnastics. Junior\u2019s latest report card was less than stellar? Well, yes\u2014he\u2019s so smart that school just bores him. Little League game spent on the bench? The coach probably doesn\u2019t realize the talent he has on his hands.\n\nThe majority of parents, 93.5 percent, correctly recognized that their children were, in fact, overweight or obese\u2014but nearly 30 percent said they didn\u2019t see their children\u2019s weight as a problem, and roughly the same number rated their children\u2019s health as \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nThis dissonance, according to pediatrician and lead study author Kyung Rhee, may have to do with what she calls \u201cthe normalization of obesity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many kids who are overweight\u2014and so many adults who are overweight\u2014that a lot of parents just don\u2019t recognize it\u201d as a problem, she says (around one-fifth of U.S. children and one-third of adults are currently obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n\nIn the same survey, parents were also asked about what changes they had made or planned to make to their children\u2019s eating and exercise habits. Researchers then divided the parents into stages ranging from \u201cprecontemplation/contemplation\u201d (those who were not yet thinking about making changes, or had only just begun) to \u201caction/maintenance\u201d (those who had already made lifestyle changes and kept them up for some time). Despite the fact that they filled out their surveys inside an obesity clinic, 40 percent of parents hadn\u2019t yet made it to the action/maintenance stage in changing their children\u2019s diets, while 60 percent hadn\u2019t gotten around to encouraging more physical activity.\n\nThough the study was based on only a small participant pool, past research has also pointed out this glaring parental blind spot: An analysis of 69 separate studies conducted between 1990 and 2012, published earlier this year in Pediatrics, concluded that more than half of all parents underestimate their children\u2019s weight.\n\nIn the U.S., where the obesity rate has doubled among children (and quadrupled among teens) over the last 40 years, this lack of awareness has made its way down to the kids themselves. More than 40 percent of obese American kids are unaware they have a weight problem, the CDC recently announced.\n\nThe first step to getting overweight children on a healthier track, Rhee says, is getting their parents to take a healthier view of reality.\n\n\u201cWithout parents\u2019 involvement in this, it\u2019s pretty difficult for kids to change,\u201d she says. \u201cIn general, parents are the ones buying the food, parents are the ones setting the example.\u201d\n\nGiving up after-school Cheetos for celery stalks can be tough. Trading screen time for time outdoors can be even tougher. But this study is one more reminder than the most Herculean task may be getting parents to recognize a problem at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study found that even when parents recognize that their children are overweight, many fail to do anything about it\u2014or even to see it as a problem.", "author": "Cari Romm", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new study found that even when parents recognize that their children are overweight, many fail to do anything about it\u2014or even to see it as a problem.", "title": "Study: Many Parents Are In Denial About Their Kids\u2019 Obesity", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/shutterstock_11048371/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/study-many-parents-are-in-denial-about-their-kids-obesity/375023/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cf7\"", "article_summary": "Specifically, the study lent more support to the notion that parents of obese children often fail to see their kids\u2019 weight as unhealthy, even after a doctor\u2019s diagnosis.\nMore than 40 percent of obese American kids are unaware they have a weight problem, the CDC recently announced.\nBut this study is one more reminder than the most Herculean task may be getting parents to recognize a problem at all.\nThe first step to getting overweight children on a healthier track, Rhee says, is getting their parents to take a healthier view of reality.\n\u201cIn general, parents are the ones buying the food, parents are the ones setting the example.\u201dGiving up after-school Cheetos for celery stalks can be tough."}
