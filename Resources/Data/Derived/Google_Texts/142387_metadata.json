The former House majority leader assisted Republicans in taking over the House in the 1990s, helping write the conservative Contract with America before retiring in 2002. He then got involved with the tea party movement, becoming co-chairman of Citizens for a Sound Economy, which merged with Empower America to become FreedomWorks in 2004.\n\nIn his endorsement, Armey took a swipe at Osborn, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t need career politicians running because this is just the next rung on the ladder for them.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Nebraska Watchdog, Armey said he\u2019s endorsing Sasse because \u201cthe guy is amazing\u201d and shares his small government point of view.\n\n\u201cI think we should have a small government clearly focused on essential tasks,\u201d Armey said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a remarkable record of actually accomplishing things in education, in the private sector economy.\u201d\n\nHe also likes Sasse\u2019s opposition to Obamacare, which he called the biggest public issue of our generation.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt that he probably understands Obamacare as well as anybody alive,\u201d Armey said.\n\nSasse often says he read the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) and has made his opposition to the law the centerpiece of his campaign, making a video in which he called on members of Congress to live by the law.\n\nHe was even christened the anti-Obamacare candidate by the conservative news outlet Breitbart.com.\n\nWhich is why Armey said he found FreedomWorks\u2019 decision to endorse Osborn \u201ccurious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt struck me as a little peculiar because Osborn seems to be exactly the kind of Republican establishment candidate that they\u2019ve been averse to in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m baffled by that. It is not a choice that\u2019s consistent with their past behavior.\u201d\n\nHowever, FreedomWorks\u2019 vice president of public policy, Dean Clancy, said Armey\u2019s allegations \u201cmade me chuckle\u201d because in 2009, while Sasse was \u201coffering the Democrats advice on how to impose a government health care solution,\u201d Osborn was attending Tea Party rallies denouncing Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf anybody is an establishment candidate in this race, it\u2019s Sasse,\u201d he said. \u201cI would just say that Dick Armey should take a closer look as we\u2019ve tried to do.\u201d\n\nClancy said he\u2019s been following national health care policy for 20 years, and \u201cSasse may be able to wow people with his knowledge, but he can\u2019t fool somebody who has spent a lot of time studying these issues, as I have.\u201d\n\nClancy calls Sasse inauthentic, and says he\u2019s just positioning himself as the anti-Obamacare candidate for political reasons.\n\n\u201cOur reason for endorsing Osborn is that we think he\u2019s the true anti-Obamacare candidate in the race,\u201d Clancy said.\n\nFreedomWorks calls Sasse a \u201cMitt Romney-style technocrat masquerading for temporary political purposes an an anti-Obamacare firebrand.\u201d They accuse him of wanting to replace Obamacare with \u201cObamacare Lite.\u201d\n\nThey point to a 2010 BusinessWeek column Sasse wrote in which he said there was an emerging consensus that the individual mandating requiring all citizens to have health insurance might be a good idea. The central crux of the column, however, was on Congress rushing to pass a bad bill that wouldn\u2019t solve the problem.\n\nSasse supports universal coverage through premium support, but that\u2019s a top-down approach that only works with government coercion, Clancy said.\n\n\u201cHe calls it a market approach but you can\u2019t do it without mandates,\u201d he said.\n\nQuestions have been raised recently about Sasse\u2019s past support for the prescription drug benefit called Medicare Part D when he was assistant secretary of Health and Human Services in George W. Bush\u2019s administration. He now says he opposes the program.\n\nClancy cites a 2009 U.S. News and World Report column where Sasse said Medicare Part D was \u201cenormously successful,\u201d a \u201cpolicymaker\u2019s dream\u201d and a model for America\u2019s health care system. Sasse was no longer working for Bush when he wrote it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a top-down approach relying on coercion,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cHe was for Part D before he was against it.\u201d\n\nFreedomWorks calls Medicare Part D an \u201cunaffordable government program that added trillions to the nation\u2019s unfunded liabilities.\u201d\n\nIn the same column, Sasse also said Medicare Part D\u2019s \u201cpatient-empowering solutions\u201d would work better than the central planning, government price-setting and mandated coverage levels in the bill being considered in the Senate.\n\nClancy also cited a 2010 Fremont Tribune story where Sasse says Republicans didn\u2019t have the votes to repeal or defund Obamacare and called the law \u201can important first step\u201d in thinking about health care coverage.\n\n\u201cHe has a credibility problem when speaking about his desire to uproot Obamacare,\u201d Clancy said.\n\nOsborn, on the other hand, is a Milton Friedman disciple and an \u201cauthentic Tea Party conservative\u201d who\u2019s been involved in the movement from the beginning, Clancy said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just the real deal,\u201d he said.\n\nArmey disagrees with Clancy.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is not consistent with the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first awareness of him was his intellectually astute opposition to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHe suggested FreedomWorks isn\u2019t divulging the real reason they went with Osborn.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that\u2026they have a reason they do not want to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cI left there because I found their behavior curious, unexplainable and unacceptable so don\u2019t ask me to explain them.\u201d\n\nArmey and other conservative groups don\u2019t seem overly bothered by Sasse\u2019s stance on Medicare Part D.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Obamacare, and at the time he was serving under the president,\u201d Armey said. \u201cThere are many times you disagree with the position taken by the team.\u201d\n\nIn response to the brouhaha, Sasse\u2019s campaign manager Tyler Grassmeyer released a statement saying, \u201cBen knows more about Obamacare than any other candidate running for Senate today. He has crusaded against it since 2009, and anyone who say\u2019s he isn\u2019t a true anti-Obamacare guy is simply not paying attention to the facts.\u201d\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
