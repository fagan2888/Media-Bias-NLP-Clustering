CMS estimates that the proposed rule would reduce Medicare spending by $1.3 billion between 2015 and 2019.\n\nNegotiated prices: Among many other things, the proposed rule would revise the definition of \u201cnegotiated prices\u201d to require that all price concessions from pharmacies are reflected in these prices. Under the proposed rule, negotiated prices would mean prices for covered Part D drugs that: (1) the Part D sponsor (or other intermediary contracting organization) and the network dispensing pharmacy or other network dispensing provider have negotiated as the amount such network entity will receive, in total, for a particular drug; and (2) are inclusive of all price concessions and any other fees charged to network pharmacies; and (3) include any dispensing fees; but (4) exclude additional contingent amounts, such as incentive fees, only if these amounts increase prices and cannot be predicted in advance; and (5) may not be rebated back to the Part D sponsor (or other intermediary contracting organization) in whole or in part.\n\nProtected classes of drugs: The rule would also modify CMS\u2019s interpretation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cdrug categories or classes of clinical concern\u201d requirement. Instead of mandating coverage of all drug products in a particular class on all Part D formularies, CMS would limit protected classes to those meeting criteria established under the regulation. The proposed criteria would result in formulary inclusion of all drugs within the antineoplastic, anticonvulsant, and antiretroviral drug classes (subject to proposed exceptions), but the rule would not require all drugs from the antidepressant and immunosuppressant drug classes to be included on all Part D formularies. While antipsychotics would not meet the criteria, CMS proposes that they remain protected at least through 2015 to ensure that CMS has \u201cnot overlooked a need for any transitional consideration.\u201d\n\nPreferred pharmacies: Rules would also shift for \u201cpreferred pharmacies\u201d within Part D plans\u2019 pharmacy networks. CMS would allow Part D sponsors to reduce copayments or coinsurance at such pharmacies only if they offer consistently lower negotiated prices than are available from other pharmacies in the pharmacy network. CMS also proposes to modify the \u201cany willing pharmacy\u201d requirement to require plan sponsors to contract with any willing pharmacy able to meet one set of the terms and conditions offered by that plan for that type of pharmacy.\n\nContracted network rules: Under the new regs, a Part D sponsor must offer and publicly post standard terms and conditions for network participation for each type of pharmacy in its contracted network, and (1) may not require a pharmacy to accept insurance risk as a condition of participation in the PDP sponsor's contracted pharmacy network, and (2) must offer payment terms for every level of cost sharing offered under its plans (consistent with CMS limitations on the number and type of cost sharing levels) and for every type of similarly-situated pharmacy.\n\nPrescribing rights: CMS also seeks the right to revoke a physician\u2019s or eligible professional\u2019s Medicare enrollment if he or she has an abusive pattern of prescribing Part D drugs and represents a threat to beneficiary health and safety, or otherwise fails to meet Medicare requirements, or if the prescriber\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) certificate of registration or state license is suspended or revoked. The rule also would require that prescribers of Part D drugs enroll in Medicare as a condition of coverage for their prescriptions.\n\nOther proposed changes in the rule include: Limit prescription drug plans sponsors to offering no more than two Part D plans in the same service area; implement an ACA requirement that MA plans and Part D sponsors report and return identified Medicare overpayments; and establish U.S. citizenship and lawful presence as an eligibility requirement for enrollment in MA and Part D plans.\n\nCMS will accept comments on the proposed rule until March 7, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/sweeping-changes-2015-medicare-advantage-part-d-regs", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "This week, CMS released a proposed rule that would make significant revisions to the Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug program regulations.
