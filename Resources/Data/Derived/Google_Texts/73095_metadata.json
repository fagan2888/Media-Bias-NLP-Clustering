Evgeny Kuznetsov scored the lone goal in the tiebreaker, and the Capitals escaped with a 3-2 victory Saturday.\n\n\u201cI looked at that game as hopefully a playoff series at some point,\u201d Washington coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cTwo very good hockey teams that mirror each other in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nBraden Holtby had 30 saves for the Capitals, who registered their season-high fourth consecutive win and earned a split of the season series. Each team won twice on its own ice.\n\nThird-place Washington now trails New York by four points in the extremely tight Metropolitan Division.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the better teams we\u2019ve played all year,\u201d Islanders center John Tavares said.\n\nWith the exception of a third-period fight between Washington\u2019s Tom Wilson and Matt Martin, neither team took a penalty after the first period. Defense was a priority, there were precious few breakaway chances and the goaltending was solid.\n\nJust like in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt was great for us, the way we battled today,\u201d said Eric Fehr, who scored his 17th goal to give the Capitals a temporary lead in the third period.\n\nAfter the Islanders forced overtime by scoring with goaltender Chad Johnson on the bench, Kuznetsov followed overtime by beating Johnson on the first attempt of the shootout. Holtby subsequently denied all three New York tries, the last by Ryan Strome.\n\n\u201cWe obviously couldn\u2019t help our goalie out in the shootout,\u201d Tavares said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any past Holtby.\u201d\n\nThe Islanders were 12-1 in games decided after regulation, including 7-1 in shootouts. But they didn\u2019t have much to lament after this one.\n\n\u201cThat was a great game,\u201d New York coach Jack Capuano said. \u201cI really liked the things that we did. It would have been unfortunate not to walk out of here with at least a point. Our guys battled.\u201d\n\nFehr put the Capitals up 2-1 at 14:26 of the third period, scoring at the end of a give-and-go exchange with teammate Brooks Laich. That snapped a deadlock that had been in place since late in the first period.\n\nAfter Capuano pulled Johnson, Tavares bounced a shot in the crease off the right post. But the Islanders retained possession, and Strome put in a rebound from the left circle at 19:12 to force overtime.\n\nHoltby and Johnson remained strong right up until the end. Johnson has spent the season serving as the backup to Jaroslav Halak, but on this day he put in a performance that was anything but second-rate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like anything else \u2014 the more you play, the better you play,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cHe gave us a chance.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s Nicklas Backstrom earned an assist for his league-leading 64th point, breaking a tie with Patrick Kane of Chicago.\n\nNew York took a 1-0 lead at 7:41 of the first period on a wrist shot by Travis Hamonic, his 100th career point. It was Hamonic\u2019s fourth goal of the season, the first since Nov. 26 against Washington.\n\nMatt Niskanen tied it at 19:19 with slap shot from the right circle off a behind-the-net pass from Backstrom, who registered his 46th assist and seventh point in his last four games.\n\nWashington outshot New York, 10-7, in a scoreless second period during which neither team was called for a penalty.\n\nEarly in the third period, Holtby skated across the crease to kick away a shot by Josh Bailey, who had taken a crossing pass from Tavares.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A showdown between the first-place Islanders and surging Capitals had all the elements of a postseason game, with one notable exception: The ending.
