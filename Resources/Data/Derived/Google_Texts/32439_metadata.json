In fact, as I argued recently, we don\u2019t even need it anymore since we\u2019ve given the media tacit permission to lie to us every other day of the year already. But every now and again, against all odds, someone manages to pull off an actually funny prank that teaches us the most important April Fools\u2019 Day lesson of all: Love.\n\nAlso that everyone is stupid.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened with this NPR post on their Facebook page on Monday. \u201cWhy Doesn\u2019t America Read Anymore?\u201d the headline asked. It\u2019s a question that many of us who toil in the bowels of the word-caves where the content is mined ask on a daily basis. An even more infuriating question: Why do people online comment without reading the story? Not that that sort of thing ever goes on around here, where the discussion forms are vibrant and teeming with well-considered takes on the specific issue at hand and definitely not an infinitely recycled deluge of Obamacare cliches.\n\n\u201cIn an age of readily available information and countless ways to get it,\u201d NPR\u2019s post teased, \u201cwe seem to be losing touch with our powers of comprehension.\u201d\n\n\u201cYES. SO MUCH THIS,\u201d you might have thought had you seen the post, before promptly launching into your preformed set of talking points. Many readers, although that\u2019s probably not the right term, did just that [screengrab via Uproxx]:\n\nHad they actually taken the time to click on the link, they would\u2019ve found the following:\n\nCongratulations, genuine readers, and happy April Fools\u2019 Day! We sometimes get the sense that some people are commenting on NPR stories that they haven\u2019t actually read. If you are reading this, please like this post and do not comment on it. Then let\u2019s see what people have to say about this \u201cstory.\u201d Best wishes and have an enjoyable day, Your friends at NPR\n\nThe lesson here? It\u2019s either that NPR is wasting your tax dollars on denigrating the American character, or that this is exactly why we need services like NPR in the first place. But you were probably already thinking that anyway long before you read this story.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Luke O\u2019Neil is a journalist and blogger in Boston.
