Roberts had thrown his hat in the ring, saying he wanted to inject a little competition into the race.\n\nA week later, sitting Mayor Kendall W. Lane made it official: He\u2019ll be running for a third term.\n\nAgainst Lane, a Keene native who worked for decades as an attorney in the city and as a N.H. state representative before running for mayor in 2011, Roberts has shaken up a race that, for several election cycles, has yielded few surprises.\n\nThe Wyoming native was the sole supporter of the proposal to keep the Keene Pumpkin Festival going before its cancellation, and has been a vocal presence as vice chairman of the city council\u2019s finance and personnel committee.\n\nA retired lieutenant colonel with the U.S. Marines, Roberts is in his fourth term as a Keene city councilor. He also represents Keene in the N.H. House as a Democrat, and serves as a member of the Keene Board of Education.\n\nKeene\u2019s mayor presides over city council meetings, makes appointments to committees and directs certain city priorities.\n\nCouncilors say they\u2019re looking forward to a debate between two candidates, who are on similar footing in terms of experience.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both equally qualified,\u201d councilor Randy L. Filiaut said Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think the city would lose either way.\u201d\n\nThe last time Filiault said he remembers a strongly contested a race was the 2007 election.\n\nIn that race, former city councilor and planning board chairman Bill Beauregard won a crowded primary and ran against six-year city councilor Dale Pregent to fill the seat left open when four-term Mayor Michael E.J. Blastos retired.\n\nSince then, competition has been slim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit since we had two equally qualified candidates,\u201d Filiault said.\n\nPregent ran unopposed for a second term and remained mayor until 2011.\n\nWhen Lane, then a city councilor, ran for the office in 2011, his only opponent was Cheshire TV producer Rick Blood, who told The Sentinel that year that he was running only to prevent a one-man race.\n\nIn 2013, Lane won a second term against Darryl W. Perry, who received only 168 votes to Lane\u2019s 1,683.\n\n\u201cCompetition is always good,\u201d Councilor Bettina A. Chadbourne said Tuesday. \u201cI think there should be more people running in general for the mayor\u2019s position, and for City Council.\u201d\n\nChadbourne said she welcomes new candidates but has not officially decided which candidate for mayor she will endorse. She said she believes the 15-member council is split on who it will support.\n\nFiliault said he remains undecided.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of torn down the middle,\u201d he said.\n\nCouncilor Mitchell H. Greenwald said he\u2019s prepared to support Lane in his run for re-election.\n\n\u201cI think Kendall has been an excellent mayor,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cI see no reason to make a change.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a slap at Kris, I\u2019m just looking at what the best options are.\u201d\n\nEither way, Filiault said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be interesting, definitely.\u201d\n\nNathaniel M. Stout, a former city councilor, said he is glad to see a healthy contest among mayoral candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to have good circulation at that level,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that any candidates for mayor will need to focus on the looming task of replacing longtime City Manager John A. MacLean, who announced last month that he will retire in October after 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re filling John\u2019s position should be foremost in any mayoral candidate\u2019s mind,\u201d Stout said.\n\nStout, who as a councilor pushed for a campaign financing ordinance that would have required mayoral candidates to disclose their funding sources, said he doesn\u2019t see this year\u2019s race as particularly partisan.\n\nWhile Lane is a Republican and Roberts a Democrat, Stout says he sees both as being fairly \u201cmiddle-of-the road.\u201d\n\nBut partisan or not, he said Roberts\u2019 decision to run will make the race fun to follow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to know that there will be some conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe final decision will be up to city voters, who will go to the polls in November to cast ballots for both mayor and city council members.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "Though the official filing period won\u2019t start until next month, members of the Keene City Council already have their eyes on a mayoral race that could be one of the more competitive contests for the office in recent memory.", "title": "Keene councilors gear up for \u2018interesting\u2019 mayoral race", "url": "http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/keene-councilors-gear-up-for-interesting-mayoral-race/article_6a01ad17-d304-52c4-b06e-329e96d8f910.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/98/e989e082-3636-515b-a606-2ddb53372da8/55a9a09f9141a.preview-100.jpg?resize=200%2C292", "height": 292}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sentinelsource", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Though the official filing period won\u2019t start until next month, members of the Keene City Council already have their eyes on a mayoral race that could be one of the more competitive contests for the office in recent memory.", "fb": {"app_id": 195134749461}, "keywords": "local,top_story", "google-site-verification": "oOCA50_TAAjdvXwxVnDnOs5yS_kZUqHI6u4prlFHnH4", "news_keywords": "local,top_story"}, "article_summary": "A retired lieutenant colonel with the U.S. Marines, Roberts is in his fourth term as a Keene city councilor.\n\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re filling John\u2019s position should be foremost in any mayoral candidate\u2019s mind,\u201d Stout said.\nThough the official filing period won\u2019t start until next month, members of the Keene City Council already have their eyes on a mayoral race that could be one of the more competitive contests for the office in recent memory.\nBy mid-June, City Councilor Kris E.
