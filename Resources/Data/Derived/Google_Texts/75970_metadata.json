President Obama rightfully spoke out against police brutality and racism. He spoke out about the Trayvon Martin incident and established a commission to tackle the discrimination and police brutality practices within law enforcement.\n\nI feel compelled to tell you these things in the interest of fairness, honesty, objectivity and balance. And all of us, regardless of color or political party, should be willing to give credit where credit is due. I must say I voted for Obama because he was the better choice over McCain and over Romney. There was no other candidate to vote for in the general election and like many of you, I believed having a man of color in the highest office in the land would open doors for our children. President Obama represented hope, change and fresh new ideas. Or did he?\n\nEvery coin has two sides and it seems many Caucasian people looked only at the bad sad while most of our people looked only at the good. Unlike either side, my only agenda is the truth. But now it\u2019s time for the bad news which has become obvious to any of our people who have any sense, do any research or honestly face the facts. Under President Obama, there are more African Americans on government entitlement programs (like food stamps) than ever before. Under President Obama, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was signed and implemented in 2011, interfering with the constitutional rights of American citizens.\n\nUnder President Obama unemployment rates in the African American community have risen. And a little research will prove to you that the heath care plan was originally Hillary\u2019s plan \u2013 not President Obama\u2019s. That makes for an interesting mix with Michelle Obama reportedly on the Board of Directors for various hospitals. But while we are the topic of the first lady, I should also address a rumor floating around the web about the disbarring of both Michelle and Barack Obama as attorneys. According to sources (see link following), they both voluntarily inactivated their licenses so they would not have to take continuing education classes and pay annual fees for licenses they were not using and either can reactivate their license and practice. Click the link to see the facts. http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/the-obamas-law-licenses/ However, according to other sources, that is not exactly how things played out. Click the following link to see the other side for yourself. http://www.thelastgreatstand.com/michelle-obama-both-disbarred-anyone-shocked/\n\nThen there is Frank Marshall Davis, the socialist who appeared to be involved with President Obama\u2019s mother and heavily influenced our president\u2019s thinking. Clearly our president\u2019s talk of redistribution of wealth and punishing the rich are socialist principles. Ask any socialist and he/she will tell you that. Then there are the drone aircraft used to \u201cexterminate\u201d people from other countries with no trial at all, taking flight on President Obama\u2019s watch. Then there are the tax cuts that President Obama said were targeted towards the rich, only for us to find the taxes he spoke of would start at the middle class. There is also President Obama\u2019s strange rise to power \u2013 unseating a veteran African American politician for the state senate seat in Illinois and seemingly coming almost out of nowhere.\n\nThen there is the president\u2019s birth certificate, the nurse who oddly enough remembered him being born in Hawaii over 50 years ago (what a memory) and the slips of the tongue which appear to admit Obama was born in Kenya. But for most of you, these things were ignored, overlooked or disbelieved. Yet I cannot overlook these things because our people are important to me, our prosperity, our safety and those we trust to be the catalysts of change, the right kind of change.\n\nToday we know President Obama claims to be Christian and his father was Muslim. Ironically, Barack Obama does not represent the moral or spiritual value system of either belief system. Pushing the homosexual agenda, pushing the intrusion of bigger and bigger government into your lives, pushing the Pro Choice agenda so millions of unborn African American children will not be allowed to live and that\u2019s not all. Have our people traded our spirituality and morality for the color of a president who looks like us? YOU NEED TO RESEARCH THE RECORD FOR YOURSELF and realize that color unfortunately does not mean loyalty or allegiance.\n\nSelf-proclaimed \u201cChristian\u2019 President Obama recently told the American people with spiritual beliefs against homosexuality that you need to change your thinking. In essence, this is to say forget the Bible, your religious or spiritual beliefs are wrong and need to be changed. Here is the quote and you can click the link thereafter to read his shocking statements for yourself. Keep in mind our population is dropping from crime, incarceration, disease, abortion and homosexuality. Will there be any of us left?\n\nAccording to the site below, President Obama states \u201cThose who disagree with the idea of gay marriage based, for example, on their religious views, must change to be more like progressives who accept gay marriage.\u201d So I ask you, how can these words be uttered by a Christian when the Bible clearly speaks against homosexuality? And this time there is no explaining his position away or hiding it behind color.

But this article is not about George Bush. Nor is it about a comparison between President Obama and any other president \u2013 Reagan, Clinton, Lincoln etc. Too many people have used those comparisons to misdirect the issue here so let\u2019s stay on point. Here is maybe the hardest pill to swallow. They gave us a president who looks like us and talks like many of us so most of our people assumed he is one of us in both color and value system. Not exactly true and we are seeing that more and more day by day. President Obama is a team player \u2013 the question is for what team? Or were we given a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing simply to pacify, quiet down and control the African American community in this country? Time does not need to tell because actions have already answered these questions.\n\nOur people must learn to vote for a president who will represent our beliefs and those courses of action that will prosper our people in every way possible. We cannot afford to vote a man in based on color while sacrificing our spirituality and our morality. And maybe most importantly, our people must realize that our future is largely up to us, not a president. The president is neither a king nor a savior nor a magician. If you want change, YOU make it happen.\n\nStaff Writer; Marque-Anthony\n\nMore Articles:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "language": "en"}, "article_summary": "You are here: Home Christian Talk / President Obama: Has He Really Helped Our People?\nPresident Obama: Has He Really Helped Our People?\nAnd a little research will prove to you that the heath care plan was originally Hillary\u2019s plan \u2013 not President Obama\u2019s.\nNor is it about a comparison between President Obama and any other president \u2013 Reagan, Clinton, Lincoln etc.\nhttp://www.thelastgreatstand.com/michelle-obama-both-disbarred-anyone-shocked/Then there is Frank Marshall Davis, the socialist who appeared to be involved with President Obama\u2019s mother and heavily influenced our president\u2019s thinking."}
