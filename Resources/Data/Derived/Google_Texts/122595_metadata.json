But Harris' spokesman, Nicholas Pacilio, said that attorneys general from several states have been participating in regular conference calls on the subject.\n\nIn September, Better Business Bureaus nationwide warned that fraudulent telemarketers were calling consumers pretending to offer information about the Affordable Care Act in an effort to obtain personal information for identity theft.\n\nIn the California case, the websites used names meant to evoke the state's own insurance exchange, Harris said.\n\nConsumers who used Internet search programs such as Google to find the Covered California site were presented with ads for the fake sites instead, some of them using the exchange's logo and using its name.\n\nBut instead of directing users to the site of the state's insurance exchange, where they could purchase policies approved under the new law and possibly qualify for a federal subsidy, the ads took consumers to the websites of private insurance companies and brokers.\n\nHarris warned consumers who wish to sign up to go directly to the state's site. She said policies offered outside the exchanges may not have the consumer protections required by the Affordable Care Act and may not be eligible for subsidies.\n\nHarris did not disclose the names of the businesses involved, other than to list the now-shut website names.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Authorities in California shut down 10 fake Obamacare websites, amid nationwide concern among law enforcement officials about potential fraud during the program's rollout, the state's attorney general said on Thursday.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/california-takes-down-10-fake-obamacare-websites-2d11591128", "type": "article", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/november/131114/2d9688465-2013-11-14t193413z_1_cbre9ad1idc00_rtroptp_3_usa-healthcare-technology.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Authorities in California shut down 10 fake Obamacare websites, amid nationwide concern among law enforcement officials about potential fraud during the program's rollout, the state's attorney general said on Thursday."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Authorities in California shut down 10 fake Obamacare websites, amid nationwide concern among law enforcement officials about potential fraud during the program's rollout, the state's attorney general said on Thursday.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/november/131114/2d9688465-2013-11-14t193413z_1_cbre9ad1idc00_rtroptp_3_usa-healthcare-technology.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "California takes down 10 fake Obamacare websites - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-14", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/california-takes-down-10-fake-obamacare-websites-2d11591128", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Tech,Security"}, "article_summary": "\"These websites fraudulently imitated Covered California in order to lure consumers away from plans that provide the benefits of the Affordable Care Act,\" Harris said in a statement.\nA man looks over the legitimate Affordable Care Act signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York on Oct. 2.\nThe extent of fraud related to the Affordable Care Act is not yet clear.\nShe said policies offered outside the exchanges may not have the consumer protections required by the Affordable Care Act and may not be eligible for subsidies.\nIn the California case, the websites used names meant to evoke the state's own insurance exchange, Harris said."}
