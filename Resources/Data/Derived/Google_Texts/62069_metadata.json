Insurance companies Anthem Inc. and Premera Blue Cross both were hit by hackers earlier this year, in separate incidents that together exposed more than 90 million medical records to criminals.\n\nSpurred on by the Affordable Care Act and the U.S. government, health care providers are beginning to store more and more patient records on computers, in the form of electronic health records.\n\nMore than 528,000 health care providers and hospitals had registered in federal incentive programs for electronic health records as of February 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services.\n\nThese electronic records mean that \"doctors in hospitals have access to full health records where and when they need them and to have all of the information about all of the patients all of the time,\" Liu said.\n\nThe records also give researchers a chance to tackle \"some of our biggest health challenges by analyzing massive amounts of data for breakthroughs in treatment, prevention or prediction of illness,\" he added.\n\nUnfortunately, the increased use of electronic health records also exposes personal medical data to the same sort of cybersecurity threats that other industries and services have long faced, Blumenthal said.\n\n\"What's happening now is that the medical world is catching up with the rest of the world,\" he said. \"That means that health data is now potentially insecure in the same way that your credit card and financial data has been insecure for quite a long time.\"\n\nIn their study, Liu and his colleagues evaluated an online database maintained by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that lists data breaches of unencrypted health information, as reported by health plans and physicians under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.\n\nHIPAA requires that patient medical information be protected, and that breaches affecting 500 or more individuals be reported, Blumenthal said.\n\nThe study authors identified 949 breaches affecting 29.1 million records. Six breaches involved more than 1 million records each, and the number of reported breaches increased over time, rising from 214 in 2010 to 265 in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"About 5.1 million people in the U.S. have heart failure; about half die within five years of diagnosis.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Researchers call for enhanced security as more patient information is stored online", "zone": "homepage/articles", "og": {"url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2015/04/14/unauthorized-breaches-of-medical-records-on-the-rise", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Researchers call for enhanced security as more patient information is stored online", "title": "Unauthorized Breaches of Medical Records on the Rise"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers call for enhanced security as more patient information is stored online", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Unauthorized Breaches of Medical Records on the Rise - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-04-14", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "Collections: Health,HealthDay,computers,internet,doctors,hospitals,Meditation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-04-14"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z8li2r", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce72b\"", "article_summary": "Six breaches involved more than 1 million records each, and the number of reported breaches increased over time, rising from 214 in 2010 to 265 in 2013.\nInsurance companies Anthem Inc. and Premera Blue Cross both were hit by hackers earlier this year, in separate incidents that together exposed more than 90 million medical records to criminals.\nSpurred on by the Affordable Care Act and the U.S. government, health care providers are beginning to store more and more patient records on computers, in the form of electronic health records.\nBut electronic health records also are increasingly vulnerable to exposure through hacking, the researchers reported.\nUnfortunately, the increased use of electronic health records also exposes personal medical data to the same sort of cybersecurity threats that other industries and services have long faced, Blumenthal said."}
