They were turned over in response to a document request from the House Oversight Committee. The website launched on a Tuesday. Publicly, the government said there were 4.7 million unique visits in the first 24 hours. But at a meeting Wednesday morning, the war room notes say \u201csix enrollments have occurred so far.\u201d\n\nA very good story, although while coming into work I heard the reporter, Sharyl Attkisson, say the number was \u201cshocking.\u201d Now, Attkisson is an excellent reporter. She\u2019s done great stories on Benghazi and \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d and this story is no doubt a good scoop.\n\nBut \u201cshocking\u201d? This is about as shocking as David Ortiz being named MVP at the end of the World Series.\n\nFirst, if the Obama Administration had even decent enrollment numbers, it would have released them by now. The fact that it hasn\u2019t is a big red flag that the numbers are terrible.\n\nSecond, the federal website has been, to borrow an abbreviation, a total \u201cCF.\u201d If people can\u2019t get on to the website, then they can\u2019t enroll.\n\nThird, there have plenty of stories about insurers complaining that \u201cthe federal health-care marketplace is generating flawed data that is straining their ability to handle even the trickle of enrollees who have gotten through so far.\u201d If insurers can\u2019t get the right data, then applicants probably won\u2019t be enrolled.\n\nFinally, Enroll Maven has been tracking the \u201cunofficial\u201d number of enrollees based on new stories about states that have released numbers. His count is just over 36,000, or barely 0.5% of the enrollment goal of 7 million.\n\nIn short, 6 people signing up on day one isn\u2019t shocking. It\u2019s expected.\n\nPhoto: iStockPhoto", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/Ho-hum.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1383318547178", "description": "CBS News reports that ,\n\n \n Early enrollment figures are contained in notes from twice-a-day &...", "title": "6 People Signed Up On Day One -- Ho\u00a0Hum - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabbf\"", "article_summary": "Finally, Enroll Maven has been tracking the \u201cunofficial\u201d number of enrollees based on new stories about states that have released numbers.\nFirst, if the Obama Administration had even decent enrollment numbers, it would have released them by now.\nSecond, the federal website has been, to borrow an abbreviation, a total \u201cCF.\u201d If people can\u2019t get on to the website, then they can\u2019t enroll.\nCBS News reports that,Early enrollment figures are contained in notes from twice-a-day \u201cwar room\u201d meetings convened within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after the website failed on Oct. 1.\nIn short, 6 people signing up on day one isn\u2019t shocking."}
