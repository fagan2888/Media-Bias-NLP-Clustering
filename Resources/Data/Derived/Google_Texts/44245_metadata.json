The increases, however, are only about half the amount sought by those insurers in their initial rate requests submitted this summer.\n\n\u201cWe closely scrutinized the proposed rate increases insurers requested and reduced them significantly where appropriate,\u201d said Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky. \u201cWhile we have made substantial progress in reforming our health care market and holding down costs, there is much more work ahead. We will continue to engage with consumer groups, insurers, providers, and other stakeholders as we move forward with that effort.\u201d\n\nLawsky said the new rates are sill, on average, about 50% lower than those charged before New York rolled out its Obamacare health exchange last year. The state held the line on increases despite a projected 8% increase in overall health care costs.\n\nAmong the individual plans, Health Republic Insurance of New York will have the biggest increase, 13%, followed by MVP Health Care at 9.97%. Several plans, however, will have lower rates, including United HealthCare of New York with a decrease of 15.3%.\n\nSmall group plans will rise, on average 6.7% in the coming year, state officials said. The biggest increase among those plans will be felt by patrons of MetroPlus Health Plan, 14.41% and MVP Health Services Corp.,12.66%.\n\nConsumer groups hailed the new rates and the state\u2019s efforts to hold the line on increases.\n\n\u201cCosts do go up and you would expect premiums to go up to offset those costs,\u201d said Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group. \u201cI think the Affordable Care Act experiment continues but the initial diagnosis is a good one.\u201d\n\nInsurers, meanwhile, accused state officials of artificially deflating the market.\n\n\u201cWe believe this rate setting process is seriously flawed, that the approved rates are inadequate, and that DFS\u2019s decisions are irresponsible and do not reflect actuarial reality,\u201d said New York Health Plan Association President Paul Macielak.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is inadequate rates will result in reducing product choice or otherwise de-stabilizing the market, which is ultimately harmful to the health care system as a whole and the to consumers who rely on it,\u201d Macielak said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1689203.1393044158!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/ben-lawsky-jpg.jpg", "description": "Rates for individual insurance plans \u2013 including those offered on New York\u2019s Obamacare exchange \u2013 will rise on average 5.7% in the coming year, the state\u2019s Department of the Financial Services reported.", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Rates for individual insurance plans \u2013 including those offered on New York\u2019s Obamacare exchange \u2013 will rise on average 5.7% in the coming year, the state\u2019s Department of the Financial Services reported.", "title": "Health insurance rates to increase in 2015", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/health-insurance-rates-increase-2015-blog-entry-1.1928354", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1689203.1393044158!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/ben-lawsky-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rates for individual insurance plans \u2013 including those offered on New York\u2019s Obamacare exchange \u2013 will rise on average 5.7% in the coming year, the state\u2019s Department of the Financial Services reported.", "title": "Health insurance rates to increase in 2015", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/health-insurance-rates-increase-2015-blog-entry-1.1928354", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1689203.1393044158!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/ben-lawsky-jpg.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-04T16:56:21-0400", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "sailthru.title": "Health insurance rates to increase in 2015", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "nydn_section": "dailypolitics", "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Rates for individual insurance plans \u2013 including those offered on New York\u2019s Obamacare exchange \u2013 will rise on average 5.7% in the coming year, the state\u2019s Department of the Financial Services reported.", "viewport": "width=1070, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Among the individual plans, Health Republic Insurance of New York will have the biggest increase, 13%, followed by MVP Health Care at 9.97%.\nThe biggest increase among those plans will be felt by patrons of MetroPlus Health Plan, 14.41% and MVP Health Services Corp.,12.66%.\n\u201cWhile we have made substantial progress in reforming our health care market and holding down costs, there is much more work ahead.\nThe state held the line on increases despite a projected 8% increase in overall health care costs.\nNew York Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky says state \"closely scrutinized\" rate increasesNew Yorkers will have to dig a little deeper into their wallets for health insurance in 2015, state officials announced Thursday."}
