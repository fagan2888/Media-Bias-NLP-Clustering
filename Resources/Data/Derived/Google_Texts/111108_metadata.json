Bill Shuster for a second time Tuesday held off challenger Art Halvorson and won a Republican nomination for the 9th Congressional District seat. Halvorson had also tried unsuccessfully to unseat Shuster in the 2014 primary election.\n\nUnofficial returns from The Associated Press show that across the sprawling, 12-county district, voters Tuesday backed Shuster with 48,686 votes compared to 47,677 for Halvorson, a retired Coast Guard captain from Blair County who is now a commercial real-estate developer.\n\n\u201cI am honored to represent a region that I have called home my entire life, and I thank the people of the 9th District for electing me to represent the Republican Party in the election this November,\u201d Shuster said in a statement released early this morning. \u201cMy campaign focused on a positive message of conservative solutions that cut spending and put up a roadblock to President Obama\u2019s disastrous agenda, and I won\u2019t stop fighting for these values.\n\n\u201cAs I have since my first day in office, I\u2019ll continue representing our region with conservative leadership, and I look forward to our party coming together to stop Hillary Clinton and get a conservative back in the White House,\u201d Shuster said.\n\nBut Halvorson told the Gazette just after midnight that he\u2019s not conceding defeat, and that being short about 1,000 votes could change.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many absentee ballots are out, and some provisional ballots, because some locations ran out of ballots and had to use paper ballots that didn\u2019t get counted electronically,\u201d Halvorson said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s still ballots out there. \u2026 Clearly, the difference is within the margin of outstanding ballots. I think we need to wait before we call this. \u2026 I\u2019m not conceding one vote. When all the votes are counted, we\u2019ll see what the end result is. We\u2019re not done yet.\u201d\n\nHalvorson said he was very pleased with the support he received from 9th District voters.\n\n\u201cWe won Franklin, Fulton, Bedford, Blair and Indiana counties,\u201d he said.\n\nHalvorson had strong support from Indiana County voters Tuesday. He received 7,425 votes (63.57 percent) to Shuster\u2019s 4,221 votes (36.14 percent).\n\n\u201cPeople are fed up with big government and I\u2019m for limited government,\u201d Halvorson said. \u201cI\u2019m running against a big government guy with unlimited funding who buys his elections. It shows the money still has an out-sized influence.\u201d\n\nHalvorson said Shuster had at least a 10-to-1 spending advantage over his own campaign.\n\nBut, Halvorson continued, his vote total \u201cshows you can go toe-to-toe with a big government guy if you work hard enough and you have enough volunteers, as we did, extraordinary volunteers, particularly in Indiana.\u201d\n\nHalvorson said it may take two to three days to count the outstanding ballots, so by Friday morning the results of all the voting should be known.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cI still think we\u2019re in it. I think the votes are out there. We just need to find them.\u201d\n\nAnd Halvorson said he and his supporters will continue trying to defeat Shuster.\n\n\u201cWe think he\u2019s bad for America,\u201d Halvorson said. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely bad for the 9th District. The results are all around us. Look at the boarded-up main streets. \u2026 The coal industry \u2014 decimated. The gas industry \u2014 decimated. Jobs leaving. Population in decline. Agriculture just tied up in knots by big government. People are fed up with that. But unfortunately, with a lot of money you can deceive people, and he\u2019s been able to do that. And we\u2019re going to be about exposing it.\u201d\n\nHalvorson said earlier in the campaign that he was running again in part to \u201cbreak the pattern of entrenched career politicians.\u201d With a campaign slogan of \u201cRescue America,\u201d Halvorson pledged to try to change the Republican leadership, limit the deficit, pay off the national debt and grow the economy by reducing what he said is a mountain of oppressive governmental regulations that strangle small businesses and farms.\n\nShuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has represented the 9th District since 2001. His reelection campaign material described him as a \u201cconservative champion\u201d who has fought for fiscal responsibility, limited federal government, pro-life and pro-Second Amendment values, immigration reform to better protect America from \u201cfailed state\u201d terrorists and to defeat Obamacare.\n\nSome news accounts earlier this spring accused Shuster of a \u201ccoziness\u201d with the airline industry that included spending time in Miami with the leader of the airline industry group Airlines for America and dating one of the group\u2019s female lobbyists, Shelley Rubino.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Shuster said he had been completely open about his personal relationship with the woman and had taken steps to ensure that she doesn\u2019t lobby his office or the House Transportation Committee.\n\nThere were no Democrat candidates seeking a nomination for the 9th District listed on Tuesday\u2019s ballots. However, Adam Sedlock, of Fayette County, ran as a write-in candidate with the goal of winning a Democrat nomination and getting on the ballot in the general election. He needed 1,000 write-in votes to do so. A total of 1,346 write-in votes were cast by Democratic voters in the 9th District. Details of the write-in vote will not be available until verified by elections officials.The 9th District includes all of Bedford, Blair, Fayette, Franklin, Fulton and Indiana counties and parts of Cambria, Greene, Huntingdon, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland counties.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
