The first kick of a mule was when we shut the government down in the mid-1990s and the second kick was over the last 16 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no education in the second kick of a mule. There will not be a government shutdown. I think we have fully now acquainted our new members with what a losing strategy that is.\u201d\n\nPolitical Wire on how McConnell has suddenly changed his tone\u2026 in just a month, from originally calling House legislation \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d to this.\n\nObama may want to push for immigration, but Trey Gowdy, who chairs the House immigration committee, says, \u201cGood luck\u201d to Democrats in trying to get immigration through the House. USA Today: \u201cHouse Republicans emerged from the 16-day shutdown fight angered at the White House and Reid for refusing to negotiate over the terms to end the shutdown and lift the nation's debt ceiling. Some say that if the Democrats use the same strategy and refuse to compromise on immigration then the issue will be dead this year.\u201d Said Gowdy: \"It's a little disingenuous to treat the House as an irrelevant branch of government and then say, 'By the way, tomorrow you'll need to go ahead and push (immigration reform). It doesn't work that way.\"\n\nSaid Raul Labrador: \"It's not going to happen this year. After the way the president acted over the last two or three weeks where he would refuse to talk to the speaker of the House ... they're not going to get immigration reform. That's done.\"\n\nOf passing immigration reform, Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) said, \"That would really melt down the conference.\u201d\n\nReality check: Which party was it that lost 71% of Latinos in the last presidential election? And how does the GOP think it will turn out for them with Hispanics in the next few elections if they are seen as not only causing the government shutdown and taking the country to the brink over the debt ceiling, but also blocking immigration reform \u2013 because they are upset that the president wouldn\u2019t negotiate over his health-care law?\n\nDemocrats are concerned about Paul Ryan\u2019s no vote on the legislation to open the government and raise the debt ceiling. Roll Call: \u201cPelosi and Hoyer fear that Ryan\u2019s unwillingness to vote for the Senate-negotiated fiscal package on Wednesday could portend an unwillingness to engage in the kind of frank, bipartisan compromise necessary to finalize a fiscal 2014 budget by the Dec. 13 deadline.\u201d\n\nNBC\u2019s Michael O\u2019Brien looks at the chances of another government in January.\n\nTed Cruz is blocking Obama\u2019s FCC nominee because he wants less disclosure in political advertising. The Hill: \u201cSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), whose efforts to defund ObamaCare helped lead to the government shutdown, is blocking the confirmation of Tom Wheeler, President Obama's nominee for chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. A spokesman for Cruz said the senator has placed a hold on the nomination until Wheeler clarifies whether he would require more disclosure about the donors behind political TV ads.\u201d More: Cruz argues the Democrats are trying to use the FCC to implement the goals of the Disclose Act \u2014 which would have required political groups to reveal more information about their donors. He and other Republicans claim the bill would have chilled political speech.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mitch McConnell says no more shutdowns over Obamacare: \u201cOne of my favorite old Kentucky sayings is there\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule.
