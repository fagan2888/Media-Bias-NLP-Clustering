Moreover, only 44 percent of the veterans surveyed said they have received the health, disability, financial and educational benefits they were promised, according to the study.\n\nRelated: VA Gets to Work, Reduces Backlog of Disability Claims by 84 Percent\n\nThe findings underscore the problems of hundreds of thousands of veterans who returned from deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade. Many of them have required prolonged hospitalization and treatment for physical and mental health ailments and are prone to high rates of alcoholism, divorce, depression and suicide.\n\n\u201cThe survey shows veterans of every generation are proud of their military service and believe it had a positive impact on their life, even though many paid a price,\u201d Marc Burgess, DAV CEO and national adjutant, in a statement accompanying the survey. \u201cYet the results also point to major gaps in the support, health care and disability benefits they receive. It also reveals challenges many younger veterans face finding employment. It\u2019s clear our government and country need to step up and keep the promises made to America\u2019s veterans.\u201d\n\nDuring his address today after laying a wreath at the Arlington National Cemetery, Obama said that his administration had made important progress in reducing veteran homelessness, improving medical service response time and slashing the once massive backlog of disability claims by 90 percent.\n\n\u201cStill, the unacceptable problems we continue to see \u2026 is a challenge for all of us if we are to match our words and deeds,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican and Democratic presidential candidates also voice concern about the country\u2019s veteran population and promised vast improvement in services if they win election in 2016.\n\nRelated: Veterans Day by the Numbers\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, yesterday praised progress made by the Obama administration in addressing some of the worst health care and social service problems at the VA, but said there is still plenty of work to be done. \u201cToday we are failing to keep the faith with our veterans,\u201d Clinton said in a speech in New Hampshire, according to The Washington Post.\n\nShe unveiled proposals for reforms of the VA and vowed \u201czero tolerance for the kinds of abuses and delays we have seen.\u201d While her approach would preserve the current VA model of combining the stand-alone VA health care system with some private-sector health care services funded by Medicare, she said she would strongly oppose GOP proposals for privatizing health-care services.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Politicians and dignitaries from President Obama on down praised the service and sacri", "title": "Most Veterans Say They Are Not Treated Well by the Government", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/Most-Veterans-Say-They-Are-Not-Treated-Well-Government", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11112011_Veterans_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/Most-Veterans-Say-They-Are-Not-Treated-Well-Government", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11112011_Veterans_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Politicians and dignitaries from President Obama on down praised the service and sacri", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "While more than half of those surveyed believe that veterans are well treated by the public, only 22 percent said that veterans are being well treated by the federal government.\nPoliticians and dignitaries from President Obama on down praised the service and sacrifice of the nation\u2019s military veterans as they commemorated Veterans Day Wednesday.\nAccording to the findings of the DAV Veterans Pulse Survey released Tuesday, 84 percent of veterans believe their military service had an \u201coverall positive impact\u201d on their lives and nearly 80 percent say that they would repeat their service if they had to do it again.\nMoreover, only 44 percent of the veterans surveyed said they have received the health, disability, financial and educational benefits they were promised, according to the study.\n\u201cYet the results also point to major gaps in the support, health care and disability benefits they receive."}
