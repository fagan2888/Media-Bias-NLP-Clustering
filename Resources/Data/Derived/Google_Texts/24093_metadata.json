These family caregivers provide a staggering 37 billion hours in unpaid care annually.\n\nA labor of love to be sure, family caregivers also face huge responsibilities, and are the backbone of our care system in the U.S.\n\nAs a family caregiver myself \u2014 having cared for my parents and now, along with my two millennial sons, caring for my husband, who has ALS \u2014 I know how challenging, rewarding and difficult this experience can be. Every week, across the country:\n\nDaughters are poring through bills and statements to help manage Dad\u2019s finances after putting the kids to bed.\n\nBrothers and sisters are splitting up duties and figuring out who can make it to which appointment, and how to pay for the changes that are needed in Mom and Dad\u2019s house.\n\nParents are making sure their child with a disability is getting the needed education and resources.\n\nMiddle-aged sons are taking off work driving their aging dad around town, and spending weekends helping with house repairs.\n\nMillennial kids are helping their mom with a health condition get around the house.\n\nHusbands, wives and partners are helping loved ones after a surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Kentucky, Donna cares for her mother: \u201cAt first my help included taking her to various doctor visits and assisting with household chores. In May of this year I retired early to care for her 24/7.\u201d\n\nIn Nevada, Maria cares for a friend: \u201cI am not sure when our friendship transferred to caregiving but today I am her primary caregiver. I take care of all her bills, her mail, her transportation, making sure she is stocked with her personal items, but most importantly being there for her as a daughter, friend and someone she knows will always be there for her.\u201d\n\nWhile they wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, many family caregivers are often on call 24/7, sometimes without even a break; they need some support. Thank you to the Senate sponsors of the RAISE Act, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and the HELP Committee leadership, Sens. Alexander and Murray, for your bipartisan action to support family caregivers like Donna, Maria, myself and so many others.\n\nWe also thank the House sponsors of the RAISE Act, Reps. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) and Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), for their bipartisan leadership on this bill.\n\nAARP now urges the U.S. Senate to pass the RAISE Family Caregivers Act to recognize, assist, include, support and engage family caregivers this year.\n\nNancy LeaMond is AARP chief advocacy and engagement officer.
