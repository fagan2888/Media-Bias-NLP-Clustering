Vermont is taking full advantage of the law and the number of people without health insurance is now at a record low. According to the U.S. Census Bureau only 31,000 Vermonters, about five percent of the state\u2019s population, was not covered by some form of health insurance in 2014. That\u2019s lower than any state except for Massachusetts, and it\u2019s less than half the 11.7 percent of Americans who are uninsured.\n\nBut those numbers are somewhat misleading. Everyone over 65 is covered by Medicare, so rather than looking at the entire population, let\u2019s focus only on the the health insurance status of the under 65 population. The accompanying graph shows that Obamacare has had a major impact in both the U.S. and Vermont. Vermont\u2019s uninsured rate for under 65 year olds hovered around 11 percent from 2006 through 2011. It\u2019s interesting that the severe recession of 2008-2009 is invisible \u2014 there wasn\u2019t any increase in the number of Vermonters who were uninsured. That wasn\u2019t true for the nation, but given that the Great Recession was the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, it\u2019s remarkable that there wasn\u2019t a big spike up in the percentage of Americans who lost their health insurance. Since 2011, when Obamacare began to take effect, the percentage of uninsured for the under 65 year olds has fallen significantly and is now 5.9 percent in Vermont and 13.5 percent in the U.S.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2014 there has been a big increase in the number of Vermonters getting health insurance from Medicaid, which is paid for by both federal and state funds through a complicated formula. Vermont\u2019s Medicaid rolls have increased dramatically, from 105,000 in 2006 to 145,000 in 2014. At the same time the number of Vermonters getting their health insurance in the private insurance market \u2014 through their employers or on their own \u2014 has fallen from 396,000 to 350,000. Those numbers tell me that there has been an almost one to one subsitution from privately provided health insurance to government provided insurance for the under 65 population.\n\nThe percentage of Vermonters without health insurance has declined, to be sure, but that change from 11 percent to 6 percent obscures the larger dynamic\u2014the substitution of publicly funded health insurance for privately funded.\n\nThat switch has significant problems for the state budget. We\u2019re already seeing the strains on the fiscal year 2017 budget, which hasn\u2019t even been formally put forward (it will be when the legislature meets next January). Most of the budget pressures are coming from Medicaid. Given how expensive health care is, it\u2019s not surprising that the state with the second lowest rate of uninsured is finding it expensive to provide that service to its citizens. The cost savings that were projected to come from efforts to reign in costs and provide preventative care have not materialized. I hope they do, but I fear they will be elusive.\n\nThe health-care budget pressures will only get worse. The sweetener, or subsidy, that Obamacare currently provides to states to encourage them to enroll uninsured people into Medicaid will gradually be reduced over the next few years. They won\u2019t be eliminated, but any reduction in the federal government\u2019s share of health care costs is bound to put more pressure on the state Medicaid budget, and the overall state budget.\n\nAs Vermont ages and people under the age of 65 cross that threshold into senior citizendom, they become eligible for Medicare which, unlike Medicaid, is paid for entirely by the federal government. In 2015, 8,000 Vermonters will turn 65 and that number will increase to 10,000 annually by 2020.\n\nAs Vermont\u2019s under 65 population, and the number of people under 65 receiving Medicaid, shrinks, that will reduce health care cost pressures in the state budget. But that will lead to another budgetary pressure. Government does provide nursing home care for people over 65 who can\u2019t afford it. But it\u2019s paid for by Medicaid, not Medicare, which means the state will be on the hook for a significant portion of those costs. If you think that health care costs are expensive, take a look at the cost of extended nursing home stays. It\u2019s enough to bust any state\u2019s budget.\n\nArt Woolf is associate professor of economics at the University of Vermont.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://bfpne.ws/1NN7nFd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Vermont is taking full advantage of the law and the number of people without health insurance is now at a record low.", "og": {"site_name": "Burlington Free Press", "description": "Vermont is taking full advantage of the law and the number of people without health insurance is now at a record low.", "title": "Woolf: Obamacare impacts Vermonters", "url": "http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/money/2015/11/12/woolf-obamacare-impacts-vermonters/75641534/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/burlingtonfreepress.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vermont is taking full advantage of the law and the number of people without health insurance is now at a record low.", "title": "Woolf: Obamacare impacts Vermonters", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/58236075a8e8a4f4f73dde8159b740d281ba36b3/c=809-0-2937-2128&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/03/Burlington/B9318327963Z.1_20150803193008_000_GEMBHE893.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@bfp_news", "site": "@bfp_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=835986144", "fb": {"app_id": 151224581596873}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health care, Vermont,"}, "article_summary": "The percentage of Vermonters without health insurance has declined, to be sure, but that change from 11 percent to 6 percent obscures the larger dynamic\u2014the substitution of publicly funded health insurance for privately funded.\nIf you think that health care costs are expensive, take a look at the cost of extended nursing home stays.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau only 31,000 Vermonters, about five percent of the state\u2019s population, was not covered by some form of health insurance in 2014.\nIt\u2019s interesting that the severe recession of 2008-2009 is invisible \u2014 there wasn\u2019t any increase in the number of Vermonters who were uninsured.\nVermont is taking full advantage of the law and the number of people without health insurance is now at a record low."}
