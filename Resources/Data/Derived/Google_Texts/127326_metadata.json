White, had requested but never received permission from the office of Mayor Vincent C. Gray to publish a critique of Mr. Obama\u2019s surprise announcement on Thursday that he would allow thousands of Americans to renew policies that might not provide the minimum coverage required by the health law.\n\nInstead of waiting to hear from Mr. Gray\u2019s office, the person said, Mr. White\u2019s office posted the statement on the city government\u2019s website less than 15 minutes after sending an email seeking approval. Later, when confronted by the mayor, Mr. White said he had received permission from the mayor\u2019s staff even though he had not, the person said.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. White said that Victor L. Hoskins, Washington\u2019s deputy mayor, told him that the mayor had \u201cdecided to go in a different direction\u201d and that Mr. White\u2019s services would no longer be needed. Mr. White, who had been commissioner for roughly three years, said his statement on the Affordable Care Act was not mentioned during his conversation with Mr. Hoskins.\n\nMr. White said that although he commonly sent releases to the mayor\u2019s office, it was not his normal practice to wait for the mayor or the mayor\u2019s office to sign off. He added that he did not misrepresent to the mayor that he had permission to send out the release.\n\n\u201cWhen I issue statements, I am speaking on behalf of the department about insurance, and I don\u2019t speak on behalf of the mayor,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cIn this instance, however, the issue was clearly more political than usual.\u201d\n\nMichael M. Flagg, a spokesman for Mr. White, referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office, saying he could not discuss personnel matters.\n\nMr. White\u2019s statement took direct issue with Mr. Obama\u2019s decision, saying the president\u2019s policy reversal to allow the continuation of canceled policies \u201cundercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District\u2019s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama had been criticized heavily over the canceled policies because he had said many times that people who liked their insurance would be able to keep it under the new law. Mr. Obama\u2019s reversal, which allows states to continue policies that had been canceled but does not require that they do so, threw the issue into the laps of insurance companies and insurance commissioners like Mr. White, who typically regulate insurance policies.\n\nIn a meeting with Mr. Obama at the White House on Friday, executives for the major insurance companies expressed mixed feelings about whether the continuation of canceled policies could work in every state.\n\nAt the same time, several insurance commissioners voiced their opinions on the move.\n\n\u201cI do not believe his proposal is a good deal for the State of Washington,\u201d Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner there, said Thursday.\n\nThe commissioner in Florida, by contrast, supported the proposal.\n\nThe person with knowledge of the situation said that Mayor Gray was unhappy with the tone of Mr. White\u2019s statement, if not the substance of its arguments.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131117164609, "twitter": {"description": "The District of Columbia\u2019s commissioner, William P.
