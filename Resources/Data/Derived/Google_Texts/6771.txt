A former D.C. police officer previously convicted of felony bribery was arrested Tuesday for trying to bring a loaded, unregistered gun into the Library of Congress, officials say.

Jeff Jefferson Ahn, also known as Young Ahn, of Lorton, Va. entered the Thomas Jefferson Building about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday and agreed to be searched, federal court records say.

In an x-ray machine, a U.S. Capitol Police officer spotted a handgun in Ahn’s briefcase. The officer opened the briefcase and found a loaded .38 caliber revolver, according to court records.

Ahn then told the officer he "worked for MPD" and that the revolver was his "off-duty" weapon, prosecutors said. He was arrested when he failed to provide proof of his retirement credentials or of the license for the revolver, and was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.

Ahn was convicted of felony bribery in 1999, according to federal court records. The Metropolitan Police Department confirmed he was previously an officer, and that his service ended that year.

A judge has issued a “stay-away” order prohibiting Ahn from coming within 100 yards of U.S. Capitol grounds.
