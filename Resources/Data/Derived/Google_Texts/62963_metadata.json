The couple had ten children.\n\nOscar Cardenas, 37, Anderson was one of two men who died on the way to work Wednesday.\n\nHe was riding in the passenger seat in a GMC Jimmy with three others. Authorities said 29-year-old Lukas Green was driving a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier south on State Road 9 when he crossed the centerline south of County Road 1300 N and struck the GMC Jimmy head-on.\n\nGreen was flown to IU Health Methodist Hospital in critical condition. Antonio Perez, who was driving the GMC Jimmy, and Cardenas were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\u201cI heard one of the two in front breathing for their last breath,\u201d recalled 17-year-old Kyle Kress who was riding in the back of the GMC Jimmy.\n\nKress was also flown to an area hospital in critical condition. He could barely stand as he told Fox 59 what happened.\n\n\u201cScariest moments I\u2019ve ever seen or heard,\u201d he recalled.\n\nIn the midst of her grief, Cardenas\u2019 wife Amalia spoke to Fox 59 about the moment she found out her husband had passed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was waiting for somebody to come and tell me \u2018No, you know, we made a mistake.\u2019 But when they showed me his ID, then I knew it was him.\u201d\n\nNow she is the sole parent of ten children and she\u2019s pregnant with twins, due any day.\n\nShe is getting help from family, friends and strangers. A group of local women who help struggling families in the Anderson area collected food, clothes and items for the Cardenas family.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine. I just couldn\u2019t imagine,\u201d said Kelli Cave. She is a member of One Families Junk is Another\u2019s Treasure! and Hidden Treasures-Free Group on Facebook.\n\nFox 59 was there when she and others delivered the collected goods to the Cardenas family.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t make the grief go away, but maybe a little bit of stress taken away? That\u2019s what we want to do,\u201d Cave said.\n\nEven in her most helpless moment, this act of kindness gave Cardenas some hope that things would work out for her children.\n\n\u201cThey will be okay,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m gonna promise my husband\u2026 that they will be okay.\u201d\n\nBoth groups continue to collect donations for the Cardenas family and funeral costs.
