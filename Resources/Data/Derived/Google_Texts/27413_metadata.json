But from all indications, it\u2019s like all the other agreements that are not free-trade agreements. They are investor-rights agreements. The idea is that the Obama administration wants to ram the deal through without public discussion. The idea is called \u2018fast-track authority.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "News, World, U.S.", "description": "The world renowned intellectual and author criticized Washington&rsquo;s double standards regarding the deadly use of drones in the Middle East.", "GENERATOR": "teleSUR", "Author": "teleSUR / OA-TP", "og": {"url": "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Noam-Chomsky-Says-Obama-and-Hillary-Clinton-Are-Opportunists-20150612-0003.html", "image": "http://www.telesurtv.net/__export/1434094812327/sites/telesur/img/chomsky-noam.jpg_1689854194.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The world renowned intellectual and author criticized Washington&rsquo;s double standards regarding the deadly use of drones in the Middle East.", "title": "Noam Chomsky Says Obama and Hillary Clinton Are 'Opportunists'"}, "twitter": {"site": "@teleSURenglish", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "og-title": "Noam Chomsky Says Obama and Hillary Clinton Are 'Opportunists'", "revisit-after": "1 days", "language": "en_US", "fb": {"admins": 100009828662021, "pages": 479681268841947, "app_id": 1103464276336828}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "News/U.S.", "articleid": 1434094020000, "publishtime": "2015-06-12T03:27:00Z"}, "Pageclass": "article", "title": "Noam Chomsky Says Obama and Hillary Clinton Are 'Opportunists'"}, "keywords": "Noam Chomsky, Obama, Clinton", "organization": "teleSUR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "Googlebot": "all"}, "article_summary": "The idea is that the Obama administration wants to ram the deal through without public discussion.\nNoam Chomsky, a historian, linguist and a prominent commentator on political affairs in the United States and the world, lashed out at President Barack Obama calling him \u201can opportunist\u201d and said Hillary Clinton is no different.\nRELATED: US Democracy in Serious Decline, Says Noam Chomsky\u200bHe criticized the Obama administration\u2019s health care act.\nThe world renowned intellectual and author criticized Washington\u2019s double standards regarding the deadly use of drones in the Middle East.\nIn an interview with WorldNetDaily (WND) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Chomsky, who was voted the \u201cworld\u2019s top intellectual\u201d in a 2005 poll, expressed no disappointment in Obama, because he \u201cdidn\u2019t expect anything\u201d from him."}
