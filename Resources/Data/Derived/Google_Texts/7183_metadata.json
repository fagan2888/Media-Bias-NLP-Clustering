The story didn\u2019t break until Oct. 10.\n\nAccording to a local farmer, Steven Jensen, who reported the spill, the response team for Tesoro Logistics LP didn\u2019t arrive immediately after he filed his complaint \u2014 instead, it took them one day to dispatch a team, which dug ditches around the contaminated ground in an attempt to halt the oil from traveling.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe last high-profile inland oil spill came in March in Mayflower, Ark., when an ExxonMobil pipeline allowed 7,000 barrels of crude to enter residential areas.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press report, Jensen said he had been smelling oil for days before he realized that the tire of his combine had picked up the liquid. The farmer, Steve Jensen, told the AP that when he discovered the actual site of the pipeline spill, he witnessed oil \u201cspewing and bubbling six inches high.\u201d\n\nAs far as his crop goes, Jensen told Reuters that it had disintegrated.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have known it was a wheat plant,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Reuters, authorities indicated there were no reports of contamination of lakes, streams or rivers within five miles of the spill at this point, although the impacts of the spill, which coated the top 10 feet of soil, have yet to be fully felt.\n\nThe pipeline is owned by Tesoro Logistics LP, a publicly traded company formed by Tesoro Corporation, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. According to the company, the pipeline has been temporarily shut down for repairs.\n\nThe pipeline, which measures six inches, was transporting oil from North Dakota\u2019s famous Bakken formation to a site in Columbus, N.D.\n\nThe spill, which went unreported for days, comes as the nation is still in the midst of the fight over the Keystone XL, a 1,700-mile pipeline that would transport more than 830,000 gallons of oil each day from Alberta, Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nNebraska farmers in particular have been vocal in their opposition to the pipeline, citing concerns over eminent domain being enacted by a foreign corporation and the likelihood that a spill would lead to contamination of their crops, as is the case right now in North Dakota.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seven acres of farmland reportedly have been destroyed by a massive pipeline oil leak that went unreported for days., Arkansas, ExxonMobil, Mayflower, North Dakota, Oil, pipeline,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Mint Press News Desk", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Seven acres of farmland reportedly have been destroyed by a massive pipeline oil leak that went unreported for days., Arkansas, ExxonMobil, Mayflower, North Dakota, Oil, pipeline,", "title": "ND Pipeline Spill Leaks 20,000 Barrels Of Oil, Destroying Wheat Crops", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/nd-pipeline-spill-leaks-20000-barrels-of-oil-destroying-wheat-crops/170455/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101113_ND_16x9-690x387.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-11T22:17:22-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Seven acres of farmland reportedly have been destroyed by a massive pipeline oil leak that went unreported for days., Arkansas, ExxonMobil, Mayflower, North Dakota, Oil, pipeline,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101113_ND_4x3.jpg", "title": "ND Pipeline Spill Leaks 20,000 Barrels Of Oil, Destroying Wheat Crops", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "pipeline", "published_time": "2013-10-12T05:04:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-11T22:17:22-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbef3\"", "article_summary": "ND Pipeline Spill Leaks 20,000 Barrels Of Oil, Destroying Wheat CropsSeven acres of farmland reportedly have been destroyed by a massive pipeline oil leak that went unreported for days.\nThe pipeline, which measures six inches, was transporting oil from North Dakota\u2019s famous Bakken formation to a site in Columbus, N.D.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorThe last high-profile inland oil spill came in March in Mayflower, Ark., when an ExxonMobil pipeline allowed 7,000 barrels of crude to enter residential areas.\nA North Dakota pipeline spill has allowed more than 20,000 barrels \u2014 or 800,000 gallons \u2014 of crude oil to enter one of the state\u2019s wheat fields, representing a worst-case scenario for farmers attempting to operate in pipeline-heavy areas.\nThe pipeline is owned by Tesoro Logistics LP, a publicly traded company formed by Tesoro Corporation, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas."}
