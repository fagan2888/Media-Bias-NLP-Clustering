But Texas officials decided not to expand Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for the poor and disabled, leaving uninsured nearly 1 million residents who would have been eligible for coverage under the expanded program.\n\n\n\nThat was a rebuke of the Obama administration, which is now considering whether \u2014 or to what extent \u2014 it will renew the matching funds. Federal officials told HHSC in April they would consider Texas\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid when determining whether to renew the federal matching funds that supplement local dollars.\n\nSome at the meeting said they worried the federal government would reduce Texas\u2019 uncompensated care funding because the state had refused to expand Medicaid. In addition to reimbursing hospitals for caring for the uninsured, some of the $29 billion also helps fund innovative projects to help care for low-income populations.\n\nTom Watkins, a spokesman for March of Dimes, an organization that supports infant health care, said the money helps fund critical services for women without coverage. Many of the adults in the coverage gap are women who will only qualify for Medicaid if they become pregnant, he said.\n\n\u201cThis funding is critical to the health of women and children in our state,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cThe greatest opportunity to improve the health of a woman, and to improve the health of her child during pregnancy, occurs before they get pregnant.\u201d\n\nThe month-long public comment period for HHSC\u2019s proposal to the federal government to have the funding extended another five years will end Aug. 5.\n\nTexas should expand Medicaid coverage in addition to securing a waiver extension, said Laura Guerra-Cardus, associate director of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund in Texas.\n\n\u201cCoverage expansion must be part of the solution,\u201d the Austin doctor said. \u201cWithout coverage, individuals do not have adequate access to preventative, chronic and ongoing care that makes the concept of health care meaningful.\u201d\n\nHowever, many who testified said Medicaid coverage expansion itself is more important than extending the five-year program, and urged the HHSC to pressure the government to expand coverage.\n\nHHSC must submit its request for extending the waiver by the end of September. If it fails, the money would run out in September 2016.\n\nClarification: This story has been changed to clarify comments by Laura Guerra-Cardus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals that serve large uninsured populations stand to lose critical funding if Texas can&rsquo;t convince the federal government to continue helping the state pay, doctors and health advocates told the state health department Thursday.", "parsely-title": "Texas Needs Federal Money for Uninsured, HHSC Told", "twitter": {"description": "Hospitals that serve large uninsured populations stand to lose critical funding if Texas can&rsquo;t convince the federal government to continue helping the state pay, doctors and health advocates ...", "creator": "@SophiaBollag", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/07/16/doctors-advocates-urge-hhsc-extend-funding-uninsur/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2013/02/11/Medicaid-Expansion-3_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "title": "Texas Needs Federal Money for Uninsured, HHSC Told", "site": "@TexasTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Tribune", "description": "Hospitals that serve large uninsured populations stand to lose critical funding if Texas can&rsquo;t convince the federal government to continue helping the state pay, doctors and health advocates told the state health department Thursday.", "title": "Texas Needs Federal Money for Uninsured, HHSC Told", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/07/16/doctors-advocates-urge-hhsc-extend-funding-uninsur/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2013/02/11/Medicaid-Expansion-3_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 154122474650943, "pages": 124434790836}, "parsely-author": "Sophia Bollag", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-link": "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/07/16/doctors-advocates-urge-hhsc-extend-funding-uninsur/", "parsely-section": "front-page", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/"}, "parsely-image-url": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2013/02/11/Medicaid-Expansion-3_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-pub-date": "July 16, 2015, 7:06 p.m."}, "article_summary": "Federal officials told HHSC in April they would consider Texas\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid when determining whether to renew the federal matching funds that supplement local dollars.\nTexas should expand Medicaid coverage in addition to securing a waiver extension, said Laura Guerra-Cardus, associate director of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund in Texas.\nSome at the meeting said they worried the federal government would reduce Texas\u2019 uncompensated care funding because the state had refused to expand Medicaid.\n*Clarification appendedHospitals that serve large uninsured populations in Texas stand to lose critical funding if the state can\u2019t convince the federal government to continue helping with the cost, doctors and health advocates told the state health department Thursday.\nTom Watkins, a spokesman for March of Dimes, an organization that supports infant health care, said the money helps fund critical services for women without coverage."}
