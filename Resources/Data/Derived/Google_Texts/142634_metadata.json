Don\u2019t believe me? He says so himself.\n\nWe all know them: friends and relatives, even media personalities, who we thought were hardline conservatives are now swooning over Donald Trump, the next great savior of the Republic.\n\nOver Thanksgiving dinner and many texts since, one relative explained his allegiance to Trump with exuberance. Appeals to how his belief in property rights doesn\u2019t match Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for eminent domain, requests for explanations on why Trump has contributed to the successful elections of such far-Left Democrats as Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi, or why Trump used to be a Democrat, met obfuscation.\n\nPerhaps if the Trump fans heard it from the Donald himself, they might be willing to reconsider their support. So here are five instances Trump told us all he is actually a liberal.\n\nCradle to Grave Nanny State Trump expounded on his favorite subject, immigration, during the CNN Republican primary debate. Sandwiched in between many \u201cright-wing\u201d fantasies was a seemingly conservative idea, but upon closer examination, it reveals a very liberal premise: \u201cA woman gets pregnant. She\u2019s nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nI guess we (the taxpayers via the government) are supposed to take care of everyone from the moment they\u2019re born to the moment they die. I guess we (the taxpayers via the government) are supposed to take care of everyone from the moment they\u2019re born to the moment they die.\n\nA conservative or libertarian would recognize that welfare is as much a drag on the economy as anti-immigrant activists claim immigration is, if not more so. Yet Trump accepts our welfare state as an unchangeable, natural part of how the government cares for its people.\n\nSocialized Healthcare In an interview on \u201c60 Minutes \u201d this September, Trump opened up on his not-so-conservative ideas for healthcare reform. Maintaining that Obamacare, which gave the federal government much greater control over the health insurance industry, was a disaster, he said about healthcare that \u201cthe government\u2019s gonna pay for it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt, as covered by John Nolte from Breitbart (emphasis his and mine):\n\nDonald Trump: Obamacare\u2019s going to be repealed and replaced. Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what\u2019s going on with premiums where they\u2019re up 40, 50, 55 percent.\n\n\n\nScott Pelley: How do you fix it?\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: There\u2019s many different ways, by the way. Everybody\u2019s got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, \u2018No, no, the lower 25 percent that can\u2019t afford private. But\u2013\u2018\n\n\n\nScott Pelley: Universal health care.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: I am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\n\n\n\nScott Pelley: The uninsured person is going to be taken care of. How? How?\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: They\u2019re going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably\u2013\n\n\n\nScott Pelley: Make a deal? Who pays for it?\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: \u2013the government\u2019s gonna pay for it. But we\u2019re going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it\u2019s going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.\n\nOf course, this is nothing new from Trump. The Donald has supported Hillary\u2019s single-payer ideas in the past, and though he downplayed his support for single payer during the GOP Fox debate by saying \u201cit could have worked in a different age,\u201d (15 years ago, when he stated his support for single payer in the United States) when he\u2019s pressed, he betrays his true convictions about the role of government in our lives.\n\nOh, and if they like their plans and doctors, they can keep their plans and doctors. Sound familiar?\n\nIn 2007, Trump responded to Wolf Blitzer\u2019s prompt on Hillary\u2019s most recent iteration of universal healthcare: \u201cI think it was very good. It\u2019s a very very complex setup for things going on right now in terms of healthcare, but she came out with an idea, sounds like a pretty good idea, and a lot of people like it and embraced it. \u201c\n\nAlso, too, from one of Trump\u2019s books (\u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d), he confesses his affinity for a single-payer system like that of Canada: \u201cThe Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America\u2026We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\u201d\n\nSome call Trump\u2019s plans a \u201cclash with Republican orthodoxy,\u201d but it\u2019s not just that\u2014it\u2019s an embrace of liberal orthodoxy.\n\nTrump Thinks Eminent Domain Is \u2018Wonderful\u2019 In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier, Trump opined on the subject of eminent domain,(the power of government to seize private property, with compensation, and give it to another private party for development): \u201cEminent domain for massive projects, for instance, if you\u2019re gonna create thousands of jobs, and you have somebody that\u2019s in the way, and you need a house in a certain location\u2026because you\u2019re going to build this massive development and going to employ thousands of people\u2026that without this little house you can\u2019t build the factory, I think eminent domain is fine.\u201d\n\nAs long as the developer believes he\u2019s going to improve the local economy, it\u2019s totally fine to take someone\u2019s private property. In other words, as long as the developer believes he\u2019s going to improve the local economy, it\u2019s totally fine to take someone\u2019s private property. Not for building a highway for public use, mind you, which is the other example Trump said was \u201cwonderful,\u201d but for another private entity to take and develop for private purposes. Such a position is neither constitutional (according to a literal reading), nor conservative.\n\nMore Government Can Solve Immigration Want illegal immigrants deported? You can have all of them sent packing, never to return, for one low price of $400 billion!\n\nWhat does your package include? According to Reason, around 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers that would constitute yet another layer of expensive and tedious bureaucracy. For every new \u201cfrontline\u201d enforcement officer, there is a chain of command involving even more salaried and pensioned employees, and plenty of bureaucratic red tape holding it together.\n\nYou can have all of them sent packing, never to return, for one low price of $400 billion! Trump\u2019s official position paper quotes the president of the ICE Officers Council on immigration:\n\n\u201cOnly approximately 5,000 officers and agents within ICE perform the lion\u2019s share of ICE\u2019s immigration mission\u2026Compare that to the Los Angeles Police Department at approximately 10,000 officers. Approximately 5,000 officers in ICE cover 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam, and are attempting to enforce immigration law against 11 million illegal aliens already in the interior of the United States\u2026Since 9-11, the U.S. Border Patrol has tripled in size, while ICE\u2019s immigration enforcement arm, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), has remained at relatively the same size.\u201d\n\nThose who actually believe one of government\u2019s core problems is inefficiency and believe in the power of free markets should recognize that Trump\u2019s policy is based on his faith that government can make it all better. Government can save your job, government can root out all the criminals, government can. But in fact, in most areas of our lives, government cannot.\n\nMake America Great Again You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWhat? This isn\u2019t liberal, it\u2019s American!\u201d\n\nLet me tell you why. Vague slogans take on different meanings depending on what we read into them. Into Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, you can read \u201cdeport the illegals,\u201d \u201cgive everyone healthcare,\u201d or \u201cboost the economy.\u201d\n\nBut the most accurate way to read the slogan is by contextualizing it in everything else the candidate has said and done. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America great again\u201d slogan is fundamentally liberal. It\u2019s \u201cYes, we can\u201d all over again.\n\nBut the most accurate way to read the slogan is by contextualizing it in everything else the candidate has said and done. Implied in these catchy taglines are candidates\u2019 core philosophies about government and its relationship to its people. Who is going to make America great again? By all accounts, based off his speeches and his attitude, Trump is, and he plans to use the heavy hand of government to do it.\n\nWhen Obama declared to cheering crowds, \u201cYes, we can,\u201d he didn\u2019t mean us all as individuals, being productive members of society. He meant \u201cwe\u201d as taxpayers, as contributors to the greater good, as determined by government elites. He meant \u201cwe\u201d as government bureaucrats carefully coordinating the march toward the Left.\n\nBut chiefly implied in \u201cwe,\u201d as the past seven years has shown us, was the strong-man president who makes deals with companies like Solyndra and oversteps the bounds of his role time and time again. It is the man who would make the world a better place by the sheer force of his personality and the ability to skirt the written law.\n\nThe difference between these two strong men with larger-than-life personalities is slight. Trump is simply more transparent, bothering less with the \u201cwe\u201d and forthrightly emphasizing who he really believes will make America great again: himself. He will do it not through the innovation of the free market, nor through the ability to persuade hearts and minds, but through the might of government that he sincerely trusts to carry out his slogan.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 08:34:30 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Donald Trump wants to \u2018make America great again\u2019 by imposing his will on everybody.
