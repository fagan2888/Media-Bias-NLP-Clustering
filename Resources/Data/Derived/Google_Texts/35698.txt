HALIFAX, Va. (AP) — Virginia State Police say a Halifax County sheriff’s deputy shot and wounded a man who fired into a crowd of people in Halifax.

State police said in a news release that the incident took place Sunday morning at the Halifax Veterans of Foreign Wars hall after authorities responded to a parking complaint call.

After arriving at the scene, authorities say the deputy saw a male suspect firing into a crowd of people. The deputy confronted the shooter, who refused to drop his weapon. Officials say the deputy then shot the shooter.

The suspect was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Five others were wounded in the initial shooting.

Halifax County Sheriff Fred Clark says the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation’s Appomattox Field Office is investigating.
