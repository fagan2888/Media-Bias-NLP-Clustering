Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) says he cannot support the budget deal put forward by GOP leadership because of the White House’s intent to create a single payer “Obamacare of Crop Insurance.”

In a press release Tuesday after the budget deal was released to the public, Cramer said:

I cannot support the bill because it is a breach of the carefully negotiated 2014 Farm Bill. The White House’s intent to re-open the Farm Bill and create a single payer “Obamacare of Crop Insurance” is unacceptable to me and many members of Congress. I am committed to working with House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway and his committee to find the $3 billion in savings in other areas of the government.

GOP leadership is reportedly planning to rush the budget deal to a vote before Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) steps down as Speaker of the House at the end of the month.

Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) – who is expected to replace Boehner as House Speaker – said he thinks the process behind the budget deal “stinks” but has not promised to vote against it.
