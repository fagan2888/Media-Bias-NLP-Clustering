Paris, France

The French Interior Ministry says 3.7 million marched throughout France for an unprecedented rally to show unity in the face of terrorism after attacks that killed 17.



The Interior Ministry said that an estimated 2.5 million marched across France in cities and towns Sunday, and between 1.2 and 1.6 million in Paris. But it said a precise account is impossible given the enormity of the turnout in the capital.



Earlier the ministry said it was an unprecedented turnout.



World leaders also joined the march, after attacks on a newspaper office, kosher supermarket and police.
