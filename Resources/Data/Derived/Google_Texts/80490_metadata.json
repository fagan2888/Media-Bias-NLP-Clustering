(AP) - Oregon State Coach Wayne Tinkle said that in the aftermath of a loss, he had a \u201clittle chat\u201d with Gary Payton II about being more aggressive offensively and more of a leader.\n\nMessage received, loud and clear.\n\nPayton had 24 points, four steals and a school-record seven blocks as Oregon State defeated Colorado 72-58 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI always listen to him when we have those talks. I try to bring energy and leadership,\u201d Payton said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t myself the last game here, and I just have to get back to what I do best and run around and just facilitate and help the team.\u201d\n\nMalcolm Duvivier scored 17 points and Daniel Gomis added 10 points and four blocks for the Beavers (17-10, 8-7 Pac-12), who snapped a three-game losing streak.\n\nXavier Johnson had 12 points and nine rebounds and Tre\u2019Shaun Fletcher scored 11 for Colorado (12-14, 5-9), which has one road win on the season.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t have that fight, that competitiveness,\u201d said Colorado Coach Tad Boyle.\n\nOregon State shot 48.9 percent for the game, compared to the Buffaloes\u2019 34.6 percent. Colorado also had 22 turnovers.\n\nThanks to Oregon State\u2019s zone defense, Colorado started the game ice cold, shooting 1 of 16. \u201cWe came out with a lot of energy at game time and I think it sparked a really good run,\u201d Duvivier said.\n\n\u201cThat defense in the first half was some of the best defense we\u2019ve played all year,\u201d Tinkle added.\n\nThe Beavers took an 18-4 lead after Duvivier\u2019s 3-pointer with 8:52 left in the half.\n\nPayton\u2019s 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer put Oregon State ahead 34-12.\n\nColorado trailed big most of the second half. Johnson capped a 15-4 run with a 3-pointer for the Buffaloes that made the score 54-46 with 3:45 left. The Beavers had four turnovers during the stretch.\n\n\u201cWe started pressing, we started getting aggressive,\u201d Boyle said.\n\nDuvivier responded with a 3-pointer on Oregon State\u2019s next possession.\n\nPayton, a junior college transfer, is the son of NBA and Beavers great Gary Payton.\n\nAskia Booker entered the contest leading the Buffaloes with 17.4 points per game. Shadowed by Payton much of the night, he had nine points on 2-for-14 shooting.\n\n___\n\nTIP INS\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes have lost five of their last six games. \u2026 Josh Scott needs three blocks to become the fifth player in Colorado history with 1,000 points, 600 rebounds and 100 blocks.\n\nOregon State: The Beavers saw their school-record 14-game home winning streak snapped in a 47-37 loss to No. 9 Utah on Thursday. \u2026 The Beavers Pac-10 champion 1989-90 squad was honored during halftime, including the elder Payton, who was named Sports Illustrated player of the year that season.\n\nGRAND THEFT BASKETBALL\n\nGary Payton II is the only player in the Pac-12 with a steal in every game this season.
