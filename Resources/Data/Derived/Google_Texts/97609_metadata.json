Nadal, who has won eight titles in Paris, gets an opportunity to nudge ahead Monday when he plays his first-round match against American wild-card entry Robby Ginepri.\n\n\u201cRafa is the favorite\u201d to win this tournament, Federer proclaimed, saying Novak Djokovic comes next in the pecking order, \u201cand then the rest (of us); it\u2019s very clear.\u201d\n\nWhen Federer departed the main stadium, Serena Williams entered and had about the same amount of difficulty, beating 130th-ranked French wild-card entry Alize Lim 6-2, 6-1. Across the grounds at Court Suzanne Lenglen, Venus Williams defeated 17-year-old Belinda Bencic of Switzerland 6-4, 6-1.\n\nVenus, whose 34th birthday is next month, turned professional about 2\u00bd years before Bencic was born. No longer are there teens at the top \u2014 Venus, for example, was 17 when she reached her first Grand Slam final; younger sister Serena was that age when she won her first major championship.\n\nIndeed, the 2014 French Open women\u2019s field has more than twice as many players age 30 or older (17) as teens (eight).\n\n\u201cYoung folks today, eh?\u201d Venus said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to hopefully stay alive myself as an older player.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Roger Federer, Serena and Venus Williams advance at French Open", "title": "Roger Federer, Serena and Venus Williams advance at French Open", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/25/roger-federer-serena-and-venus-williams-advance-at-french-open/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140525__roger-federerp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140525__roger-federerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-25T16:37:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:20:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd132a\"", "article_summary": "Across the grounds at Court Suzanne Lenglen, Venus Williams defeated 17-year-old Belinda Bencic of Switzerland 6-4, 6-1.\nSunday\u2019s win was the 2009 champion\u2019s 59th in a French Open match, tying Federer with Rafael Nadal for the most in history.\nIndeed, the 2014 French Open women\u2019s field has more than twice as many players age 30 or older (17) as teens (eight).\nPARIS \u2014 Roger Federer\u2019s 4-year-old twins, Myla and Riva, hung in there for about 20 minutes Sunday in his guest box at Court Philippe Chatrier, long enough to see Daddy take control of his French Open match.\nVenus, whose 34th birthday is next month, turned professional about 2\u00bd years before Bencic was born."}
