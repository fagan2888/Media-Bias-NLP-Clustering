Birth control, abortion, embryonic research, and the Affordable Care act are a few of the perennial topics.\n\nA study commissioned by the AAAS offered insight into how Americans viewed the relationship between science and religion. It shows 38.3% of participants viewed the relationship as a collaboration, and 26.8% said it was in conflict. The remaining group was divided between favoring either science or religion.\n\nA video released followed the life of a young boy from the onset of Ebola to death. The video displayed information combining scientific findings alongside the church\u2019s information of African Culture. The video aimed to present information to solve the problem from religious and scientific standpoints.\n\nJennifer Wiseman is the director of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s Dialogue on Science, Ethics and Religion. She takes great interest in global health projects such as the Ebola video described above.\n\n\u201cMany religious communities are interested in bettering human health as a way of service to others,\u201d and they need the best scientific research in order to provide the best service, wrote Jennifer Wiseman in an email. She also wrote \u201chealth care practices are not carried out in a vacuum,\u201d requiring the insights of people like faith leaders to make a difference in communities.\n\nShe believes that global health should be an effort where religion and science can cross paths to work for the benefit of the world. The biases of both sides should not stand in the way of global health.\n\nResources\n\nFollow the Conversation on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "science and religion, global health, ebola", "wot-verification": "16fbad63ab63c74f7a00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=848230695", "og": {"site_name": "World Religion News", "description": "Can The Unlikely Duo Of Science and Religion Come Together To Improve Global Health?", "title": "Uniting Science and Religion to Improve Global Health - World Religion News", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://d2dr8938rg169c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/science-and-religion.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-25T12:20:53+00:00", "url": "http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/uniting-science-and-religion-to-improve-global-health", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "World Religion News", "description": "Can The Unlikely Duo Of Science and Religion Come Together To Improve Global Health?", "title": "Uniting Science and Religion to Improve Global Health - World Religion News", "image": "http://d2dr8938rg169c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/science-and-religion.jpg", "creator": "@wreligionnews", "site": "@wreligionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "5f29a126ba9e522baf7e2a66460567c0"}, "fb": {"admins": 100005957105571, "pages": 339229182869545}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msvalidate.01": "AF45DC66947DF3D642757570CA3C0A47", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WorldReligionNews", "section": "Issues", "tag": "Science and Religion", "published_time": "2015-03-29T12:00:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T12:20:53+00:00"}, "bitly-verification": "ed93578da323", "description": "Can The Unlikely Duo Of Science and Religion Come Together To Improve Global Health?"}, "article_summary": "Can the unlikely duo of science and religion come together to improve global health?\nShe believes that global health should be an effort where religion and science can cross paths to work for the benefit of the world.\nThe biases of both sides should not stand in the way of global health.\nShe takes great interest in global health projects such as the Ebola video described above.\nShe also wrote \u201chealth care practices are not carried out in a vacuum,\u201d requiring the insights of people like faith leaders to make a difference in communities."}
