PhRMA spokesman Robert Zirkelbach would only say on Wednesday that \u201ca decision has not been made yet.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUbl, who is credited with singlehandedly lifting the profile of the medical device industry in Washington, has spent 17 years in top positions at AdvaMed. His last 10 years have been as president and CEO.\n\nSince the passage of ObamaCare, Ubl has concentrated on repealing the law\u2019s medical device tax. Dozens of lawmakers from both parties have co-sponsored repeal legislation, including a bill that cleared the House earlier this year.\n\nA powerful healthcare advocate, he has been cited on lists like \u201cPeople Who Changed the Medtech Industry\u201d and \u201cThe Hill\u2019s Top Lobbyists.\u201d He was also the sixth highest-paid healthcare lobbyist last year with total compensation of almost $2 million, according to an analysis by Modern Healthcare.\n\nUbl has been outspoken on issues like regulation, writing in an op-ed last year that the Obama administration\u2019s regulators are \u201cslowing the pace of innovation.\u201d He has also led efforts to streamline the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s process for reviewing products.\n\nThe leadership at PhRMA, the pharmaceutical sector\u2019s leading lobby, has been in question since its current president and CEO, John Castellani, announced plans to step down in April. Castellani has been at the helm for 10 years.\n\nHis announcement came during a massive shake-up among top healthcare lobbying shops, with the long-time leaders of America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) also stepping down this spring.\n\nAdvaMed did not return requests for comment about the move, first reported by Politico Pro.\n\n\u2014This report was updated at 12:23 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Steve Ubl appears poised to lead the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s largest trade group.", "description": "Steve Ubl appears poised to lead the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s largest trade group.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Steve Ubl appears poised to lead the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s largest trade group.", "title": "Medical device lobbyist tapped to lead PhRMA", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/254642-medical-device-lobbyist-tapped-to-lead-phrma", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/254642-medical-device-lobbyist-tapped-to-lead-phrma", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-23T11:44-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-23T11:44:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/254642-medical-device-lobbyist-tapped-to-lead-phrma", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Steve Ubl appears poised to lead the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s largest trade group.", "card": "summary", "title": "Medical device lobbyist tapped to lead PhRMA"}, "dcterms.title": "Medical device lobbyist tapped to lead PhRMA"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe232a\"", "article_summary": "A medical device lobbyist is expected to take over as head of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s largest trade group, according to a source.\nSince the passage of ObamaCare, Ubl has concentrated on repealing the law\u2019s medical device tax.\nSteve Ubl, president and CEO of AdvaMed, will \u201cmore than likely\u201d take over as president and CEO of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the source said.\nPhRMA spokesman Robert Zirkelbach would only say on Wednesday that \u201ca decision has not been made yet.\u201dADVERTISEMENTUbl, who is credited with singlehandedly lifting the profile of the medical device industry in Washington, has spent 17 years in top positions at AdvaMed.\nThe leadership at PhRMA, the pharmaceutical sector\u2019s leading lobby, has been in question since its current president and CEO, John Castellani, announced plans to step down in April."}
