(AP) - Lou Ann Rieley held a crying toddler close to her chest.\n\nShe methodically patted the child\u2019s back, rocking her gently in a green La-Z-Boy.\n\nThe toddler\u2019s wails were drowned out by a number of other children of all ages running in the living room - all seemingly in a hurry, but with nowhere to go.\n\nThe family dog barked down the hall, riled by the commotion. The front door swung open and two more children raced in.\n\n\u201cCan you all go play outside, please,\u201d she said, patting the baby\u2019s back.\n\nThe scene appeared chaotic, at best. But to Rieley, it was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nAs a mother of 11 biological children, she\u2019s used to a full house.\n\nFor the last 36 years, Rieley has opened her home to those in need of a place to stay, mostly to children who have been abused or abandoned.\n\nHer generosity and ever-growing family has captured the hearts of her Millsboro neighbors and the rest of the state. For the last decade, her story has been featured in countless publications and television broadcasts. Additionally, The Delaware Association of America Mothers recognized her as Delaware\u2019s Mother of the Year in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt was a tremendous honor,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were many other worthy mothers who could have easily carried the title.\u201d\n\nRieley and her husband, John, have taken in six to nine kids through the foster care system over the years. Countless others have come and gone on their own. Many have just shown up on their doorstep.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve helped more than I can remember,\u201d she said, counting on her fingers.\n\nThe grand total is somewhere around 40, she figured.\n\nAt times, Rieley joked, she wasn\u2019t aware she was parenting some of the kids in her house.\n\n\u201cWe always had this big dorm room upstairs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had six boys, ages 16 to 25, living up there because we had a business that employed a lot of them - we created a business for them.\n\n\u201cOne boy was at dinner every night for three weeks and I asked him, \u2018Do you live here?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yeah, I moved in three weeks ago with the other guys.\u2019 \u201c\n\nRieley always dreamed of having a big family, but more importantly, she wanted a blended one, made up of the lonely and downtrodden. Rieley herself was adopted and grew up hearing stories of her grandfather, an orphan.\n\nHe became a successful member of society - a businessman, husband and father, despite all odds.\n\n\u201cHe never even knew his real name,\u201d she said, handing over the crying baby to its mother, Kelly, one of Rieley\u2019s elder children. Kelly wrapped the child in blankets and hugged her own mother.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back for dinner,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter they left, a hush fell over the living room. Faint sounds of children playing outside drifted in through the open window. The ceiling fan made a ticking sound with each rotation.\n\n\u201cJack Davis was the name my grandfather took for himself,\u201d Rieley said.\n\nThough he died five years before Rieley was born, she always felt as if she knew him, thanks to the stories of her mother and grandmother.\n\n\u201cTo hear about all that he went through broke my heart and inspired me at the same time,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI knew that when I grew up, I wanted to help those with similar circumstances.\u201d\n\nBut opening one\u2019s home to kids with troubled pasts can come with a price. Windows have been smashed. Walls have been punched. Doors have been kicked in. Police intervention has been needed more than once.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even begin to understand the darkness some of these children have escaped from,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never tolerated them acting out, but we understood it.\u201d\n\nThere usually was a pattern. The bad behavior didn\u2019t happen immediately, and it typically didn\u2019t last long, she said. It would begin after what she called the \u201choneymoon period.\u201d A few months after arriving on their best behavior - once they felt safe and bonded with the group - they\u2019d start to act out.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d get comfortable and then they\u2019d get scared,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019d be scared of getting hurt again by people they loved. So, as a way to gain control, they\u2019d lash out, say hurtful things and get violent. Reject you before you can reject them kind of thing.\u201d\n\nRieley said she\u2019s watched this pattern of behavior dozens of times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always rough,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have to hold on tight through it. We always reassured them that they had found a place of peace - a place of love.\u201d\n\nTroubled kids aren\u2019t the only ones who have received the Rieleys\u2019 love. They\u2019ve helped drug addicts, homeless people, displaced families and single mothers get back on their feet.\n\nBut a stay at the Rieley house isn\u2019t a vacation. Those living there must agree to the house rules, which include receiving a proper education.\n\nRieley homeschools all of the children. Her students study Latin, philosophy, algebra, business ethics and social etiquette, among many other subjects. She also encourages her children to take an interest in politics and the world around them.\n\n\u201cWhen our oldest kids were little, we took them to Washington, D.C., every year - not just to the museums, but to the White House, to the Capital, to the Supreme Court - and we told them from a very early age that \u2018someday, you\u2019ll come back here and you\u2019re going to make a difference.\u2019 And three of them so far have done that.\u201d\n\nThose living under her roof must also work toward independence, either keeping a job or actively looking for one.\n\nMany don\u2019t have to look far.\n\nThe family home sits on nearly 125 acres of farmland purchased years ago by Rieley\u2019s grandfather. The farm has plenty of animals: cows, horses, pigs, rabbits and dogs. There\u2019s no lack of work to be done.\n\nThree boys bounded into the living room.\n\n\u201cMom, when is dinner?\u201d asked Matthew, Rieley\u2019s youngest.\n\n\u201cIn a little bit,\u201d she said.\n\nNot only is Rieley a wife, mother, businesswoman and teacher, but she\u2019s also a head chef who\u2019s mastered the art of cooking for a large family. She makes a buffet-style breakfast every morning and a big, sit-down dinner each night.\n\n\u201cMealtime is important here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s when we come together as a family, share our stories and adventures from the day.\u201d\n\nAs Rieley walked into the kitchen, the last glimpse of sunlight came through the window above the sink. A holiday candle burning on the counter filled the room with the scent of candied apples, cinnamon and pine needles. A hint of bacon lingered in the air, perhaps from breakfast.\n\n\u201cSteak is on the menu tonight,\u201d she said, pulling tender cuts of meat from the refrigerator.\n\nThe steaks were from the farm. The day before, they had fresh, roasted ham.\n\nWhile Rieley trimmed the steaks using a pair of kitchen scissors, her husband John came home from work. The two exchanged warm hellos.\n\n\u201cSo how many are we feeding tonight?\u201d he asked, kissing her on the cheek.\n\n\u201cI think 10,\u201d she replied.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Times of Salisbury, Md., http://www.delmarvanow.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lou Ann Rieley held a crying toddler close to her chest.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Lou Ann Rieley held a crying toddler close to her chest.", "title": "Full house: Delaware mother takes in 40 kids, she guesses", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/20/full-house-delaware-mother-takes-in-40-kids-she-gu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/20/exchange_foster_care.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/20/exchange_foster_care.jpeg", "description": "Lou Ann Rieley held a crying toddler close to her chest.", "card": "summary", "title": "Full house: Delaware mother takes in 40 kids, she guesses"}, "Author": "HANNAH CARROLL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "After they left, a hush fell over the living room.\nAdditionally, The Delaware Association of America Mothers recognized her as Delaware\u2019s Mother of the Year in 2013.\nAt times, Rieley joked, she wasn\u2019t aware she was parenting some of the kids in her house.\nThree boys bounded into the living room.\nAs a mother of 11 biological children, she\u2019s used to a full house."}
