You know, the guy from those travel books. He also has a travel TV show called \u201cRick Steves\u2019 Europe: Through the back door\u201d where he shows you how to travel through Europe through, well, the back door. He\u2019s also possibly the biggest fanny-pack and dad-jeans wearing dork on earth. You know, this guy:\n\nWell old Rick Steves has been getting political these days. First he outed himself as a proud pothead with his advocacy for Washington state\u2019s legal marijuana law passed this last November. He became something of a spokesman for New Approach Washington, and was successful at helping get the historic pot legalization bill passed.\n\nThen Rick got political again on Monday, coming out as an Obamacare supporter. Both these moves have angered the more conservative faction of Rick\u2019s travel following, but Rick really doesn\u2019t seem to care\u2014he\u2019s like the Honey Badger of fanny-pack-wearing travel hosts.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt of what Rick wrote on his blog this week:\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to me that in our great nation, about a fifth of the citizens are unable to afford health insurance, need to go to the emergency room for routine medical needs, and are terrorized by the specter of one serious accident or sickness wiping out their family financially. And, just as amazing, half of our country thinks that\u2019s OK and is fighting mad about the possibility of change. Even more perplexing, many of the people who think this is the best America can afford are the very people who need help the most.\n\n\u2026\n\nSomeone recently asked me, \u201cAs a businessman and an employer, what do you think of Obamacare?\u201d My response was that, as a businessman, I don\u2019t think of it at all. I employ 80 people. I imagine my health-care costs might go up a bit. But this is a community issue. My response to Obamacare is as an American who wants to be proud of my country. It is an embarrassment that so many Americans are brutalized by health-care costs. Europeans and Canadians \u2014 who spend far less per person on health care, like their care, and have options for rich people to get all the private VIP service they like \u2014 marvel at how so much of America is hell-bent on maintaining our status quo.\n\n\u2026\n\nThose opposed to Obamacare have a powerful and well-funded voice. I believe it\u2019s the slickest marketing initiative money can buy. Those who need the Affordable Care Act don\u2019t have these special interests speaking out in their favor. Study the issue carefully. Ask yourself what motivates the loudest voices pulling out all the stops to shape your opinion: compassion or greed?\n\nRead the rest here, and visit healthcare.gov, which is now back up and running, to get yourself some health insurance if you need.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who would have thought?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Who would have thought?", "title": "Rick Steves is a proud pothead and Obamacare advocate", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/206952/rick-steves-is-a-proud-pothead-and-obamacare-advocate/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-02-at-10.16.58-AM.png", "height": 443}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Who would have thought?", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "rick steves,rick steves healthcare,rick steves marijuana,rick steves obamacare,news", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-02T14:45:14Z", "modified_time": "2013-10-03T10:36:43Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a0f\"", "article_summary": "You know, this guy:Well old Rick Steves has been getting political these days.\nPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of Rick Steves.\nHe also has a travel TV show called \u201cRick Steves\u2019 Europe: Through the back door\u201d where he shows you how to travel through Europe through, well, the back door.\nMy response to Obamacare is as an American who wants to be proud of my country.\nFirst he outed himself as a proud pothead with his advocacy for Washington state\u2019s legal marijuana law passed this last November."}
