For information on how to enroll, visit www.HealthCare.gov. The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, has helped millions of uninsured Americans\u2014especially Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, or AAPIs\u2014gain affordable, high-quality health care coverage. As enrollment for 2015 coverage begins, here are five facts to keep in mind about the effects of the ACA on the AAPI community.\n\nA substantial number of AAPIs remain uninsured. Before the ACA, one in every six AAPIs were uninsured. Among some AAPI groups\u2014such as Korean, Tongan, Pakistani, and Thai Americans\u2014nearly one in four people were uninsured. Even taking into account the first round of enrollment, 1.3 million of them are still uninsured.\n\nThe ACA has expanded AAPIs\u2019 access to high-quality health care. After the first round of enrollment, an additional 600,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders gained insurance coverage, and 121,000 young AAPI adults between ages 19 and 26 gained coverage under a parent\u2019s employer-sponsored or individually purchased health insurance plan. By 2016, 2 million otherwise uninsured AAPIs will gain or be eligible for coverage.\n\nThe ACA has made quality health care more affordable for AAPIs. Approximately 10 percent of AAPIs who purchased insurance offered through the federal and state health insurance marketplaces benefited from financial assistance, such as tax credits. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, has estimated that almost half of those who enrolled in plans with tax credits pay $50 or less in insurance premiums per month.\n\nThe ACA has ameliorated health disparities that long plagued the AAPI community. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were more likely to have Hepatitis B as of 2014, and AAPI women were less likely to get screened for cancer. Under the ACA, an estimated 4.3 million AAPIs\u2014particularly, 2.5 million AAPI women\u2014with private insurance now have access to expanded preventive services, such as screenings for various types of cancer, with no cost sharing.\n\nAlthough language and cultural barriers have limited the reach of the ACA\u2019s benefit to AAPIs, organizations have found effective ways to transcend these barriers. For example, Action for Health Justicepartnered with local organizations and small businesses to translate health insurance marketplace materials into Hindi, Korean, Farsi, Mandarin, and Arabic Urdu, among many others, as well as to provide multilingual and multicultural assistance for the AAPI community.\n\nFor the 1.3 million uninsured AAPI, the 2015 enrollment period is very important. The community has already benefited greatly from affordable, accessible, and quality health care. Now that local organizational efforts have addressed language and cultural barriers\u2014which previously hindered the population from enjoying the ACA\u2019s benefits\u2014the AAPI community should seize this opportunity to enroll in the second round of open enrollment.\n\nJohn Zhang is a former Progress 2050 intern and a current student at the University of California, Los Angeles.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "name", "description": "A look at five facts that highlight the benefits of the Affordable Care Act for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.", "title": "5 Key Facts About the Affordable Care Act for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders", "url": "https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2015/01/27/104458/5-key-facts-about-the-affordable-care-act-for-asian-americans-and-pacific-islanders/", "image": "https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP101206021194_WEB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 217056148424105}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "elq-topic": "race"}, "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, has helped millions of uninsured Americans\u2014especially Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, or AAPIs\u2014gain affordable, high-quality health care coverage.\n5 Key Facts About the Affordable Care Act for Asian Americans and Pacific IslandersSOURCE: Rick Maiman/AP for UnitedHealthcareLee Sheut-Hing, center, discusses how her insurance agency's health and wellness programs have helped her achieve better health with representatives from UnitedHealthcare.\nThe community has already benefited greatly from affordable, accessible, and quality health care.\nThe ACA has made quality health care more affordable for AAPIs.\nFor the 1.3 million uninsured AAPI, the 2015 enrollment period is very important."}
