According to recent data, as many as one in 50 children lives somewhere on the spectrum, which ranges from mild social impairments to severe difficulties with language and motor control.\n\nThe team\u2019s stated goal in the study was not to develop a robust saliva test in full, but to prove the method\u2019s reliability and collect small data samples they could then use in larger follow-up tests. \u201cThis is a first step,\u201d senior author and neuropsychology researcher Alisa Woods told Medical Daily. \u201cThe hope is that we can find some biological marker that co-varies with a behavioral measurement.\u201d\n\nRight now, the gold standard for ASD diagnosis is a test called the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) exam. It\u2019s a series of assessments that gauges a person\u2019s location on the autism spectrum based on things like communication skills and ability to socialize. However, the ADOS exam is often dismissed as too simplistic. As Woods explains, autism isn\u2019t merely a social disorder. Several studies have linked it to medical issues involving gastrointestinal dysfunction, which can trigger immune responses and produce inflammation in the body. The new test hopes to exploit some of these additional symptoms.\n\nTo do that, the team collected drool samples from 12 participants, six of whom had ASD and six who didn\u2019t. In analyzing the samples for protein concentrations, they ultimately found the children with ASD had markedly different proteins overall and different concentrations of similar proteins in their saliva than kids in the control group. To the researchers, this suggested the method for detecting new biomarkers held water.\n\nWoods is quick to point out she and her colleagues don\u2019t have a legitimate test on their hands, at least not yet. \u201cWe need to do a larger-scale study to validate the markers and compare the markers with the behavioral measurements,\u201d she said. From there, they\u2019d need to carry out blind trials that test the method\u2019s sensitivity (how well it ignores non-essential information) and its consistency. \u201cIf we can do that, certainly we might be able to improve upon either the existing tests or supplement them.\u201d\n\nIf the research offers a novel benefit, it will be in the timing of diagnosis. Behavioral measurements like the ADOS exam can offer clues as to what\u2019s going on inside the body, but they don\u2019t reveal the entire picture. They can\u2019t; discreet changes aren\u2019t always evident until the child matures.\n\nBiomarkers pick up that slack. They can provide a window into the many processes involved with keeping homeostasis, which include the typical responses in the digestive system like inflammation and immune response. If the biomarkers stay true after rigorous follow-up tests, scientists would have a new way not only to identify ASD but parse out the severity. They could also have the potential to form a protein signature: five or so key proteins that, if present together, Woods says, indicate one risk over another.\n\n\u201cThere are so many different things we can do further.\u201d\n\nSource: Wetie A, Wormwood K, Russell S, Ryan J, Darie C, Woods A.
