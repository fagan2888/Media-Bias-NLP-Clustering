It shows. It\u2019s just how fast he can move at his size. Not a lot of guys can do that and he\u2019s obviously gonna have success in this league with that kind of talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral times Clady and Clowney matched up in individual drills and live team exercises. Once, toward the end of practice during a hurry-up drill, Clowney beat Clady to the inside and pressured Manning on a touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas. Had it been a regular season game, it\u2019s likely that Clowney would have knocked Manning to the ground on the throw, if not made it all the way there for a sack.\n\nClowney received similar reviews from Broncos tight end Julius Thomas, who helped double-team Clowney a few times when he moved off the line and into a linebacker position. Thomas said Wednesday\u2019s practice would be more telling, though, because players will be in full pads (although the teams still won\u2019t tackle to the ground.)\n\nThe Texans, with Clowney and two-time Pro Bowler J.J. Watt often lining up on opposite ends, will likely have one of the strongest defensive lines in the league. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, who has gone up against Watt in the past, acknowledged that Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine that kind of ability and his work ethic, that is why he\u2019s such a special player,\u201d Manning said of Watt, who tallied 10 1/2 sacks last season. \u201cAnd obviously Clowney appears to be one heck of a talent.\u201d\n\nBut the praise for Watt and Clowney wasn\u2019t just coming from the Broncos\u2019 offense. Denver defensive end DeMarcus Ware said he could tell the rookie was a special player just from watching on the sideline.\n\n\u201cI see how athletic he is and how he plays the game,\u201d Ware said of Clowney. \u201cHe had a couple plays in practice today where you could see his athleticism. J.J., he\u2019s the same thing. \u2026 He can rush the passer and stop the run and make big plays.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,DeMarcus Ware,J.J.
