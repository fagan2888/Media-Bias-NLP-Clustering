Bush \u2014 not Obamacare \u2014 for the remarkable Medicare cost slowdown.\u201d The news story, by reporter Lori Montgomery, reports on a posting, \u201cThe $500 Billion Medicare Slowdown: A Story About Part D,\u201d by health policy experts Loren Adler and Adam Rosenberg on a blog hosted by the prestigious Health Affairs policy journal.\n\nAdler and Rosenberg make the case that it is Bush-era changes to the Medicare program for seniors that have led to the overall slowing of growth in the Medicare program. Specifically, they point to changes in the Part D program\u2013the prescription drug program.\n\nThe authors write, \u201cDespite constituting barely more than 10 percent of Medicare spending, our analysis shows that Part D has accounted for over 60 percent of the slowdown in Medicare benefits since 2011.\u201d\n\nWhile both decline in spending and cheaper drugs might, at first glance, seem positive, there will be a serious cost. That cost is drug innovation.\n\nAdler and Rosenberg point out two distinct causes of the drug spending decline: \u201cLower Part D spending primarily stems from the \u2018patent cliff\u2019 \u2013 a number of blockbuster brand-name drugs that have lost patent protection, paving the way for cheaper generic competitors \u2014 and a decrease in the rate of introduction of new brand-name drugs.\u201d\n\nThey explain that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)\n\n\u201cfound that, between 2007 and 2010, the share of prescriptions filled with generic drugs rose from 67 percent to 78 percent nationwide (and from 63 percent to 73 percent in Part D). In addition, brand name drugs with a combined $117.2 billion in U.S. sales, including best-sellers like Nexium and Cymbalta, are expected to lose patent protection between 2012 and 2016 according to analysis from the Congressional Research Service.\u201d\n\nThe second and more unsettling reason for the lower spending decline is that \u201cCBO also found that new branded pharmaceuticals have been introduced at a slower rate than in the late 1990s.\u201d\n\nWhat the Health Affairs bloggers and the Washington Post reporter miss, fixated as they are on the goal of limiting health care spending, is the critical point that the development of new drugs, while an expensive process, is a good thing because it leads to life-saving new treatments. For more on this you can read the recent NRL news article, \u201cEven bigoted study finds high-cost drugs worth it.\u201d Also see this article.\n\nThe decline in pharmaceutical innovation may be attributed to past changes to the Medicare part D program as well as mechanisms contained in the Obama Health care law \u2013 all meant to suppress health care spending. Too few recognize that, drug price controls have a devastating effect on the development of new lifesaving drugs.\n\nResearch and development is financed by investors who buy stock or provide venture capital. Investment in pharmaceutical development is risky. Many promising leads fail to work out and never make it to the market. On average, of 5,000 potential new drugs tested, only one is eventually approved for patient use. Of all new drugs brought to market, only 30% recover their research and development costs.\n\nThose who say drugs are overpriced often compare the high price of an innovative, breakthrough drug with the low cost of its production. They conclude that, even taking into account the cost of research and development for that particular drug, the patient is being \u201cgouged\u201d to produce \u201cwindfall\u201d profits. This perspective fails to recognize that given the high odds against any given potential drug ever getting to the market and then actually making money, only the possibility of that high rate of return can induce investors to invest.\n\nBut while everyone would prefer to pay less\u2013or nothing\u2013for health care (or anything else), government price controls prevent access to lifesaving medical treatment that costs more than the prices set by the government. In fact, the Obama Health care law is full of various ways that the government can limit what resources Americans will be permitted to devote to saving the lives of themselves and their family members (documentation here).\n\nThe basic point is that health care spending is crucial to innovation and quality treatments. Now and for years to come, Obamacare will work through regulation and pressure on insurers to hold down spending and will stifle both innovation and quality care. That is, unless the Obama Health law can be repealed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NoMoney.png"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "article_summary": "The basic point is that health care spending is crucial to innovation and quality treatments.\nThe decline in pharmaceutical innovation may be attributed to past changes to the Medicare part D program as well as mechanisms contained in the Obama Health care law \u2013 all meant to suppress health care spending.\nToo few recognize that, drug price controls have a devastating effect on the development of new lifesaving drugs.\nBut while everyone would prefer to pay less\u2013or nothing\u2013for health care (or anything else), government price controls prevent access to lifesaving medical treatment that costs more than the prices set by the government.\nOf all new drugs brought to market, only 30% recover their research and development costs."}
