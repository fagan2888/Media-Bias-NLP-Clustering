This was the essential condition for Britain to restore her reputation and standing.\u2019 This contradictory statement is like many others by leading politicians that Britain\u2019s standing depended upon the United States and not Britain itself. It amounts to a fundamentally defeatist view of the country that Thatcher herself wanted to be \u2018great.\u2019\n\nThroughout her eleven years in Downing Street Thatcher was obsessed with America and the special relationship, which she put at the top of her international priorities even though she lectured US presidents and was not afraid to advance a tough contrary view. Her first visits to the United States were in 1975 and 1977 as leader of the opposition. \u2018Not for the last time, she was a tremendous hit with the Americans. It was the beginning of a relationship, which never broke down: which was, indeed, to be a definitive element of her foreign policy as prime minister.\n\nHaving met, among others, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, she said of the visit: \u201cI feel I have been accepted as a leader in the international sphere, the field in which they said I would never be accepted\u201d.\u2019 On a third visit to the United States in 1979 she met President Jimmy Carter. \u2018In December at the invitation of President Carter I made a short visit to the United States\u2014the first of many as Prime Minister. In a short speech at my reception on the White House Lawn I went out of my way to reaffirm my support for American leadership of the West.\u2019 In a lengthy interview on the ABC network in February 1981, Thatcher expressed regret for the \u2018complete misunderstanding about the European initiative on the Middle East\u2019. She also reassured viewers that the US was the \u2018single most important nation and what it does is the single most important thing in the Middle East. And we all understand that in Europe and would like our American friends to know that we understand that.\u2019 (Press Conference for Washington Press Club, 26 February 1981.)\n\nThus, early in her premiership Thatcher had appointed herself the European cheerleader for the United States. To the Conservative Party Conference later that year, she said: \u2018We cannot defend ourselves, either in this island or in Europe, without a close, effective and warm-hearted alliance with the United States. Our friendship with America rests not only on the memory of common dangers jointly faced and of common ancestors. It rests on a respect for the same rule of law and representative democracy. Our purpose must be not just to confirm but to strengthen a friendship which has twice saved us this century. Had it not been for the magnanimity of the United States, Europe would not be free today.\u2019 Andrew Thomson, one of her biographers, goes on to say: \u2018She will be the first, of course, to explain and appreciate that all nations are unique and that she does not want the United Kingdom to become a miniature America. But the sheer rushing, gushing spirit of free enterprise in the United States will always reinforce her own vision for Britain.\u2019\n\nThatcher never approached Europe with anything like the same spirit. \u2018Her ear was so attuned to the anti-Europeanism of the 1970s that it overlooked the anti-Americanism of the 1980s. For her, Americans are wartime allies and Cold War partners\u2014attitudes formed, no doubt, before 1960.\u2019 Sir Percy Cradock, Foreign Policy Adviser for the second half of Thatcher\u2019s premiership, said: \u2018Solidarity with the US as a cardinal principle of foreign policy acquired a special sanctity under Margaret Thatcher, but as a working rule it had been in place for many British Governments over many years.\u2019 Thatcher believed that the Anglo-American relationship had done more for the defence and future of freedom than any other alliance in the world. Referring to NATO in 1990\u2014her last year of power\u2014Thatcher wrote: \u2018However fascinated I was by events in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, I could not forget that the strength and security of the West ultimately depended upon the Anglo-American relationship,\u2019 a view that relegated the rest of Europe to a Thatcherite obscurity. Elsewhere in her autobiography she claims that following the end of the Cold War a deep confusion existed about the future of Europe and Britain\u2019s place in it. She wrote that the special relationship had been allowed to cool to near freezing point. Contemplating future developments in the post-Cold War world\u2014an Orwell-type division into three blocs or a return to a pre-1914 big power scramble\u2014she says:\n\n\u2018Neither need come to pass if the Atlantic Alliance remains, in essence, America as the dominant power surrounded by allies which, in their own long-term interest, generally follow its lead.\u2014And such collective security can only really be provided if there is a superpower of last resort.\u2019\n\nAnalysis of this argument suggests an Orwellian outcome or a prolongation of Cold War tactics that would encourage Russia to reorganise its policies so as to oppose the spread of US hegemony. Constant emphasis upon Western security requires an answer to the question: security against which power or group of powers, and the implication is the continuation of rival bloc policies. Geoffrey Howe, after ten years of loyal service as chancellor and then foreign secretary and finally the non-role of deputy prime minister, at last fell out with Thatcher in spectacular fashion. Subsequently, in his memoir \u201cConflict of Loyalty,\u201d he highlights points of difference between the United States and Britain and Thatcher\u2019s response to them. British policy was to uphold the International Court of Justice while the US either ignored or vetoed its jurisdiction as it did over the Contras laying mines in Nicaraguan waters. Thatcher insisted that rather than vote against the United States Britain should abstain. \u2018It was hardly a major issue. But I was nevertheless disconcerted by the strange sequence of events: first, Britain supports US action against Libyan terrorism, second, US supports Britain in action against Irish terrorism; third, Britain condones US-sponsored \u201cterrorism\u201d against Nicaragua.\n\nThis was yet another occasion, on which Margaret insisted on carrying the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d perhaps one bridge too far.\u2019 In all the differences between Thatcher and the Americans\u2014there were several\u2014she first argued that a good ally must disagree when necessary but always in the end came out as the agent\u2014reluctant or otherwise\u2014 of the United States. Her strong words obscured her subservience. The change of government in the United States, which replaced Reagan with Bush senior and Baker as secretary of state, altered Washington\u2019s perspective on the special relationship. \u2018So neither Bush nor Baker was likely to accept the thesis, which Margaret Thatcher has re-enunciated, that \u201cthe ties of blood, language, culture and values which bound Britain and America were the only firm basis for US policy in the West\u201d.\u2019\n\nThatcher managed to establish a remarkable rapport with President Ronald Reagan not least because they shared the same free-market approach to their respective economies. In 1981 Thatcher had her first meeting as prime minister with President Reagan at which she made plain her intended adherence to the Atlantic Alliance when she said: \u2018Your problems will be our problems and when you look for friends we shall be there.\u2019 These two \u2018ideological soul mates\u2019 reinvigorated what Thatcher described as the \u2018extraordinary alliance\u2019. They shared a commitment to free trade, low taxes, limited government and strong defence. At the same time they rejected the concept of de\u0301tente with the Soviet Union; they wanted to win the Cold War. The friendship between the two led to a revival of the special relationship, which had suffered a marked decline from the time that Heath took Britain into the EEC. There were to be four particular events that would test the special relationship: the Falklands War (1982); the US invasion of Grenada (1983); the US bombing of Libya (1986); and the ending of the Cold War, which raised acute fears in Britain that the United States would come to terms with the USSR without consulting its ally.\n\n\u2018The Thatcher-Reagan axis of the eighties will surely be remembered for developing a more robust capitalism and for achieving by strength and unity in the wider North Atlantic Alliance, disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union. Diplomats, businessmen and politicians have all played their part in securing these successes, but the pivot was the personal relationship of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.\u2019 In his biography, \u201cOne of Us,\u201d Hugo Young claims that during the Reagan period Thatcher had established a significant hold on US opinion: first, her victory in the Falklands; second, an improving economy; third her rapport with the president. In December 1984 Thatcher visited Washington to tell Reagan that his Strategic Defence Initiative (Stars Wars) would not work. On another visit shortly afterwards in February 1985 she addressed a joint session of Congress: \u2018To maintain nuclear deterrence\u2019 she told Congress, \u2018it was necessary to ensure our research and capacity do not fall behind the work being done by the Soviet Union. That is why I firmly support President Reagan\u2019s decision to pursue research into defence against ballistic nuclear missiles\u2014the Strategic Defence Initiative.\u2019 She thus expunged her stand of the previous December. Also in the same speech to Congress, Thatcher said: \u2018No one of my generation can forget that America has been the principal architect of a peace in Europe that has lasted forty years. Given this shield of the United States, we have been granted the opportunities to build a concept of Europe beyond the dreams of our fathers.\u2019 In none of her actions in relation to Europe did Thatcher do anything to advance this concept of Europe. The year 1985 was when the two countries celebrated 200 years of diplomatic relations and the occasion led to a two-way exchange of compliments with Thatcher claiming \u2018our relationship a truly remarkable one. It is special. It just is and that\u2019s that.\u2019 Reagan replied: \u2018The United States and the United Kingdom are bound together by inseparable ties of ancient history and present friendship.\u2019 The Reagan connection was of huge importance to Thatcher who went out of her way on a number of occasions to extol its merits: \u2018But Ronald Reagan\u2019s election was of immediate and fundamental importance because it demonstrated that the United States, the greatest force for liberty that the world has known, was about to reassert a self-confident leadership in world affairs. I never had any doubt of the importance of this change and from the first I regarded it as my duty to do everything I could to reinforce and further President Reagan\u2019s bold strategy to win the Cold War which the West had been slowly but surely losing.\u2019 The message in this statement was simple: everything depended upon the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two most important conservative figures of the past 30 years had a more complicated relationship than you think", "author": "Guy Arnold", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The two most important conservative figures of the past 30 years had a more complicated relationship than you think", "title": "The Iron Lady\u2019s American obsession: Thatcher and Reagan\u2019s desperate political alliance", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/22/the_iron_ladys_american_obsession_thatcher_and_reagans_desperate_political_alliance/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/thatcher_reagan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The two most important conservative figures of the past 30 years had a more complicated relationship than you think", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/thatcher_reagan.jpg", "title": "The Iron Lady\u2019s American obsession: Thatcher and Reagan\u2019s desperate political alliance", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The Iron Lady\u2019s American obsession: Thatcher and Reagan\u2019s desperate political alliance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1980s, America, Books, Britain, Conservatism, Editor's Picks, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd6f\"", "article_summary": "Her first visits to the United States were in 1975 and 1977 as leader of the opposition.\nThatcher insisted that rather than vote against the United States Britain should abstain.\nThus, early in her premiership Thatcher had appointed herself the European cheerleader for the United States.\nShe wrote that the special relationship had been allowed to cool to near freezing point.\nSubsequently, in his memoir \u201cConflict of Loyalty,\u201d he highlights points of difference between the United States and Britain and Thatcher\u2019s response to them."}
