Apparently when it comes to the government shutdown battle over the implications of Obamacare, all Senator Marco Rubio has to offer is lame pop culture jokes. In the same day that Rubio said he will not vote for a deal to end the shutdown and raise the debt limit, he unleashed a new campaign site called "Obamacare Horror Story" through his Reclaim America PAC.

To reiterate: The federal government is shut down and Marco Rubio is making American Horror Story jokes. There's not even information on this site as to why Rubio thinks Obamacare is so bad. It's just a tacky bid to get people to sign up for his mailing lists so he can pester them with fundraising e-mails.

Meanwhile, senators who are doing things beside coming up with dumb TV parodies announced a deal today that they hope would end the shutdown, raise the debt limit and save America from defaulting on its loans.

Rubio released a statement saying he's against it.

"I cannot support this deal because it postpones any significant action on pro-growth and spending reforms and does nothing to provide working class Americans even one shred of relief from ObamaCare's harmful effects."
