They added that the rock\u2019s surface had signs of burning, which takes place when an space object enters the atmosphere.\n\nOn Wednesday, national media reported another rock half the size showed up just a few miles away from the original discovery site. These reports follow multiple sightings of a shooting star in Suwon, a suburb south of Seoul.\n\nFollowing the initial reports of the first rock, the national media have begun speculating on its value, noting that very rare meteorites are sold for dozens of dollars per gram.\n\nThe space rock trade isn\u2019t common in South Korea outside academic circles but collectors worldwide buy and sell meteorites.\n\nLee Jong-ik, a geologist at the Korea Polar Research Institute and lead researcher in the ongoing analysis, on Wednesday said it\u2019s too early to give a precise estimate of the value of the rock, which depends on the rarity of its composition.\n\nHeightened interest in the rock\u2019s value is partly due to the Sochi Winter Olympics, where the organizers awarded medals containing a piece of a meteorite on Feb. 15. Athletes received the medals to commemorate a February 2013 asteroid explosion above the Russian province of Chelyabinsk Oblast.\n\nAgence France-Presse/Getty Images A file picture taken on February 15, 2013, shows a meteorite trail seen above a residential apartment block in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk.\n\nThe Chelyabinsk explosion is also known for producing the largest meteorite fragment on record, weighing about 650 kilograms and found in a lake in October in the Urals.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAlso popular on Korea Real Time now:\n\nIKEA Hits South Korea Finally\n\nSaturday Night Live Faces Backlash for Adoptee Parody", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "South Korean media outlets are abuzz this week with the news of the discovery of a possible meteorite, likening the rock to a jackpot worth millions of dollars.", "title": "Meteorite Fever Grips South Korean Media", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/12/meteorite-fever-grips-south-korean-media/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BW420_meteor_P_20140312031039.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Meteorite Fever Grips South Korean Media", "description": "South Korean media outlets are abuzz this week with the news of the discovery of a possible meteorite, likening the rock to a jackpot worth millions of dollars.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Jeyup S.
