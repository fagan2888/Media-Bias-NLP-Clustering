Officials said during this week's annual cigar festival that this year alone, they expect to double sales of hand-rolled \"habanos\" on the island. (Ramon Espinosa / AP)\n\nAs Havana celebrated the annual Cigar Festival that wraps up with a gala-dinner bash Friday, officials said that this year alone they expect to double on-island sales of hand-rolled cigars, known here as \"habanos,\" from 3 million to 6 million.\n\n\"This is an important jump in just one year,\" said Jorge Luis Fernandez Maique, vice president of Habanos SA, a mixed venture between Cuba's state-run Cubatabaco and the British company Altadis. \"It's a boom for the Cuban market.\"\n\nThe additional sales would represent a modest increase to the company's overall annual production of around 90 million to 100 million premium units to meet domestic and international demand, primarily in Europe and China.\n\nBut officials see it as just the tip of the cigar: If the U.S. embargo were to fall amid a normalization of diplomatic relations, Habanos believes it could capture nearly a third of the American market, the world's largest for cigars.\n\nAlmost 600,000 visitors traveled to the island from the United States last year, a figure that includes mostly Cuban-Americans on family visits but also tens of thousands of people on legal educational and religious exchanges. The number is expected to rise, though it's still unclear by how much.\n\nMany visit shops like the one where Alfonso works.\n\n\"They are aware that these are first-rate cigars,\" said Teresita Diaz, a saleswoman at the store.\n\nUnder the new rules, U.S. travelers are now allowed to bring back up to $100 in combined tobacco and alcohol products, a lot less than the $3,000 to $4,000 sales that Diaz can ring up for some of the Canadian, European and Chinese aficionados who shop there.\n\nU.S. visitors can smoke as many cigars as they like while on the island, and can now return with a few five-packs of Montecristo #4 (sale price: $27.75) or Cohiba Siglo I ($34.50) without violating the cap.\n\nIf even half of the current number of U.S. travelers were to bring back $50 worth of cigars each, that would add up to some $15 million in new sales for the Habanos company this year.\n\nGetting approval to export cigars to the U.S. would be the real bonanza for Cuba.\n\nHabanos, which reported global sales of $439 million last year, estimates it could sell roughly 70 million to 90 million cigars there, nearly doubling Cuba's current production, if the embargo were lifted.\n\nThat would be possible only with the approval of the Republican-controlled Congress. After the initial buzz over the Dec. 17 announcement that Washington and Havana would move to restore ties, progress has been slow on resolving far simpler matters such as reopening embassies in each other's respective countries.\n\nThere are also questions about Cuba's ability to ramp up production to eventually meet U.S. demand. The country suffers from major infrastructure deficiencies, and tobacco farmers sometimes complain of transportation delays following the harvest that can cause the leaves to go bad.\n\n\"It's clear that even today, the amounts (harvested) are not enough,\" said Ricardo Salas, who distributes Cuban cigars in Cyprus.\n\nWhile American aficionados would initially be intrigued by the \"forbidden fruit\" aspect of Cuban cigars, many might find they prefer something more familiar, and less overpowering.\n\nSalas and other experts said milder Cuban brands such as Montecristo and Romeo y Julieta would likely do better in the U.S. than the stronger Partagas and Cohiba varieties.\n\nAfter more than five decades of separation, \"the average American doesn't know the Cuban product,\" said Salas. \"They have as a comparison Central American or Dominican tobacco \u2014 they've become used to that kind of flavor of a softer, more discreet tobacco.\"\n\nAndrea Rodriguez on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27611749/cuban-cigar-makers-anticipate-big-bucks-from-u", "sailthru.author": "By Andrea Rodriguez \n  The Associated Press", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27611749:view"}, "startDate": "2015-02-28T19:39:12-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "HAVANA  \u2014 Over six decades rolling premium cigars with his small, wrinkled hands, Arnaldo Alfonso has taken pride in seeing his \"habanos\" sampled by visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.", "title": "Cuban cigar makers anticipate big bucks from U.S. travelers", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27611749/cuban-cigar-makers-anticipate-big-bucks-from-u", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0227/20150227__02DCBCIGw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0227/20150227__02DCBCIGw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-02-28T19:41:02-0700", "endDate": "2025-02-27T13:48:13-0700", "description": "HAVANA  \u2014 Over six decades rolling premium cigars with his small, wrinkled hands, Arnaldo Alfonso has taken pride in seeing his \"habanos\" sampled by visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.", "byline": "By Andrea RodriguezThe", "pubDate": "2015-02-28T19:42:11-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-28T19:39:12-0700", "sailthru.title": "Cuban cigar makers anticipate big bucks from U.S. travelers", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Business: Top Business", "news_keywords": "business,economy,technology news,business information,Boulder, Boulder County,Broomfield County,local businesses,tech sector,startups,natural food industry,construction,development,real estate,Boulder,Broomfield,Longmont,Louisville,Lafayette,Colorado", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/top-business/ci_27611749/cuban-cigar-makers-anticipate-big-bucks-from-u", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "HAVANA  \u2014 Over six decades rolling premium cigars with his small, wrinkled hands, Arnaldo Alfonso has taken pride in seeing his \"habanos\" sampled by visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.", "title": "Cuban cigar makers anticipate big bucks from U.S. travelers"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0227/20150227__02DCBCIGw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f1b\"", "article_summary": "\"It's clear that even today, the amounts (harvested) are not enough,\" said Ricardo Salas, who distributes Cuban cigars in Cyprus.\nWhile American aficionados would initially be intrigued by the \"forbidden fruit\" aspect of Cuban cigars, many might find they prefer something more familiar, and less overpowering.\nA tobacco worker roll cigars at the Corona cigar factory in Havana, Cuba, on Thursday.\nCuban cigar makers are licking their chops over new U.S. rules that let more Americans travel to the island and legally bring back as much as $100 worth in prized stogies for the first time in decades.\nNow he's delighted by the idea of customers lighting them up in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States, where Cuban cigars have been outlawed since the U.S. embargo took effect in 1962."}
