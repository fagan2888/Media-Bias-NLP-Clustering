We care about the quality and freshness of our food; we care about the quality of the service we receive. These priorities when choosing a destination for grabbing a quick bite emerged in Consumer Reports\u2019 most recent ranking of our nation\u2019s fast food restaurants.\n\nSLIDESHOW: The 10 Best Fast Food Restaurants in America\n\nThe magazine asked more than 32,000 readers \u2013 who ate more than 96,000 meals at 65 chains \u2013 what they thought. The less ubiquitous fast food restaurants and the regional ones were the most popular with diners.\n\nRespondents looked at five criteria to rank each chain: food quality and freshness, value, politeness, speed of service, and cleanliness of the dining area. Based on these criteria, they had to come up with a grade out of 100.\n\nThe top winner: In-N-Out Burger, which has a cult following of fans from across the country. Its restaurants are only available in a handful of states, mostly on the West Coast, which means that for many Americans, vacationing in California often includes paying a visit to an In-N-Out Burger restaurant.\n\nOther names that made the list of the best fast food restaurants include Chick-fil-A and Potbelly Sandwich Shop, but most of the other chains on the list aren\u2019t that well known.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find many fine national (defined as operating in six or more states) and regional restaurants,\u201d noted Consumer Reports.\n\nClick here to see the 10 Best Fast Food Restaurants in America.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Making the list of the best fast food restaurants in America this year from Consumer Reports: Chick-fil-A and Potbelly Sandwich Shop \u2013 and a few other surprises.", "title": "10 Best Fast Food Restaurants in America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/03/10-Best-Fast-Food-Restaurants-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/The_Habit_Burger_Grill_Sean_Carter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/03/10-Best-Fast-Food-Restaurants-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/The_Habit_Burger_Grill_Sean_Carter.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Making the list of the best fast food restaurants in America this year from Consumer Reports: Chick-fil-A and Potbelly Sandwich Shop \u2013 and a few other surprises.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Click here to see the 10 Best Fast Food Restaurants in America.\nSLIDESHOW: The 10 Best Fast Food Restaurants in AmericaThe magazine asked more than 32,000 readers \u2013 who ate more than 96,000 meals at 65 chains \u2013 what they thought.\nThere are a few surprises on the Consumer Reports\u2019 list this year of the best fast food restaurants in America \u2013 and a few names that are not that well known nationally.\nThe less ubiquitous fast food restaurants and the regional ones were the most popular with diners.\nThese priorities when choosing a destination for grabbing a quick bite emerged in Consumer Reports\u2019 most recent ranking of our nation\u2019s fast food restaurants."}
