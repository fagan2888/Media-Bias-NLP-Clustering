Police in Indianapolis arrested an 18-year-old man late Sunday in connection to the death of Amanda Blackburn.

Detectives with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (VCU) Violent Crimes Unit have arrested Larry Taylor of Indianapolis on a preliminary charge of murder.

Police say Taylor was one of four suspects brought in for questioning about Blackburn's death earlier in the week.

Blackburn was shot in the head during a home break-in on November 10.

Her husband, Pastor Davey Blackburn, came home to find her unresponsive.

She died less than a day after the shooting.

A family spokesman says Amanda Blackburn was pregnant with the couple's second child at the time of her death.

IMPD received federal assistance from the United States Marshals Services in the arrest.

IMPD Chief Rick Hite says, “We are thankful to our federal, state, and local partnerships that aided in the apprehension of the suspect in this terrible and senseless crime. All victims of criminal homicides deserve closure, and as a community we must send a collective message that violence is not an option.”

The Marion County Prosecutor's Office will now review the case for a charging decision.
