The unit has now been closed following the inspection.\n\nThere are also claims that patients were resuscitated despite a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d (DNR) notice.\n\nThis is the latest crisis to hit the troubled hospital, which was placed on special measures by the health regulator Monitor last November after data inaccuracies in cancer treatment targets meant it had breached its licence to provide certain services. The CQC found that staff were allegedly being bullied to change figures and a police investigation was launched into the claims.\n\nAn emergency control centre has now been put in place at Colchester Hospital to handle problems with capacity. Routine elective operations are being rescheduled, hospital managers are trying to discharge as many patients as they safely can and extra staff are being brought it.\n\nProfessor Mike Richards, the CQC\u2019s chief inspector, told The Guardian: \u201cCQC carried out an unannounced inspection at Colchester hospital this week in response to concerns. The inspection looked at the accident and emergency department and the emergency assessment unit (EAU).\n\n\u201cFollowing the inspection, we gave feedback to the trust about our safeguarding concerns so that it could take appropriate action to ensure the safety and well-being of its patients. We will return to carry out further inspections at the trust and we are working urgently with Monitor to resolve these issues.\n\n\u201cA full report of CQC\u2019s findings will be published on our website in due course.\u201d\n\nThe crisis at Colchester Hospital University NHS Trust comes as Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, warned of \u201creal pressure\u201d on A&E departments this winter and announced a \u00a3300m fund to help alleviate the situation.\n\nMr Hunt said on Friday: \u201cThe pressures are higher than they have ever been before in the system.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018major incident\u2019 at Colchester was announced on Friday during the public part of a scheduled hospital board meeting, although the findings from the CQC visit were discussed in the private part of the meeting, from which the press and public were excluded.\n\nA spokesman for Colchester Hospital refused to either confirm or deny a number of specific allegations about the use of restraint, inappropriate sedations and patients being resuscitated despite DNR notices.\n\nHowever its chief executive, Dr Lucy Moore, admitted that safeguarding concerns had been raised.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe Care Quality Commission raised a small number of safeguarding concerns when its team gave immediate feedback and the end of the inspection on Wednesday.\u201d\n\nPeter Wilson, the acting chairman of the hospital trust, said: \u201cThe Care quality Commission visited here and visited A&E and emergency admission unit departments. Disappointingly, although they commented favourably on some aspects their general view was that the situation had not improved. We have already put actions in place to address some of the issues they face.\n\n\u201cWe are, however, facing an unprecedented demand at the front end and have declared today a major incident, which means a whole-hospital review of demand, capacity, staffing levels and discharge processes and other opportunities for improvement.\u201d\n\nBut patient groups have described the alleged ill-treatment of patients as a \u201chorrific\u201d situation.\n\nKatherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: \u201cI\u2019m saddened, horrified and distressed to hear of such allegations. If they are confirmed, they are horrific. It\u2019s deeply alarming that despite Mid-Staffordshire, Winterbourne View and all the reports that have been published, that this inhumane treatment and lack of care and compassion continues to happen today, especially with such vulnerable patients.\u201d\n\nNorth East Essex clinical commissioning group, the GP-led NHS body that sends patients to the hospital and pays for their treatment, said it was concerned by the CQC\u2019s findings. A spokesman for the group said: \u201cWe are very disappointed to hear that the CQC has seen little improvement to A&E services since their last visit earlier this year [and] of particular concern is the issue of safeguarding patients.\n\n\u201cWhile we await their full report, we are working with the hospital trust and other partners to address the CQC\u2019s urgent concerns highlighted during their visit this week. This includes supporting safe discharges and preventing avoidable admissions.\u201d\n\nThe CQC\u2019s most recent inspection report on the hospital, published in July, found that it required improvement in the key areas of safety and responsiveness and had inadequate leadership, although it was found to be good in terms of how effective and caring it was.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "health", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03107/colchester-hospita_3107804k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@patricksawer"}, "keywords": "colchester hospital, detention, patients, essex, CQC, Health News,Health,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Home;News;UK_News;Health_News;Patrick_Sawer;NHS", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/health/news", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "description": "Colchester Hospital hit by claims that elderly and dementia patients \n  'inappropriately detained and sedated' as ward is shut to new admissions", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Patients 'inappropriately detained' at crisis-hit Colchester Hospital", "section-id": 4302, "GSAGenre": "healthnews", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-health-news", "GSAMLC": "news/health/healthnews", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 11232953, "WT.cg_s": "health", "news_keywords": "colchester hospital, detention, patients, essex, CQC", "tmgads.channel": "news", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "health", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-15", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-health-health_news", "last-modified": "2014-11-15", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "News", "wordcount": 906, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Patrick Sawer", "tag": "NHS", "subsection": "Health News", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 3, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 11232953, "tmgads.articleid": 11232953, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Patients \\u0027inappropriately detained\\u0027 at crisis-hit Colchester Hospital \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11232953/Patients-inappropriately-detained-at-crisis-hit-Colchester-Hospital.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03107/colchester-hospita_3107804k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"11232953\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-15T10:54:01Z\",\"section\": \"News\",\"authors\": [\"Patrick Sawer\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"Home\",\"News\",\"UK News\",\"Health News\",\"Patrick Sawer\",\"NHS\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Colchester Hospital hit by claims that elderly and dementia patients   'inappropriately detained and sedated' as ward is shut to new admissions", "title": "Patients 'inappropriately detained' at crisis-hit Colchester Hospital", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11232953/Patients-inappropriately-detained-at-crisis-hit-Colchester-Hospital.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03107/colchester-hospita_3107804k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "news", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.health.news", "DCSext.author": "Patrick Sawer", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-11-15 10:54"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03ed\"", "article_summary": "An emergency control centre has now been put in place at Colchester Hospital to handle problems with capacity.\nA spokesman for Colchester Hospital refused to either confirm or deny a number of specific allegations about the use of restraint, inappropriate sedations and patients being resuscitated despite DNR notices.\nProfessor Mike Richards, the CQC\u2019s chief inspector, told The Guardian: \u201cCQC carried out an unannounced inspection at Colchester hospital this week in response to concerns.\nHowever its chief executive, Dr Lucy Moore, admitted that safeguarding concerns had been raised.\n\u201cWhile we await their full report, we are working with the hospital trust and other partners to address the CQC\u2019s urgent concerns highlighted during their visit this week."}
