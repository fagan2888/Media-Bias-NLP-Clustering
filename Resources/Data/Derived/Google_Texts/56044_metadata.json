He took the president to task and touched on high-profile state issues like education spending.\n\nBrownback laid the groundwork in his speech by referencing what he and lawmakers had done in Kansas in recent years. He touted tax policy, the unemployment rate and job growth.\n\n\u201cKansans are finding good jobs right here at home. Working together, we\u2019ve created an economic environment where new filings for new businesses have increased by 15 percent,\u201d said Brownback.\n\nBrownback brought up a top-shelf issue this year, writing a new school funding formula. He blasted the old formula that lawmakers tossed out.\n\n\u201cOf the more than $4 billion the state puts into education funding, not nearly enough goes towards instruction. That\u2019s highly inefficient, if not immoral,\u201d said Brownback.\n\nSome lawmakers would disagree, saying there are lots of important school functions not being counted as classroom spending.\n\nThe governor urged lawmakers to get the job done writing a new formula and gave them some specifics he wants to see.\n\n\u201cI call on the Legislature to design a new education funding system that puts more of our money into instruction, that provides bonuses for exceptional teachers and recognizes their true value to our future and the souls of our students,\u201d said Brownback.\n\nThe governor took a swipe at Planned Parenthood and said he\u2019d block any Medicaid funding from going to the organization.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, I signed legislation stopping most taxpayer funding from going to Planned Parenthood. The time has come to finish the job. Planned Parenthood\u2019s trafficking of baby body parts is antithetical to our belief in human dignity,\u201d said Brownback.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri has said they don\u2019t take part in any tissue donation programs. Elise Higgins, with Planned Parenthood, said Medicaid dollars support health care services, not abortions.\n\n\u201cLife-saving preventive health care. They\u2019re getting pap tests, cervical cancer screenings, breast exams, birth control and STD testing and treatment,\u201d said Higgins.\n\nThere\u2019s been a push to expand Medicaid in Kansas, but Brownback offered his own push against the plan. Supporters of expansion have argued it will help rural hospitals. Brownback said he\u2019d create a task force to look for alternate ways to help those hospitals.\n\n\u201cObamacare has increased health care costs and especially hurt rural health care. It was Obamacare that cut Medicare reimbursements to rural hospitals. It was Obamacare that caused the problem, we should not expand Obamacare to solve the problem,\u201d said Brownback.\n\n\n\nThe governor also blasted the president on his proposal to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center and his handling of refugees. Some people thought Brownback talked a little too much about the president.\n\n\u201cHe spent a lot of time worrying about President Obama. President Obama can take care of himself, he was elected twice,\u201d said Democratic state Representative Barbara Ballard.\n\nBallard pointed out that the speech was completely devoid of talk about the state\u2019s budget deficit, which could approach $200 million next year.\n\n\u201cWe heard a lot, but not about the state of Kansas and the needs we have and the revenue we do not have,\u201d said Ballard.\n\nRepublican state Senator Jeff Melcher said it\u2019s not a big deal that the governor did not bring up the budget deficit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about the budget shortfall, but when you look at it compared to the overall total of the budget, it\u2019s just not a huge number. We\u2019re going to be able to deal with that,\u201d said Melcher.\n\nLawmakers will learn the specifics of the governor\u2019s budget Wednesday, when Brownback\u2019s budget director unveils the details of the spending plan.\n\nStephen Koranda is a Kansas Statehouse reporter based at Kansas Public Radio.
