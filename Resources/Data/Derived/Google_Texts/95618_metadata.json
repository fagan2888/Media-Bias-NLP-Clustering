Glad you asked. Bring Your Own Cup Day (or #BYOC if you\u2019re on the Twitters) is a Bacchanalian feast of excess where customers bring a watertight vessel to their nearest 7-Eleven, smack $1.50 on the counter, and fill said vessel with the Slurpee of their choosing.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Fast Food Restaurants in America\n\nThere are limitations though, so hold your hedonistic horses. Whatever container you choose to use must be non-porous, so no baseball caps or fedoras. Also, whatever container you bring must be able to fit through a 10-inch diameter hole \u2013 so put that oil drum back in the basement. Even with the size limitations, you could still be getting a deal \u2013 USA Today posits that a cup that just makes the cut could hold a gallon of 7-Eleven\u2019s finest sugar water.\n\nAccording to 7-Eleven\u2019s VP of marketing, Laura Gordon, the event is being presented as a \u201cSummer Kickoff,\u201d which seems a little optimistic considering the fact that it\u2019s foggy, 48 degrees Fahrenheit, and drizzling right now in New York City. Still, who am I to judge? Maybe the gods will look favorably upon 7-Eleven\u2019s offering, and bring a day of sunshine, Slurpees, and nothing but syrup:\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If, for some reason, you\u2019ve ever wanted to induce a diabetic coma, tomorrow might be the time to do it. 7-Eleven, the chain of convenience stores most favored by packs of high-school layabouts who aren\u2019t yet old enough to hang out in bars, is holding a promotion called \u201cBring Your Own Cup Day\u201d tomorrow, April 11.", "title": "Cavity Watch: 7-Eleven To Host 'Bring Your Own Cup' Slurpee Day", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Quick-Hits/2015/04/10/Cavity-Watch-7-Eleven-Host-Bring-Your-Own-Cup-Slurpee-Day", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/slurpee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Quick-Hits/2015/04/10/Cavity-Watch-7-Eleven-Host-Bring-Your-Own-Cup-Slurpee-Day", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/slurpee.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lumbology"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If, for some reason, you\u2019ve ever wanted to induce a diabetic coma, tomorrow might be the time to do it. 7-Eleven, the chain of convenience stores most favored by packs of high-school layabouts who aren\u2019t yet old enough to hang out in bars, is holding a promotion called \u201cBring Your Own Cup Day\u201d tomorrow, April 11.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa1b\"", "article_summary": "7-Eleven, the chain of convenience stores most favored by packs of high-school layabouts who aren\u2019t yet old enough to hang out in bars, is holding a promotion called \u201cBring Your Own Cup Day\u201d tomorrow, April 11.\nBring Your Own Cup Day (or #BYOC if you\u2019re on the Twitters) is a Bacchanalian feast of excess where customers bring a watertight vessel to their nearest 7-Eleven, smack $1.50 on the counter, and fill said vessel with the Slurpee of their choosing.\nMaybe the gods will look favorably upon 7-Eleven\u2019s offering, and bring a day of sunshine, Slurpees, and nothing but syrup:Top Reads From The Fiscal Times:\nAlso, whatever container you bring must be able to fit through a 10-inch diameter hole \u2013 so put that oil drum back in the basement.\nIf, for some reason, you\u2019ve ever wanted to induce a diabetic coma, tomorrow might be the time to do it."}
