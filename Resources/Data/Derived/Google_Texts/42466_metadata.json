Whether it is the severe effects of flooding, unseasonal heat waves, devastating bush fires or decade-long droughts, Australia\u2019s people, economy and natural environment have all keenly felt the impact of extreme weather and climate change.\n\nAustralia\u2019s national scientific organizations have been raising the alarm for more than a decade, and the previous government accepted that scientific consensus and enacted a cap-and-trade scheme in 2012. But after a divisive election last year \u2014 one that saw native-born Rupert Murdoch exercise his considerable influence in Australian media markets to disastrous effect \u2014 the country is now governed by a deeply unpopular Liberal-National government, crafted in the image of the most climate-denying elements of the Tea Party. And its position on climate change has significant impacts on global efforts to reduce carbon emissions: Australia is not only the chair of the G-20 group of nations, but also holds a place on the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThe rest of the world saw this ideology on full, embarrassing display with the recent visit by Prime Minister Tony Abbott to Canada and the United States. A week after President Obama\u2019s introduction of substantial policy reforms to reduce carbon pollution, and China\u2019s first-ever pledge to cap carbon emissions, the Australian prime minister stood next to his Canadian counterpart and scoffed at the idea of global warming, saying that climate change is \u201cnot the only or even the most important problem that the world faces\u201d and that measures to reduce carbon emissions would \u201cclobber\u201d the economy.\n\nAll of this marks a shift for Australia, from constructive middle-power to fringe-dwelling rock-thrower and -blocker. Back at home, Tony Abbott is on course to make Australia the first nation in the world to abolish a legislated carbon price.\n\nBut how on earth did this happen?\n\nThe calm before the storm\n\nTony Abbott was elected prime minister last September, after six years of rule by the progressive Labor Party, which had engineered Australia\u2019s leap forward as a leader on global climate policy. Following its rise to ruling party in 2007, the first act of the new Labor government was to ratify the Kyoto protocol, after a decade of refusal by the former prime minister and close George Bush ally John Howard. Howard himself was defeated and ignominiously lost his own seat in parliament. Labor\u2019s historic victory was later dubbed the world\u2019s first \u201cclimate election.\u201d\n\nFor the decade leading up to that 2007 election, Australia had suffered a prolonged drought affecting almost the entire continent. Water restrictions were introduced in most major population centers, and the nation\u2019s food bowl, the Murray Darling Basin, was close to collapse. A series of severe bush fires also ravaged the country, peaking in 2009 with Australia\u2019s worst ever bush fire disaster, Black Saturday, when 173 people died.\n\nPublic support for action on climate change was at an all-time high, and before the 2007 election, Labor leader Kevin Rudd called climate change the \u201cgreatest moral, environmental and economic challenge\u201d facing Australia and the globe. He repeated the statement and the sentiment many times as prime minister.\n\nOn the back of this wave of support, Rudd introduced carbon pricing laws in 2009 called the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The conservative opposition was in disarray, and its private-equity millionaire leader Malcolm Turnbull, a climate-action advocate, largely supported the policies. So did, surprisingly the national coal-miners union.\n\nSomeone who did not support the legislation was Tony Abbott. Backed by the hard-right sections of his party \u2014 many of whom openly denied the scientific basis of anthropogenic global warming \u2014 he defeated Turnbull in late 2009 in a vote for the leadership by a single vote. The carbon pricing laws were then defeated in the senate, where the Greens party voted with the climate deniers to block the carbon pricing laws. Two moderate Liberal-National senators crossed the floor to vote with the Labor government, but to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the failure of the Copenhagen Climate Council to deliver the strong climate action that many were hoping for, combined with the failure of the carbon pricing laws in the senate, saw Rudd shelve the policy to concentrate instead on the economy and healthcare reform in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. His moral and political standing subsequently collapsed, and he was replaced as prime minister in 2010 by Julia Gillard.\n\nUnholy alliance: Murdoch, Norquist and Abbott\n\nIn 2010, Gillard managed to shepherd a cap-and-trade law to passage, in the form of the Clean Energy Future Act. However, the government\u2019s popularity was on the wane, and the opposition party took full advantage. Tony Abbott called the science of climate change \u201ccrap\u201d and various senior figures in his front-bench team openly questioned the scientific basis of anthropogenic global warming. Abbott spoke at anti-carbon price rallies in front of banners proclaiming Prime Minister Gillard as a \u201cwitch\u201d and a \u201cbitch.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, several key members of Abbott\u2019s party including the now-Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, visited the United States to meet with conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, and conservative players in last year\u2019s government shutdown debacle of 2013, including Matt Kibbe and Grover Norquist.\n\nGillard\u2019s carbon pricing laws eventually came into effect in 2012, amid the biggest fear campaign ever seen in Australia. Rupert Murdoch-owned mastheads, controlling as much as 70 percent of the newspaper market, carried front-page stories attacking the laws.\n\nU.S. climate-denier talking points became commonplace in the Australian media. Gina Rinehart, whose wealth is significantly derived from coal mining, aggressively bought up shares in Australia\u2019s only major non-Murdoch-owned media company, Fairfax. She is now its largest shareholder. Australia\u2019s only national daily newspaper, the Murdoch-owned Australian, promoted \u201cmisleading\u201d stories giving credence to climate denialist views, outnumbering those accepting climate science by 10-to-1, according to a report in the Quarterly Essay.\n\nA senior Liberal-National senator who played a major role in Abbott\u2019s rise to the party leadership was sponsored to attend a Heartland Institute conference in 2013; that same senator is also a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization that has opposed climate action in the past. Another senior backer of Abbott and former Howard government minister, Nick Minchin, who has since retired, is an avowed climate skeptic and claims recent warming is due to a \u201cnatural cycle\u201d\n\nDespite the fear campaign, after a year of operation of the carbon pricing laws, the evidence was in: Carbon emissions from the now carbon-constrained sectors of the economy decreased by 7 percent, and new renewable energy generation increased by 30 percent.\n\nNothing was going to save the Labor government, though. They were swept from power by the Abbott-led opposition in September 2013. Abbott named repealing the carbon price laws as his No. 1 legislative priority in the days after the election. And among his first acts as newly elected prime minister, in contrast to Rudd in 2007, was to block the creation of an international Commonwealth climate compensation fund, and to abolish the independent Climate Commission.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Australia was once a leader on climate action.
