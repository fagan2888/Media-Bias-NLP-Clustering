We don\u2019t get to see it often, but KD was looking to get shots up early and scored 11 points in the opening frame.\n\nWith 10:33 left in the second quarter Westbrook checked back into the game after a brief rest while the Thunder held a 29-27 lead. Behind Westbrook\u2019s Tasmanian-like attack, in less than four minutes the OKC lead had blossomed to 15 points and the Thunder had complete control of the game.\n\nOKC\u2019s dominance can be credited to the points in the paint, where the Thunder totaled 34 in the first half on 73.9 percent shooting.\n\nPelicans guard Jrue Holiday played hard throughout and he helped New Orleans get back within 62-53 at halftime, but Durant, Westbrook and Serge Ibaka put on a clinic in the third quarter to put the game away and let the reserves get some playing time in the fourth.\n\nDurant totaled 23 points on 10-of-17 shooting, and Ibaka added 18 points, seven rebounds and three blocks. Enes Kanter notched a double-double off the bench with 11 points and 12 rebounds while Anthony Morrow had 10 points of his own.\n\nBoth Holiday and Anthony Davis each scored 23 points to lead the Pelicans.\n\nThe Thunder now enter the All-Star Break with a 40-15 record, and will be back in action next Friday when they host the Pacers. OKC will then have a quick turnaround as they host the Cavaliers two days later on Sunday afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "It was a somber evening inside of Chesapeake Energy Arena, but despite the devastation the Thunder family suffered throughout the week, the home team was able to pick up a 121-95 win over the Pelic...", "author": "Brett Coppenbarger", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31204437/thunder-power-past-the-pelicans-on-a-somber-thursday", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9865611_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It was a somber evening inside of Chesapeake Energy Arena, but despite the devastation the Thunder family suffered throughout the week, the home team was able to pick up a 121-95 win over the Pelic...", "title": "Thunder Power Past The Pelicans On A Somber Thursday"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9865611_G.jpg", "description": "It was a somber evening inside of Chesapeake Energy Arena, but despite the devastation the Thunder family suffered throughout the week, the home team was able to pick up a 121-95 win over the Pelic...", "card": "summary", "title": "Thunder Power Past The Pelicans On A Somber Thursday"}, "wnreadableurl": "thunder-power-past-the-pelicans-on-a-somber-thursday", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/02/11", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,thunder,nba,basketball,kevin durant,russell westbrook,anthony davis,monty williams,ingrid williams,pelicans,new orleans", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS22", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,thunder,nba,basketball,kevin durant,russell westbrook,anthony davis,monty williams,ingrid williams,pelicans,new orleans"}, "article_summary": "Durant totaled 23 points on 10-of-17 shooting, and Ibaka added 18 points, seven rebounds and three blocks.\nBoth Holiday and Anthony Davis each scored 23 points to lead the Pelicans.\nWith 10:33 left in the second quarter Westbrook checked back into the game after a brief rest while the Thunder held a 29-27 lead.\nBehind Westbrook\u2019s Tasmanian-like attack, in less than four minutes the OKC lead had blossomed to 15 points and the Thunder had complete control of the game.\nEnes Kanter notched a double-double off the bench with 11 points and 12 rebounds while Anthony Morrow had 10 points of his own."}
