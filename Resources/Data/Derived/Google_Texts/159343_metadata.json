In fact, this page had endorsed Coleman over Franken and Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley, arguing that in a second term the pragmatic Republican would continue to be a voice of moderation in the party and an effective representative for this politically divided state.\n\nBut by a mere 312 recounted votes in a presidential-election-year wave favoring Democrats, Minnesota sent the author of \u201cRush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\u201d to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIn an editorial that appeared in this space a day after Franken took the oath of office in 2009, we urged him to make good on his pledge to leave Stuart Smalley behind and focus on policy work that would benefit all Minnesotans.\n\nON THE ISSUES To read excerpts from the candidates\u2019 recent endorsement interviews with the Editorial Board, go to: \u2022 <CHARENTITY>7</CHARENTITY>Al Franken: http://tinyurl.com/mvk4gja \u2022 <CHARENTITY>7</CHARENTITY>Mike McFadden: http://tinyurl.com/ml8d4j3\n\nFor the most part Franken has delivered, earning our endorsement for a second term over political newcomer Mike McFadden, an investment banker whose campaign has failed to convince us that Minnesotans should squander the benefits that incumbency can bring.\n\nAs we had hoped, Franken is comfortable in \u201cthe weeds\u201d \u2014 that policy wonk space in which legislators address real-world issues such as student debt, privacy rights and food safety.\n\n\u201cYou get the respect of your colleagues if \u2018you\u2019re in the weeds,\u2019 \u201d Franken recently told the Star Tribune Editorial Board. \u201cYou get the respect of your colleagues because so much of the stuff we can get done has nothing to do with partisan politics.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview with the Editorial Board, McFadden described Franken as \u201cthe most partisan senator in the Democratic Party,\u201d pointing to an analysis by opencongress.org of the 161 votes he took since the beginning of the current session of Congress in 2013. Franken has voted with the Senate Democratic caucus 159 times, for a rate of 98.8 percent \u2014 topping the list. But at the same time, Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 whom McFadden is quick to praise \u2014 voted with her party 96.2 percent of the time (153 of 159 votes).\n\nWe find it more meaningful to consider Franken\u2019s list of legislative accomplishments since arriving in Washington.\n\nHis provision in the Affordable Care Act requiring insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on actual health care is a needed curb on rising administrative costs. Working with Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Franken co-sponsored legislation targeting credit rating agencies for conflicts of interest that contributed to the 2008 financial meltdown.\n\nHe added common-sense provisions to the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act to help protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault from financial harm. And after 64 people died and hundreds were sickened by tainted medications manufactured by a Massachusetts drug compounding facility, Franken worked with Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas to reform dated laws on drug distribution.\n\nHe has also championed food safety, job training, renewable energy, Internet neutrality, funding for Native American schools, student debt relief and privacy-rights measures.\n\nMinnesota Republicans scoff at Franken\u2019s record, arguing that his legislative accomplishments are minor at best. But as Klobuchar has proved, focusing on practical legislation, working hard and serving constituents is a successful formula in Minnesota \u2014 especially during a first term.\n\nTo his credit, McFadden has run a policy-focused campaign. He faults Franken and his party for their energy policies \u2014 including excessive regulation of pipelines and mining \u2014 that he says are stifling the economy.\n\nMcFadden opposes Obamacare, wants health care regulated by the states, and is a fan of health savings accounts and coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. On Medicare and Social Security, McFadden is short on specifics but pledges to work with members of both parties to address projected funding shortfalls without raising taxes.\n\nHe would redirect federal education dollars from \u201cbroken school districts\u201d to charter schools \u2014 citing the admirable work he\u2019s done with Cristo Rey, a Jesuit school in Minneapolis that has had success with low-income students.\n\nMcFadden is critical of President Obama\u2019s handling of foreign-policy issues but, like Franken, supports the current bombing campaign targeting ISIL. Both candidates want Obama to seek congressional authorization for any escalation of that effort.\n\nMcFadden and Franken support overhauling the tax code, but neither offers many specifics. Franken would eliminate subsidies for oil and gas companies, while McFadden wants revenue-neutral \u201csimplicity and transparency.\u201d\n\nConservatives have a clear, credible choice in this race. There\u2019s little doubt McFadden would give more critical scrutiny to spending than Franken. He\u2019s a quick study and might also have the kind of independent streak that made Coleman our pick in 2008. We\u2019re just not sure.\n\nThe more we saw of McFadden during the campaign, the more he used Republican talking-point generalities while also pledging to work as a bipartisan problem-solver. He prides himself on not being a professional politician, but he avoids concrete answers to tough questions with the best of them. Without a record to run on, he\u2019s asking Minnesotans for trust he has yet to earn in public office.\n\nThroughout his first term, Franken has kept his head down and delivered on what this page asked of him when he belatedly started his term in 2009 \u2014 policy work that benefits residents of this state. In many cases, he\u2019s done so while working with Republican colleagues.\n\nIf he wins re-election, we\u2019d urge Franken to stay in the policy \u201cweeds\u201d but also provide leadership on improving the ACA, seeking the kind of genuine compromise that can produce meaningful progress on Medicare and Social Security, and reforming the tax code.\n\nFor the first time, Franken might serve as a member of the minority party, making it even more imperative that he work across the aisle. Based on his record over the past five years, we trust he would take a serious approach to a second term and do exactly that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Policy-focused incumbent has earned a second term.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Policy-focused incumbent has earned a second term.", "title": "Endorsement: For U.S. Senate, Al Franken", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/endorsement-for-u-s-senate-al-franken/280371022/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141419235925839.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141419235925839.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Policy-focused incumbent has earned a second term.", "title": "Endorsement: For U.S. Senate, Al Franken", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/endorsement-for-u-s-senate-al-franken/280371022/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141419235925839.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141419235925839.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "U.S. Senate race"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Congress,Al Franken,Mike McFadden,election,U.S. Senate race"}, "article_summary": "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022After unseating incumbent Republican Norm Coleman in a bitter 2008 Senate campaign, satirist-turned-politician Al Franken headed to Washington promising a serious approach to his new career.\nFranken has voted with the Senate Democratic caucus 159 times, for a rate of 98.8 percent \u2014 topping the list.\nThroughout his first term, Franken has kept his head down and delivered on what this page asked of him when he belatedly started his term in 2009 \u2014 policy work that benefits residents of this state.\n\u201cYou get the respect of your colleagues if \u2018you\u2019re in the weeds,\u2019 \u201d Franken recently told the Star Tribune Editorial Board.\nMcFadden is critical of President Obama\u2019s handling of foreign-policy issues but, like Franken, supports the current bombing campaign targeting ISIL."}
