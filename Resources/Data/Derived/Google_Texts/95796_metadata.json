Just because a college has asked for disclosure does not mean that an applicant will be refused admission. It simply alerts schools to investigate certain applicants\u2019 backgrounds and enables academic officers to determine, case by case, whether an individual poses a threat.\n\nMany people with previous convictions have turned their lives around and should be given a chance to attain a college education. Yet not asking about criminal records is foolhardy.\n\nThe City University of New York, which claims that its practice of not asking about criminal history has not posed a safety problem, should not be held up as an example, since CUNY schools are commuter colleges with no dormitories and therefore less opportunity for violence.\n\nIf the question about a criminal record poses a barrier to completing an application for students with prior convictions, there are other ways, like counseling and nondiscrimination disclosure, to encourage those students without endangering a campus. Colleges would do well to balance the individual needs and potential of each applicant with a criminal record with the rights of the entire student population to a safe environment.\n\nALAN KADISH\n\nPresident, Touro College\n\nand University System\n\nNew York", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150326032100, "twitter": {"description": "Alan Kadish, the president of Touro College, takes issue with an editorial.", "title": "Colleges and Criminals", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/opinion/colleges-and-criminals.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003593391"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/opinion/colleges-and-criminals.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003593391", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/opinion/colleges-and-criminals.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Colleges and Criminals", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 26, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Colleges and Universities,Admissions Standards,Discrimination,Ex-Convicts", "news_keywords": "Discrimination,Ex Cons", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Alan Kadish, the president of Touro College, takes issue with an editorial.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Alan Kadish, the president of Touro College, takes issue with an editorial.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 26, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-03-26", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Ex-Convicts", "published": "2015-03-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "l26criminal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150326032100, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/opinion/colleges-and-criminals.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Alan Kadish, the president of Touro College, takes issue with an editorial.", "title": "Colleges and Criminals"}, "pdate": 20150326, "des": "Ex-Convicts", "articleid": 100000003593391, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Colleges and Criminals", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1040\"", "article_summary": "Colleges have a responsibility to keep their students safe, and one way to do that is to ask about past criminal records.\nYet not asking about criminal records is foolhardy.\nColleges would do well to balance the individual needs and potential of each applicant with a criminal record with the rights of the entire student population to a safe environment.\nJust because a college has asked for disclosure does not mean that an applicant will be refused admission.\nMany people with previous convictions have turned their lives around and should be given a chance to attain a college education."}
