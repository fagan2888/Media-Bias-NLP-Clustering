The changes to the president\u2019s signature health care law include one that would exempt military veterans who are already enrolled in Pentagon or Veteran Affairs Department from being counted under the law, allowing some employers with around 50 employees to avoid the mandate. The other would allow employers to avoid providing health coverage to workers who clock in less than 40 hours a week, up from the law\u2019s current 30-hour threshold, without penalty. Critics claim that that latter legislation would actually be counterproductive, making part-time work more likely.\n\n\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee said Monday that the House will vote this Friday on legislation to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline for the tenth time. The pipeline\u2019s creation is likely to be neither the doom considered by some green activists nor the job creator that Republicans have touted and the White House has yet to issue a veto threat.\n\n\u201cEnacting such measures early in the new session will signal that the logjam in Washington has been broken, and help to establish a foundation of certainty and stability that both parties can build upon,\u201d wrote Boehner and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell in a Wall Street Journal op-ed after the November elections.\n\nIn her letter Monday, Pelosi wrote that the \u201celection demonstrated that the American people are hopeful that this new Congress can work together to grow our economy and in turn grow the paychecks of American workers.\u201d\n\nPelosi outlined two bills in particular that Democrats would put forward on Tuesday. One recycled bill would discourage corporations from exporting their headquarters to avoid U.S. taxes and use the revenue to pay for the crippled highway trust fund, which keeps a host of major infrastructure projects afloat. Democrats will also reintroduce another bill that would limit tax deductions for millionaire executives at publicly held companies unless they gave some rank-and-file employees raises to match certain cost of living standards too.\n\nPelosi\u2019s message\u2014one Democrats have been pounding for ages\u2014is geared directly at her party\u2019s populist base. On Wednesday, the AFL-CIO will hold its first National Summit on Raising Wages, which will include a keynote speech from liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The economic debate in Congress will be much like last year's: \u201cWhere are the jobs?\u201d vs. \"Where are the wages?\"", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are taking very different approaches to the economic concerns of most Americans.", "title": "Republicans: 'Where Are the Jobs?'
