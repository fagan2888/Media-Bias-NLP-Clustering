The idea is to limit sugar consumption to 10 percent of a person\u2019s daily total calories. Currently, Americans get about 16 percent of their calories from added sugars on average.\n\nThe new rule is not as strict as the sugar caps other health organizations have suggested. The World Health Organization endorses a limit of six teaspoons, or 25 grams, per day.\n\nThe new limit part of the FDA\u2019s push to change food labels to display the total amount of added sugars in a food, as opposed to natural sugars. (This is similar to how \u201csaturated fat\u201d and \u201ctotal fat\u201d are currently separated out on food labels.) Although added and natural sugars are chemically similar, foods that contain natural sugars, like fruit, usually contain other nutrients, like fiber, that are considered beneficial. Added sugar, meanwhile, is just that: superfluous. It\u2019s been indicted by many nutritionists as one driver of the obesity epidemic and a potential cause of other health problems, such as heart disease.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FDA just announced that Americans should limit their added sugar intake to 12 teaspoons per day.
