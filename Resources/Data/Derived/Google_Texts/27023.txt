Thousands of the hungry and the hardy took to the streets of Lafayette under sunny skies on Saturday morning to take part in one of the town's most popular traditions, the 18th Annual Lafayette Quaker Oatmeal Festival.

It was an early opportunity for some to make good on a new year's resolution, by joining the throngs for the 5K "Quicker Quaker" walk and run, a centerpiece of the yearly festivities. A total of 1,010 racers signed up for the competition, which saw Jeremy Freed claim the men's division, in a breezy time of 15:06, while Kristen Arendt was the women's winner, clocking in at a similarly brisk 17:33.

The oatmeal festival, as the name would suggest, was not just for the athletically inclined, of course. The popular family-oriented event saw throngs pack into Pioneer Elementary School for the come-one, come-all oatmeal feed, enabling visitors to enjoy their favorite hot cereal garnished by a wide array of toppings.

Other features of the festival included a health fair sponsored by Boulder Community Hospital/Community Medical Center, which included interactive demonstrations, health screenings and more.

Rounding out the attractions was a Bonfils Community Blood Drive.
