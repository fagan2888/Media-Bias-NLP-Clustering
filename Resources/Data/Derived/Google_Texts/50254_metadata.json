I sat down with Taia for an interview about his film, his life, and his views on homosexuality, Islam, Morocco and France. Here are some highlights. Are you hoping that Salvation Army will be released in Morocco? More than hoping\u2014I really want it to be released in Morocco. Before shooting, I submitted the screenplay in its original form to the authorities at the National Centre for Moroccan Cinema. I didn't cut anything. I didn't want to sugarcoat things in order to get the green light to shoot. They approved the screenplay, and I hope they end up following through by allowing the film to be released. I know a lot of people will be shocked when they see the film. But I don\u2019t see anything shocking in it, because it portrays a reality. I\u2019m not the only person to have lived this reality, nor am I the only one who sees it. You\u2019re known as a novelist, and this is your first film. What inspired you to make the movie? Cinema has been an obsession of mine for a long time. Ever since my adolescence, I\u2019ve had this dream [of making movies], which came from my love of Egyptian cinema. That was the only culture that we had access to in Morocco, as a poor family. Egyptian films were the only ones on Moroccan television. They taught us a lot about love, about society, about ourselves. And as a homosexual, they pretty much saved me, because they allowed me to escape to this whole other world. And there\u2019s now an Arabic word for \u201chomosexual\u201d that is not disrespectful: \u201cmithy.\u201d It was created just six years ago, and is now used everywhere. There are also films and filmmakers that inspired me, but that I didn't discover until I was an adult: Satyajit Ray\u2019s The Apu Trilogy; the work of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, for its dark romanticism, its taste for melodrama, its critique of World War II-era Germany and its subversive, but tender, portrait of homosexuality; and Michael Powell\u2019s Black Narcissus, which directly influenced Salvation Army.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Morocco&#39;s only openly gay filmmaker discusses the inspirations behind Salvation Army and his home country&#39;s changing attitudes toward homosexuality.", "author": "Jon Frosch", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Morocco&#39;s only openly gay filmmaker discusses the inspirations behind Salvation Army and his home country&#39;s changing attitudes toward homosexuality.", "title": "'There's a Place for Gays in Islam'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/salvationarmyvenice/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/09/theres-a-place-for-gays-in-islam/279400/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5ec\"", "article_summary": "Before shooting, I submitted the screenplay in its original form to the authorities at the National Centre for Moroccan Cinema.\nI sat down with Taia for an interview about his film, his life, and his views on homosexuality, Islam, Morocco and France.\nAnd there\u2019s now an Arabic word for \u201chomosexual\u201d that is not disrespectful: \u201cmithy.\u201d It was created just six years ago, and is now used everywhere.\nThey approved the screenplay, and I hope they end up following through by allowing the film to be released.\nAnd as a homosexual, they pretty much saved me, because they allowed me to escape to this whole other world."}
