Ultimately, ownership, team leadership, and key stakeholders felt there was no bigger statement for the Los Angeles Dodgers to plant their flag in Oklahoma City than by renaming their Triple-A team the Dodgers as well.\u201d\n\nIn September, the franchise was acquired by Mandalay Baseball\u2014a joint venture between ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers and an investor group led by Mandalay Entertainment Chairman and CEO Peter Guber. Since Triple-A baseball began in Oklahoma City in 1962, the Los Angeles Dodgers are the fifth Major League team to call Oklahoma City its Triple-A home and \u201cDodgers\u201d will be the third name used, following 89ers and RedHawks.\n\n\u201cUsing the Dodgers' name is a privilege,\u201d Guber said. \u201cIt's one of the three or four most iconic brands in sports all over the world, and we are thrilled we have the opportunity to share it and shine with it.\u201d\n\nThe team's new logos and jerseys incorporate several elements of the Los Angeles Dodgers' history and the culture of Oklahoma City and Bricktown. Some of the elements of the new brand\u2014including the Dodgers script and the famous \u201cshooting ball\u201d\u2014have been associated with the Dodgers since 1938. The team's new home jerseys mirror the current home jerseys of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the home hat is styled after the old Brooklyn Dodgers' hats.\n\nAll of the new elements were developed by the Los Angeles Dodgers' graphic design team.\n\n\u201cWe didn't just want to slap \u2018Oklahoma City' over an existing Dodgers logo and call it a day,\u201d said Ross Yoshida, Los Angeles Dodgers Director of Graphic Design. \u201cWe wanted to tailor the Dodger brand to something that people in Oklahoma City could take pride in, hence elements like the homage to Bricktown on the primary logo and the SkyDance Bridge patch on the home uniforms.\u201d\n\nAll new design elements are available to see at the team's website, okcdodgers.com.\n\nFans can get their hands on new Oklahoma City Dodgers merchandise at the newly remodeled team store located on the Mickey Mantle Plaza at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. The store will be open on weekdays from 10 a.m. \u2013 4 p.m. through December 10. Updated hours after December 10 will be posted online or can be obtained by calling (405) 218-1000.\n\nSeason ticket packages, including the Seven-Game Holiday Pack, are now available for the 2015 season.
