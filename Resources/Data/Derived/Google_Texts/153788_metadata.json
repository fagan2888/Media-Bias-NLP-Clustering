Winds between 30 to 40 mph blew snow that fell overnight in the Red River Valley, weather service meteorologist Tom Grafenauer said.\n\nThat area will be the first to feel the effects of a strong cold front, he said, with temperatures reaching 20-below and wind chills approaching minus 50 by Sunday morning.\n\nBy Tuesday, parts of the Midwest will see below-zero temperatures, while lows will reach single-digits along the East Coast. The chilly weather is even expected to move as far south as New Orleans.\n\nMeteorologist Ryan Maue of the private Weather Bell Analytics has called it \u201cold-timer\u2019s type of cold.\u201d\n\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
