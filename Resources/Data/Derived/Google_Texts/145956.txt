LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Colorado’s ability to win championship cross country races has long hinged on starting out slowly and then moving up throughout a race, a strategy the team uses because of the advantages of training at altitude and racing at sea level.

On Saturday at E.P. “Tom” Sawyer Park at the NCAA cross country championships, they tried to do the same, but the story of how they lost happened in the final 2,000 meters. Runners race with chips on their shoes that track progress at 2K, 5,200 meters, 8K and then the finish at 10K, which offers insight into how the race played out.

At 2K, Colorado was third with 181 points behind Iona (143 points) and Syracuse (97 points). Colorado remained in third at 5.2K with 130 points, behind Stanford’s 123 and Syracuse’s 90. At 8K, Colorado and Syracuse were tied with 99 points. By the finish, Syracuse had won 82-91 over Colorado.

Senior Pierce Murphy, Colorado’s No. 1 runner all season, was in 18th at 2K before moving up 11 spots to seventh, then three spots by 8K and one final position to third in the last 2K.

Let’s took a closer look at Colorado’s next five runners.

Senior Morgan Pearson

Pearson was 28th at 2K, 18th at 5.2K (10-spot improvement), 16th at 8K (+2) and 25th at the finish — a drop of nine spots in the last 2,000 meters and an overall gain of three spots.

94th at 2K, 76th at 5.2K (+18), 41st at 8K (+35), and 26th (+15) at the finish — a net gain of 68 spots from 2K to the finish. That kind of movement suggests Dressel started too slowly and didn’t have the time to move up farther. Still, that’s not surprising given that he was racing only his second 10K ever (his last one eight days prior at regionals in Albuquerque).

64th at 2K, 35th at 5.2K (+29), 27th at 8K (+8), 33rd at the finish — a drop of six spots in the last 2K and a net gain of 31 positions.

64th at 2K, 35th at 5.2K (+29), 27th at 8K (+8), 33rd at the finish — a drop of six spots in the last 2K and a net gain of 31 positions. Senior Ammar Moussa

42nd at 2K, 26th at 5.2K (+16), 35th (-9), 42nd (-7) at the finish. No net change in position.

Moussa, because he was sixth, didn’t count in team scoring. But he fell behind Syracuse’s eventual No. 4 — Philo Germano — in the final few meters of the race (based on some video I saw; more on that below).

Moussa was fifth overall at nationals last year, and Saarel — who said he had been struggling to come back from mononucleosis all year — was seventh. So two Buffs runners who were huge contributors last year had way worse days on Saturday. Colorado won the championship in 2014 with 65 points.

Now let’s examine Syracuse, which placed three runners in the top 10 and started much stronger overall near the front of the race and then gained positions. Even though Colorado’s fifth runner came in before Syracuse’s fourth and fifth, Syracuse’s front-loaded group made the task of winning extremely difficult for Colorado.

Sophomore Justyn Knight

Knight, Syracuse’s top runner, moved up front early in the race and never wavered. He was 4th at 2K, 3rd at 5.2K, 3rd at 8K, and 4th at the finish — no net change in position.

14th at 2K, 13th at 5.2K (+1), 9th at 8K (+4), 9th at the finish (0). Net gain of five positions.

14th at 2K, 13th at 5.2K (+1), 9th at 8K (+4), 9th at the finish (0). Net gain of five positions. Junior Joel Hubbard

50th at 2K, 41st at 5.2K (+9), 51st at 8K (-10), 47th at the finish (+4). Net gain of three positions. Hubbard ended as Syracuse’s fifth runner.

51st at 2K, 44th at 5.2K (+7), 56th at 8K (-12), 65th at the finish (-9). Net loss of 14 positions. Lennon ended as Syracuse’s No. 6.

51st at 2K, 44th at 5.2K (+7), 56th at 8K (-12), 65th at the finish (-9). Net loss of 14 positions. Lennon ended as Syracuse’s No. 6. Sophomore Philo Germano

Here’s where it gets interesting. Germano was 52nd at 2K, 56th at 5.2K (-4), 53rd at 8K (+3), 39th at the finish (+14). That’s a net gain of 13 positions from 2K to the finish, but he gained 14 spots in the final 2,000 meters — which translated to 13 positions in team scoring. In photos I took of the race from the platform, you can see him charging hard — he’s behind Moussa in one frame, and then ahead of him in the next. All other things being equal, without Germano’s late surge to be Syracuse’s No. 4 runner, the Orange doesn’t win.

Syracuse maintained a strong group of three near the front of the race and either maintained or moved up a handful of positions. Yes, cross country is a team sport, and Syracuse’s success with its top three set it up for victory. But Germano’s monster last 2,000 meters — and, really, what I suspect was an all-out kick in the homestretch — ultimately sealed the win for the Orange.
