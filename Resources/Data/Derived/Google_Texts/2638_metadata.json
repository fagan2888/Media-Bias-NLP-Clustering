And somehow, amid all the weirdness, the Jurassic World actor managed to stay sexy, reported Us Weekly.\n\nPratt chug-a-lugged Fireball whisky before launching into his unusual lecture, during which he described various situations that might occur and provided acting tips on what to do.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you get pulled over and you have a bunch of weed in your glove box,\u201d suggested a clearly drunk Chris. \u201cSimple, you do this: \u2018Officer, I don\u2019t have weed in my glove box.'\u201d\n\nWatch the rest below.\n\nAnd he also offered some parting words of semi-wisdom.\n\n\u201cThis has been acting with Chris Pratt, I hope it helps. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t. Just work out a lot and use sunscreen.\u201d\n\nThe reference to working out, however, isn\u2019t a joke. As the Inquisitr reported, Pratt lost 60 pounds by exercising diligently and following a Paleo-style low carb diet.\n\nIn addition to banning booze (except for that GQ acting lecture), Chris slashed carbohydrates. He also did a variety of fitness, including CrossFit.\n\nPaleo diets require eliminating specific food groups entirely, such as grains. The low-carb diet plan emphasizes protein such as fish and chicken, natural fats such as avocado, fresh fruits, and non-starchy vegetables. Pratt feels that his eating philosophy requires that same all-or-nothing mentality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done with that,\u201d he says with reference to starchy foods and guzzling booze.\n\nBut how did Chris end up getting drunk, then? He explained that it was at the end of a photo session for GQ, reported the Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the end of a GQ photoshoot and we\u2019re supposed to do an acting DVD, acting video kind of bit for YouTube. Truth is, it\u2019s hot as hell and I\u2019m drunk,\u201d confessed Pratt.\n\nIn addition to the weed warning, Chris provided details on \u201cHow to act when you see a T-Rex at a Jamba Juice\u201d and \u201cHow to act when you see a snake.\u201d\n\nNow facing his tour for Jurassic World, Pratt decided to apologize before he even started, reported CNET.\n\n\u201cI want to make a heartfelt apology for whatever it is I end up accidentally saying during the forthcoming \u202a#\u200eJurassicWorld\u202c press tour,\u201d posted Chris on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI am not in the business of making excuses. I am just dumb. Plain and simple. I try. I REALLY try! When I do (potentially) commit the offensive act for which I am now (pre) apologizing you must understand I (will likely have been) tired and exhausted when I (potentially) said that thing I (will have had) said that (will have had) crossed the line.\u201d\n\n[Images Via Chris Pratt/Facebook]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Pratt got very, very drunk to deliver a very, very strange speech on life, liberty, and the pursuit of an acting career.
