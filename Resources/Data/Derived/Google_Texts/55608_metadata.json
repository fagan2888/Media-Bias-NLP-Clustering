In her most recent announcement, Clinton promises to \u201cfight to break down these barriers so that everyone, regardless of where they live, has a chance to live up to their potential.\u201d\n\nClinton starts with her economic ideas as she lays out her plan, in which she urges Congress to act as quickly as possible in regards to fixing Puerto Rico\u2019s current financial disaster. She advocates for Congress to allow Puerto Rico to \u201crestructure all of their debt, while respecting Puerto Rico\u2019s local self-government\u201d as \u201cgiving Puerto Rico a shot at overcoming its critical budgetary problems is the fair thing to do.\u201d\n\nTo continue ensuring the Puerto Rico is treated equitably, Clinton\u2019 next proposal is to \u201censure Puerto Rico\u2019s political status gets resolved.\u201d While Clinton does not explicitly say whether or not she is condoning statehood for Puerto Rico in this section, she does say, \u201cthat Puerto Ricans, as all Americans, should have the opportunity to participate in helping elect their President, regardless of where they live.\u201d On this point she also pledges to demand, \u201cthat Congress honors whatever the people of Puerto Rico decide\u201d regarding their legal status.\n\nHillary\u2019s plan also addresses health care on the island, especially in the dawn of the Zika virus. She addresses the fact that healthcare has become less affordable and less accessible to Puerto Ricans as \u201cdoctors are fleeing Puerto Rico at an alarming rate.\u201d To ensure these people get the health care they need, Clinton promises to increase the share of Medicare and Medicaid paid by the federal government, while keeping Congress from rolling back the Affordable Care Act \u2013 in fact, Clinton says she wants to \u201cbuild on the ACA\u201d- and stopping the cuts to Medicare Advantage.\n\nClinton also speaks to the future, as she details her plan to \u201censure quality education for Puerto Rican youth.\u201d To do so she will make pre-K universal nationally, a reform that would include Puerto Rico, while allocating more money to the Early head Start and Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. For older learners, Clinton has proposed the New College Compact, which will \u201cprovide scholarships and child care support for student parents\u201d while ensuring that debt doesn\u2019t hold down other students after graduation.\n\nClinton also put forth a policy for jobs, in which she will raise the minimum wage, ensure equal pay for women in the workforce, boost apprenticeships and guarantee paid family and medical leave. To combat Puerto Rico\u2019s poverty rates she proposed a \u201c$125 billion investment to create good-paying jobs, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and connect housing to opportunity in communities that are being left out and left behind.\u201d\n\nLastly, Hillary addresses Puerto Rican veterans. In her plan, she says she will hold VA employees accountable to ensure they are putting veterans\u2019 needs first, while also \u201ctransform[ing] the VA into an integrated health care system.\u201d\n\nWhile not all of these proposals are necessarily exclusive to Puerto Rico, what is important is that Clinton\u2019s plan for the island is one in which Puerto Rico is legally and socially seen as equal to states, regardless of its statehood, or lack thereof.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Pasquines", "title": "Clinton\u2019s official platform focuses on equity for Puerto Rico", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://pasquines.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26228171301_8d034d410c_b.jpg", "height": 684}, "url": "https://pasquines.us/2016/04/25/clintons-official-platform-focuses-on-equity-for-puerto-rico/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://pasquines.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26228171301_8d034d410c_b.jpg", "title": "Clinton\u2019s official platform focuses on equity for Puerto Rico", "site": "@", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 507699892617456}, "theme-color": "#000000", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1", "article": {"section": "Elections", "tag": "Puerto Rico", "published_time": "2016-04-25T20:20:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T20:20:28+00:00", "author": "https://pasquines.us/author/gciuffetelli/"}, "filament": {"is-404": 0, "is-page": 0, "is-single": 1, "post-type": "post", "is-tag": 0, "is-author": 0, "is-front-page": 0, "tags": "2016,democrat,democratic,election,hillary-clinton,news,political,politics,pr,president-presidential,primary,puerto-rico", "is-attachment": 0, "is-tax": 0, "is-preview": 0, "is-sticky": 0, "is-category": 0, "is-home": 0, "is-search": 0, "is-singular": 1, "categories": "elections,headlines", "is-archive": 0}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pasquines.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-Pasquines_icon_black-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "While her opponent Senator Bernie Sanders also has a platform for the territory, Clinton\u2019s last official statement regarding Puerto Rico was a paltry 377-word press statement.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has now put forth a comprehensive plan for Puerto Rico that centers on fairness.\nTo combat Puerto Rico\u2019s poverty rates she proposed a \u201c$125 billion investment to create good-paying jobs, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and connect housing to opportunity in communities that are being left out and left behind.\u201dLastly, Hillary addresses Puerto Rican veterans.\nHillary\u2019s plan also addresses health care on the island, especially in the dawn of the Zika virus.\nFor older learners, Clinton has proposed the New College Compact, which will \u201cprovide scholarships and child care support for student parents\u201d while ensuring that debt doesn\u2019t hold down other students after graduation."}
