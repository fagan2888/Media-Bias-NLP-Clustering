Yet her bold statement seems out of touch considering the growing list of issues plaguing President Obama\u2019s signature law. Median premium increases are about 12%, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Health and Human Services forecasts that between 9.4 million and 11.4 million Americans will enroll in the online exchanges \u2014 half as many as previously thought. And health-insurance networks continue to get narrower, as insurers try to keep costs from rising even faster than they already are.\n\nThese developments are concerning enough. But they pale in comparison to what lies ahead. Using the latest health-insurance-exchange enrollment data and a model funded in part by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, I recently estimated how the Affordable Care Act will affect the health insurance market over the next decade.\n\nIn brief: Costs will continue to rise and coverage will continue to underwhelm. In fact, it will likely go into reverse, leaving millions more Americans uninsured than today.\n\nStart with the premiums, which are rising by an average of 12% from this year to next. This trend shows no signs of stopping. Across all individual plans, premiums will likely rise a further 7.4% between 2016 and 2017. Family plans will be slightly lower, increasing by roughly 6.2%. Similar increases will continue over the next decade.\n\nBy 2025, I estimate that premiums for individual plans will be about 61% more expensive than they will be in 2016. Family plans, meanwhile, will see premium hikes of roughly 61.5%. Silver plans \u2014 the most popular plans by far \u2014 will have annual premiums of nearly $5,500 for individuals and $23,500 for families. By comparison, those same plans will cost an average of $3,200 and $13,600, respectively, in 2016.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s supporters typically respond that Americans will be fine because any premium hikes will be covered by taxpayer subsidies. Yet my analysis finds this is woefully misguided.\n\nFor most plans, I estimate that 50% or more of annual premium growth will come out of consumers\u2019 pockets. Between 2016 and 2017, families will pay an average $600 more a year for the most popular silver plans. This number will steadily grow in the coming years, until the annual new costs total more than $1,000. Cumulatively, I estimate silver family plan holders will be paying almost $8,000 more out of pocket within 10 years. Individuals with comparable plans are looking at $2,000.\n\nRemember: That is on top of existing premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, all of which have also risen under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThese premium increases will be driven by two factors. The expiration of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurer assistance programs \u2014 so-called \u201crisk corridors\u201d and \u201cre-insurance\u201d \u2014 in 2017 are already forcing insurers to price their plans higher. But this creates a chain reaction where customers \u2014 especially the healthy young adults who are crucial to the law\u2019s success \u2014 start leaving the insurance market in droves.\n\nThis chain reaction is already in its early stages. Millions of Americans are already struggling to pay for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance. For millions of others, it\u2019s not just a struggle \u2014 it is impossible.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nFor a growing number of Americans, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s penalty for not purchasing insurance will be the most affordable choice. Millions of people are already taking this path. The Obama administration initially predicted between 2.7 million and 5.4 million people would pay the Affordable Care Act\u2019s penalty for not purchasing insurance. Yet last year, roughly 7.5 million Americans already took that path.\n\nThis trend will only accelerate. I estimate that Affordable Care Act exchange enrollment will peak in 2016 and 2017, then start declining thereafter. By 2025, six million Americans will have left the market entirely. Millions more will join the pool of eligible workers, largely due to population growth, yet many of them will refuse to sign up for the Affordable Care Act in the first place.\n\nOverall, the number of uninsured Americans will rise from 29 million in 2015 to a staggering 40 million in 2025 \u2014 a nearly 40% increase. Perhaps most concerning is that this will leave nearly as many Americans uninsured as there were before the Affordable Care Act was passed.\n\nHillary Clinton could indeed be right. The Affordable Care Act could be working as intended. If that\u2019s true, it should be absolutely terrifying for the millions of Americans who are suffering \u2014 or will soon suffer \u2014 under it.\n\nStephen T.
