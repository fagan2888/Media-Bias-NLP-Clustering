The author of the column, Peter Schweizer, bases his assertion on an analysis of the president\u2019s public schedule and offers an explanation for why it shows the President and the chief implementer of his signature policy achievement \u201calmost never\u201d met over the past three years.\n\nPerhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed. . . . Obama\u2019s critics say his loner style makes him unusually uninterested in working with other politicians.\n\nThe problem? Sebelius and the President did meet\u2014 a lot. \u201cShe is frequently at the White House for meetings related to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including dozens with the President in the last year alone,\u201d says Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for HHS. \u201cIn fact, she met with the President just yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe problem with Schweizer\u2019s analysis is his data set: Cabinet Secretaries who regularly come to the White House are not always recorded in the White House visitors log or listed on the president\u2019s public schedule. But Schweizer, a former foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin and a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank, based the column on an analysis of the official presidential schedule and a presidential calendar published by Politico. Featuring several pie charts and color-coded tables, the analysis was put together by the Government Accountability Institute. Schweizer is GAI\u2019s president and the organization says its mission is \u201cTo investigate and expose crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies, and other governmental corruption or malfeasance.\u201d\n\nSebelius has said that the President was never told the launch of HealthCare.gov was destined to flop, which is why it\u2019s relevant to understand more about how much Sebelius knew about its problems and what she conveyed to the president. But it\u2019s clear that analyzing the White House presidential calendar is not a good place to start this fact finding mission, as this official document does not record all\u2014or even most\u2014of the interactions between Obama and those who work for him.\n\nPrevious news stories and columns analyzing the presidential calendar and White House visitor logs have similarly offered a skewed snapshot of how Obama spends his time. In May 2012, the Washington Post published an item called \u201cWhich Cabinet secretary visits the least,\u201d analyzing the White House visitor logs to determine how often Obama met with cabinet members. The piece noted that \u201cthe database covering guests to the White House complex doesn\u2019t show us every visit\u201d but the Post published a follow up item the next day pointing out that then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had visited the White House 681 times, far more than the 33 times that showed up in the visitor logs.\n\nIn 2012, Marc Thiessen published a column in the Post citing a GAI report to make the claim that Obama \u201cskips\u201d more than half of his daily intelligence briefings. The Post\u2019s chief fact checker Glenn Kessler called the claim \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201cspecious\u201d and awarded it \u201cthree Pinocchios.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A column in Politico magazine today makes the astonishing claim that President Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had just one in-person meeting at the White House between March 23, 2010, the day the Affordable Care Act was signed, and Nov. 30, 2013.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/12/06/fact-check-did-obama-and-sebelius-only-meet-in-person-once/", "site_name": "TIME.com", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/sl_obamacontr_0210_blog.jpg?w=600", "type": "article", "title": "Fact Check: Did Obama and Sebelius Only Meet in Person Once? | TIME.com"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "health care, affordable care act, barack obama, obamacare, peter schweizer, sarah palin, white house", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "news_keywords": "health care, affordable care act, barack obama, obamacare, peter schweizer, sarah palin, white house"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc58\"", "article_summary": "Previous news stories and columns analyzing the presidential calendar and White House visitor logs have similarly offered a skewed snapshot of how Obama spends his time.\nPerhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.\nSebelius and the President did meet\u2014 a lot.\nThe Post\u2019s chief fact checker Glenn Kessler called the claim \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201cspecious\u201d and awarded it \u201cthree Pinocchios.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s clear that analyzing the White House presidential calendar is not a good place to start this fact finding mission, as this official document does not record all\u2014or even most\u2014of the interactions between Obama and those who work for him."}
