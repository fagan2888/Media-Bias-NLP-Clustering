Then, researchers followed up with all the patients within two weeks of their being discharged from care, to ask about their satisfaction. By the end of the study, they were only able to reach 34 patients who received the biosketch cards and 42 patients who did not receive the cards.\n\nPatient satisfaction scores among the people who received the biosketch cards were 22 percent higher, compared with those who didn't receive the cards, researchers found.\n\nSpecifically, 25 out of the 34 patients who received the cards said that they had \"excellent overall quality of doctor care.\" Meanwhile, 22 out of the 42 patients who did not receive the cards said the same.\n\nThis isn't the first time it's been suggested that rapport between doctor and patient could lead to patient benefits. A 2012 study in the journal Patient Education and Counseling showed that doctor empathy is associated with decreased stress and pain levels among patients.\n\nMore: Patient Satisfaction", "article_metadata": {"description": "How well do you really know your doctor?\n\nA small new study in", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-11-07 08:44:48 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "How well do you really know your doctor?\n\nA small new study in", "title": "How Well Do You Know Your Doctor?
