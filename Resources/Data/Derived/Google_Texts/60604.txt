WASHINGTON–U.S. Rep. Steve King, an influential Iowa Republican, endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz for president on Monday morning. King’s blessing gives Cruz a prized voice in the early caucus state among the conservatives he’ll need to win the first nomination contest in 2016.

“I believe that Ted Cruz is the answer to my prayers,” said King, “a candidate God will use to restore the soul of America.”

King tore through a laundry list of things he loved about Cruz at Monday announcement in Iowa, including his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, his plan for immigration and that “has consistently stood on principle.” King praising Cruz’s “unmatched intellect grounded in constitutionalism. and said he’ll campaign for the Texan.

Cruz said he was honored to get King’s endorsement and called him “a tremendous leader in the House and one of the few truly principled men and women in Washington.”

“I can’t thank [King] enough and know that his help gives us a significant advantage as we continue to grow and have success in Iowa and across the nation,” said Cruz in a statement accompanied by a prerecorded video from King.

Cruz campaign aides said they expected King’s endorsement, and the two hunted pheasant together in late October. Cruz and King have long collaborated in Congress on conservative causes, and King’s son signed onto a pro-Cruz super PAC in August.

The timing, relatively early compared to King’s previous endorsements, comes as Cruz’s rivals question his record immigration. King is one of Congress’s most hawkish members on immigration, and his endorsement could assuage conservatives concerned about the recent skirmish.
