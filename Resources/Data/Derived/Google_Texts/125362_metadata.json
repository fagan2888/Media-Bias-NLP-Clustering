By 2050, the Census Bureau expects that figure to double, as the largest generation in American history lives longer than any before it. The generation of Baby Boomers has drawn criticism\u2014from themselves, among others\u2014for holding overly high expectations for their lives and for pushing too hard to meet them. These are qualities, however, that could serve them nicely as they strive to grow older with some comfort and purpose. Americans who were born between 1946 and 1964 aren\u2019t as likely to settle for simply retiring to Florida to play mahjong. \u201cThey recognize that the current systems in place are not only inadequate to meet the demands of aging, but woefully inadequate to meet their expectations,\u201d says Joseph Coughlin, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s AgeLab, which studies this fast-coming demographic upheaval. \u201cNow that we\u2019re living so much longer, we do not know what we will be doing with all that time.\u201d\n\nHappily filling their time, while continuing to contribute to the economy, will be one major challenge for these new senior citizens. Here\u2019s another: money. Having enough of it to remain solvent past retirement is especially worrisome for low-income workers and for anyone without substantial savings or pensions. But for anyone lucky enough not to worry about money, the challenge involves rethinking the way retirement looks. Do Baby Boomers want to give up their jobs entirely, or shift to part-time or flexible work, as some companies allow? They may prefer to reinvent themselves and embark on a second, \u201cencore\u201d career in the nonprofit sector. Others may want to become entrepreneurs and small-business owners or to involve themselves in a volunteer project so intensively that it amounts to a part-time job. No comprehensive national policy or consensus among experts has emerged on how to regard employment past the traditional age of retirement. So far, however, no comprehensive national policy or consensus among experts has emerged on how to regard employment past the traditional age of retirement. \u201cWe have not done a good job of \u2026 figuring out what work looks like to people in the latter part of their lives,\u201d says Andrew Scharlach, a professor of aging at the University of California (Berkeley) School of Social Welfare. \u201cWe have this image of 40 hours a week or nothing.\u201d That may not suit older workers who want to slow down without opting out entirely. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to signal that they want to retire because it can suggest that they are somehow disengaging,\u201d says Jacquelyn James, a co-director of Boston College\u2019s Center on Aging and Work. \u201cBut we know people of all ages want these kinds of choices.\u201d Even without a national consensus, programs that encourage these choices exist from coast to coast. A handful of companies and institutions, such the National Institutes of Health, offer ways of letting older workers, once they\u2019ve retired, return on a contract or part-time basis; this takes advantage of their expertise while easing them into their post-employment lives. CVS offers flexibility for older pharmacists in cold climes by letting them spend the winter in a southern state. Even so, programs of phased retirement are still pretty rare, says James. \u201cFlexibility is still seen as an employee perk as opposed to a business strategy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many older Americans want and need to keep working, but that requires a major shift in the way the country thinks about the elderly.", "author": "Nancy Cook", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "\u201cNow that we\u2019re living so much longer, we do not know what we will be doing with all that time.\u201d", "title": "Will Baby Boomers Change the Meaning of Retirement?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/06/RTR4DQBU/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/baby-boomers-retirement/396950/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4242\"", "article_summary": "Do Baby Boomers want to give up their jobs entirely, or shift to part-time or flexible work, as some companies allow?\nHaving enough of it to remain solvent past retirement is especially worrisome for low-income workers and for anyone without substantial savings or pensions.\nThe generation of Baby Boomers has drawn criticism\u2014from themselves, among others\u2014for holding overly high expectations for their lives and for pushing too hard to meet them.\n\u201cWe have this image of 40 hours a week or nothing.\u201d That may not suit older workers who want to slow down without opting out entirely.\nNo comprehensive national policy or consensus among experts has emerged on how to regard employment past the traditional age of retirement."}
