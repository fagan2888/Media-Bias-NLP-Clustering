Another year, another cookie-cutter, Ameri-centric entry in the insipid "Call of Duty" series. Despite having single-player campaigns that get shorter and shorter with each iteration — this one must last about 15 minutes by this point — these games still manage to sell well since they're one of only two console titles where gamers are guaranteed to find multiplayer action anytime (the other being the bug-ridden "Battlefield").

But hey! This one's different! It's got Kevin Spacey!
