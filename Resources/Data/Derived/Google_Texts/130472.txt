People are chanting #HandsOffMyBC on social media as SCOTUS hears arguments of several religious non-profits who think employee birth control coverage is a sin. This is not the first challenge to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, either.

The Zubik v. Burwell case is an extension of the Hobby Lobby case from 2014, which ruled that certain corporations don't have to provide birth control coverage to employees if it's against their beliefs.

So, what are the religious nonprofits arguing?

It's an interesting argument. Basically, they think that the whole idea of claiming religious exemption from the requirement to cover employees' BC is violating their religious freedom. They say that even filling out the forms to get the exemption ultimately leads to sin (AKA those employees getting birth control elsewhere). Hmmmm.

What's the Obamacare contraceptive mandate do anyways?

With this mandate, or requirement, access to contraceptives has increased drastically. This means less unplanned pregnancies and less abortions across the US.

Many women do not want their employers infringing on their access to BC in the first place. Many people can't believe this conversation is still happening.

Even politicians are weighing in.

No, we’re not gonna deny coverage for contraception or any other procedure because an employer has a “moral” objection to it. #HandsOffMyBC — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 23, 2016
