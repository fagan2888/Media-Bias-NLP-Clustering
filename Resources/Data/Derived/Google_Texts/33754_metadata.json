Kevin McCarthy's to lose, but even if he overcomes a last-minute challenge from a conservative rival, the California Republican will take the gavel as a weakened leader.\n\nWith a nomination election set for Thursday, McCarthy appears to have rounded up the votes he needs to secure the preliminary round to take over once Speaker John A. Boehner steps down at the end of the month.\n\nAs the No. 2 Republican, McCarthy, now the majority leader, is next in line for the job and, until recently, faced only a nominal challenger.\n\nBut the surprise entry of Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) brings a new dynamic to the leadership race and shows just how dissatisfied Republicans both in and out of Washington are with the status quo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d bet he ends up cobbling together enough votes to become the speaker, but how well he can manage is another story,\u201d said John J. Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult time to be speaker. It\u2019s a time where success is defined as avoiding catastrophe.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s allies remain confident he has the 218 votes needed to win the final House floor vote scheduled for Oct. 29, but Chaffetz, in launching his own bid, predicted McCarthy will fall short.\n\nChaffetz, like McCarthy, is of a younger generation of GOP lawmakers who prefer conflict to compromise. The Utah congressman lacks strong leadership experience, but he provides a viable alternative for those who are worried that promoting McCarthy would be seen in their home districts as promoting the same insiders at a time when constituents appear to prefer outsiders.\n\n\u201cIf we just promote existing leadership, yikes, that's going to get ugly for us at home,\u201d Chaffetz said Monday in a briefing with reporters. \u201cThere will eventually be a realization we better darn well put up a fresh face.\u201d\n\nA key test will unfold Tuesday night when McCarthy appears before House conservatives at a closed-door candidates\u2019 forum where many GOP lawmakers will be looking to extract promises about how he will deal with their priorities.\n\nHe\u2019ll face tough questions over raising the nation\u2019s debt limit, defunding Planned Parenthood and keeping the sequester caps to cut spending. Because GOP conservatives control a powerful block of about 50 votes, their support can make or break candidates.\n\nChaffetz already has suggested the direction he is heading, calling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u201cflat-out wrong\u201d for taking the threat of a government shutdown off the table in recent negotiations over Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nThat sort of hardened approach may win support from conservatives. But those promises will prove much tougher for the new speaker to deliver, as Boehner readily understands.\n\nThe House GOP\u2019s attempts to push a conservative agenda was no match for the power of the Senate filibuster or President Obama\u2019s veto pen. Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, advance the Keystone XL pipeline or prevent Obama\u2019s immigration actions \u2014 all GOP priorities that languished under Democratic objections.\n\nBoehner understood this dynamic, but got blamed by his troops for not fighting harder. McCarthy will face the same dilemma of trying to convince conservatives he will go to the mat, even as he is constrained by the limits of shared governance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to try to pin him down on commitments,\u201d said one House Republican aide granted anonymity to discuss the race. \u201cThat may get him in, but that risks raising expectations and making promises that will be difficult to keep.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy has remained largely out of the limelight since his high-profile TV stumble in which he appeared to suggest that the GOP-led House investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack was partly aimed at weakening Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Chaffetz capitalized on the remark in mounting his long-shot challenge.\n\n\u201cWe need a speaker who speaks,\u201d Chaffetz told reporters this week, promising his communication skills would be better than McCarthy\u2019s.\n\nMcCarthy remained away from Washington at a GOP fundraiser Monday in Pittsburgh, and on Tuesday, he continued mop-up a week after his televised Benghazi gaffe, which he has since retracted.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the Select Committee on Benghazi is to find the truth \u2014 period,\u201d McCarthy said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nHow the race has come to this for McCarthy is another episode of discontent in the Republican Party that has played out in Congress and on the presidential primary trail.\n\nMcCarthy and Chaffetz in many ways should be natural allies. Separated by just two years in age and their arrival in Congress, they are relative newcomers to Washington, elected on promises to shake things up.\n\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >>\n\nBoth sleep in their offices at night, as they try to prove they haven't succumbed to Washington\u2019s comforts. Friends as they are, Chaffetz headlined McCarthy\u2019s annual Bakersfield fundraiser in May.\n\nYet last Friday, at a fundraising event in New York City, the two men stood \u201ceyeball to eyeball\u201d as Chaffetz told his colleague he was launching a challenge for the job.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy,\u201d Chaffetz recalled Monday, as he outlined his leadership goals in the committee room, where he wields the gavel as House Oversight chairman.\n\nChaffetz readily acknowledges he is late in the race and lacks the sophisticated whip-counting operation needed to pull off a victory. But he believes enough GOP colleagues agree with him that voters want change.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s affable personality and his prodigious party fundraising have earned him goodwill among colleagues. They have been supportive, if resigned, despite his sometimes inartful comments.\n\n\u201cCertainly he\u2019s got the inside track,\u201d said Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.). \u201cI would be stunned if somebody beat him.\u201d\n\nBut the rise of Republican voter unrest on the campaign trail and McCarthy\u2019s gaffe last week has led some Republicans to question whether McCarthy will win over critics to secure the job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still an open question and will be for a while,\u201d said the House GOP aide.\n\nThe challenge is apparently strong enough that Boehner pushed back Thursday\u2019s scheduled elections for offices lower down the leadership ladder. They will be held after the Oct. 29 floor vote for speaker.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Even if Kevin McCarthy wins his battle for House speaker, he could look weaker", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The job of House speaker is still Rep.
