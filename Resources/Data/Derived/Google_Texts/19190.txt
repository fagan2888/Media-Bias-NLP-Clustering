A woman and her three children are OK after escaping an apartment fire in the 200 block of NE 11th St. in Oklahoma City overnight.

Investigators say that the family was in bed, asleep, when the smoke detector alerted the woman. She saw the fire on the floor in her son's bedroom and proceeded to get the three children out of harm's way.

According to the OKC Fire Department, four of the five units in this apartment complex were occupied at the time of the fire and 13 people were evacuated in total. No one was hurt.

The other units just have smoke and water damage and investigators are still working to gauge the severity of that damage.
