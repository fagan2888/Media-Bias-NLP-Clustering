J.W. Childs Forms Motorcycle Apparel Holding Company

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Bruckmann Rosser Sherrill and Investcorp have also made investments in the sector

J.W. Childs Associates LP has brought portfolio companies Revzilla and Cycle Gear under one umbrella called Comoto Holdings Inc. Revzilla along with Cycle Gear, which are both motorcycle apparel and parts retailers, will continue to operate independently.

Revzilla, located in Philadelphia, is an e-commerce retailer of motorcycle apparel, accessories and parts with more than $100 million in annual sales. J.W. Childs initially invested in Revzilla earlier in 2016. Cycle Gear, headquartered in Benicia, California, also sells motorcycle parts and accessories through 113 stores. The company also sponsors about 150 motorcycle related events every year. J.W. Childs acquired Cycle Gear in 2015.

“The investment is a great fit with our strategy of investing in leading specialty retailers and consumer brands and we look forward to participating in this next phase of growth at both Cycle Gear and Revzilla,” says J.W. Childs partner Jeff Teschke.

Revzilla and Cycle Gear are not the only motorcycle equipment companies that have received interest from investment firms. For instance, in 2015, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A) agreed to buy Detlev Louis Motorradvertriebs GmbH; Bruckmann Rosser Sherrill & Co. purchased Simpson Performance Products; and Investcorp acquired Dainese.

Kay Scholer and Piper Jaffray (NYSE: PJC) advised J.W. Childs and Cycle Gear. Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Peter J. Solomon Co. advised RevZilla.
