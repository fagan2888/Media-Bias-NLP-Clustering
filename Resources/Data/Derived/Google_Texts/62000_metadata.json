At $16.4 trillion, our nation\u2019s total debt is now larger than our entire economy.\n\nThis means that every man, woman, and child owes a $53,000 share of this debt. That level of spending is unsustainable. We cannot afford to keep adding over a trillion dollars to the debt every year, as we have for the past four years.\n\nA major credit rating agency has already downgraded our nation\u2019s credit once, and, if we don\u2019t start making some real progress on spending reforms, more downgrades are likely in the near future.\n\nWhat does that mean, practically speaking?\n\nWell if you or I as citizens had a bad credit rating, banks would charge a higher interest rate when we approached them to borrow money.\n\nIt works the same way with nations. If the United States\u2019 credit rating is further downgraded, our country will pay higher interest rates. This will mean trillions of borrowing in order for America to pay its bills.\n\nNeedless to say, we can\u2019t go on like this forever. Eventually, we are simply going to run out of money. And no tax increase, no matter how high, will be enough to save us.\n\nThe only way\u2014the only way\u2014to dig ourselves out of this hole and put our country on a sound financial footing is to get spending under control.\n\nReducing our spending and debt will jump-start our economy and create jobs and opportunities for American families and workers.\n\nAnd the way to start is by passing a budget.\n\nI think most American families would agree that having a budget is essential to keeping their spending under control.\n\nAnd if a budget is essential when you\u2019re running a family, it\u2019s even more essential when you\u2019re running an entity the size of the federal government.\n\nCongress\u2019 first priority every year should be coming up with a spending plan. In fact, the law requires Congress to do just that.\n\nYet, it\u2019s been almost four years since the Democrat-led Senate passed a formal budget.\n\nThe last time Senate Democrats passed a budget, the iPad didn\u2019t even exist!\n\nThe lack of a clear spending blueprint has enabled billions of dollars in wasteful spending and massive growth in the size of government.\n\nRather than continue spending hard-earned taxpayer dollars on government projects, Washington should approve private-sector economic projects like the Keystone XL pipeline\u2014which the President is blocking. This project alone would create 20,000 jobs and strengthen America\u2019s energy independence.\n\nAs every family knows, budgeting is about priorities, and it can require tough decisions. There\u2019s rarely enough money to pay for everything, so you have to decide where your priorities lie, and allocate money accordingly.\n\nCongress should be no different.\n\nOne thing that must be part of the budget debate this year is a plan to reform our entitlement programs to save and protect Social Security and Medicare for current retirees, as well as for future generations of Americans.\n\nThese programs are in trouble, and they\u2019re on an unsustainable path.\n\nSocial Security began running a deficit in 2010, and without meaningful reform, Medicare will be bankrupt by 2024.\n\nDespite this dire situation, Democrats have resisted any discussion of reform.\n\nBut the only way to save our entitlement programs is to reform them. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s not too late. If we act now, we can put our nation back on a sound financial footing and preserve the promise of economic prosperity for future generations.\n\nIf instead we choose to wait, if instead we choose to put off these tough decisions for another day, then we choose to leave the next generation with a far worse economy than we received from our parents and grandparents. We cannot let that happen.\n\nWe can fix this problem. And I believe that if we work together, we will fix it. I hope Democrats will join us in passing a budget and putting our nation back on the path to prosperity.\n\nThank you for listening. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator John Thune (R-SD) urged Senate Democrats to pass a budget cutting spending, entitlement reform, and the Keystone XL Pipeline", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Senator John Thune (R-SD) urged Senate Democrats to pass a budget cutting spending, entitlement reform, and the Keystone XL Pipeline", "title": "Thune Touts Spending Decrease, Entitlement Reform, Keystone In GOP Weekly Address - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Thune-822-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/22/thune-touts-spending-decrease-entitlement-reform-keystone-in-gop-weekly-address/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senator John Thune (R-SD) urged Senate Democrats to pass a budget cutting spending, entitlement reform, and the Keystone XL Pipeline", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Thune-822-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Thune Touts Spending Decrease, Entitlement Reform, Keystone In GOP Weekly Address - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "budget, entitlement reform, John Thune, Keystone XL,Breitbart TV, Economics,Thune", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Keystone XL", "published_time": "2015-08-22T05:26:38-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce710\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSenator John Thune (R-SD) urged Senate Democrats to pass a budget cutting spending, entitlement reform, and the Keystone XL Pipeline during Saturday\u2019s GOP Weekly Address.\nThe last time Senate Democrats passed a budget, the iPad didn\u2019t even exist!\nReducing our spending and debt will jump-start our economy and create jobs and opportunities for American families and workers.\nThe lack of a clear spending blueprint has enabled billions of dollars in wasteful spending and massive growth in the size of government.\nI think most American families would agree that having a budget is essential to keeping their spending under control."}
