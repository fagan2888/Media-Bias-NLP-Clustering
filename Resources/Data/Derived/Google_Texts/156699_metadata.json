The film was based around an interview with Putin in which he discussed some of the highs and lows of his time in office.\n\nRelated: Did Putin Snag U.S. Uranium and Sell It to Iran?\n\nAmong his most painful memories, Putin said, were two events associated with the aftermath of uprisings in the Northern Caucasus, which the Kremlin put down brutally in 1996 and again in 2000. In 2002, Chechen rebels seized a Moscow theater in an operation that wound up costing the lives of a large number of people when security services staged a rescue operation. Two years later, Chechen rebels seized a school in the town of Beslan in an attack that left more than 300 dead, including nearly 200 children.\n\nIn the interview, Putin accused the U.S. \u2014 which had recently suffered the 9/11 attacks, also by Islamic militants \u2014 of supporting the Chechen rebels.\n\n\u201cAt one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cSomeone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't.\u201d\n\nRelated: EU Dials Back Gazprom Investigation, but Still Riles Kremlin\n\nAsked about Russia\u2019s takeover of the Ukraine in 2014, Putin said: \u201cI think we did the right things, and I don\u2019t regret about anything. The main thing for us was to understand what the people living in Crimea wanted. Did they want to stay in Ukraine or to be together with Russia?\u201d\n\nHonoring what he claimed were the wishes of ethnic Russians in Crimea, he said, was \u201ca matter of paramount importance. Not because we want to grab or eat up something and not even because of Crimea\u2019s strategic significance for the Black Sea region. Simply, this is an element of historic justice.\u201d\n\nPutin said that the consequences for Russia, including harsh international economic sanctions that were tightened after Moscow began supporting armed rebels in eastern Ukraine, were not a long-term problem.\n\n\u201cThis policy of Russia\u2019s containment has been known for centuries,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new to it and there\u2019s no reason for us to feel distressed.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Cash Cow Gazprom Is in EU Regulators\u2019 Crosshairs\n\nOn Monday, meanwhile, Putin took another not-so-veiled shot at the U.S., which spearheaded efforts to cut Russia off from global financial markets after last year\u2019s invasion of the Crimean Peninsula. That made it very difficult for Russia to refinance its debt, among other things.\n\nSpeaking in St. Petersburg, Putin referred to unspecified countries he called Russia\u2019s \u201cquasi-partners,\u201d saying that they had sought the ruin of the Russian economy but had been disappointed.\n\n\u201cApparently someone was counting on some sort of collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cNo collapse happened. The Russian economy is easily overcoming these artificial barriers.\u201d\n\nRelated: As the Ruble Recovers, Putin Spins Economic Cheer\n\nSome might debate Putin\u2019s conclusions. The Russian economy is headed into recession, and its citizens are dealing with double-digit inflation and a ruble that, despite some gains this year, is still far weaker in terms of purchasing power than it was a year ago.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Vladimir Putin accused the United States of supporting Islamic militants in the Northern Caucasus region and suggested that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year was a form of \u201chistoric justice.\u201d", "title": "Defiant Putin Calls Invasion of Crimea \u2018Historic Justice\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/Defiant-Putin-Calls-Invasion-Crimea-Historic-Justice", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-08-05T152804Z_1_LYNXMPEA740OE_RTROPTP_2_UKRAINE-CRISIS-USA-PUTIN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/Defiant-Putin-Calls-Invasion-Crimea-Historic-Justice", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-08-05T152804Z_1_LYNXMPEA740OE_RTROPTP_2_UKRAINE-CRISIS-USA-PUTIN.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Vladimir Putin accused the United States of supporting Islamic militants in the Northern Caucasus region and suggested that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year was a form of \u201chistoric justice.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e16\"", "article_summary": "In the interview, Putin accused the U.S. \u2014 which had recently suffered the 9/11 attacks, also by Islamic militants \u2014 of supporting the Chechen rebels.\nThe film was based around an interview with Putin in which he discussed some of the highs and lows of his time in office.\nThe Russian economy is easily overcoming these artificial barriers.\u201dRelated: As the Ruble Recovers, Putin Spins Economic CheerSome might debate Putin\u2019s conclusions.\nThe main thing for us was to understand what the people living in Crimea wanted.\nSpeaking in St. Petersburg, Putin referred to unspecified countries he called Russia\u2019s \u201cquasi-partners,\u201d saying that they had sought the ruin of the Russian economy but had been disappointed."}
