Cape Town, South Africa

A woman in South Africa celebrated her 100th birthday by performing a skydive on Saturday.

Georgina Harwood's family and friends traveled from all over the world to Melkbosstrand in Cape Town to see her skydive, which raised funds for the National Sea Rescue Institute.

"It was definitely a very special, exhilarating experience," said Harwood.

It was Harwood's third sky dive, her first was in 2007 when she was aged 92. The 100-year-old's next adventure will be shark cage diving, which she will attempt on Monday.
