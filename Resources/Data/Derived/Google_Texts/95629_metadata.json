That\u2019s a significant decrease considering that family physicians see nearly one third of children and children make up about 10% of their practice.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors say they are concerned that Affordable Care Act polices that are increasing coverage for adults are spreading the services of current family physicians too thin.\n\nREAD: ACA earns higher scores with physicians\n\n\u201cPolicy discussions regarding looming physician shortages and the implementation of healthcare reform have focused predominantly on adults,\u201d say the study\u2019s researchers from the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care. \u201cThe costs of adult-related healthcare can overwhelm those of children\u2019s care, leaving children\u2019s health services to be an afterthought in the minds of many policy makers.\u201d\n\nMale family physicians, those who are older and those in a group practice are less likely to provide care to children. Also, in years when family physicians are taking recertification exams, they see fewer child patients.\n\nThe survey was given to family physicians taking the American Board of Family Medicine maintenance of certification exam between 2006 and 2009. Because the survey was a mandatory part of the test, it has a 100% response rate of 37,020 physicians.\n\nFamily physicians in the South and the West see fewer child patients than do Northeastern physicians. The Washington D.C. area had the lowest percentage of family physicians treating children at 45%; while 84% of Nebraska\u2019s family physicians treat children.\n\n\u201cFamily physicians, especially in rural and underserved areas, may face impossible demands to care for a larger insured population, resulting in decreased capacity to provide care for children,\u201d the study\u2019s authors say. \u201cAdditionally, current geographic maldistribution of the child health care physician workforce is leading to difficulty with access to care for many children and families.\u201d\n\nREAD: The future of family medicine\n\nWhen family physicians practice obstetrics, they also treat more children, according to the study. Incentives for medical students who want to go into family medicine and the pediatric programs in medical schools should be strengthened to make the profession more profitable and less stressful, the study says.\n\n\u201cStrengthening existing partnerships and forging new collaborative relationships among general pediatric, obstetric, and family medicine educators may also be important if we are to ensure a well-trained, geographically well-distributed child physician workforce,\u201d the study\u2019s authors say. \u201cPolicy makers must consider how ongoing discussions of payment reforms, principally aimed at value-based purchasing and broader population management, influence access to care for children in areas with few providers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "The availability of primary care services for children is changing, as fewer family physicians are seeing children, according to a recent Annals of Family Medicine study.", "Description": "The availability of primary care services for children is changing, as fewer family physicians are seeing children, according to a recent Annals of Family Medicine study.", "og": {"url": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/aca-demands-may-deter-family-docs-treating-children", "site_name": "Medical Economics", "description": "The availability of primary care services for children is declining, as fewer family physicians are seeing children, according to a recent Annals of Family Medicine study.\n\n\tThe percentage of family", "title": "ACA demands may deter family docs from treating children"}, "DC.identifier": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/node/389165", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.date": "2014-10-24", "last-modified": "Tue, 28 October 2014 17:17:50 GMT", "DC.creator": "Donna Marbury", "DC.source": "Medical Economics eConsult", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, family medicine, maintenance of certification, MOC, Modern Medicine Feature Articles, pediatrics, physician shortage, primary care shortage, Practice Management", "emsContentType": "ACA demands may deter family docs from treating children", "DC.title": "ACA demands may deter family docs from treating children"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1004\"", "article_summary": "The Washington D.C. area had the lowest percentage of family physicians treating children at 45%; while 84% of Nebraska\u2019s family physicians treat children.\nThe availability of primary care services for children is declining, as fewer family physicians are seeing children, according to a recent Annals of Family Medicine study.\nThe survey was given to family physicians taking the American Board of Family Medicine maintenance of certification exam between 2006 and 2009.\nThat\u2019s a significant decrease considering that family physicians see nearly one third of children and children make up about 10% of their practice.\nThe percentage of family physicians caring for children dropped from 78% in 2000 to 68% in 2009."}
