Sioux Falls, SD

What started out as a rainy morning ended with sunshine and many fixed windshields.

Certified Auto Glass hosted their third annual Free Rock Chip Repair Day in the Western Mall parking lot in Sioux Falls Saturday.

The first repair is free and donations given go toward the Susan B. Koman foundation. President of Susan B. Koman in South Dakota, Rod Goeman says most of Saturday's donations will help others across South Dakota.

"If there's a way we can help them get to the clinics, get care at the clinics we want to make sure that everyone has that opportunity to get a mammogram and be checked. We feel that the best way to stop cancer is to catch it as early as possible and that's really where a lot of end roads have come," Goeman said.

Goeman says the free chip repair raised close to $3,000 within the first two years, and even with the rain Saturday morning, they saw a good turn out.
