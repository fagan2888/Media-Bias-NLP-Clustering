It\u2019s a positive emotion, and people register positive emotions, more so than negative emotions, when forming new bonds. So to better understand these emotions when it comes to new social bonds, researchers from the University of California, Irvine conducted one study on couples and one on single women.\n\nIn the first study, 66 couples were tested on their positive emotions while couples were being teased or reflecting on their past relationships. And in the second study, 91 women watched six emotional film clips with either a roommate or a stranger.\n\nThe results showed couples could accurately track their partners\u2019 positive emotions, while women in the second study felt closer to strangers displaying positive emotions. Overall, participants in both studies were more aware of one another\u2019s positive emotions \u2014 and when situations had friendship potential, participants were more attuned to positivity than negativity.\n\n\u201cOur findings provide new evidence of the significance of positive emotions in social settings and highlight the role that positive emotions display in the development of new social connections,\u201d Belinda Campos, lead researcher, said in a press release. \u201cPeople are highly attuned to the positive emotions of others and can be more attuned to others' positive emotions than negative emotions.\u201d\n\nCampos added it\u2019s a certain kind of smile that displays positive emotions, called the Duchenne smile. It\u2019s a \u201cdistinct smile that involves the simultaneous movement of two facial muscles around the eyes and cheeks, and is primarily produced when people are sincere and happy.\u201d What\u2019s more is Campos believes people \u201care very much aware\u201d when someone is flashing a Duchenne, or genuine, smile versus a fake smile.\n\nDuchenne smile reference chart.

The fake smile is called the \u201cSay Cheese\u201d smile, where people only contract the zygomatic major, since they can\u2019t voluntarily contract the orbicularis oculi.\n\nApparently, our brain controls these two types of smiles; the Duchenne smile is controlled by the limbic system, or the emotional part of our brain, while the \u201cSay Cheese\u201d smile is controlled by the motor cortex.\n\n\u201cWhen a patient with damage to the motor cortex on the brain's left hemisphere attempts to smile, the smile is asymmetrical, with the right side of the smile not moving as it should,\u201d Today reported. \u201cHowever, when that same patient spontaneously laughs, the smile is normal with no asymmetry. This means that the genuine smile is controlled by some other part of the brain.\u201d\n\nSource: Campos, B. et al. Attuned to the positive?
