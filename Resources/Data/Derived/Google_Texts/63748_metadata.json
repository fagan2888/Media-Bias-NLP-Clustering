Three more people overseas were also charged in the case.\n\nProsecutors say Jama and Dhirane women raised money -- which they referred to as \"living expenses\" -- for al-Shabab using code words like \"orphans\" to refer to al-Shabab fighters.\n\nThey say the two women were the leaders of a conspiracy operating in the United States, Kenya, the Netherlands, Somalia and elsewhere. Court records say Jama sent money through a conduit to Kenya, while Dhirane used a conduit in Somalia.\n\nJama faced an initial appearance Wednesday at the federal courthouse in Alexandria.\n\nOf the three overseas suspects, one is in custody in the Netherlands; the other two are fugitives in Kenya and Somalia.\n\nAll five people were indicted on one count each of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and 20 counts of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Alexandria announced the charges Wednesday.\n\nThe United States designated al-Shabab as a terrorist group in 2008. The group is linked to al-Qaida.\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC4 Washington", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two women in the U.S. have been charged with funneling money to the extremist group al-Shabab in Somalia.", "title": "Reston Woman Among Those Charged With Helping Group Linked to Al-Qaida", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4 Washington", "description": "Two women in the U.S. have been charged with funneling money to the extremist group al-Shabab in Somalia.", "title": "Va.
