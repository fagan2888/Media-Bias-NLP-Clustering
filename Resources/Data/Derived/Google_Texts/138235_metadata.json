It also offered relief to workers who may be enrolled in those plans next year.\n\nThe administration will rule that plans without \u201csubstantial coverage for in-patient hospitalization services\u201d do not meet the law\u2019s \u201cminimum value\u201d threshold, the Treasury Department said in a notice Tuesday morning. It will issue final regulations saying so next year, it said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news for employees,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, project director at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be stuck with subpar coverage.\u201d\n\nHundreds of employers with low-wage workers, such as retailers and temporary-staffing companies, have been preparing to offer such plans for 2015, the first year large companies are liable for fines if they do not provide minimum coverage.\n\nLarge companies are not required to offer the health law\u2019s \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d including hospital services (unlike the insurance sold to individuals and small employers). But most analysts assumed that the minimum value calculator \u2014 testing whether insurance pays at least 60 percent of expected medical costs for a given plan \u2014 would require hospital care. It didn\u2019t.\n\nAlthough the insurance costs half as much as similar coverage including hospitalization, an online calculator published by the Department of Health and Human Services certifies it as passing the law\u2019s minimum-value standard, Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post reported two months ago. Many see the calculator as flawed.\n\nNumerous large employers have already committed to such coverage for next year, brokers say. Some have enrolled workers for insurance that began in October.\n\nResponding to industry pleas, the administration agreed to allow those plans for a year if employers committed to them before Tuesday, Nov. 4. But officials also moved to give their workers an affordable alternative, granting an exception to the rule that would have barred them from premium subsidies if they opted instead to buy insurance on the health law\u2019s online marketplaces.\n\nUnder the health law, employees who are offered minimum-value coverage at work are ineligible for federal tax credits in online insurance marketplaces. \u201cIn no event\u201d will workers given an employer plan without hospital coverage be disqualified from the subsidies, the Treasury said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very positive, constructive, sensible step,\u201d said Edward Lenz, senior counsel for the American Staffing Association, a trade group for temp and recruiting companies. \u201cThe key is that everybody\u2019s going to be held harmless\u201d \u2014 companies that have committed to the plans as well as workers wanting to buy their own, subsidized insurance with broader coverage.\n\nAbout half of the association\u2019s 1,600 members, who employ 3 million people on any given day, had committed to offer or were considering calculator-tested plans without hospital coverage, Lenz said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "business", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A \u2018loophole\u2019 in the health law had allowed low-cost plans that excluded certain crucial benefits.", "title": "Obama administration closing loophole that allowed substandard health-care plans", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-administration-closing-loophole-that-allowed-sub-standard-health-care-plans/2014/11/04/478057de-646c-11e4-9fdc-d43b053ecb4d_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-administration-closing-loophole-that-allowed-sub-standard-health-care-plans/2014/11/04/478057de-646c-11e4-9fdc-d43b053ecb4d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "business", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "478057de-646c-11e4-9fdc-d43b053ecb4d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "A \u2018loophole\u2019 in the health law had allowed low-cost plans that excluded certain crucial benefits."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe08a7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s good news for employees,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, project director at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\nResponding to industry pleas, the administration agreed to allow those plans for a year if employers committed to them before Tuesday, Nov. 4.\nClosing what many see as a loophole that could trap millions of people in substandard insurance, the Obama administration said Tuesday that large-employer medical plans lacking hospital coverage will not qualify under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s toughest standard.\n\u201cIn no event\u201d will workers given an employer plan without hospital coverage be disqualified from the subsidies, the Treasury said Tuesday.\nAbout half of the association\u2019s 1,600 members, who employ 3 million people on any given day, had committed to offer or were considering calculator-tested plans without hospital coverage, Lenz said."}
