All this week, the University of Hartford has hosted events marking the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. The programs have been designed to encourage reflection on what was accomplished back then, as a way to ask ourselves, “what can we do now?”

This hour, we hear from a panel discussion hosted by WNPR's Diane Orson called Leveling the Playing Field about disparities in access to education and health care. We talk about how Connecticut’s teachers, administrators, and health care professionals can better respond to the needs of the diverse communities they serve.
