The Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation Commission also is charged with recommending best child welfare practices with regards to the Wabanaki.\n\nEsther Attean, co-director of Maine-Wabanaki REACH, an organization that helped prepare the groundwork for the commission and is working with the tribal communities to prepare them to participate in the commission\u2019s work, was asked to characterize the sense of the Passamaquoddy people at Pleasant Point in light of the panel\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cI think fear is the overriding feeling of everyone, [mainly fear of breaking silence and speaking out],\u201d said Attean, who grew up in Pleasant Point and now lives in Old Town. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of fear, but there\u2019s a lot of excitement. We have folks who are ready to come \u2026 and share their stories,\u201d she said Sunday.\n\nCommunity organizers have been holding meetings to educate, inform and prepare members of the Pleasant Point community for the commission\u2019s visit, said Attean. A group also was formed to help guide the process of interacting with the commission. In fact, the commission\u2019s mandate gives the tribal people control over the visit by the panel. Each community essentially dictates how the visit will be conducted and invites the commission when the people are ready. The commission made a preliminary visit to Pleasant Point in September to meet with residents and answer questions about its activities.\n\nThe commission was officially mandated by the five Wabanaki chiefs \u2014 the other four Wabanaki tribes are the Passamaquoddy at Indian Township, the Micmac in Aroostook, the Maliseet in Houlton, and the Penobscot near Orono \u2014 and Gov. Paul LePage in June 2012 and has until November 2015 to complete its mission. The five commissioners were chosen by a 13-member committee in December 2012 based on their experience with state-tribal relationships, welfare services and government.\n\nThe commission co-chairmen are Carol Wishcamper of Freeport, a consultant, and gkisedtanamoogk, an adjunct professor of Native American studies and the peace and reconciliation programs at the University of Maine. The other commissioners are Matthew Dunlap, Gail Werrbach and Sandra White Hawk.\n\nThe commission will be \u201cquite busy\u201d at Pleasant Point, Wishcamper said Saturday. Members of the Passamaquoddy tribe will have the opportunity to talk about their experiences, which they will be able to do in private, if they prefer. The activities also will include a \u201clistening circle,\u201d allowing participants to tell their stories and get mutual support, said Wishcamper. Ceremonies will kick off and close the three-day gathering.\n\nThe commission will visit other Native American communities in the coming months. It plans to visit Indian Township in February and later meet with Native Americans in Bangor and reservation communities. In addition, it will meet with officials representing state child welfare and social service agencies, the criminal justice system, foster parents and foster children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an intense schedule,\u201d said Wishcamper.\n\nAttean made two presentations related to the commission\u2019s work, speaking at Washington County Community College in Calais and at the University of Maine at Machias last week. She spent about 45 minutes in Machias on Thursday evening discussing the history of Native Americans with particular focus on Maine\u2019s tribes as well as information about events that led to the formation of the commission.\n\nSome 20 Wabanaki tribes originally inhabited Maine, Attean told the Machias audience of about 40 people, but 16 were \u201cannihilated by genocide,\u201d and only four remain. Ninety-six percent of the Wabanaki population was depleted after the arrival of Europeans to North America; there are about 8,000 Wabanaki today.\n\nIn the late 1800s, government policies shifted away from genocide of tribal peoples to forced assimilation into American culture, she said. Indian children were removed from their homes and placed in foster homes of white families and also sent to boarding schools. Native American children were abused in various ways by their foster parents and in the boarding schools, she said.\n\n\u201cThey were very damaged,\u201d said Attean. \u201cAll that trauma has been passed down [through the generations],\u201d she added. Attean referred to studies showing that tribal people have high rates of substance abuse and dependency, other health problems and violent crime.\n\nDenise Altvater, 53, a Passamaquoddy who lives at Pleasant Point, also spoke at the university and described her experience of being removed from her family\u2019s home and put into foster care when she was 7. For four years, she and her siblings were \u201ctortured,\u201d said Altvater \u2014 raped, starved and beaten.\n\nSince the commission has no state funding, it has had to raise funds to support its activities, noted Wishcamper. The commission recruited and hired an executive director who in turn recruited and hired other staff, as well as adding unpaid interns. Fundraising continues with a particular focus on being able to hire staffers to work in specific communities to engage tribal people in the commission\u2019s activities. The commission staff has offices in Ellsworth.\n\nThe commission\u2019s work will not be a snapshot of the issue, said Wishcamper.\n\n\u201cThis is not intended to be a one-shot deal \u2026 It\u2019s intended to be an opening \u2026 so people can begin to heal from the intergenerational trauma that\u2019s resulted from the numbers of children who\u2019ve been taken from the community,\u201d he said.\n\nThe truth and reconciliation process has only been used twice before in the U.S., observed Wishcamper, but those commissions were at the municipal level. The Maine commission is \u201cthe first time a state has committed to a process,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly hopeful about what\u2019s going to come out of this,\u201d said commission executive director Heather Martin. \u201cI think this is a great opportunity for the whole state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A special commission charged with investigating and documenting how Wabanaki people suffered from Maine\u2019s child welfare system will begin its work in earnest next week with a visit to the Passamaquoddy tribe at Pleasant Point.For the five-member commission, sworn in on Feb. 12, the Nov. 20-22 visit will be the [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "A special commission charged with investigating and documenting how Wabanaki people suffered from Maine\u2019s child welfare system will begin its work in earnest next week with a visit to the Passamaquoddy tribe at Pleasant Point.
