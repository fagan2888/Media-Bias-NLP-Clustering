The experienced sailor is piloting Athena, her 29-foot Erikson sailboat, solo from her hometown down the U.S. eastern seaboard, with a stop in the Bahamas, around Florida and up the state\u2019s west coast to Eckerd on St. Petersburg\u2019s waterfront.\n\nShe left on Sept. 29. Although plenty of friends offered to tag along, Gardiner-Smith decided it was something she needed to do alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I understand it better now that I\u2019ve traveled so far,\u201d she said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing you have done something all by yourself. When there\u2019s a tough situation, you get yourself out of it. That\u2019s really important for people, especially for young people. Once I got to Florida, it just felt really good.\u201d\n\nAthena is now docked in Jacksonville while Gardiner-Smith spends the holidays with her family back home. On Jan. 3, she\u2019ll be back aboard the sloop to continue down the Florida coast.\n\nShe\u2019s technically not traveling solo. Elli, her 10-pound cockapoo, has been along for the ride.\n\nBut the trip has taken a toll on what Gardiner-Smith calls her \u201cfurry first mate.\u201d In October, when they went for a walk onshore in a port south of Boston, the dog bolted onto the street and was struck by a truck.\n\nElli\u2019s right hind leg was badly shattered and had to be amputated.\n\n\u201cIt was so sad,\u201d Gardiner-Smith said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep her from going into the road. It\u2019s so crazy.\u201d\n\nShe said she cried for days, but when reunited with her dog also came away with \u201cthe lesson I am trying to learn from my little dog. That lesson is to be resilient, unyielding in a desire to live, and, most importantly, to pick up from wherever life has placed me without resentment or anger,\u201d she wrote on her blog, which is being published by the Portland Press Herald in Maine.\n\nElli spent some recovery time in Maine but was back on the boat in November. She\u2019s getting around fine on three limbs, Gardiner-Smith said.\n\nThere have been other, less catastrophic setbacks. Gardiner-Smith backed over her dinghy line in York Harbor, Maine, tangling her propeller and requiring a dive into the frigid October sea. A fuel tank clog required repairs in Stonington, Conn. She needed a lift up the mast in a bosun\u2019s chair after the mast tangled in some tree branches in the Intracoastal Waterway and bent her wind vane.\n\nIn each case, fellow sailors came to her assistance.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, people in the sailing world are exceptionally nice and kind,\u201d she said.\n\nGardiner-Smith comes from a family of avid sailors and said she learned to walk on a boat. Along with her father, mother and sister, she\u2019s traveled to Central America, the Caribbean and has crossed the Atlantic to Europe.\n\nHer grandparents winter aboard a sailboat in the Bahamas, and when she resumes her trip, Gardiner-Smith will take a detour to visit them -- probably with Fort Lauderdale as the setting-off point -- and sail around the Exumas.\n\nShe relies on electronic GPS mapping, an iPod app and paper charts to set her course, largely along the Intracoastal Waterway, a series of protected channels that can be safer, but much busier than open sea.\n\nThe boat has a single-burner propane stove -- \u201cI eat a lot of canned soup,\u201d she said -- and she reads a lot.\n\nShe takes precautions with Elli. The dog has a \u201creally cute little lifejacket\u201d and gets clipped in when the boat is moving.\n\nFighting loneliness can be challenging.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll psych myself out once in a while, sailing at night, imagining everything that can go wrong, sitting there in the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that can go wrong.\u201d\n\nThe sailor spent Halloween in New York City and watched the marathon there. She had a makeshift Thanksgiving dinner of rotisserie chicken and pasta on the boat with her mother and sister.\n\nThis holiday week, surrounded by friends and family, enjoying hot showers, she said she is torn by that companionship and the longing to be back at sea. She\u2019ll return to Jacksonville on Jan. 3, resuming her trek down Florida. After the Bahamas, she\u2019ll head through the Florida Straits and up the west coast to college.\n\nGardiner-Smith was considering attending New College in Sarasota when she learned about Eckerd. \u201cI went to check it out, and I didn\u2019t even apply elsewhere,\u201d she said. The college\u2019s extensive waterfront activities are a particular draw, she said.\n\nShe\u2019s not sure about a major yet,but hopes to arrive in July to find a place for the boat and for the August \u201cFall Term\u201d for freshmen.\n\nThere\u2019s \u201cno set route yet\u201d for the back end of the trip. \u201cJust Eckerd at the end of it,\u201d she said.\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 28 Dec 2014 15:16:04 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Sally Gardiner-Smith is off to college, and she should arrive in time for classes.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Sally Gardiner-Smith is off to college, and she should arrive in time for classes.", "title": "High school grad sailing from Maine to Eckerd College in St. Pete", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/high-school-grad-sailing-from-maine-to-eckerd-college-in-st-pete-20141228/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141228/ARTICLE/141229411/EP/1/3/EP-141229411.jpg", "height": 339}, "updated_time": "2014-12-28T15:16:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Sally Gardiner-Smith is off to college, and she should arrive in time for classes.", "title": "High school grad sailing from Maine to Eckerd College in St. Pete", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141228/ARTICLE/141229411/AR/0/AR-141229411.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-12-28T15:16:04Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-12-28T15:16:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Gardiner-Smith, a Woolwich, Maine, teenager accepted to Eckerd College, is taking the long way to campus.\nGardiner-Smith backed over her dinghy line in York Harbor, Maine, tangling her propeller and requiring a dive into the frigid October sea.\nAlthough plenty of friends offered to tag along, Gardiner-Smith decided it was something she needed to do alone.\nAfter the Bahamas, she\u2019ll head through the Florida Straits and up the west coast to college.\nGardiner-Smith was considering attending New College in Sarasota when she learned about Eckerd."}
