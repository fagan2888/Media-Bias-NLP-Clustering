Thomas Hughes has been arrested after an incident on Friday afternoon, involving a stolen vehicle.

Sheriff's deputies were called to 8903 Bramlett Road on Friday at approximately 12 p.m. after receiving a report of a stolen vehicle that could be found at that address.

On arrival at the residence, deputies located an individual identified as Thomas Hughes. When he noticed the deputies, he entered the vehicle he had been working on in an effort to flee. Hughes ignored commands to stop the vehicle, and he recklessly and purposely maneuvered the vehicle in their direction. Two deputies had to take quick and evasive actions to avoid being struck by the vehicle and one fired his weapon due to the fear of being struck.

Hughes fled, but the vehicle was located a short time later, and he continued to flee into a wooded area. The vehicle Hughes fled in was found to be stolen along with another vehicle at the Bramlett Road address.

Hughes has been charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment with a weapon. The investigation continues.
