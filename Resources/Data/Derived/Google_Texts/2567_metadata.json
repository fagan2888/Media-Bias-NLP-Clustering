In addition, for the first time, it has begun to offer policies off the exchange that comply with Obamacare\u2019s new rules.\n\n\n\nThat means the nation\u2019s largest health insurer will once again be waging an all-fronts battle for business with Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc., the nation\u2019s second-largest insurer.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe entrance of United, it is a game changer,\u201d said Paul Ashley, a health benefits broker at Indianapolis-based First Person. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the \u2018individualization\u2019 of health benefits.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because, Ashley said, UnitedHealthcare will have health plans on the exchange that offer the broad network of hospitals and doctors workers are used to seeing in their employer health plans.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, WellPoint\u2019s Anthem subsidiary offered Obamacare exchange customers a narrow choice of doctors and hospitals.\n\n\n\nAnthem\u2019s narrow network was a \u201ccause for concern\u201d among many employers, Ashley said, who were considering ending their group health plans and sending their workers to the Obamacare exchange.\n\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare\u2019s broad network\u2014which includes all of the state\u2019s 169 hospitals and more than 16,000 physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners\u2014is key to the company\u2019s strategy to set itself apart from the nine other insurers offering individual policies in Indiana.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we evaluated the current offerings, we felt that there was an advantage to the consumer to offering that broad access,\u201d said Dan Krajnovich, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO for Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nUnitedHealthcare regional CEO Dan Krajnovich declined to estimate individual-policy Hoosier enrollees for 2014. UnitedHealthcare regional CEO Dan Krajnovich declined to estimate individual-policy Hoosier enrollees for 2014.\n\nUnitedHealthcare\u2019s challenge, however, will be price. Its cheapest plan on the Obamacare exchange charges Marion County family consumers premiums that are about 16 percent higher than Anthem\u2019s cheapest plan.\n\n\n\nEven among the Silver plans that most Hoosiers chose this year, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s cheapest plan is more expensive than Anthem\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the cheapest, but they\u2019re not astronomically off base,\u201d said Matt Kleymeyer, a benefits broker at Bernard Health in Indianapolis. \u201cIt\u2019s the age-old question about what\u2019s going to pull the lever. Is it price? Or is it access to a doctor?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnthem executives have said, unambiguously, that the answer is price. And in 2014, they certainly looked right. Anthem attracted 83,000 of the 120,000 Hoosiers who signed up for coverage via the Obamacare exchange, according to figures from the Indiana Department of Insurance.\n\n\n\nBut unlike the three other insurers that sold on the Obamacare exchange this year, UnitedHealthcare has a brand name that could compete with Anthem\u2019s Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnited has very strong brand recognition here in Indianapolis,\u201d Kleymeyer added.\n\n\n\nKrajnovich also thinks UnitedHealthcare will be able to set itself apart with the tools it offers to help consumers manage their health and shop for the care they need. That\u2019s increasingly important, he noted, since the exchange plans have deductibles that reach as high as $13,000 for families\u2014making healthy living and smart health care shopping more important than ever.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have a share in the cost, so they need to be empowered to control those costs,\u201d Krajnovich said.\n\n\n\nHolding back\n\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare was wary of Obamacare in its first year, choosing to participate on the exchanges in just four states.\n\n\n\nSo UnitedHealthcare offered the nearly 35,000 individual customers it had in Indiana at the end of 2013 the chance to just stay in those pre-Obamacare policies.\n\n\n\nThat was a cheaper option for its customers, because Obamacare required that all policies cover a list of 10 \u201cessential health benefits\u201d and that they pay for at least 60 percent of all expected medical expenses.\n\n\n\nThe health law also said insurers could no longer price their policies based on consumers\u2019 health. Instead, they have to take all comers, charging more only if consumers are older or if they smoke.\n\n\n\nThose changes pushed the cost of individual insurance in Indiana up 24 percent over what it would have been, according to a recent analysis by Yale University economist Amanda Kowalski.\n\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare executives worried, as did many others, that only the sickest customers would sign up.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor this market to be sustainable, it needs to have a balanced risk pool, and the composition of that risk pool on the individual side is uncertain at this point,\u201d UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley told investors in the spring of 2013. UnitedHealth Group is the parent company of UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\n\nCatching up\n\n\n\nBut the worst fears didn\u2019t materialize, which left WellPoint sitting pretty by being the first mover in the exchanges in the states where it operates. As a result, WellPoint\u2019s stock price has surged 50 percent in the past year\u2014versus a 32-percent bump for UnitedHealth Group.\n\n\n\nKrajnovich declined to say how many Hoosiers UnitedHealthcare expects to sign up on individual policies this year\u2014other than to joke that it wants them all.\n\n\n\nBut UnitedHealthcare\u2019s actuaries predicted rather modest success in 2015.\n\n\n\nAccording to the filings with the Indiana Insurance Department, UnitedHealthcare expects to sign up 4,935 customers on the Obamacare exchange and 1,319 off the exchange.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a total of 6,250 members\u2014or less than 10 percent of Anthem\u2019s total from this year.\n\n\n\nBut the key test will be what happens a year or two from now. That\u2019s when, according to federal regulations, even small employers will be forced to drop their pre-Obamacare plans.\n\n\n\n\u201cEmployers are moving away from sponsoring a health plan and moving toward sponsoring a health experience,\u201d Ashley said.\n\n\n\nWhen they do, about three of four employers will face big premium increases from Obamacare\u2019s new rules, said Ashley.\n\n\n\nMany might instead end their group health plans and send their employees to the Obamacare exchanges. Indianapolis-based RANAC Corp. did exactly that last year, dropping its UnitedHealthcare policy because the company could dodge a premium increase of more than $13,000.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was not a small increase,\u201d said RANAC President Keith Pitzele. \u201cAnd we continually have been getting double-digit increases\u201d in previous years.\n\n\n\nThat move cost UnitedHealthcare eight customers and their dependents.\n\n\n\nBut going forward, UnitedHealthcare hopes its suite of insurance plans will catch customers\u2014whether they have employer health insurance or are buying on their own.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe certainly want to continue our relationships with those customers,\u201d Krajnovich said.\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "After sitting on the sidelines this year, UnitedHealthcare is getting back into Indiana\u2019s individual-insurance game.
