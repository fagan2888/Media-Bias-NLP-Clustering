In March of this year the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced a breakthrough discovery, (the yet unconfirmed) existence of gravitational waves. As I wrote back on the day of its announcement, the discovery was thought to be “evidence to support [Einstein’s] last untested prediction about the Theory of General Relativity.” The existence of gravitational waves was viewed as proof of a period of inflation after the birth of our universe.

When it was announced, on March 17, the discovery had yet to be confirmed. Since then, other researchers have been skeptical that gravitational waves were viewed by the team and BICEP2 telescope in the South Pole. It may have all just been dust in the Milky Way.

Now the researchers themselves are hedging the discovery. Nature writes:

“In a paper published on 19 June in Physical Review Letters1, the BICEP2 collaboration, named after the South Pole telescope they used to look at a patch of the microwave sky, acknowledges that the foreground effect of dust in the Milky Way may account for a larger fraction than previously estimated — and possibly all — of what had appeared to be a signal from the dawn of time. “In addition, presentations given earlier this week at a cosmology conference in Moscow, based on observations from the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite add fresh evidence that what BICEP2 could be entirely due to a confounding effect of dust.”
