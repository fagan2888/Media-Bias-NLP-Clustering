The trade publication Supermarket News recently rounded up a list of promotions showing that retailers are getting \u201ccreative\u201d to encourage more customers to get flu shots. CVS promises shoppers that they\u2019ll get a free flu shot (with most insurance plans), as well as a \u201cshopping pass\u201d valid for 20% off non-sale merchandise on the day you\u2019re vaccinated. Safeway knocks a flat 10% off your grocery bill when you come in to get a flu shot. Target is waving a deal of 5% off your total purchase on the day you get a flu shot, which can range in (retail) price from $24.99 to $49.99. Get vaccinated at a Giant Food store and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a coupon book good for savings of more than $30.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, just as retailers are constantly expanding the Christmas season with promotions and ads that start earlier and earlier every year, pharmacies are trying to beat the competition to the punch by pushing flu shots long before flu season is on the radar of consumers. Walgreens, which is utilizing a \u201cGet a Shot. Give a Shot.\u201d marketing campaign to win over consumers\u2019 flu shot business\u2014money raised helps poor children around the world get vaccinated\u2014announced back on August 19 that all of its stores, health care clinics, and Duane Reade locations (which it also owns) were armed and ready to administer flu shots. Rite Aid actually beat Walgreens by a week, informing customers that flu shots were available at all of its stores starting on August 12, more than two weeks before Labor Day weekend.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with stores encouraging Americans to protect their health by getting flu shots. The CDC recommends annual flu vaccinations for almost everyone ages 6 months and up.\n\nYet it still seems fair to question the motivation of the flu shot peddlars. You don\u2019t have to be a cynic to see that retailers promote flu vaccinations and other health-minded initiatives at least partly out of self-interest. When CVS stopped selling tobacco products, it was regarded first and foremost as a win for the health of all Americans, but it has also come to be seen as a savvy business move that\u2019s helped the drugstore chain stand out from competitors in the marketplace and boosted the company\u2019s stock price significantly.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s worth noting that flu vaccinations are very profitable for drug makers and drugstores alike. Sales are increasing rapidly in the age of Obamacare and increased coverage too. Forbes reported in 2013 that the number of flu shots administered by CVS had more than doubled the previous year. For the first quarter of 2014, immunizations at Walgreens were up 34% compared to the previous year. In early September, Meijer Pharmacy announced that it expects to administer 30% more flu shots this season compared to a year ago.\n\nAn increase in flu shots means an increase in shoppers, who are especially likely to browse the aisles and buy stuff when they\u2019re given a coupon for discounted merchandise that day. So in a way, flu shots are not unlike loss leaders or Black Friday doorbuster deals: They\u2019re handy for helping retailers to draw loads of customers inside stores. Only with flu shots, pharmacies aren\u2019t losing money each time one is sold, which is often the case with deeply discounted \u201cdoorbusters.\u201d Drugstores must also like establishing the idea in the minds of consumers that a store that\u2019s good for vaccinations is also probably a solid go-to resource for nearly all of the customer\u2019s health needs, preventive care in particular.\n\nVarying advice on when flu shots should be administered may raise some eyebrows as well. No one gets more than one flu shot (at least not on purpose), so there\u2019s a natural incentive for pharmacies to try to get their needles into the shoulders of shoppers before the competition does. But is getting a flu shot while it\u2019s still summer a good idea?\n\nRite Aid certainly thinks so. \u201cGetting a flu shot as soon as it is available is the single best way to protect yourself and others against the flu,\u201d Robert I. Thompson, Rite Aid executive vice president of pharmacy, said in a press release.\n\n\u201cThe best time to get a flu shot is not October, but actually before or soon after school starts,\u201d Meijer Drug Store Vice President Nat Love said in a statement. \u201cOnce classes begin, kids can literally bring viruses into your home every day, and it becomes difficult to keep influenza from spreading throughout the whole family. There is no expiration date to receiving a flu shot, so the sooner you get your flu shot, the better chance you have of staying healthy.\u201d\n\nAs for the CDC, its recommendations for timing are as follows: \u201cVaccination optimally should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. Health care providers should offer vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available (by October, if possible). Vaccination should be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating.\u201d\n\nThat would seem to settle that. Only it doesn\u2019t because not everyone is on the same page. Dr. Mark Dowell, an infectious disease doctor at Rocky Mountain Infectious Diseases, recently told the Casper Journal (Wyoming) that because a flu shot\u2019s efficacy starts wearing off as early as four months after being injected (perhaps sooner if you\u2019re over 65), you could be asking for trouble by electing to being vaccinated before October 1. \u201cIf you get your flu shot too early,\u201d Dr. Dowell said, \u201cyou may run out of protection before the peak flu season hits in Wyoming.\u201d\n\nIt also seems worth pointing out that, at times, marketers seem guilty of stretching the truth in order to give customers the hard sell on flu vaccinations. \u201cFollowing a second straight severe flu season in the U.S., and one which impacted younger adults in particular with increased hospitalizations, health officials are encouraging early vaccination to help protect against influenza this season,\u201d a Walgreens statement released in August explained. Indeed, the CDC verifies that the flu hit young people particularly badly in 2014. But overall, it was not a \u201csevere flu season\u201d like Walgreens suggests. In fact, despite the brutally cold winter, cough and flu medicine sales from giants like Procter & Gamble were weak, indicating fewer people were sick.\n\nAnd, ostensibly, a big reason fewer people were sick is \u2026 because they\u2019d gotten flu shots!\n\nSo go on and get your flu shot.
