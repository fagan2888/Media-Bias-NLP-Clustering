But we can\u2019t do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past.\u201d\n\nReferring to Hillary Clinton, he continued: \u201cJust yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday. Yesterday is over, and we are never going back.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s directed the same kind of rhetoric toward Jeb Bush back when he was a threat.\n\nSo whether he\u2019s claiming to be the youngest guy in the room or pledging his Gen X bona fides \u2013 like his fondness for Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur, and West Coast hip hop \u2013 Rubio has shrewdly positioned himself as the youthful (for the office, anyway) alternative to the Boomer candidates. (Is a Pavement T-shirt and a crush on Winona Ryder next?)\n\nSome observers have doubted he can get anywhere with his pitch, though. Ana Marie Cox, for instance, called him a \u201cGen-X Fraud.\u201d\n\nTake away Rubio\u2019s biography and look at his positions and he becomes less the voice of his generation and more Benjamin Button. If I told you about a candidate that was anti-marriage equality, anti-immigration reform (for now), anti-pot decriminalization, pro-government surveillance, and in favor of international intervention but against doing something about climate change, what would you guess the candidate\u2019s age to be? On all of those issues, Rubio\u2019s position is not the one shared by most young people. The Guardian dubbed him the \u201cJohn McCain of the millennial set,\u201d which isn\u2019t fair to McCain, who at least has averred that climate change exists.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if his fellow Xers are persuaded. But weirdly, Rubio seems to be getting through to millennials much better than we\u2019d expect, given their reputation for liberalism. An insightful Slate story based on a new NBC News poll describes Rubio but matching Hillary Clinton with voters from 18 to 34 \u2014 despite the tendency of Democrats to capture the young \u2014 and slightly beating her (48 to 45 percent) among all voters.\n\nAs friendly and sane as Rubio might appear on the surface \u2014 considering the current GOP competition \u2014 the idea of him becoming president is chilling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rubio is a severely conservative millennial in a 44-year-old's Gen X clothing", "title": "Dear Generation X: Don\u2019t believe the Marco Rubio hype", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rubio is a severely conservative millennial in a 44-year-old's Gen X clothing", "title": "Dear Generation X: Don\u2019t believe the Marco Rubio hype", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/15/dear_generation_x_dont_believe_the_marco_rubio_hype/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/marco_rubio8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rubio is a severely conservative millennial in a 44-year-old's Gen X clothing", "title": "Dear Generation X: Don\u2019t believe the Marco Rubio hype", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/marco_rubio8.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Timberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Generation X, Marco Rubio", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, Generation X, Marco Rubio, Entertainment NewsAt least since he officially announced his race for the presidency in April, Marco Rubio has been playing himself up as the young guy in the mix.\n\u201cThe time has come for our generation to lead the way towards a new American century,\u201d he said at Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower.\nBut weirdly, Rubio seems to be getting through to millennials much better than we\u2019d expect, given their reputation for liberalism.\nAs friendly and sane as Rubio might appear on the surface \u2014 considering the current GOP competition \u2014 the idea of him becoming president is chilling.\n\u201cBefore us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America."}
