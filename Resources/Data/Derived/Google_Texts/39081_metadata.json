Smith, a USC professor and one of the study\u2019s authors, in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a diversity problem. We have an inclusion crisis.\u201d\n\nThe study, titled the Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, examined the 109 films released by major studios (including art-house divisions) in 2014 and 305 scripted, first-run TV and digital series across 31 networks and streaming services that aired from September 2014 to August 2015. More than 11,000 speaking characters were analyzed for gender, racial and ethnic representation and LGBT status. Some 10,000 directors, writers and show creators were examined, as was the gender of more than 1,500 executives.\n\nThe portrait is one of pervasive underrepresentation, no matter the media platform, from CEOs to minor characters. \u201cOverall, the landscape of media content is still largely whitewashed,\u201d the study concludes.\n\nIn the 414 studied films and series, only a third of speaking characters were female, and only 28.3 percent were from minority groups \u2014 about 10 percent less than the makeup of the U.S. population. Characters 40 years or older skew heavily male across film and TV: 74.3 percent male to 25.7 percent female.\n\nJust 2 percent of speaking characters were LGBT-identified. Among the 11,306 speaking characters studied, only seven were transgendered (and four were from the same series).\n\n\u201cWhen we start to step back to see this larger ecology, I think we see a picture of exclusion,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t match the norms of the population of the United States.\u201d\n\nBehind the camera, the discrepancy is even greater. Directors overall were 87 percent white. Broadcast TV directors (90.4 percent white) were the least diverse.\n\nJust 15.2 percent of directors, 28.9 percent of writers and 22.6 percent of series creators were female. In film, the gender gap is greatest: Only 3.4 percent of the films studied were directed by women, and only two directors out of the 109 were black women: Ava DuVernay (\u201cSelma\u201d) and Amma Asante (\u201cBelle\u201d).\n\nFollowing a request made in May by the American Civil Liberties Union (which cited previous USC studies, as well as those by UCLA and the Directors Guild in claiming women have been \u201csystematically excluded\u201d from directing jobs), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year began investigating gender discrimination in Hollywood.\n\nThe federal investigation is just one element of growing scrutiny for the industry. But for protesters, finding a target for what some consider a systematic problem isn\u2019t easy. Even many of those, like Spike Lee, who have criticized the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, have insisted the issue goes far deeper than Oscar nominees. When academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs recently announced dramatic steps to diversify the overwhelmingly white and male film academy, she said: \u201cThe academy is going to lead, and not wait for the industry to catch up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Damning study finds a \u2018whitewashed\u2019 Hollywood", "title": "Damning study finds a \u2018whitewashed\u2019 Hollywood", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Damning study finds a \u2018whitewashed\u2019 Hollywood", "title": "Damning study finds a \u2018whitewashed\u2019 Hollywood", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/22/damning_study_finds_a_whitewashed_hollywood/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/entertainment-equality-study.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Damning study finds a \u2018whitewashed\u2019 Hollywood", "title": "Damning study finds a \u2018whitewashed\u2019 Hollywood", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/entertainment-equality-study.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jake Coyle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Among the 11,306 speaking characters studied, only seven were transgendered (and four were from the same series).\nMore than 11,000 speaking characters were analyzed for gender, racial and ethnic representation and LGBT status.\nBroadcast TV directors (90.4 percent white) were the least diverse.\nJust 2 percent of speaking characters were LGBT-identified.\n\u201cOverall, the landscape of media content is still largely whitewashed,\u201d the study concludes."}
