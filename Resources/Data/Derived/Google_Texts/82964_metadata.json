WBA, -1.09% will become the first retailer to launch seamless loyalty-program integration with Apple Pay AAPL, +0.79% the retailer said Thursday. Members of Walgreens' Balance Rewards program, which has more than 85 million active members, will be able to use Apple Pay to redeem loyalty points, just as they would if they were using their regular Walgreen rewards card, by adding their loyalty account to their Apple Wallet.

Earlier this year, Apple announced plans to make its mobile payment platform compatible with retail store-branded payment and loyalty cards, which included compatibility with cards from Walgreens and Dunkin Donuts.
