Have we learned much? No.\n\n\n\nCollege has become a scam.\n\n\n\nSome students benefit: those with full scholarships and/or rich parents so they don\u2019t go deep into debt, those who love learning for its own sake and land jobs in academia and those who get jobs that require a college credential.\n\n..\n\nBut that\u2019s not most students.\n\n\n\nHalf today\u2019s recent grads work in jobs that don\u2019t require degrees. Eighty thousand of America\u2019s bartenders have bachelor\u2019s degrees.\n\n\n\nPoliticians such as Hillary Clinton promote college by claiming that over a lifetime, college graduates \u201cearn $1 million more.\u201d That statistic is true but utterly misleading. People who go to college are different. They\u2019re more likely to have been raised by two parents. They did better in high school. They\u2019d make more money even if they never went go to college.\n\n..\n\nEconomist Bryan Caplan argues that there isn\u2019t much evidence that college grads are paid more because they learned anything at college that is valuable to their jobs.\n\n\n\nGetting into elite universities and graduating from them is mostly a \u201csignaling\u201d device, he says. It tells employers you\u2019re a smart person, so employers can begin teaching you things you really need to know. Employers, not the colleges, turn out to be the ones making students valuable contributors.\n\n..\n\nThis suggests college is more like a hurdle than an investment. It would be better if companies found cheaper ways to screen for talent than four years of college.\n\n\n\nMost of America\u2019s prestigious universities started out as training centers for the priesthood and ways of confirming your status as part of the upper crust. In many cases, that\u2019s still true today. Taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be forced to subsidize that. But we are.\n\n..\n\nNow President Obama proposes spending more of your money on \u201cfree community college.\u201d Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders goes further, proposing \u201cfree tuition\u201d at four-year public colleges.\n\n..\n\nOf course, \u201cfree\u201d just means taxpayers are forced to pay.\n\n\n\nThis is nuts. When government subsidizes services, people supplying those services get wasteful. Colleges now spend millions on manicured lawns and fancy gyms.\n\n..\n\nA University of Missouri admissions officer bragged to my TV show crew about the university\u2019s \u201cday spa\u201d and said when it comes to recruiting students, \u201cmore important than reading, writing and arithmetic\u201d is giving \u201cour Tigers spring break every time they step into the student recreation complex.\u201dI\u2019m happy that Missouri\u2019s students like their luxurious gym, but I don\u2019t want to help pay for it. If the school thinks its \u201cday spa\u201d is crucial for recruiting, let them sucker their own alumni into making voluntary contributions for it. Leave taxpayers alone.Government subsidies encourage students who don\u2019t belong in college to go anyway. Many don\u2019t graduate, feel bad about themselves and end up deep in debt. The subsidies also invite schools to increase the cost of tuition.\n\n..\n\nDemocrats complained we need Obamacare because health care costs \u201cwere skyrocketing.\u201d But while the cost of health care rose 296 percent over the past 30 years, college tuition rose 553 percent. College is now a grotesque spending bubble, funded by government, that\u2019s about to burst.\n\n..\n\nLaw professor Glenn Reynolds, author of \u201cThe Education Apocalypse,\u201d writes, \u201cThe rapid increase in college tuition began just about exactly the time the federal government started helping to subsidize college ... (Y)ou don\u2019t want to engage in subsidies that make universities more bloated and more inefficient.\u201d\n\n..\n\nBut that\u2019s what Obama and Sanders propose to do.\n\n\n\nA more compassionate move would be to warn people that college is not as valuable as colleges advertise themselves to be.\n\n\n\nPayPal co-founder Peter Thiel encourages students to escape the college trap by paying them $100,000 not to go to college and instead to found their own capitalist ventures.\n\n..\n\nIf we really want to build a better future and not just keep going through the same old motions, experiments like that are a much smarter idea than throwing more money at the college bubble.\n\n\n\nJohn Stossel is host of \u201cStossel\u201d on Fox News and author of \u201cNo They Can\u2019t! Why Government Fails, but Individuals Succeed.\u201d\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why go to college these days?", "title": "John Stossel: College has become a big, costly scam | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Why go to college these days?", "title": "John Stossel: College has become a big, costly scam | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150529/OPINION02/150529106/0/search", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150529/OPINION02/150529106/AR/0/AR-150529106.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Columns", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Business, Politics, Social issues, University, John Stossel,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-05-29 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "Why go to college these days?", "title": "John Stossel: College has become a big, costly scam | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150529/OPINION02/150529106/0/search", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150529/OPINION02/150529106/AR/0/AR-150529106.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "John Stossel: College has become a big, costly scamIT\u2019S GRADUATION time!\nJohn Stossel is host of \u201cStossel\u201d on Fox News and author of \u201cNo They Can\u2019t!\nEmployers, not the colleges, turn out to be the ones making students valuable contributors.\n..Democrats complained we need Obamacare because health care costs \u201cwere skyrocketing.\u201d But while the cost of health care rose 296 percent over the past 30 years, college tuition rose 553 percent.\nLeave taxpayers alone.Government subsidies encourage students who don\u2019t belong in college to go anyway."}
