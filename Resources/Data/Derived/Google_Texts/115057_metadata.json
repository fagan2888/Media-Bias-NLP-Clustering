That is to say, the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d is really just a euphemism for the power to shut down the government, or part of the government. Senate Republicans have made it crystal clear that they refuse to exercise that power.\n\nIn which case, what\u2019s left?\n\nMcConnell did not provide a path forward Thursday in the likely case that the House bill fails. Passing the House bill would \u201cbe our first choice,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not able to do that, then we\u2019ll let you know what\u2019s next.\u201d\u2026 Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune declined to say Thursday whether the upper chamber would pass a clean funding bill for the department if the House legislation stalls in the Senate, but added: \u201cWe recognize the important role that the Department of Homeland Security plays in this country.\u201d\u2026 Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, outlined the debate ahead of Thursday afternoon\u2019s panel. \u201cNone of us want to see DHS face any kind of a shutdown threat. Too important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also want to make sure we have done all we can to get the president to work with us rather than go around Congress and around the American people through his executive actions.\u201d\n\nIf you won\u2019t take Thune\u2019s and Portman\u2019s words for it, just listen to John Cornyn, McConnell\u2019s top deputy in the Senate:\n\n\u201cThe expectation by the rank and file in the House is it\u2019s not going to come back even remotely similar to what we sent over there. And there is a real reticence by members of our conference to allow the funding to lapse,\u201d [one House Republican] lawmaker added\u2026 \u201cNo more drama associated with shutting down, for example, the Department of Homeland Security. That\u2019s off the table,\u201d Cornyn told reporters. \u201cUnder no circumstances will we see any shutdowns,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s that. Even if the bill passes the Senate, it\u2019s a mortal lock that Obama will veto it. Now here\u2019s the Senate majority whip all but telling you that if that happens, if O forces the GOP to decide between a DHS shutdown and a \u201cclean\u201d bill that funds Homeland Security with no concessions whatsoever on amnesty \u2014 a total capitulation by Republicans \u2014 they\u2019ll choose the latter. All of this was entirely foreseeable when the GOP passed the \u201ccromnibus,\u201d setting up a showdown with the White House on DHS funding. McConnell and Cornyn have spent the two months since election day telling every reporter who\u2019ll listen that job one for the new Senate majority is showing Americans it can govern. No more shutdowns, no more debt-ceiling standoffs. Message: It\u2019s safe to elect a Republican president in 2016 and let the GOP control all of government. So what does the House do with the last major bill of the lame-duck session? They set up a shutdown-or-bust choice for the party on amnesty, an issue that\u2019s laser-hot with their own base. Mystifying.\n\nLet me repeat a prediction I made a few weeks ago, then: Precisely because the base is paying close attention, they won\u2019t settle for a \u201cclean\u201d funding bill either. There\u2019s a \u201csecurity first\u201d bill coming on immigration reform. The only question is when.\n\nLeaders have tried to reassure colleagues worried about illegal immigration by pledging action on legislation to secure the border and strengthen enforcement policies against illegal residents. \u201cStep 1 is to pass pretty much all of [Homeland Security Committee Chairman] Mike McCaul\u2019s [R-Texas] border security bill. That\u2019s the first step we\u2019ll take,\u201d said Rep. Kenny Marchant (R-Texas).\n\nMcConnell might get 60 votes for a security bill. Centrist Dems like Claire McCaskill fear a backlash from their party if they humiliate Obama by voting against amnesty, but security at the border and in the interior U.S. is a regular feature of the comprehensive immigration reform bills that Democrats routinely vote for. They won\u2019t be crossing O by supporting it. They will be reducing their party\u2019s leverage over comprehensive reform by supporting only the Republican-favored security half of it, but that matters less after Obama\u2019s amnesty than it used to do. The legalization half of comprehensive reform has already been enacted: The GOP, by refusing to shut down DHS, will be effectively agreeing to legalization via executive order. That\u2019s not a perfect deal for Democrats \u2014 a \u201csecurity first\u201d bill will have the force of statutory law whereas O\u2019s legalization order could be undone by the next president \u2014 but everyone understands at this point, I think, that no successor from either party is going to undo O\u2019s order. The politics are too tough. So yeah, McConnell might well get 60 for \u201csecurity first.\u201d The question is, would Obama sign a bill like that? And if he won\u2019t, knowing that the GOP has essentially forfeited its power of the purse by forfeiting their power to shut down parts of the government, what leverage will they have to force him to sign?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re going try to pass it.
