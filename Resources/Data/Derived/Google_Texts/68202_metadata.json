A stray bullet struck the family's Lincoln Sedan, shattering the back window, and hitting Mina, who was strapped into a baby seat in the back.\n\nThe child was struck with the bullet, and glass cut him under his eye.\n\n\"He got hurt in his face, and his left (sic) here bleeding,\" said the baby's uncle, Michael Beshay.\n\nMichael was at the scene hours later, cleaning up his brother's car, a car that is now part of an unimaginable crime scene.\n\nOfficials say it appears a bullet fragment became lodged in the baby's right cheek. The baby's uncle says he got a frantic call from his brother after the infant was shot. Mina's 5-year-old sister was also in the car at the time.\n\nJersey City Police and emergency units spent hours combing the area for clues, and interviewing witnesses. Officials say so far witnesses have been uncooperative.\n\nMina was released from surgery on Saturday night, and is expected to be okay.\n\nOfficials say Mina was an unintended target. Detectives are still searching for the shooter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Family members say a New Jersey toddler struck in the face by a stray bullet while sitting in his family's parked car has undergone surgery and is expected to recover fully.", "language": "english", "author": "CeFaan Kim", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/Family-Toddler-struck-by-stray-bullet-expected-to-recover-363589801.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Mena+Beshay+.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Family members say a New Jersey toddler struck in the face by a stray bullet while sitting in his family's parked car has undergone surgery and is expected to recover fully.", "title": "Family: Toddler struck by stray bullet expected to recover"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Family members say a New Jersey toddler struck in the face by a stray bullet while sitting in his family's parked car has undergone surgery and is expected to recover fully.", "title": "Family: Toddler struck by stray bullet expected to recover", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/Family-Toddler-struck-by-stray-bullet-expected-to-recover-363589801.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Mena+Beshay+.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Family: Toddler struck by stray bullet expected to recover", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Family Toddler struck by stray"}, "article_summary": "A stray bullet struck the family's Lincoln Sedan, shattering the back window, and hitting Mina, who was strapped into a baby seat in the back.\nThe baby's uncle says he got a frantic call from his brother after the infant was shot.\nOfficials say Mina was an unintended target.\n\"He got hurt in his face, and his left (sic) here bleeding,\" said the baby's uncle, Michael Beshay.\nThe child was struck with the bullet, and glass cut him under his eye."}
