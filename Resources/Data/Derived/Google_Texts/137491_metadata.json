New York plays an American League style of baseball. The Mets tied for third in the NL in home runs (177) but ranked last in stolen bases (15).\n\nThe Kansas City Royals, the darlings from the heartland, have a style that would play well in the NL. The contact-hitting, base-stealing Royals ranked second in the AL in stolen bases (104) but just 14th in home runs (139).\n\nWhile the Mets\u2019 strength comes from their starting pitching, Kansas City counters with a nearly impenetrable bullpen.\n\nWhat the clubs share is a nearly three-decade championship drought and some history. This is the first World Series between franchises born in the expansion-era 1960s.\n\nThese clubs have been without a World Series title since the mid-1980s. The Royals beat the St. Louis Cardinals in 1985, and the Mets stunned the Boston Red Sox in 1986.\n\nKansas City returns to the World Series after falling in seven games to the San Francisco Giants last year. The Mets are making their first appearance since 2000, when they lost 4-1 in the Subway Series against the Yankees.\n\nGame 1 of the 2015 World Series starts at 6:07 p.m. MDT on Tuesday at Kansas City\u2019s Kauffman Stadium.\n\nFollowing are three keys to this year\u2019s Fall Classic:\n\nDynamic starters vs. contact hitters\n\nFrom top to bottom, the Mets\u2019 powerful rotation is the best in the majors. If their starters can pitch deep into games and protect a fragile bullpen, the Mets have an edge in the World Series.\n\nNew York has three starters whose fastballs averaged at least 95 mph during the regular season. Among starters with at least 150 innings pitched, Noah Syndergaard ranked No. 1 overall at 97.1 mph, with Matt Harvey (95.9 mph, fourth) and Jacob deGrom (95.0 mph, ninth) close behind.\n\nMets pitchers can overpower a lineup, but they\u2019re facing a Royals team that gets on base and causes damage. No team in the majors came close to striking out as little as the Royals. They ranked 30th in baseball with 973 strikeouts, with Atlanta next on the list, striking out 1,107 times.\n\nNumbers Game\n\n\u2022 Kansas City hitters had the highest contact rate in the majors this season at 81.9 percent.\n\n\u2022 Mets starters had the best strikeout-to-walk rate (4.18) in the majors.\n\nStingy relievers vs. big bats\n\nRoyals relievers were far from perfect in the American League Championship Series against Toronto. For example, Kelvin Herrera gave up a huge, three-run double to Troy Tulowitzki in Game 5, and Ryan Madson served up a game-tying, two-run blast to Jose Bautista in Game 6.\n\nHowever, over the long haul, K.C.\u2019s hard-throwing trio at the back of the bullpen \u2014 Wade Davis, Luke Hochevar and Herrera \u2014 was tough to crack. The trio has allowed one earned run in 21 innings this postseason for a 0.43 ERA. Basically, opponents have to take the lead in the first six innings or face defeat.\n\nBut Mets hitters can strike at any time, especially sizzling second baseman Daniel Murphy, who has hit a home run in a record six consecutive playoff games. The addition of outfielder Yoenis Cespedes at the trade deadline gave the Mets\u2019 offense a boost. New York finished third in the major leagues in scoring and fourth in OPS after the all-star break.\n\nNumbers Game\n\n\u2022 Royals relievers struck out more batters (59) in 41 innings this postseason than did Kansas City starters (55) in 55 innings.\n\n\u2022 Murphy has hit .421, with a 1.026 slugging percentage, 11 runs scored and 11 RBIs, in the postseason.\n\nExperience vs. momentum\n\nThe Royals are back in the World Series after beating powerful Toronto in six tough games. After taking the Giants to seven games in last season\u2019s World Series, the Royals are a seasoned bunch.\n\nMets manager Terry Collins is in his first World Series, and so are most of his players. Indeed, few of them had played in a postseason game until this year. The Royals have eight regular players who have participated in a World Series, while only Curtis Granderson has World Series experience among the Mets\u2019 regulars.\n\nBut the Mets have proven themselves in the playoffs. They beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in an NLDS, besting ace Zack Greinke, at Dodger Stadium, in Game 5. Then the Mets swept the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS, never trailing in the series.\n\nThe downside, however, is the Mets\u2019 long layoff. They will have had five days off between the NLCS and the World Series. That\u2019s not good for New York, because five of the last six teams with five or more days off went on to lose the World Series.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if every team\u2019s the same,\u201d Collins told reporters. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re going to ride that pitching. And by the way, our pitching right now could use a blow, because we\u2019re pushing them pretty hard. I\u2019m glad our starters are going to get an extra day.\u201d\n\nNumbers Game\n\n\u2022 In games at Kauffman Stadium, the Royals will have Kendrys Morales as the designated hitter. He hit 22 homers and drove in 106 runs in the regular season.\n\n\u2022 The Mets will probably use a Michael Cuddyer /Kelly Johnson platoon at DH. The duo combined for 24 homers and 88 RBIs, including Johnson\u2019s time with the Braves earlier in the season.\n\nSaunders\u2019 prediction: Royals in seven games", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New York Mets vs. Kansas City Royals a classic World Series matchup", "title": "New York Mets vs. Kansas City Royals a classic World Series matchup", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/24/new-york-mets-vs-kansas-city-royals-a-classic-world-series-matchup/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151024__BN20151025_C3_BNSP25BBOWORLDSERIES1p3.jpg", "height": 516}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151024__BN20151025_C3_BNSP25BBOWORLDSERIES1p3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T19:46:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:46:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Royals have eight regular players who have participated in a World Series, while only Curtis Granderson has World Series experience among the Mets\u2019 regulars.\nThe contrast is stark and striking, and it holds the promise of a classic World Series.\nThe New York Mets, the boys from the Big Apple, won the National League pennant with powerful starting pitching and timely slugging.\nKansas City returns to the World Series after falling in seven games to the San Francisco Giants last year.\nNumbers Game\u2022 Kansas City hitters had the highest contact rate in the majors this season at 81.9 percent."}
