Google would also spend about $30 million for a 1.5% stake in Branson\u2019s company.\n\nThe news comes three days after Google bought satellite startup Skybox Imaging for $500 million, in an effort to gain more satellite technology. Google also recently devoted at least $1 billion to develop a satellite program which through the projected lunch of 180 small low Earth satellites would provide web access to areas of the world that currently have little or no Internet access.\n\nFacebook (FB) is another company who has also been rumored to be looking into providing wireless Internet access in remote areas. In March, the social networking giant spent $20 million on Ascenta, a U.K.-based aerospace firm which makes its own solar-powered unmanned aircrafts. Obviously, extending web access to the billions of people who do not currently have it contains powerful commercial incentives for both companies since the vast majority of their earnings comes from Web search advertising, which should only increase as web access becomes more widespread.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Wall Street Pit", "description": "Search giant Google (GOOGL) is reportedly in \u201cadvanced talks\u201d to take a stake in Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson\u2019s $2 billion ...", "title": "Google (GOOGL) in \u201cAdvanced Talks\u201d To Take Virgin Galactic Stake", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wallstreetpit.com/wp-content/uploads/news/virgin-galactic.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-14T16:47:29+00:00", "url": "http://wallstreetpit.com/104328-google-googl-in-advanced-talks-to-take-virgin-galactic-stake/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wallstreetpit", "section": "Business", "tag": "GOOGL", "published_time": "2014-06-14T15:58:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-14T16:47:29+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Search giant Google (GOOGL) is reportedly in \u201cadvanced talks\u201d to take a stake in Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson\u2019s $2 billion ...", "title": "Google (GOOGL) in \u201cAdvanced Talks\u201d To Take Virgin Galactic Stake", "image": "http://wallstreetpit.com/wp-content/uploads/news/virgin-galactic.jpg", "creator": "@wallstreetpit", "site": "@wallstreetpit", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd258c\"", "article_summary": "Search giant Google (GOOGL) is reportedly in \u201cadvanced talks\u201d to take a stake in Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson\u2019s $2 billion spaceflight company, Sky News reported.\nObviously, extending web access to the billions of people who do not currently have it contains powerful commercial incentives for both companies since the vast majority of their earnings comes from Web search advertising, which should only increase as web access becomes more widespread.\nThe news comes three days after Google bought satellite startup Skybox Imaging for $500 million, in an effort to gain more satellite technology.\nGoogle would also spend about $30 million for a 1.5% stake in Branson\u2019s company.\nFacebook (FB) is another company who has also been rumored to be looking into providing wireless Internet access in remote areas."}
