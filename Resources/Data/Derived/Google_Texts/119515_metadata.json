The math and English standards differ from state to state and\u2014though politicians are increasingly fond of claiming otherwise\u2014don\u2019t define curriculum, but rather a certain set of skills kids should master grade by grade. For the math standards, that means being able to \u201cuse addition and subtraction within 20\u201d by first grade and to \u201cfind all factor pairs for a whole number in the range 1-100\u201d by fourth. The other main category of standards, English Language Arts, focuses broadly on teaching kids more sophisticated reading-comprehension skills to prepare them for the \u201cdemands of college, career, and life.\u201d School districts and teachers decide for themselves how to implement these standards. Yet Common Core didn\u2019t stay innocuous for very long.\n\nThe Obama administration prioritized Common Core with its Race to the Top incentives, offering states that adopted the standards preference in their bid for extra money. While few Republican leaders objected to this initiative at the time, in recent years conservatives\u2014even, or especially, the same ones who once supported the standards\u2014have come to demonize Common Core as an egregious example of federal overreach. States and local school districts should be responsible for developing their own curriculum, this argument runs, not Washington. It\u2019s yet another variation of the right\u2019s tired \u201cabolish the Department of Education\u201d rhetoric, though particularly incoherent since Common Core has exactly no bearing on how curriculum is developed or implemented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential contenders still for the most part support Common Core; in April, Hillary Clinton called the politics that have sprung up around the standards \u201creally unfortunate\u201d and \u201cvery painful, because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort\u2014it was actually nonpartisan.\u201d But on the Republican side, only two of the candidates still dare affirm the standards. And while a handful of others never liked Common Core, many clumsily withdrew their support when the political tides turned. Here\u2019s where all the GOP candidates currently stand.\n\nThe Haters Who Always Hated\n\nSome of the GOP contenders have been dead-set against the very notion of Common Core from the beginning, most notably former Texas Gov. and zombie candidate Rick Perry, who was so appalled by the potential takeover of Texas\u2019 high educational standards that he refused even to compete for the Race to the Top funds tied to Common Core adoption. Under Perry, Texas was also one of only two states that refused to collaborate on the curriculum standards in the first place.\n\nPhoto by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nAnother Texas politician, Sen. Ted Cruz, is almost as passionately opposed to Common Core as to Obamacare: \u201cInstead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through Common Core,\u201d he said in his lofty announcement of candidacy at Liberty University in March, \u201cimagine repealing every word of Common Core.\u201d (Except\u2014another Lone Star \u201coops\u201d\u2014you can\u2019t actually repeal Common Core, because it\u2019s not a law.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul is another long shot who never dug Common Core much. In a January email to supporters (subject heading: \u201cRotten to the Core\u201d) he blasted the standards, somewhat incomprehensibly, as being rife with \u201canti-American propaganda, revisionist history that ignores the faith of our Founders and data-tracking of students from kindergarten on.\u201d Paul\u2019s opposition to Common Core is certainly consistent with his less-is-more take on government, and he has repeatedly vowed to obliterate the Department of Education: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d notice if the whole department was gone tomorrow,\u201d he famously said last year.\n\nAnd though Marco Rubio had previously shown support for higher standards, the Florida senator came out against Common Core relatively early, saying in 2013 that even if they started out \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d the standards now represent a bid \u201cto turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board.\u201d\n\nThe 180-ers\n\nThis second group of Republican candidates supported Common Core when it was advantageous to do so but have since reversed their positions with varying degrees of hypocrisy. Take New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who, at a KIPP Charter School conference in August 2013, declared, in his typical balls-out way,\n\nWe\u2019re doing Common Core in New Jersey and we\u2019re going to continue. And this is one of those areas where I\u2019ve agreed more with the president than not, and with Secretary [Arne] Duncan. \u2026 I think that part of the Republican opposition that you\u2019ll see in some corners in Congress is a reaction\u2014that knee-jerk reaction that\u2019s happening in Washington right now\u2014that if the president likes something, then the Republicans in Congress don\u2019t and if the Republicans like something, then the president doesn\u2019t. It is this mind-set in D.C. right now that says we have to be at war constantly. I just don\u2019t buy that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSounds reasonable enough. Fast-forward a little less than two years and Christie is talking about Common Core like a broken-down Dodge Dart. \u201cIt\u2019s now been five years since Common Core was adopted. And the truth is that it\u2019s simply not working,\u201d he said, and: \u201cInstead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating new ones.\u201d Even more emphatically, in June, Christie said, \u201cWe must reject federal control of our education and return it to parents and teachers. We need to take it out of the cubicles of Washington, D.C., where it was placed by the Obama administration and return it to the neighborhoods of New Jersey.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal also lands in the flip-flopper category. After showing initial support for Common Core\u2014maintaining his enthusiasm for a full year after his enthusiastic prediction, in January 2012, that the standards \u201cwill raise expectations for every child\u201d\u2014Jindal did an about-face in 2014 and sued the federal government over an \u201cattempt by the executive branch to implement national education reform far beyond the intentions of Congress.\u201d (The Louisiana Board of Education sued the governor right back.)\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, while he never displayed as much outright enthusiasm as his colleagues in New Jersey and Louisiana, by no means objected to the standards that were already in place when he took office as governor in 2011. His first budget recommended testing that would assess \u201cmastery of Common Core Standards,\u201d and Wisconsin became one of the first states to adopt Common Core. But by early 2014, Walker was \u201crevisiting\u201d the standards, and six months after that he made an even more dramatic reversal with a press release that \u201ccall[ed] on the members of the State Legislature to pass a bill in early January to repeal Common Core and replace it with standards set by people in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, though he had already left office to professionally run for president by the time Common Core came on the scene, once supported the standards so vigorously that he wrote a letter to the Oklahoma state Legislature in 2013:\n\nThese standards, known as Common Core State Standards, have been near and dear to my heart since I served as Governor of your neighboring state of Arkansas. And it\u2019s disturbing to me there have been criticisms of these standards directed by other conservatives including the RNC. The truth of the matter is, these criticisms are short-sighted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter a growing backlash from his Tea Partier base, Huckabee repudiated the standards, colorfully observing, at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January 2015, \u201cFolks, what Common Core may have originally been was a governor-controlled states initiative to keep the fickle federal fingers of fate off of education. It has morphed into a frankenstandard that nobody, including me, can support.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s campaign website drives the point home: \u201cI also oppose Common Core and believe we should abolish the federal department of education. We must kill Common Core and restore common sense.\u201d\n\nThe Late-to-the-Partiers\n\nAnd then there are the Republicans who aren\u2019t actually in charge of any body politic who had no reason to go on the record about Common Core back when politicians on both sides of the aisle actually thought uniform learning benchmarks weren\u2019t a half-bad idea. Donald Trump, on the Hugh Hewitt Show in February, answered a question about Common Core by saying,\n\nTrump: Well, first of all, I think it\u2019s going to kill [Jeb] Bush, and I think that education should be local, absolutely. I think that for people in Washington to be setting curriculum and to be setting all sorts of standards for people living in Iowa and other places is ridiculous.\n\nHewitt: Why is it going to kill Bush?\n\nTrump: Because I think people don\u2019t want to have somebody from Washington looking down and saying this is what you\u2019re going to be studying.\n\nHewitt: But do you think he\u2019s responsible for that part of it?\n\nTrump: No, but he\u2019s responsible for supporting it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn July, the Donald turned it up a notch, as he is wont to do, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s pathetic what\u2019s going on, [Bush\u2019s] stance on Common Core. He\u2019s in favor of Washington educating your children.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina offered a new (and I have to say not unintelligent) spin on Common Core opposition at the education summit in New Hampshire in August:\n\nCommon Core may have started out as a set of standards, but what it\u2019s turned into is a program that honestly is being overly influenced by companies that have something to gain, testing companies and textbook companies, and it\u2019s becoming a set of standards, not on what a kid has to learn but instead on how a teacher has to teach and how a student should learn, and that kind of standardization is always going to drive achievement down, not up.\n\nThe Kinda-Sorta Supporters\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat leaves just two Republican candidates standing on Common Core, even if both increasingly shy away from using those two words in that order: Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nKasich has called the right-wing opposition to Common Core \u201chysteria,\u201d according to the Blaze.\n\nWhen you study the issue, you separate the hysteria from the reality. \u2026 We have carried it out. We have higher standards. We want our kids to perform better and do better. \u2026 The standards are determined by our local school boards. There is total local control.\n\nThat same month, January 2015, Kasich elaborated on Fox News:\n\nThe Common Core was written by state education superintendents and local principals. In my state of Ohio, we want higher standards for our children, and those standards are set and the curriculum is set by local school boards. Barack Obama doesn't set it, the state of Ohio doesn't set it. It is local school boards driving better education, higher standards, created by local school boards. I've asked the Republican governors who have complained about this to tell me where I'm wrong, and guess what, silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThough in more recent months he has acknowledged that the subject has become \u201cradioactive,\u201d Kasich hasn\u2019t backed down from his support. At the education summit last week, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to change my position because there\u2019s four people in the front row yelling at me.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Jonathan Alcorn/Getty Images\n\nJeb Bush was an even more vociferous supporter before Republicans came out against the standards. In 2013, he said,\n\nThese standards, the Common Core State Standards, are clear and straightforward. They will allow for more innovation in the classroom, less regulation, they'll equip students to compete with their peers across the globe. Do not pull back. Please do not pull back from high, lofty standards.\n\nThis May, Bush remained steadfast in his support: \u201cBecause people have a different view of what Common Core is, am I supposed to back away from something that I know works?\u201d\n\nThis is still pretty much Bush\u2019s position, though he is now more likely to emphasize that these standards are locally derived than their content. In August, he said: \u201cThe term \u2018Common Core\u2019 is so darn poisonous, I don\u2019t even know what it means. I\u2019m for higher standards\u2014state-created, locally implemented\u2014where the federal government has no role in the creation of standards, content, or curriculum.\u201d\n\nBush continues to drive this point home, decoupling the idea of high standards from the \u201cpoisonous\u201d term to the greatest extent possible. At the summit in New Hampshire, he said, \u201cIf people don\u2019t like Common Core, fine. Just make sure your standards are much higher than the ones you had before. We can\u2019t keep dumbing down standards.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Wondering where the GOP candidates stand\u2014or used to stand\u2014on the Common Core?", "sailthru.author": "Laura Moser", "description": "When first developed by 48 states and the District of Columbia in 2009, the Common Core State Standards appeared to be an innocuous bipartisan effort b ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "When first developed by 48 states and the District of Columbia in 2009, the Common Core State Standards appeared to be an innocuous bipartisan effort b ...", "title": "What the GOP Candidates Said About Common Core Before Hating Common Core Was Cool", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/schooled/2015/09/08/common_core_and_the_republican_primary_what_the_gop_candidates_said_before.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/schooled/2015/09/08/common_core_and_the_republican_primary_what_the_gop_candidates_said_before/484797712-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-greets.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When first developed by 48 states and the District of Columbia in 2009, the Common Core State Standards appeared to be an innocuous bipartisan effort b ...", "title": "What the GOP Candidates Said About Common Core Before Hating Common Core Was Cool", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/schooled/2015/09/08/common_core_and_the_republican_primary_what_the_gop_candidates_said_before.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/schooled/2015/09/08/common_core_and_the_republican_primary_what_the_gop_candidates_said_before/484797712-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-greets.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-08T12:50:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "What the GOP Candidates Said About Common Core Before Hating Common Core Was Cool", "sailthru.headline": "The Common Core Guide to the Republican Primary", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"What the GOP Candidates Said About Common Core Before Hating Common Core Was Cool\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/schooled/2015/09/08/common_core_and_the_republican_primary_what_the_gop_candidates_said_before.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/schooled/2015/09/08/common_core_and_the_republican_primary_what_the_gop_candidates_said_before/484797712-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-greets.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"247150908001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-08T12:50:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Life\",\n  \"author\": \"Laura Moser\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"common core\",\n    \"john kasich\",\n    \"chris christie\",\n    \"bobby jindal\",\n    \"k-12\",\n    \"donald trump\",\n    \"jeb bush\",\n    \"department of education\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "What the GOP candidates said about common core before hating Common Core was cool:", "keywords": "Common Core, Republican Primary, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, GOP, Department of Education, Donald Trump", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "Common Core, Republican Primary, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, GOP, Department of Education, Donald Trump", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "When first developed by 48 states and the District of Columbia in 2009, the Common Core State Standards appeared to be an innocuous bipartisan effort b ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/schooled/2015/09/08/common_core_and_the_republican_primary_what_the_gop_candidates_said_before/484797712-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-greets.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38db\"", "article_summary": "His first budget recommended testing that would assess \u201cmastery of Common Core Standards,\u201d and Wisconsin became one of the first states to adopt Common Core.\nPhoto by Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesAnother Texas politician, Sen.
