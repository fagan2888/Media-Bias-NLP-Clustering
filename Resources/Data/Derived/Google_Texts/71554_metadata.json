Yet most of the liberal pundits and legislators speaking for socioeconomically disadvantaged kids in school have no idea what it\u2019s like to be one. As a recent grad from that demographic, I have three reasons Obamacare hurts low-income college students:\n\n1. The Individual Mandate is Not Compatible with Financial Aid\n\nFinancial aid is based on the difference between an individual\u2019s estimated family contribution (EFC) and cost of attendance (COA). However, the cost of health insurance is rarely considered part of COA. This means kids who have a very low EFC and can barely afford school have to pay insurance premiums thanks to the individual mandate.\n\nThose who say the fee will not apply to struggling students are the most out-of-touch. Not only are scholarship grants over the COA considered taxable income, but the poorest often work while in school and make enough money to be slammed by the fee. The individual mandate was already implemented years ago at most public and private universities \u2013 it has already done damage to the most financially needy students.\n\n2. Keeping Parents\u2019 Plans Until Age 26 Hurts the Poor\n\nMost Supporters claim Obamacare will increase competition among insurance companies to provide low-cost plans to the poor who were suffering before\u2014a true bleeding-heart story. Yet the provision that children are covered by their parents\u2019 plan until age 26 hurts the poor the most.\n\nThe worst off parents don\u2019t have health insurance and will likely opt to pay the $95 fee. As a result, the rich kids will relax and have several years out of college to find a job with benefits while the poor kids (whom Obamacare claims to help the most) will be forced to sign up for whatever plans are left over before the higher $695 fee hits.\n\n3. The Economic Fallout Makes College Less Valuable\n\nFor most wealthy families, college is a given. Poor families, however, often send their children to college with great sacrifice \u2013 even if the student earns a full ride there are difficulties: perhaps the student was expected to work in the family business, look after many siblings, or add to the household income. This is especially true for first-generation students. It is difficult, but it is also a time-honored part of the American Dream.\n\nThe American Dream is at stake. If Obamacare continues to cause employers to avoid hiring the 50th worker and cut back on employment hours, then the prospects for college graduates will only go from bleak to worse. A low-income student may weigh the odds and simply decide it\u2019s not worth it anymore.", "article_metadata": {"description": "So they say Obamacare helps poor students?
