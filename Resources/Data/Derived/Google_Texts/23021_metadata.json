But a pilot program launched at Juravinski Hospital in Ontario, Canada, eliminates the red tape to help patients reunite with their pets. Zachary's Paws for Healing is the first program of its kind in Canada. Advocates say the program helps patients recover because they remember what's waiting for them at home and the visits help pets know that their humans are doing well. In addition to the companion pet visits, the program also offers patients foster care for their pets on a case-by-case basis .Program founder Donna Jenkins hopes the success of the program will inspire other Canadian and U.S. hospitals to launch similar initiatives.
