Since he first began working in Pittsburgh, his practice has doubled, and with the implementation of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, the uptake has grown even faster\n\nThe law, commonly called Obamacare, increased transgender Americans\u2019 access to care they weren\u2019t able to receive before \u2013 including routine tests, hormone therapy, mental health and substance abuse services.\n\nIt\u2019s a far-cry from where things were.\n\nBeing transgender, recognized as \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d by the psychiatric community, was once labeled as a pre-existing condition by insurance companies, who would raise premiums on patients or deny them coverage. They also would broadly link various medical conditions to being transgender, refusing reimbursement.\n\nBurch says he\u2019s heard horror stories from patients about past experiences they have had with doctors. One patient was told to leave a doctor\u2019s office.\n\n[READ: Loopholes Remain in Obamacare Birth Control Coverage]\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how to help people like you,\u201d he says, recalling the patient\u2019s account.\n\nBut while the health care law has improved access for transgender people, it still is not officially interpreted under national civil rights statutes to cover much of the care advocates hope it eventually will. Most notably, the government has yet to write new provisions that could classify as discrimination a provider\u2019s refusal to pay for gender transition, which sometimes involves hormone therapy or surgery that in some states currently must be approved by a doctor before being covered.\n\n\u201cMany people still believe that the health care that transgender people need in relation to gender transition is somehow not real health care, that it\u2019s cosmetic, that it\u2019s not really necessary,\u201d says Harper Jean Tobin, policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality. \u201cThat is the kind of thinking, historically, that is behind these exclusions.\u201d\n\nStatutes preventing discrimination against the transgender community are seen as critical even to ensuring basic care. Because of difficulties with societal acceptance and employment, transgender people face much higher rates of HIV infection, smoking, drug and alcohol use and suicide attempts than the general population, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National LGBTQ Task Force.\n\nAt the same time, they also are hesitant to use medical services because of misunderstanding and discrimination on the part of providers, a poll by the two groups shows. Of those surveyed, half said they had to teach their doctors and health care providers basic information about themselves and the medications they were taking, one-fifth were refused services, and 28 percent said they went without medical care on at least one occasion because they were afraid of discrimination at a hospital or clinic.\n\nCurrently, discrimination is prohibited in a health care setting that receives government funding. Under Obamacare, patients who are transgender have the same option as everyone else of buying tax-subsidized private insurance plans in government-run marketplaces without being turned down. The law also expanded the definition of income limits for Medicaid, the government\u2019s program for poor and disabled Americans. The change provides more low- or even no-cost health coverage options for poor people who live in the District of Columbia or one of the 28 states that have expanded this definition \u2013 a key development for the transgender community, whose members often face high rates of poverty and unemployment.\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Study Finds Health Care Getting More Expensive and Disparate]\n\nStill, gaps remain. Tobin says exclusions to medical care associated with transition \u2013 including hormone replacement therapy or sex reassignment surgery \u2013 haven\u2019t changed in most states, making her wonder whether the plans offered truly provide better benefits compared to where they were before the health law.\n\nRules against exclusions related to paying for transition through private plans or Medicaid exist in nine states and the District of Columbia, and trans people have seen benefits through those rules, Tobin says, but that, \u201cin most of the country the potential of the law to remove these barriers has so far been unfulfilled.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason for that is because the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Civil Rights is still crafting final rules for specifics about what constitutes discrimination in a health care setting. The agency is responsible for enforcing these laws by first reviewing complaints from patients who say they have faced discrimination on the basis of sex, race, sexual orientation or other factors. The rules haven\u2019t yet been interpreted on a national level to mean that denying someone transition-related surgery is discrimination, though patients can submit complaints to the office for review.\n\nThe Office of Civil Rights declined to comment on the issue, saying that it anticipated rules would be delivered \u201cin the next few months.\u201d\n\nRobin Maril, senior legislative counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the country, says her organization continues to urge the agency to publish the regulations.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have informal guidance that [the Office of Civil Rights] is accepting claims of discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex stereotyping ... formal regulations are necessary to make these protections permanent,\" she said in an email.\n\nPennsylvania, where Burch practices, isn\u2019t one of the states that has created exclusion rules. He spends about two hours on the phone each week negotiating costs with health insurance companies on behalf of his patients, particularly for gender-reassignment surgery. \u201cI write a lot of letters and I\u2019ve been through a lot of appeals processes,\u201d says Burch, who is also an American Osteopathic Association spokesman on transgender health.\n\n\n\n[STUDY: Obamacare Hasn't Solved Health Care Disparities]\n\nBefore having patients undergo surgery and potentially being surprised by a massive medical bill, he checks on prices and works to make it affordable for them. Sometimes approval for a procedure such as a hysterectomy, an operation in which the uterus is removed, can take a year. If paid for out of pocket, the surgery can cost more than $10,000. This does not include procedures involving plastic surgeons, who typically do not accept insurance.\n\nClare Krusing, spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, which represents the industry, says the organization doesn\u2019t have data on the number of requests for transgender services under the health care law.\n\n\n\n\u201cHealth plans rely on the clinical guidance, recommendations and medical evidence on safety and effectiveness from the specialty medical groups when coming up with their coverage policies on specific treatments,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cCoverage may vary and may be dependent on employers\u2019 inclusion of this benefit as part of coverage, but plans will cover medically necessary transgender services and treatments for patients.\u201d\n\nLeading medical groups, including the American Medical Association, support the position that gender transition is medically necessary. \u201cAn established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with [gender dysphoria],\u201d the organization wrote in a resolution.\n\nEven if trans patients are covered for these procedures, it can be difficult for them to find doctors who know how to work with them, or even want to. On the behavioral health side, there aren\u2019t enough providers for most Americans, and insurers have broad definitions of what services should and should not be included.\n\nOther than undergoing medical procedures, trans people may change their names and gender listings on driver\u2019s licenses and Social Security cards. All of these, however, also have medical and employment implications, whether making it more difficult to apply for a job and pay for health services or making it difficult to match their health records at various facilities, for instance.\n\nSomething as simple as using the pronouns trans people prefer and the name they identify with \u2013 even when it\u2019s different from what is on their ID card or medical records \u2013 can be crucial to patient care. Patients who come to Burch \u2013 who himself goes by \u201cDr. Drai,\u201d pronounced like the moniker of a famous hip-hop mogul \u2013 often complain that former doctors they went to didn\u2019t adhere to this basic principle.\n\nThough it is important for patients to find doctors who understand their needs, Burch says it\u2019s up to doctors to educate themselves. He knows medical schools didn\u2019t always teach students how to work with patients who are transgender as they might now \u2013 because he didn\u2019t have that training in school.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "transgender", "title": "Under Obamacare, Transgender Equality Wanes", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Specific rules about civil rights in health care are not yet written, so gender-transition therapy and surgery is still not covered.", "title": "Under Obamacare, Transgender Equality Wanes", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/04/24/under-obamacare-transgender-equality-wanes", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/9e/48/0f1c2e154cd98de3355a71482070/150424-transgender-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Specific rules about civil rights in health care are not yet written, so gender-transition therapy and surgery is still not covered.", "card": "summary", "title": "Under Obamacare, Transgender Equality Wanes"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "April 24, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,Pulse,LGBT rights,transgender", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Specific rules about civil rights in health care are not yet written, so gender-transition therapy and surgery is still not covered."}, "article_summary": "\u201cMany people still believe that the health care that transgender people need in relation to gender transition is somehow not real health care, that it\u2019s cosmetic, that it\u2019s not really necessary,\u201d says Harper Jean Tobin, policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\u201cI write a lot of letters and I\u2019ve been through a lot of appeals processes,\u201d says Burch, who is also an American Osteopathic Association spokesman on transgender health.\nClare Krusing, spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, which represents the industry, says the organization doesn\u2019t have data on the number of requests for transgender services under the health care law.\nUnder Obamacare, patients who are transgender have the same option as everyone else of buying tax-subsidized private insurance plans in government-run marketplaces without being turned down.\n[ALSO: Study Finds Health Care Getting More Expensive and Disparate]Still, gaps remain."}
