So far, Paris’ stop-gap attempts to deal with its episodes of crippling smog have been decidedly car-centric. The city’s tried temporarily lowering speed limits. This year and last, it’s banned half of all drivers from the road during spikes in air pollution. And a new program will offer drivers up to €10,000 ($11,422) to trade in their diesel cars for electric models.
