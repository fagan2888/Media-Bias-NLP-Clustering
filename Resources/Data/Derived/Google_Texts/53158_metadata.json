Learn more \u00bb\n\nSince late October, by my count, there have been 10 House and Senate hearings. Eight were by House committees led by Republicans who oppose the law; two were before Senate panels run by Democrats.\n\nEvery few days, it seems, there\u2019s another hearing into one problem or another with rolling out the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s hard to keep track.\n\nThe most memorable of the hearings was Oct. 30 when Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius first testified about the HealthCare.gov debacle. Also buzzworthy was the Nov. 13 hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The panel subpoenaed Todd Park, the U.S. chief technology officer, and it was unclear whether he would appear (he did.)\n\nHere\u2019s a look at highlights from the Hill:\n\nDate: October 24, 2013\n\nCommittee: House Energy and Commerce\n\nTitle: PPACA Implementation Failures: Didn\u2019t Know or Didn\u2019t Disclose?\n\nWitnesses: Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president, CGI Federal; Andrew Slavitt, group executive vice president, Optum/QSSI; Lynn Spellecy, corporate counsel, Equifax Workforce Solutions; John Lau, program director, Serco\n\nLength: 4 hours, 24 minutes\n\nMinority party response and transcript.\n\nHighlight: \u201cFederal officials did not fully test the online health insurance marketplace until two weeks before it opened to the public on Oct. 1, contractors told Congress on Thursday,\u201d the New York Times reported. \u201cWhile individual components of the system were tested earlier, they said, the government did not conduct \u2018end-to-end-testing\u2019 of the system until late September.\u201d\n\nMemorable exchange:\n\nRep. Joe Barton (R-Texas): Will the gentleman yield?\n\nRep.

Some might say that we are actually in the Wizard of Oz land.\u201d\n\nPallone (later): \u201cI know we\u2019re not in Kansas, but I do believe increasingly we\u2019re in Oz because of what I see here.\u201d\n\nDate: November 5\n\nCommittee: Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions\n\nTitle: The Online Federal Health Insurance Marketplace: Enrollment Challenges and the Path Forward\n\nWitness: Marilyn Tavenner, administrator, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\nLength: 2 hours, 34 minutes\n\nHearing highlight: \u201cCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said Tuesday that fixes have been made to the federal Web site to improve users\u2019 experiences.
