The measles outbreak in Disneyland at the end of 2014 and early 2015 caused 147 people to fall ill, spread to 12 states, Mexico, and Canada — and had financial blowback.“These outbreaks have economic costs. They are disruptive,” Gregory Poland, lead of Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group told Forbes in 2015. Putative costs include medical treatment and lost wages/time at work. Disneyland also lost potential profits and visitors as a result of public concern.Treatment for one measles patient is over $10,000 according to the Fiscal Times. In comparison, the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is listed as only $99.99 per dose at Walgreens and is also covered under the Affordable Care Act.Emily Webb, Alaska mother whose vaccinated infant daughter tested positive for measles after a visit to Disneyland told CBS News that she wants “people to be aware and to vaccinate their kids because that’s the whole reason that she got sick in the first place.”

Business Insider sums up t he value of vaccines, saying that the vaccinations that the 4.1 million children born in the US in 2009 received is estimated to have saved $13.5 billion in potential treatment costs and another $70 billion in costs to society.Some still remain skeptical despite the high costs of the Disneyland outbreak and relatively low costs of vaccines. The National Vaccine Information Center, a nonprofit organization that monitors negative outcomes and problems with vaccination, has stated that many of those involved in the Disneyland outbreak had been vaccinated. The group suggests that the hype over the outbreak may have “more to do with covering up vaccine failures” to profit pharmaceutical companies than with public health.
