MIH is not a certification, a line in the budget, or a medical procedure; it is a way of viewing prehospital providers\u2019 role in the healthcare system and their responsibility to the people they serve.\n\nFrom the headlines it\u2019s clear that EMS leaders across the country have embraced mobile integrated health care (MIH). What\u2019s not clear is whether they are embracing the principles behind it or simply jumping on the MIH bandwagon.\n\nSome cities and counties across the country have developed fantastic programs. Yet there\u2019s a danger that too many departments will follow them and create MIH programs simply to create programs. They will add community paramedics, who will try to prevent unnecessary ambulance calls and hospital readmissions. Both are worthy goals, but before rushing to create new positions, programs, and protocols, EMS agencies can utilize the concepts of MIH in their daily operations. Through training and education, departments can empower every EMS provider to provide more patient-centered care on a daily basis.\n\nAssisting with basic medical and social needs\n\nIn one department where I serve, providers are regularly recognized with nominations for \"Call of the Quarter.\" Every three months, the \"winners\" are chosen from the nominees by a group of local residents. Typically, the stories are dramatic \u2014 the patients that most closely resemble what we see on television shows and in the news: cardiac arrests, horrible traumatic injuries, rapid sequence induction (RSI) intubations.\n\nOne quarter, we nominated a pair of paramedics who didn\u2019t start an IV or push any meds. They found an elderly patient, at home, who didn\u2019t have an acute problem. Instead, what the patient needed was assistance with basic medical and social needs. The nominees spent an hour in the patient\u2019s home, making phone calls to physicians\u2019 offices and family members. In the end, they helped the patient much more than if they had simply taken him to the emergency room. They also won the Call of the Quarter award.\n\nThis was MIH at its finest hour, even though the paramedics involved may have never heard that term before. The providers didn\u2019t take these actions because of the Affordable Care Act or changing reimbursement schemes. The department couldn\u2019t bill for the services and there was no carefully calculated estimate of costs that were avoided. But I can\u2019t remember hearing many stories during my years in EMS that made me more proud to be associated with an agency.\n\nAs EMS leaders struggle with how to implement MIH programs, they should first ask: \"Are we doing everything we can with our current resources, personnel, and protocols?\"\n\nA department that isn\u2019t already embracing MIH concepts will struggle to do so simply by creating a new community paramedic. MIH is not a certification, a line in the budget, or a medical procedure; it is a way of viewing prehospital providers\u2019 role in the healthcare system and their responsibility to the people they serve.\n\nBut having the right attitude is not always enough. Agencies can measure their dedication to the principles of MIH \u2014 providing the right service, at the right time, for the right price\u2014and should be doing so whether they have an MIH program or not. For departments looking to start a program, these measures may be critical in showing policymakers that we are already performing these interventions on a daily basis, but without the training, education, and resources we truly need.\n\nExpand data collection efforts\n\nThe importance of collecting data has become obvious to most EMS leaders, but those databases need to include more than response times and survival rates. A simple start toward MIH would be for EMS agencies to begin tracking how frequently their providers make referrals to adult protective services, local aging assistance programs, and other social services. Measuring these and other referrals allows agency leadership to report them to policymakers and show the street-level providers that management values these interventions which, although not as glamorous as intubation, can often make a bigger difference in patient\u2019s lives.\n\nMeasuring quality means measuring how people\u2019s lives are improved; rather than the number of advanced skills are performed. It doesn\u2019t take a community paramedic program to start demonstrating how MIH interventions are improving the health of the population.\n\nAbout the author Paramedic Michael Gerber, MPH, started in EMS in 2001, when he joined the volunteer fire service while working as a journalist on Capitol Hill.
