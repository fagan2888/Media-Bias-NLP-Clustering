First Lady Michelle Obama proudly defended her husband during a speech at the opening reception of the Democratic National Committee’s Women’s Leadership Forum, telling the audience that people take her husband “for granted.”

“Just think about how different our country looks to children growing up today. Think about how our kids take for granted that a black person or a woman can be President of the United States,” she declared.

“They take it for granted that for the first time in history, there are three brilliant women serving on our Supreme Court. They take for granted that their president will end hurtful policies like ‘don’t ask, don’t tell,’ that he’ll speak out for gay marriage.”

The forum marked the beginning of a long list of campaign stops the first lady is expected to make before the midterm elections. Michelle Obama has a much higher national approval rating than her husband and the Democrats are hoping she can help inspire voters.

“Today, when folks ask me whether I still believe everything we said about change and hope back in 2008, I tell them that I believe it more strongly now than ever before, because, look, I’ve seen it with my own eyes,” she said.

She then followed the same script her husband is fond of using and blamed any lack of “hope and change” on Republicans in Congress.

“If we lose these midterm elections, it’s going to be a whole lot harder to finish what we’ve started because things will be even worse here in Washington,” she said.

“In fact, it’s gotten so bad, they’ve even tried to block the work I do on child obesity — and that’s really saying something. I mean, for most folks in this country, making sure our kids get decent nutrition isn’t all that controversial — it shouldn’t be.”
