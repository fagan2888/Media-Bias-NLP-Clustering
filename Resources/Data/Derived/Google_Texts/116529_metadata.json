A late effort to demonstrate that the council members support increasing affordable housing was met with derision by one member.\n\n[In Alexandria, a choice of historic preservation or affordable housing]\n\nWhile Mayor Allison Silberberg (D) said the decision should encourage the housing authority to try again in six months, its chief executive said it was uncertain if it would. \u201cWe expended a considerable amount of money to develop these plans. We can\u2019t do that again,\u201d said Roy Priest, chief executive of the Alexandria Redevelopment and Housing Authority. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the residents in those units for another year \u2014 I don\u2019t know now where we will put them.\u201d\n\nThe 74-year-old Ramsey Homes, built by the federal government to house African American defense workers during World War II, have long passed their use-by date. There is no air-conditioning nor are there dishwashers, the heating is inadequate, the units are not accessible to people in wheelchairs, and when one tenant does her laundry, the sink in the adjacent unit backs up, residents told the council.\n\nBut replacing the four mustard-colored concrete buildings with new units catering to moderate- and low-income residents would require a more dense development to be eligible for financing and low-income tax credits, ARHA officials said. Historic preservation advocates urged preservation of at least a portion of the project. Neighbors complained that the project removed too much open space.\n\nAlthough long civic hearings are not unusual in the Alexandria council chambers, the anger that erupted from the elected officials on the dais was remarkable.\n\nFurious that ARHA waited to ask for a deferment of its special-use permit until 4:30 p.m. Friday, council members questioned whether ARHA was trying to game the system by getting a rezoning without saying exactly what it would build on the site \u2014 or whether it would sell the property to a private developer.\n\nARHA officials insisted that they could not do that without the approval of both the city council and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has a say in the property\u2019s disposition.\n\nBut years of acrimony between the two bodies spilled over, with members of both groups accusing the other of failure to share information and plans.\n\n\u201cWe gave very explicit instructions five months ago, and a lot of time has passed,\u201d said council member Paul Smedberg (D). \u201cThis is utterly frustrating. . . . And if you care so much about residents, what about the maintenance of these units over time?\u201d\n\nCouncil member John Taylor Chapman (D), who grew up in public housing, said that preservationists were not only trying to retain segregated and substandard housing but also asking families to continue to live there.\n\nHe also assailed the mayor for meeting with the city manager and the ARHA chief executive without informing council members, including those working on the issue. When Silberberg defended herself, calling the meeting \u201ca prerogative of the seat,\u201d Chapman said she missed his point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about you working with [ARHA\u2019s chief]. It\u2019s about you working with us \u2014 this is a jointly run government,\u201d Chapman said.\n\n\u201cYour anger toward me in this situation, I say with all due respect, is misplaced,\u201d she said.\n\nVice Mayor Justin Wilson (D) derided Silberberg\u2019s effort to pass a limited approval of a change in the master plan, which she said would \u201csend a signal\u201d that the council supports affordable housing.\n\n\u201cYou are amending the allowable housing from 30 to 63 units here. That\u2019s all you\u2019re doing,\u201d Wilson said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable housing, vapolitics, alexandria council, ARHA", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Ramsey Homes proposal runs into acrimony as board members fight with housing authority, each other.", "title": "Alexandria council fails to allow new affordable housing", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/alexandria-council-fails-to-allow-new-affordable-housing/2016/02/20/5c58bcba-d7e2-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@psullivan1"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "affordable housing, vapolitics, alexandria council, ARHA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "5c58bcba-d7e2-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Ramsey Homes proposal runs into acrimony as board members fight with housing authority, each other."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d3d\"", "article_summary": "A late effort to demonstrate that the council members support increasing affordable housing was met with derision by one member.\nThe Alexandria City Council, in an acrimonious six-hour hearing Saturday, refused to change the zoning that would allow the local housing authority to replace 15 antiquated but historic public housing units with 53 new units.\nAlthough long civic hearings are not unusual in the Alexandria council chambers, the anger that erupted from the elected officials on the dais was remarkable.\nWe can\u2019t do that again,\u201d said Roy Priest, chief executive of the Alexandria Redevelopment and Housing Authority.\nHe also assailed the mayor for meeting with the city manager and the ARHA chief executive without informing council members, including those working on the issue."}
