Our Constitution\u2019s goal, in part, to \u201cestablish justice\u201d relies heavily on a handful of people across the country given the awesome power and responsibility as judges.\n\nBut alarmingly, many of these judges have no use for the law.\n\nEven though their role is to interpret the law and make decisions based on the facts, too many have wrapped themselves in robes of activism. Their own ideology rips at the very fabric of justice, shredding the Constitution and state laws one fiber at a time.\n\nI know this from personal experience as U.S. District Court Judge Raymond Jackson has decided that the facts don\u2019t matter and the First Amendment is unworthy of consideration in The Radiance Foundation v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The NAACP is abusing trademark law to censor me while Alliance Defending Freedom is fighting for my civil rights. Judges gone wild don\u2019t care about the truth. They care about their worldview. Impartiality be damned.\n\nEven the ACLU of Virginia has chosen to support us by filing an amicus brief, together with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemning the judge\u2019s trampling of free speech rights. The Life Legal Defense Foundation has also filed its amicus brief, along with Reverend Walter Hoye, Day Gardner, and Dr. Alveda King of the National Black Prolife Coalition, to denounce this judge\u2019s actions with great historical substantiation and humor.\n\nBut judicial activism isn\u2019t funny.\n\nThe existence of radically pro-abortion, anti-religious liberty Obamacare is the result of judges ignoring the facts and giving Congress the power to pass any legislation as long as it\u2019s a tax. The Supremes also recently rejected to hear same-sex marriage cases that directly conflict with their own DOMA ruling in which they affirmed states\u2019 rights to define marriage. The Constitution is being rethreaded by judges who fabricate \u201crights\u201d out of activist whole cloth.\n\nU.S. District Judge John E. Jones trashed Pennsylvania\u2019s Defense of Marriage Act declaring: \u201cWe are a better people than what these laws represent, and it is time to discard them into the ash heap of history.\u201d Sure. Supporting the only form of marriage that can produce a child\u2014produce a society\u2014is an anachronistic notion that should be torched. The facts don\u2019t matter more than a purely emotionally driven sense of \u201cequal justice\u201d.\n\nPerhaps the 14th Amendment\u2019s \u201cequal protection\u201d clause should be equally applied to anyone (of any age) who\u2019d like to drive. Aren\u2019t a driver\u2019s test and license fees like a literacy test and poll tax? What about \u201cequality\u201d for anyone who\u2019d like to vote, at any age? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have the \u201cright\u201d to park in any parking spot, including those designated as handicap? How can any college legally discriminate in its selection of any potential student? Shouldn\u2019t it be everyone\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to be accepted at any college or university?\n\nThe 14th Amendment was a Reconstruction Amendment that specifically pertained to the unequal treatment of black Americans. It finally ascribed to those of my complexion full personhood. If it were meant to be a panacea for all rights we wouldn\u2019t have needed numerous subsequent amendments securing the right to vote.\n\nIn California, liberals forced \u201cequality\u201d upon the state, via SB 1172, by ensuring professional therapists and parents had no choice in counseling for children with unwanted same-sex attraction. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, unsurprisingly, denied this law violated the First Amendment and came to the predictably bizarre conclusion that, in therapy, there was no speech involved. Huh? Do counselors and their clients communicate telepathically?\n\nMatt Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel has defended the Californian families in Pickup v. Brown whose state has violated their right to parent, their freedom of religion, their freedom of speech, their equal protection under the law and their access to therapeutic choice. Staver illuminates this outrageous situation: \u201cLegislators and judges in the state of California have essentially barged into the private therapy rooms of victimized young people and told them that their confusion, caused by the likes of a Jerry Sandusky abuser, is normal and they should pursue their unwanted and dangerous same-sex sexual attractions and behavior, regardless of whether those minors desire their religious beliefs to trump their unwanted attractions.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey passed the same legislation, and Governor Chris Christie signed it into law falsely claiming children faced \u201chealth risks\u201d if exposed to such counseling. The American Psychological Association Report, used by both states to pass such an egregious attack on the First Amendment, actually found that some people benefitted from such counseling and had insufficient research showing the \u201cefficacy or safety\u201d of such therapy on minors. But the organization ignored its own findings and came to the conclusion that any therapy other than that which affirms homosexuality is harmful. Let\u2019s keep in mind this is the same politicized organization that published a poorly conducted meta-analysis claiming that child sexual abuse did not negatively impact its victims.\n\nJudges in both CA and NJ were given the most comprehensive scientific evidence regarding homosexuality and modern therapy in dealing with unwanted same-sex attraction, from the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity and the Narth Institute. The judges ignored the facts and chose politics and partiality.\n\nThese judicial opinions are brazenly reshaping our cultural and legal landscape at a frightening frequency. Whenever a judge activates a non-existent \u201cright\u201d they deactivate an actual civil right. But Congress can rein this in. Aside from confirming all federal judges, it actually has the power to abolish the federal court system. I\u2019m not suggesting this, just emphasizing that Congress is not powerless in the face of judicial tyranny. The Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction is still subject to Congress who has the Constitutional authority to determine the high court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nJudicial activism is a threat to our freedoms just as much as the apathy of the American public. Judges gone wild can only be tamed when American citizens choose to understand and embrace the power given to the People by the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "Judicial opinions are brazenly reshaping our cultural and legal landscape at a frightening frequency.", "title": "Judges gone wild: judicial activism deactivates rights", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/Miscellaneous/Freedom_erased.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/judges-gone-wild-judicial-activism-deactivates-rights", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "Judicial opinions are brazenly reshaping our cultural and legal landscape at a frightening frequency."}, "description": "{meta_description}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca0d5\"", "article_summary": "Judges gone wild can only be tamed when American citizens choose to understand and embrace the power given to the People by the Constitution.\nThe NAACP is abusing trademark law to censor me while Alliance Defending Freedom is fighting for my civil rights.\nThe Constitution is being rethreaded by judges who fabricate \u201crights\u201d out of activist whole cloth.\nJudicial activism is a threat to our freedoms just as much as the apathy of the American public.\nJudges gone wild don\u2019t care about the truth."}
