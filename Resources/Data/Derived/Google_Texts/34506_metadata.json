Michael Grimm in next year's midterm elections, blasted Grimm and House Republicans Thursday for holding the congressional district \"hostage\" over the Obamacare-inspired government shutdown.\n\nRecchia also said Grimm (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) \u008d\"has been trying to have it both ways, voting to shut down the government while going on television saying he's against a shutdown.\"\n\n\"Enough of the talking points and the television appearances and the games,\" said state Sen. Diane Savino, who joined Recchia and two dozen Island Democrats outside the gates of the shuttered-to-the-public Gateway National Recreation Area, Fort Wadsworth.\n\nWhile the park was closed, the Coast Guard base on the grounds was open to military personnel, as well as those who have \"military contracts\" there, said a National Parks ranger on site who asked not to be identified. A landscaping truck and a Meals on Wheels van were waved in.\n\nSo was a couple who presented military identification and gained access, saying they wanted to buy cigarettes at the Coast Guard Exchange, which was open for purchases, the Advance confirmed.\n\nUSUALLY VACANT\n\nIronically, the ranger greeting those visitors normally is not at the entrance, but had to be stationed there due to the shutdown.\n\nRecchia and Ms. Savino said that if the shutdown continues into next week, it will have a \"ripple effect\" on local businesses and eateries and the borough's economy overall.\n\n\"He says he doesn't want a shutdown, so let your actions speak louder than your words,\" said Recchia of Grimm. \"Instead, he falls in line, behind [Speaker John] Boehner, who delayed the vote on Sandy aid. He's trying to have it both ways. He is misleading the people of New York and the people of New York are smart.\"\n\nRecchia also accused Grimm of voting against a clean CR (continuing resolution) Wednesday night, depite having said previously he would support one -- which would have the effect of keeping the government operational for a week or two while the Senate takes up House objections to Obamacare.\n\nBut Grimm's office said that while Democrats portrayed Wednesday night's \"motion to recommit\"-- a procedural vote that usually goes along party lines -- as a clean CR, it was not.\n\n\"Rep. Grimm has not had the opportunity to vote for a clean CR,\" said Grimm spokeswoman Carol Danko.\n\nOn Monday, the eve of the shutdown, Grimm voted \"yes\" on a proposal to delay funding for the Affordable Care Act for one year. It passed the House, 228-201, effectively leading to the government shutdown, because the Senate had previously said it would reject any measure delaying the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGRIMM BREAKS RANKS\n\nA second House proposal voted on early Tuesday morning, after the shutdown had already gone into effect, added a measure that would set up a negotiating committee. It was approved, 228-199, but Grimm broke party ranks and voted \"no,\" saying it did not contain a provision to continue to fund the government. That too was rejected by the Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, Recchia and Ms. Savino said that with non-essential employees at HUD, SBA, FEMA and the Interior Department furloughed, Sandy money not already allocated could be stalled in the pipeline.\n\nThey also suggested that if the shutdown continues through this month, it could deal a huge economic blow to the city by putting the New York City Marathon in peril. The marathon was canceled last year in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.\n\n\"Send a message to Michael Grimm that we are not fooled by what you are saying on TV,\" said Recchia.\n\nSaid Grimm: \"At a time when so many people are suffering on account of the shutdown, this is nothing more than a shameless publicity stunt meant to misguide the people of Staten Island. I'm actually shocked to see Diane Savino participate in such a charade; she knows better.\n\n\"As for my opponent, it's been almost a year since Superstorm Sandy and so many victims have yet to see a dime of the federal funds I fought so hard for in Congress. As a chairman in the City Council, perhaps he should be more concerned with helping Sandy victims get their relief funds from the city by doing the job he has now instead of pandering for the one he wants.\"\n\nLou Leidy, the Democratic candidate for borough president, also made brief remarks at the press conference.\n\nIn a statement, Councilwoman Debi Rose (D-North Shore) weighed in, saying in part: \"This back-and-forth tennis match of who [is] to blame must end, and they must come to the table with a reasonable solution. Congress was elected to work for us, not to childishly bicker and endanger the national well-being.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Staten Island Democrats blast Grimm over government shutdown", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Staten Island Democrats blast Grimm over government shutdown \", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/staten_island_democrats_play_t.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/13521288-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11365088\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-04T12:02:39Z\", \"author\": \"Judy L.
