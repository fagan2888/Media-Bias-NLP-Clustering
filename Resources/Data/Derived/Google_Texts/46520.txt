A blown tire is blamed for a crash in eastern Kansas that killed one person and injured nearly a dozen others.

The crash happened around 3:30 p.m. Saturday at U.S. 69 and 399th Street in Miami County. The Kansas Highway Patrol says a 15-passenger van was heading south on U.S. 69 when the right rear tire blew, causing the driver to lose control. The van went into the median, rolled multiple times and came to rest on its top.

The Kansas Highway Patrol said the van was traveling north on U.S. 69 Highway when the rear tire blew out. The driver lost control, went across the lane and into the median and overturned.

The driver, Bradley Cox, 47, of Independence, Missouri, died at the scene.

Police said 11 other people in the van, including several children, were taken to local hospitals. Some of the injuries were listed as serious.
