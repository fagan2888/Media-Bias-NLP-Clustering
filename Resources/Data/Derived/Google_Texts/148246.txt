2. Think mental toughness. Simply put, you have to grind through when things are tough, Singer said. “Think to yourself, ‘I have to start prospecting because sooner or later someone is going to benefit from what I’m offering.’ Don’t let stuff get your down. Bounce back from setbacks. As soon as you recognize it, get it to stop. As soon as you start a negative thought, snap the rubber band on your wrist. Thoughts are habits and they come back.”

3. Repeat an identity statement to yourself. Don’t be humble about your gifts and what you can, and do, offer as a benefits professional. Know you have value. Think about what your gifts are and repeat it to yourself daily.
