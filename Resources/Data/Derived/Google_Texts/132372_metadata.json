They darted in and out of a forest, hiding from authorities.\n\nIt was roughly a 20 km (12 mile), or four hour walk from Idomeni, a sprawling tent city hosting thousands of refugees and migrants stranded by a cascade of border shutdowns throughout the Balkans in February.\n\nOthers at the campsite were also mulling their options to leave Idomeni and find vulnerable points along the border to cross into the Balkans, the preferred route to western Europe.\n\n\"There is no other solution,\" said Moutaz, a Syrian from Aleppo.\n\n\"Let him (others) put himself in my position, what would he do with this life we are living? Will he be ok with it, what is happening and what he is seeing?\"\n\nHuman rights organizations say the living conditions at Idomeni are appalling.\n\nFellow Syrian Eyas from Damascus said he would attempt to cross the Albanian border further west. \"There is a chance you will get there through the Macedonia route but the Macedonian military will send you back,\" he told Reuters.\n\nSome people chance the trek on their own. Others use traffickers, who charge anything between $350 and $600 per person to smuggle people across the border.\n\nA million migrants, many fleeing Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries in conflict in the Middle East, Asia and Africa have poured into Europe through Greece since last year.\n\nThere are more than 10,200 people camped out in tents in the fields of Idomeni. Greek authorities have repeatedly urged refugees and migrants to move to organized reception centers elsewhere in the country.\n\nLast month, Turkey and the EU sealed a controversial deal intended to halt the flow of illegal migrants into Greece from Turkey in return for financial and political rewards for Ankara.\n\nThere is now growing concern that migrants will increasingly use Italy as their conduit into Europe after the EU-Turkey pact, with more boats coming from North Africa - or even across the Adriatic Sea from the Balkans after the border closures there.\n\n(Writing by Michele Kambas; Editing by Ros Russell/Mark Heinrich)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "IDOMENI, Greece (Reuters) - After weeks stranded at a closed border in northern Greece", "title": "Migrants seek new routes into Balkans after formal borders sealed", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/24/Migrants-seek-new-routes-Balkans-after-formal-borders-sealed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-greece-macedonia_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/24/Migrants-seek-new-routes-Balkans-after-formal-borders-sealed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-greece-macedonia_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "IDOMENI, Greece (Reuters) - After weeks stranded at a closed border in northern Greece", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Greek authorities have repeatedly urged refugees and migrants to move to organized reception centers elsewhere in the country.\nIDOMENI, Greece (Reuters) - After weeks stranded at a closed border in northern Greece, migrants and refugees are seeking out new, irregular routes to get into Macedonia, clambering through forests and over hills under the cover of darkness.\nLast month, Turkey and the EU sealed a controversial deal intended to halt the flow of illegal migrants into Greece from Turkey in return for financial and political rewards for Ankara.\nIt was roughly a 20 km (12 mile), or four hour walk from Idomeni, a sprawling tent city hosting thousands of refugees and migrants stranded by a cascade of border shutdowns throughout the Balkans in February.\nOthers use traffickers, who charge anything between $350 and $600 per person to smuggle people across the border."}
