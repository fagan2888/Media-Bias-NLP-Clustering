The right to petition found its way to the bottom as a mere 2 percent could name the freedom.\n\n57 percent of Americans remembered the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, an 11 point drop from last year\u2019s 68 percent. In all, 33 percent could not name a single right.\n\nThough knowledge of the First Amendment wavered, Americans\u2019 support for it increased over the past year.\n\nThree-fourths of Americans feel the First Amendment \u201cdoes not go too far\u201d in protecting freedoms, a spike from last year\u2019s 57 percent who felt the same.\n\nThe Newseum attributed the safety threat following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings for last year\u2019s drop in support, saying numbers have since normalized.
