After conservative media ran with this, Media Matters talked to Eileen Sheil, the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Executive Director of Corporate Communications, who said, \u201cThere have been several mis-reports and they keep mentioning that we\u2019re laying off 3,000 employees. We\u2019re not.\u201d The medical facility is offering voluntary retirement to 3,000 eligible employees, but those aren\u2019t \u201cmassive layoffs,\u201d and blaming the Affordable Care Act for staffing decisions that have happened elsewhere for years is a stretch.\n\nIndeed, Sheil added that the Clinic supports the law conservative media is so eager to denigrate: \u201cWe believe reform is necessary because the current state is unsustainable. The ACA is a step toward that change and we believe more changes will come/evolve as there are still many uncertainties. Hospitals must be responsible and do what we can to prepare and support the law.\u201d\n\nAnd while this incident offers another reminder about the reliability of conservative media outlets, there\u2019s another angle to keep in mind. Though it doesn\u2019t get as much attention as it should, Medicaid expansion is incredibly important to state hospitals, which will struggle badly in Republican-led states that reject the policy. Indeed, in some states, hospitals may end up closing their doors altogether, at least in part due to the political decision.\n\nAnd when state hospitals close, there are actual \u201cmassive layoffs,\u201d which affect the employees and the economy. It\u2019s one of the reasons so many hospitals lobby Republican officials in \u201cred\u201d states to be more responsible on Medicaid expansion, though their appeals are generally ignored.\n\nSo here\u2019s the question for conservative media: when hospital staffs are laid off because Republicans blocked Medicaid expansion, and it\u2019s \u201cObamacare\u201d that could have saved those jobs, how many reports will we see chastising GOP officials for their callousness and economic recklessness?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Conservative media reported this week that Obamacare is causing layoffs at the Cleveland Clinic.
