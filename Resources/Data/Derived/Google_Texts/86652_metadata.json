Among them: acquiring companies and then raising prices on the company\u2019s drugs and investing little in research and development.\n\nThe company\u2019s investors didn\u2019t like this new face. Valeant\u2019s stock was down 6% Monday by early afternoon. That drop came even though the company lifted its full-year outlook and beat earnings expectations in the latest quarter.\n\nYet the focus of investors and Wall Street analysts once again turned to the more controversial elements of Valeant\u2019s business model, and on most of them, Valeant made an about face.\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s stock came under scrutiny after Valeant revealed that it had received subpoenas from federal prosecutors seeking information related to how it prices drugs, distributes them and helps patients afford the medicines.\n\nOn an analyst call Monday, Valeant Chief Executive J. Michael Pearson said that the company is \u201clikely to pursue fewer, if any acquisitions focused on mispriced products,\u201d going forward. He added that M&A will be less of a focus as the company plans to pay down debt.\n\nShare buybacks should generate better returns for investors now than most acquisitions, Mr. Pearson said. Shares of Valeant, which had been one of the best-performing stocks of the last decade, have dropped precipitously in recent weeks. Shares are down 30% this month, yet remain up 18% for the year.\n\nHe added that Valeant is unlikely to raise prices for any drugs in its existing portfolio more than 10% per year.\n\nIn a sharp divergence from the company\u2019s previous statement, Mr. Pearson also said that the company plans to make research and development \u201cmore of a focus.\u201d\n\nJust last week, Mr. Pearson sent a letter to Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) this week defending the Canadian company\u2019s price increases on two drugs, by 525% and 212%, after acquiring the medicines in February, moves detailed in an April article in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn that letter, Mr. Pearson wrote that spending money building \u201clarge, fixed-cost research infrastructure\u201d is inefficient and not necessarily the most productive model for the drug business. On the call, he did say that Valeant has no plans to be like other drug companies with its R&D spending, but it plans to spend more.\n\nThe company also said it is planning a sale, spinoff or take-private transaction for its \u201cNeuro\u201d segment, which the company said has seen the largest price increases. \u201cGiven the current environment, that probably doesn\u2019t make sense for us to hold onto it, especially given sort of what\u2019s happened to our multiple, with everything we got there in the press,\u201d Mr. Pearson said on the call.\n\nHe admitted that a buyer could potentially be interested in the division, despite the negative attention directed at it, because of its potential to allow a buyer to move its headquarters to a lower tax regime. Valeant, headquartered in Canada, has been known for its aggressive acquisition strategy and its ability to lower taxes on companies it acquires, particularly those in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. sought and failed to buy Botox-maker Allergan, but it looks like it's doing everything it can to give itself a face lift.", "title": "Investors Don\u2019t Like Valeant\u2019s New Face", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/19/investors-dont-like-valeants-new-face/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BQ379_VALEAN_G_20140610184047.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Investors Don\u2019t Like Valeant\u2019s New Face", "description": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. sought and failed to buy Botox-maker Allergan, but it looks like it's doing everything it can to give itself a face lift.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Maureen Farrell", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. sought and failed to buy Botox-maker Allergan, but it looks like it's doing everything it can to give itself a face lift.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-10-19T16:18:45-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/19/investors-dont-like-valeants-new-face/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-42625", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. sought and failed to buy Botox-maker Allergan, but it looks like it's doing everything it can to give itself a face lift.", "title": "Investors Don\u2019t Like Valeant\u2019s New Face", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/19/investors-dont-like-valeants-new-face/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BQ379_VALEAN_G_20140610184047.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-42625", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-10-19T16:19:12-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Share buybacks should generate better returns for investors now than most acquisitions, Mr. Pearson said.\nAmong them: acquiring companies and then raising prices on the company\u2019s drugs and investing little in research and development.\nHe added that M&A will be less of a focus as the company plans to pay down debt.\nYet the focus of investors and Wall Street analysts once again turned to the more controversial elements of Valeant\u2019s business model, and on most of them, Valeant made an about face.\nIn that letter, Mr. Pearson wrote that spending money building \u201clarge, fixed-cost research infrastructure\u201d is inefficient and not necessarily the most productive model for the drug business."}
