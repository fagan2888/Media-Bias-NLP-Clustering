Of those from private equity-backed companies, about 22% said there are disadvantages to the ownership structure.\n\nThe disadvantages they cite include slow decision making, too much meddling from the parent company, an overly short-term focus on earnings and cash flow, too much intervention in the day-to-day running of the business, insufficient equity shares for employees, overly complex capital structures, rich management fees, and unrealistic return expectations.\n\nThe remaining 78% of survey respondents from private equity-backed companies said they didn\u2019t see any disadvantages to private equity ownership.\n\nWhen asked to identify the biggest advantage the company\u2019s financial sponsor has brought to the business, executives cited such factors as flexibility in business decisions, freedom from public disclosure of financial performance, easy access to debt and equity, and the ability to expand into other regions.\n\n\u201cThe advantages and disadvantages are matched,\u201d said Thomas Stewart, executive director of the center. \u201cYou like [your sponsors] or dislike them for fairly similar reasons, which suggests to me the ownership or management style of private equity firms varies.\u201d\n\nThe mixed experience of businesses may explain why a high percentage of those whose companies don\u2019t have a financial sponsor said they aren\u2019t open to having private equity investment. Of the executives not backed by private equity firms, 29% said they had been approached by potential investors.\n\nAlthough 14% of those who had been approached by potential investors said they would be likely to sell a stake in the business in the next 12 months, 40% said they were unlikely to deal. Another 33% said they would never sell to a private equity firm. The remainder said they were unsure or undecided.\n\nMr. Stewart said there are certain businesses in the sample base for which private equity is never an option. Those include nonprofit outfits, and partnerships such as law firms, he said. The center doesn\u2019t break down the respondents according to their corporate governance structure.\n\nStill, Mr. Stewart acknowledged the 14% of people that are likely to sell to private equity represent a small percentage of the sample base, reflecting private equity ownership as a \u201clow preference\u201d for the other executives.\n\nNonetheless, firm reputation is important to wooing entrepreneurs and management teams.\n\n\u201cThere are \u2018good guys\u2019 and \u2018bad buys\u2019\u201d among private equity firms, said Mr. Stewart. \u201cIf they are competing for the same target company, the references [on the firms] would be different.\u201d\n\nWrite to Shasha Dai at shasha.dai@wsj.com; follow her on Twitter: @ShashaDai1", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Survey Says: Company Executives Have Mixed Views of PE Ownership", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/27/survey-says-company-executives-have-mixed-views-of-pe-ownership/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Survey Says: Company Executives Have Mixed Views of PE Ownership", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Shasha Dai", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2016-01-27T20:23:54-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/27/survey-says-company-executives-have-mixed-views-of-pe-ownership/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19494", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/27/survey-says-company-executives-have-mixed-views-of-pe-ownership/", "type": "article", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "site_name": "WSJ", "title": "Survey Says: Company Executives Have Mixed Views of PE Ownership"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19494", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-01-27T20:23:54-05:00"}, "article_summary": "About 28% of the respondents work at a company that is either wholly or partially owned by private equity firms.\nThe remaining 78% of survey respondents from private equity-backed companies said they didn\u2019t see any disadvantages to private equity ownership.\nOf the executives not backed by private equity firms, 29% said they had been approached by potential investors.\n\u201cThere are \u2018good guys\u2019 and \u2018bad buys\u2019\u201d among private equity firms, said Mr. Stewart.\nAnother 33% said they would never sell to a private equity firm."}
