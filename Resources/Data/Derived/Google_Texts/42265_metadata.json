It did not say what the item was.\n\nCNN showed video of a sobbing Warmbier saying: \"I have made the worst mistake of my life, but please act to save me.\"\n\nWarmbier said a \"deaconess\" had offered him a used car worth $10,000 if he could present a U.S. church with the slogan as a \"trophy\" from North Korea, KCNA said.\n\nThe acquaintance also said the church would pay his mother $200,000 if he was detained by the North and did not return, KCNA quoted Warmbier as saying.\n\n\"My crime is very severe and pre-planned,\" Warmbier was quoted as saying, adding that he was impressed by North Korea's \"humanitarian treatment of severe criminals like myself\".\n\nWarmbier's parents have not heard from him since his arrest, according to a statement from his family provided by the University of Virginia.\n\n\"I hope the fact that he has conveyed his sincere apology for anything that he may have done wrong will now make it possible for the DPRK (North Korea) authorities to allow him to return home,\" the statement said.\n\n\"I urge the DPRK government to consider his youth and make an important humanitarian gesture by allowing him to return to his loved ones.\"\n\nOther Westerners detained in North Korea previously have confessed to crimes against the state.\n\nNorth Korea's state media said in January that Warmbier \"was caught committing a hostile act against the state\", which it said was \"tolerated and manipulated by the U.S. government\".\n\nThe senior pastor at Friendship United Methodist Church in Wyoming, Ohio, told CNN that he did not know the person identified by Warmbier in the KCNA story as a deaconess there, and said Warmbier was not a member of the congregation.\n\nAccording to KCNA, Warmbier also said he was encouraged in his act by a member of the Z Society, an elite philanthropic organization at the University of Virginia that he hoped to join.\n\nAn official in the university's communications office could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIsolated North Korea is expected to face tough new U.N. Security Council resolution following its nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch this month.\n\nWarmbier was on a five-day New Year's tour of North Korea with a group of 20 and was delayed at immigration before being taken away by two airport officials, according to a tour operator that had sponsored the trip.\n\nWhile the vast majority of tourists to North Korea are from China, roughly 6,000 Westerners visit the country annually, though the United States and Canada advise against it.\n\nMost are adventure-seekers curious about life behind the last sliver of the iron curtain, and ignore critics who say their dollars prop up a repressive regime.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jee Heun Kahng; Editing by Tony Munroe and Nick Macfie)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - A U.S.", "title": "North Korea says U.S. student confessed to stealing item with propaganda slogan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/28/North-Korea-says-detained-US-student-confesses-crimes-against-state", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-usa-student_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/28/North-Korea-says-detained-US-student-confesses-crimes-against-state", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-usa-student_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - A U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Isolated North Korea is expected to face tough new U.N.
