Wearing a long, sheer robe and wide, flowing pants, Mr. Odedra whirled and placed his arms with the precision customary to this classical Indian style. Though the connection to James Brown may seem tenuous, the point was his global reach. \u201cHis music touches almost every corner of the world,\u201d said Mr. Odedra.\n\nIn creating the dance, Mr. Odedra researched how to create an East-West connection: \u201cHe had that sense of ecstasy, which reached upward spiritually, but also goes horizontally to the audience.\u201d\n\nTo tap into that, he named his piece \u201cEcstasy,\u201d and wove in both kathak and movement derived from the Sufi tradition of whirling dervishes. At one point, though, he stops and strikes his bare feet against the floor in homage to Brown\u2019s extraordinary footwork.\n\n\u201cI thought about what is the essence of my dance and James Brown\u2019s? Rhythm,\u201d he said. \u201cHe used so much of his feet. And there was so much energy sourced from the ground. I wanted to bring that and uplift it.\u201d\n\nThere was also a conceptual link that deepened the dancer\u2019s purpose. Mr. Odedra, 29, is a British citizen who grew up in Leicester, in the U.K. midlands. His parents were born in Africa, and his grandparents are Indian; he returned to India regularly and studied dance related to his heritage. In his research into Brown\u2019s messages of political activism and black pride, Mr. Odedra found a connection to questions of British identity. \u201cJames Brown does not finish and end with performance and singing,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Odedra\u2019s performance is a featured solo that compliments the show\u2019s ensemble numbers danced by the Philadelphia-based contemporary dance company Philadanco. He was brought into \u201cGet on the Good Foot\u201d by director Otis Sallid, who choreographed for Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cSchool Daze\u201d and \u201cDo the Right Thing.\u201d\n\nAfter its debut in Harlem, \u201cGet on the Good Foot\u201d will tour to Baton Rouge, Atlanta and Los Angeles. Additional tour stops will be announced for 2014-2015, including stops in Germany and Europe in 2015.\n\nYou can listen to a WSJ Radio interview with the author here.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An Indian kathak dance number was a surprise hit in \"James Brown: Get on the Good Foot,\u201d a tribute to the Godfather of Soul.", "title": "James Brown Dance Tribute Includes Indian Surprise", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/25/james-brown-dance-tribute-includes-indian-kathak-surprise/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AD680_brown_E_20131025144548.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "James Brown Dance Tribute Includes Indian Surprise", "description": "An Indian kathak dance number was a surprise hit in \"James Brown: Get on the Good Foot,\u201d a tribute to the Godfather of Soul.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Pia Catton", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "An Indian kathak dance number was a surprise hit in \"James Brown: Get on the Good Foot,\u201d a tribute to the Godfather of Soul.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-25T19:00:16-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/25/james-brown-dance-tribute-includes-indian-kathak-surprise/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-77890", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "An Indian kathak dance number was a surprise hit in \"James Brown: Get on the Good Foot,\u201d a tribute to the Godfather of Soul.", "title": "James Brown Dance Tribute Includes Indian Surprise", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/25/james-brown-dance-tribute-includes-indian-kathak-surprise/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-77890", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-25T19:07:13-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce78b\"", "article_summary": "But the surprise hit of the evening was dancer and choreographer Aakash Odedra, who performed Indian kathak dance to the form\u2019s traditional music and James Brown vocals.\nThough the connection to James Brown may seem tenuous, the point was his global reach.\nWearing a long, sheer robe and wide, flowing pants, Mr. Odedra whirled and placed his arms with the precision customary to this classical Indian style.\n\u201cI thought about what is the essence of my dance and James Brown\u2019s?\n\u201cJames Brown does not finish and end with performance and singing,\u201d he said."}
