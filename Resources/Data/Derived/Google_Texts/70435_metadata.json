The company has been able to secure a forbearance agreement, and then amendments, with the lender in order to push back the due date, because the company does not have the money to make the payment.\n\nThe interest is now due Dec. 15, but if Bref doesn\u0092t make the payment on time, the lender may demand full payment of the $997.5 million loan. Bref says it does not have the money to make that payment, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, or without the threat of liquidation, according to a Nov. 13 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe company\u0092s debt is secured by the hotel, which gives the lender the option to foreclose.\n\nBref has been struggling for a while. Through the end of the third quarter of 2014, the company has incurred $72.8 million loss, in addition to carrying a $273.3 million deficit, according to SEC filings. In the first three quarters of 2013, the company incurred a $68 million loss.\n\nAffiliates of Brookfield Financial LLC formed New York-based Bref in February 2011 to buy the interests of HRHH JV Junior Mezz LLC, which indirectly owned the hotel. HRHH\u0092s interests were assigned to Bref in lieu of foreclosure after HRHH had defaulted on a mortgage loan provided by Brookfield. (Bref is a franchisee of Hard Rock Cafe International, Inc., which owns the global trademark for all Hard Rock brands.)\n\nThe company has been working to restructure its debt since the interest payment was originally due in March.
