Though the new tax replaces the old, and is theoretically to be offset by increased federal funding, it will likely raise uncomfortable questions for the California GOP heading into the 2016 elections.\n\nSen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), a leading proponent of the new tax, said delightedly, \u201cThe proposal provides a stable ongoing funding source for Medi-Cal. It allows California to maximize its share of existing federal dollars, and we\u2019re always complaining that we don\u2019t get our fair share. It will not negatively impact premiums,\u201d KQED reports.\n\nHealth insurance plans expressed support; Charles Bacchi, CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, said the association appreciated the \u201cwillingness and patience of the Administration and legislative leaders to listen to the challenges posed by earlier formula and for continuing to work with health plans to find a workable solution.\u201d\n\nTim Hornbecker, director of business development for The Arc of Alameda County, said that the tie between developmental disabilities funding and the MCO tax was a cynical ploy by Governor Jerry Brown, who outlined the measure in his budget, to grab GOP votes, as reported by KQED.\n\nThe new measure will allot $300 million for support services for the developmentally disabled, which will be supplemented by $200 million in federal matching funds.\n\nSupport strengthened for the bill after a rate survey to be submitted to the legislature by 2019 was made part of the deal. The survey will determine appropriate rates to be paid for services for the developmentally disabled.\n\nThe bill must be approved by Governor Jerry Brown.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Monday, California legislators approved--and the GOP declined to stop-- a new tax on all managed care organizations, as Jerry Brown requested.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On Monday, California legislators approved--and the GOP declined to stop-- a new tax on all managed care organizations, as Jerry Brown requested.", "title": "CA GOP Lets Jerry Brown Pass New Health Tax - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Jerry-Brown-Rich-Pedroncelli-Associated-Press.jpg", "height": 963}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/03/01/ca-approves-health-tax/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Monday, California legislators approved--and the GOP declined to stop-- a new tax on all managed care organizations, as Jerry Brown requested.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Jerry-Brown-Rich-Pedroncelli-Associated-Press.jpg", "title": "CA GOP Lets Jerry Brown Pass New Health Tax - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "california repblicans, developmentally disabled, Jerry Brown, mco tax,Breitbart California, Obamacare, Taxes,Jerry Brown", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "mco tax", "published_time": "2016-03-01T09:10:02-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California,Obamacare,Taxes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "It allows California to maximize its share of existing federal dollars, and we\u2019re always complaining that we don\u2019t get our fair share.\nThough the new tax replaces the old, and is theoretically to be offset by increased federal funding, it will likely raise uncomfortable questions for the California GOP heading into the 2016 elections.\nSen.
