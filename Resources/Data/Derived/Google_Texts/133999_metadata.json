The hospital, which has sued the state to be included in more plans, is struggling to get paid for care given to about 125 children since Jan. 1, when the Affordable Care Act\u0092s coverage took effect, said Sandy Melzer, the facility\u0092s strategy officer.\n\nIn January, \u0093we made the decision to see all the children,\u0094 Melzer said by telephone. \u0093Maybe we\u0092ll be paid, maybe we won\u0092t. It\u0092s completely done on faith.\u0094 If the insurers refuse to cover their services, the hospital will pick up costs that go beyond the standard deductible, he said.\n\nThe insurers\u0092 strategy, outlined in a report last month by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform, is an unexpected consequence as the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, kicks into gear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law puts pressure on premiums by requiring insurers to \u0093broaden health benefits, restricting how much premiums can vary with age and adding a new health-insurance tax,\u0094 said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America\u0092s Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, a Washington-based trade group. Narrowing networks to those that accept lower payments in exchange for higher patient volume \u0093is one way to help mitigate cost increase for consumers,\u0094 he said.\n\nNarrow network plans pit two basic consumer demands against each other. On one hand, patients want choice and the ability to seek care at whichever hospital can best treat their condition. On the other hand, consumers want affordable premiums at a time when health-care costs are rising nationwide.\n\nU.S. health spending is expected to grow more than 6 percent this year to $3.1 trillion as the health-care overhaul takes full effect and millions of Americans gain insurance, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The average premium for family coverage has increased 80 percent in a decade.\n\nInsurers say one way to help lower costs is to select medical providers who deliver quality care at a low price. This week, the Health and Human Services Department said insurance plans may be required to include at least 30 percent of \u0093essential community providers\u0094 in each county in 2015 from 20 percent this year. That means about 38 percent of current plans would need to broaden their networks, according to the McKinsey study.\n\nFor now, the restricted plans have put higher-priced specialty hospitals, as well as small hospitals in markets dominated by a single insurer, in line to be cut from insurer networks. Feeling the pressure, they are pushing back.\n\nSeattle Children\u0092s Hospital, for instance, sued the Washington Office of the Insurance Commissioner in October for \u0093failure to ensure adequate network coverage\u0094 after its exclusion from five of seven plans offered on the state\u0092s insurance exchange. The hospital, which saw 351,000 pediatric patients in 2012, asked the commissioner to reconsider its standing with four of the plans.\n\nIn a Jan. 29 court filing, the state responded that \u0093nothing in the law dictates inclusion of a specific provider, regardless of their preeminence or sympathetic patient base. So long as issuers meet the legal standards for adequacy and covered services, the OIC does not manage their business arrangements for them.\u0094\n\nThe costs of carrying the hospital were unacceptable, BridgeSpan Health Co., one of the insurers at the center of the case, said in a filing. \u0093If the hospital\u0092s position were accepted,\u0094 the company said, it would require insurers to pay the hospital whatever it wants to charge.\n\nThe hospital, meanwhile, counters that the uniqueness of its services and the training required by its doctors to carry out patient care deserve more compensation.\n\n\u0093We take care of a very unique group of children, and the amount of resources we need to have is very expensive,\u0094 Melzer said. \u0093We do 100 percent of transplant care and 70 percent of cancer and cardiac care in the state. The expectation that it should cost the same as a community hospital is completely unreasonable.\u0094\n\nInsurers routinely make decisions on whether to pay for out-of-network care. Premera Blue Cross, one of the insurers that excluded Seattle Children\u0092s, has responded to 21 applications for reimbursement from the hospital, approving 13 and rejecting eight, Melzer said on Jan. 29. In the wake of the new health law, the hospital has added three staff members to handle reimbursement applications, he said.\n\nAt some point, Melzer said, the hospital will turn away patients who can\u0092t pay in advance for their services. \u0093It\u0092s not viable going forward,\u0094 he said. \u0093We can\u0092t just assume we\u0092re going to get paid.\u0094\n\nFor the family of 5-month-old Gabriella Blankers, the issue hit home last month when they took her to Seattle Children\u0092s, concerned about the shape of her head. Costs for a CT scan that found a rare birth defect were initially rejected by the family\u0092s insurer because the hospital wasn\u0092t in their network. While the insurer later made an exception, it would cover the child only until the end of March.\n\n\u0093There\u0092s nowhere else I could go,\u0094 to get the expertise Gabriella needed, said Rebekah Blankers, the girl\u0092s mother, in a telephone interview. \u0093Unless I went out of state, out of network, or out of pocket.\u0094\n\nPremera, based in Mountlake Terrace, Wash., covered the Blankers family, which includes three children, through their LifeWise affiliate for $900 a month. The insurer will grant exceptions for some of Seattle Children\u0092s unique services, but won\u0092t cover non-unique services such as asthma visits and tonsil procedures, said Eric Earling, a spokesman for the insurer, in a telephone interview.\n\n\u0093The cost of Children\u0092s non-unique inpatient services is 100 percent higher than such services at other hospitals in our statewide network,\u0094 he said.\n\nA pediatric appendectomy, which cost $23,300 at Seattle Children\u0092s, is priced at $14,100 at Premera\u0092s other in-network hospitals, Earling said, adding: \u0093The issue, at the end of the day, is access at a more affordable price. That\u0092s why their non-unique services are not covered.\u0094\n\nWhile Seattle Children\u0092s doesn\u0092t dispute the price difference, spokeswoman Stacey Dinuzzo said the hospital\u0092s appendectomy cases often involve children suffering from other rare diseases, so the cost isn\u0092t comparable.\n\nGabriella Blankers\u0092 CT scan occurred on Jan. 17. Premera denied the hospital\u0092s reimbursement request the following week. It then reversed its decision and informed Seattle Children\u0092s on Jan. 30 that it would cover Gabriella\u0092s care for the next two months, after which the insurers said it will only cover unique services.\n\nRebekah Blankers isn\u0092t waiting to find out what Premera considers unique or non-unique. She has switched Gabriella to a $200-a-month exchange plan that will cover all care done at Seattle Children\u0092s. Meanwhile, the rest of the family \u0097 including Blankers\u0092 two other daughters \u0097 will stay on the less-expensive LifeWise plan.\n\n\u0093I\u0092m just happy this happened during open enrollment,\u0094 Blankers said. \u0093If it hadn\u0092t, we wouldn\u0092t be able to switch and we would have to fight.\u0094\n\nBlankers now has a combined estimated premium of $950 a month. If she had switched the entire family to the new plan, her cost would have been about $1,500 a month, she said.\n\nSpecialized hospitals aren\u0092t the only centers struggling with the newly narrowed networks. They also affect smaller facilities in markets dominated by a single insurer, further limiting consumer choice.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only insurer selling its products on the state\u0092s independent exchange. They cover 16 of the state\u0092s 26 hospitals in their reimbursement network. Among the excluded is Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester, which serves about 75,000 patients a year, according to Al Felgar, the medical center\u0092s chief executive officer.\n\n\u0093When we found out we weren\u0092t in the network, we immediately contacted Anthem, and we were told it was not something they would discuss,\u0094 Felgar said.\n\nAnthem president Lisa Guertin says the insurer designed its exchange plans in response to customer surveys: \u0093The message that came back was clear and compelling,\u0094 she said by telephone. \u0093They would trade off the full breadth of access for the price point.\u0094\n\nAnthem picked hospitals to fulfill state and federal standards, mostly based on geography, according to Guertin. Under its plan, hospital access for those within the network in terms of driving time and distance is twice as short as is required by New Hampshire law, she said.\n\nFelgar plans to argue Frisbie Memorial\u0092s case at a Feb. 10 public hearing before New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner Roger Sevigny. \u0093We\u0092re a small hospital,\u0094 he said. \u0093When you\u0092re small, every patient counts.\u0094\n\nWhile Seattle Children\u0092s and Frisbie Memorial struggle to get into a network, big hospital companies, armed with more negotiating power, are gaining the additional market share of newly insured patients.\n\nEach of the 77 hospitals operated by Tenet Healthcare Corp., the third-largest hospital company in the United States, is participating in at least one exchange plan at every level, Chief Executive Officer Trevor Fetter said at the JPMorgan Chase health-care conference on Jan. 13.\n\nAt HCA Holdings Inc., the biggest U.S. chain by market capitalization, 97 percent of the 165 hospitals it owns are included in Bronze and Silver plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, Chief Executive Officer Milton Johnson said last month. The Nashville, Tenn.-based operator expects \u0093to get a lift\u0094 from the health law, as many of HCA\u0092s most important markets, in Florida and Texas, had high levels of uninsured whose care will now be paid for by Obamacare, Johnson said.\n\nThat takes the pressure off HCA to accept discounted reimbursements, said Sheryl Skolnick, an industry analyst at Stamford, Conn.-based CRT Capital Group.\n\nHCA\u0092s \u0093margins are high, and their outcomes are good,\u0094 Skolnick said by telephone. \u0093They don\u0092t really need anything from these health plans. So why break their price discipline?\u0094\n\nNegotiations on coverage take place annually between insurers and hospitals. Hospitals that miss the cut this year can \u0093argue to become part of the network\u0094 next year, she said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "title": "Specialty hospital not in your network?
