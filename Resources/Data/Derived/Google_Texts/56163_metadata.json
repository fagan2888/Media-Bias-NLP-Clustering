He was 74.\n\nMr. Frost died of a suspected heart attack on Saturday night aboard the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship, where he was due to give a speech, the family said. The cruise company Cunard said its vessel had left the English port of Southampton on Saturday for a 10-day cruise in the Mediterranean.\n\nKnown both for an amiable personality and incisive interviews with leading public figures, Mr. Frost\u2018s career in television news and entertainment spanned almost a half-century. He was the only person to have interviewed all six British prime ministers serving between 1964 and 2007 and the seven U.S. presidents in office between 1969 and 2008. Outside world affairs, his roster ranged from Orson Welles to Muhammad Ali to Clint Eastwood.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron was quick to send his condolences, praising Mr. Frost for being an \u201cextraordinary man with charm, wit, talent, intelligence and warmth in equal measure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nixon interviews were among the great broadcast moments \u2014 but there were many other brilliant interviews,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cHe could be \u2014 and certainly was with me \u2014 both a friend and a fearsome interviewer.\u201d\n\nThe BBC said it received a statement from Mr. Frost\u2018s family saying it was devastated and asking \u201cfor privacy at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nMr. Frost began television hosting while still a student at Cambridge University. He went on to host the BBC\u2019s satirical news show \u201cThe Week That Was\u201d in the early 1960s and, later, a sketch show called \u201cThe Frost Report\u201d and a long-running BBC Sunday show, \u201cBreakfast With Frost.\u201d His signature, \u201cHello, good evening and welcome\u201d often was mimicked.\n\nWhile popular in Britain and beginning to launch a career on U.S. television, Mr. Frost did not become internationally known until 1977, when he secured a series of television interviews with Nixon.\n\nThe dramatic face-to-face was make-or-break both for him and for the ex-president, who was trying to salvage his reputation after resigning from the White House in disgrace following the Watergate scandal three years earlier. At the time, it was the most widely watched news interview in the history of TV.\n\nThe interviewer and his subject sparred through the first part of the interview, but Mr. Frost later said he realized he didn\u2019t have what he wanted as it wound down.\n\nNixon had acknowledged mistakes, but Mr. Frost pressed him on whether that was enough. Americans, he said, wanted to hear him own up to wrongdoing and acknowledge abuse of power \u2014 and \u201cunless you say it, you\u2019re going to be haunted for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was totally off the cuff,\u201d Mr. Frost later said. \u201cThat was totally ad-lib. In fact, I threw my clipboard down just to indicate that it was not prepared in any way \u2026 I just knew at that moment that Richard Nixon was more vulnerable than he\u2019d ever be in his life. And I knew I had to get it right.\u201d\n\nAfter more pressing, Mr. Nixon relented.\n\n\u201cI let the American people down, and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dramatic faceoff went on to spawn a hit play. And in 2008, a new generation was introduced to Mr. Frost\u2019s work with the Oscar-nominated movie \u201cFrost/Nixon,\u201d starring Michael Sheen as Mr. Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon.\n\nMr. Frost was born on Apr. 7, 1939, the son of a Methodist preacher. Besides hosting, he set up his own company, which gave birth to many more popular British programs.\n\n\u201cBreakfast With Frost\u201d ran on the BBC for 12 years until 2005, and the game show \u201cThrough the Keyhole\u201d from 1987 to 2008. He recently was working for Al-Jazeera International.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Veteran British journalist and broadcaster David Frost, who won fame around the world for his TV interviews with former President Richard Nixon, has died, his family told the BBC.
