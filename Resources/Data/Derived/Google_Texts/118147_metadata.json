Its neighbour became Daisy Duck, dyed many colours with its pre-tinted forelock teased into a pink bow.\n\n\n\nCreativity was critical at the national dog grooming competition, where cuteness and balance ruled over all.\n\n'Akermanis', the Stylish Standard Poodle, at the 2014 Pet Industry Expo.

The grooming competitions involved 52 dogs competing in categories ranging from creative and nail art, as well as a new round: Asian influence.\n\nGroomers had spent months preparing their dogs for each event, growing and dying their fur. They had two hours to cut their dog's fur into elaborate designs.\n\n\n\nNSW north coast groomer Tamara James, took first prize for transforming her poodle Akermanis into a surfer riding a wave, complete with a seagull-shaped tail and a tropical fish cut from his hind leg hair. For her, the win was the end of a long road of preparation.\n\nMs James had spent two years turning her dog's fur into dreadlocks and the past few months dying his coat in slabs of black and swathes of blue.\n\n\"We used hairspray, gel, hair colour and lots of product,\" Ms James said.\n\nStylist Joanne Davis, who entered the nail art category with dog Oscar, said grooming was becoming more popular in Australia.\n\n\"We want the dog to look their best,\" she said. \"The clients love it and it certainly gets the dog a lot of attention. The options for dogs now are just endless.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "With hairspray fumes and the whirr of razors in the air, the arena was just like any other hair salon, except the clients were on four legs and had no say in what they would look like.", "title": "Spruced up pooches take centre stage at Pet Expo's national dog grooming competition", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/spruced-up-pooches-take-centre-stage-at-pet-expos-national-dog-grooming-competition-20141011-114p18.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/h/s/x/8/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.114p18.png/1413076428263.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/h/s/x/8/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.114p18.png/1413076428263.jpg"}, "description": "With hairspray fumes and the whirr of razors in the air, the arena was just like any other hair salon, except the clients were on four legs and had no say in what they would look like.", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Spruced up pooches take centre stage at Pet Expo's national dog grooming competition"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "With hairspray fumes and the whirr of razors in the air, the arena was just like any other hair salon, except the clients were on four legs and had no say in ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe202b\"", "article_summary": "Creativity was critical at the national dog grooming competition, where cuteness and balance ruled over all.\nThey had two hours to cut their dog's fur into elaborate designs.\nStylist Joanne Davis, who entered the nail art category with dog Oscar, said grooming was becoming more popular in Australia.\nMs James had spent two years turning her dog's fur into dreadlocks and the past few months dying his coat in slabs of black and swathes of blue.\n\"We want the dog to look their best,\" she said."}
