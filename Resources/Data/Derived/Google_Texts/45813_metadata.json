Exhibit A: Eden Foods.\n\nLike Hobby Lobby, Eden Foods sued the Obama administration to try to get out of providing contraceptive coverage for its employees. Eden Foods is a Michigan-based business that bills itself as \u201cthe oldest natural and organic food company in North America.\u201d It is solely owned by Michael Potter, a Catholic who refers to birth control pills as \u201clifestyle drugs\u201d and likes to whine about \u201cunconstitutional government overreach.\u201d (More crazy quotes from him below.)\n\nIn Eden Foods Inc. v. Kathleen Sebelius, filed in federal court in March of 2013, the company claimed its religious freedom was being violated by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that employee health insurance cover birth control. The suit argued that \u201ccontraception or abortifacients \u2026 almost always involve immoral and unnatural practices.\u201d In October, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided against Eden Foods, ruling that a for-profit company cannot exercise religion.\n\nBut then, on June 30, the Supreme Court ruled in the Hobby Lobby case that family-owned, \u201cclosely held\u201d companies can use religion as an excuse to flout the birth control mandate. Eden Foods is one of a few dozen \u201cclosely held\u201d for-profit companies that have filed suit over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate. On July 1, the Supreme Court ordered the 6th Circuit Court to reconsider its decision against Eden Foods and another plaintiff with a similar case.\n\nOn its website, Eden Foods talks up its commitment to organic and local farming, social responsibility, and even the LEED green-building standards. \u201cOne of our founding principles is sustainability,\u201d says the company\u2019s marketing director, Sue Becker. \u201cIt guides us today.\u201d But it\u2019s a sad, desiccated version of sustainability that would deny women the ability to decide how many children to have, or whether to have children at all.\n\nIn April of last year, Potter made a bizarrely inept attempt to explain the reasoning behind his company\u2019s suit to Salon reporter Irin Carmon. From her article:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got more interest in good quality long underwear than I have in birth control pills,\u201d [Potter said.] \u2026 I \u2026 asked why he said he didn\u2019t care about birth control, since he filed a suit about it and all. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a man, number one and it\u2019s really none of my business what women do,\u201d Potter said. So, then, why bother suing? \u201cBecause I don\u2019t care if the federal government is telling me to buy my employees Jack Daniel\u2019s or birth control. What gives them the right to tell me that I have to do that? That\u2019s my issue, that\u2019s what I object to, and that\u2019s the beginning and end of the story.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get birth control out of Rite Aid or Wal-Mart, but don\u2019t tell me I gotta pay for it.\u201d But the federal government tells him to do a lot of things, I said. Why sue over this if he had no particular issue with contraception, as the suit \u2026 clearly alleges he does out of religious conviction? Well, he said, he opposes \u201cusing abortion as birth control, definitely.\u201d But the mandate doesn\u2019t cover abortion, I reminded him, only contraception, and emergency contraception is not abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s a morass,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert in anything. I\u2019m not the pope. I\u2019m in the food business. I\u2019m qualified to have opinions about that and not issues that are purely women\u2019s issues. I am qualified to have an opinion about what health insurance I pay for.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t go over so well with Eden Foods\u2019 liberal customers, many of whom took to the company\u2019s Facebook page to complain and call for a boycott. That prompted Potter to release a non-apology apology: \u201cWe apologize for the unintended consternation given rise to by this action.\u201d But it didn\u2019t prompt him to retract the suit.\n\nNow, in the wake of the Hobby Lobby ruling, there\u2019s a new round of complaints and boycott threats on the company\u2019s Facebook page and in the Twittersphere.\n\nBut Potter isn\u2019t bothering to faux-apologize this time. He told The Daily Telegram of Adrian, Mich., that he\u2019s \u201cgrateful\u201d for the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling. And, just in case there\u2019s any confusion about where he stands, he called President Obama a \u201cdictator\u201d who\u2019s trying to take away citizens\u2019 rights.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nRead followup post: Eden Foods hit by backlash for fighting Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/eden-food-cans.jpg?w=50", "sailthru.author": "Lisa Hymas", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "Just like Hobby Lobby, Eden Foods has sued the Obama administration, claiming its owner\u2019s religious rights should trump employees\u2019 rights to access contraception.", "title": "This organic food company is refusing to pay for employees\u2019 birth control", "url": "http://grist.org/politics/this-organic-food-company-is-refusing-to-pay-for-employees-birth-control/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/eden-food-cans.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/eden-food-cans.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "grist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-02 12:37:20", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "This organic food company is refusing to pay for employees\u2019 birth control", "msapplication-tooltip": "We're an online news organization that uses humor to interpret green issues & inspire environmental action.", "p": {"domain_verify": "c293daabda398bd8ceee45abea0b3201"}, "fb": {"app_id": 548917378618963}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Grist", "sailthru.tags": "article, business-technology, food, living, politics, lisa-hymas", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/grist.org", "published_time": "2014-07-02T16:37:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-17T15:44:57+00:00"}, "sailthru.description": "Just like Hobby Lobby, Eden Foods has sued the Obama administration, claiming its owner's religious rights should trump employees' rights to access contraception.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/eden-food-cans.jpg", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://grist.org/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/330e84b0272aae748d059cd70e3f8f8d?s=16", "description": "Just like Hobby Lobby, Eden Foods has sued the Obama administration, claiming its owner's religious rights should trump employees' rights to access contraception."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec86\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBecause I don\u2019t care if the federal government is telling me to buy my employees Jack Daniel\u2019s or birth control.\nLike Hobby Lobby, Eden Foods sued the Obama administration to try to get out of providing contraceptive coverage for its employees.\nFrom her article:\u201cI\u2019ve got more interest in good quality long underwear than I have in birth control pills,\u201d [Potter said.]\nOn its website, Eden Foods talks up its commitment to organic and local farming, social responsibility, and even the LEED green-building standards.\n\u2026 I \u2026 asked why he said he didn\u2019t care about birth control, since he filed a suit about it and all."}
