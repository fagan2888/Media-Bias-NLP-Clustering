And that\u2019s no exaggeration when you look at what they have accomplished in recent years.\n\nThe place they now call their professional home was once a fire station on Douglas Boulevard. Today the garage that housed fire trucks serves as both a synagogue and an area where youth are taught Jewish customs and heritage through classes as well as a daily pre-school.\n\nThe concrete and bricks are gone, replaced by finished walls, wood flooring and a large portrait of the Rebbe, the man who died 20 years ago and is credited with starting Chabad (a Hebrew acronym for wisdom, knowledge and understanding).\n\n\u201cWe were inspired by the Rebbe, the Hebrew term for Grand Rabbi. He\u2019s the founder of Chabad worldwide, from Kathmandu, Nepal to South America,\u201d Rabbi Korik said. \u201cHis idea to reach out to communities that may have nothing in the way of a formal Jewish presence really affected us.\u201d\n\nToday there are, by the Rabbi\u2019s estimate, about 3,500 Jewish residents in the South Placer area, and seven Chabad Houses in the greater Sacramento region.\n\nThe couple chose South Placer after meeting with a Sacramento Chabad leader while they were still in New York. Their eldest son, Mendel, was just seven weeks old. Today Mendel is 10, and he has 5 brothers and sisters, all of whom the Rabbi calls wonderful blessings.\n\nChabad House offers all manner of services, including a Jewish pre-school, funeral services, weddings and more. But the organization offers outreach to those in need, regardless of faith.\n\n\u201cAs a humanitarian group, Chabad is inspired to be there for all people, not to proselytize. We are here for anyone who needs help, be it hunger, homelessness, addiction \u2013 whatever the problem that someone might have,\u201d he said. \u201cChabad has drug rehab and homeless shelters all over the world.\u201d\n\nThe Rabbi and his wife place importance not only on being a presence for Jews, both in the area and to those who are considering relocation to South Placer, but also to educate those who may be of Jewish descent but do not know anything about the culture as well as those who are merely curious about the religion.\n\n\u201cMaybe they know that they have a great grandparent who was Jewish. We help them explore what their heritage is about and how it can impact their lives,\u201d the Rabbi said. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s human nature to create stereotypes or notions about others, certainly we encounter questions. People are curious. They may assume some things incorrectly and we see this as an important opportunity to break those stereotypes.\u201d\n\nGranite Bay resident Melissa Neumann was thrilled to relocate her family to a community where her kids could attend a Hebrew school.\n\n\u201cWe moved here in 2012 and I enrolled the boys in the school to learn Hebrew and their heritage,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cTradition and culture are what give us a connection to our ancestors and help us develop our own sense of Jewish identity.\u201d\n\nThe center offers weekly prayer service on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. They also offer classes for adults and children, including a Torah class that is held in a private home in Lincoln.\n\nThe center\u2019s Yiddish club is popular, teaching Jews and non-Jews the language and culture, including songs, arts and foods. There\u2019s a religious Sunday school for kids and a religious pre-school on weekdays.\n\nOf course, the center celebrates Jewish holidays with the community and offers social events and even a program about the Holocaust in spring.\n\nThe center will host their 10th annual Chanukah event, including Menorah lighting on Tuesday, Dec. 16 at Roseville Galleria.
