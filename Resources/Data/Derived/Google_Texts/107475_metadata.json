Since we\u2019ve heard no more about it in the intervening time I\u2019d assumed that this was just more taxpayer money down yet another rathole. (Hardly newsworthy anymore, sadly.) But this week the Times is back with an update and somebody in Congress apparently noticed the Oregon money pit and would like a word with a few folks in in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nA key House oversight panel is demanding that the Department of Health and Human Services turn over all documents related to the failed Cover Oregon health care information exchange, which was abandoned last year after the state spent an estimated $300 million of federal grant money to build it. The June 15 letter from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform seeks all communication between employees for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) about the Oregon site, all documents related to the site\u2019s functioning, and a description of changes CMS made to its processes on grants and information technology related to federal and state Obamacare websites. The letter signed by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and the panel chairman, notes that despite Cover Oregon having cost hundreds of millions only to be scrapped and have the state\u2019s Obamacare customers turned over to the federal healthcare.gov site, CMS in February 2011 \u201cidentified Oregon as an \u2018early innovator,\u2019 one of only seven states granted large sums of federal dollars to design reusable IT systems in hopes of providing a state-based exchange model for other states to follow.\u201d\n\nEDIT: Paragraph struck\n\nThe question is whether or not we get our money back if it was knowingly dumped to no purpose or to something corrupt. While it\u2019s not all that common, there is precedent aplenty for states being forced to pay back inappropriately allocated funds. Fairly recently Wisconsin was facing paying back federal grant money for for an economic development scheme which was supposed to lure a new employer to the state. The deal never went through and Wisconsin was on the hook for it. There are other examples, including many in New York for similarly failed programs.\n\nIf it can happen on a smaller scale such as those there seems no reason that Oversight shouldn\u2019t be able to send a bill to Oregon for at least part of the funds. The major problem there is that Oregon has no doubt already spent the money. (They\u2019re also in the process of being sued by a major software developer over the same deal.) So it looks like Kitzhaber may be gone, but the damage that he and his fiancee rang up isn\u2019t done being tallied yet.\n\nEDIT: (Jazz) The original version of this article incorrectly stated that Congressman Chaffetz was no longer in oversight. He actually had removed Mark Meadows from a subcommittee. Apologies for the error.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Did you keep your receipts?", "title": "Chaffetz to Oregon: say\u2026 you used a lot of fed tax money on that Obamacare site, didn\u2019t you?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/06/27/chaffetz-to-oregon-say-you-used-a-lot-of-fed-tax-money-on-that-obamacare-site-didnt-you/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-27T21:31:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-27T23:06:09+00:00"}, "keywords": "Cover Oregon, government waste, John Kitzhaber, ObamaCare, Oregon,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23f4\"", "article_summary": "Chaffetz to Oregon: say\u2026 you used a lot of fed tax money on that Obamacare site, didn\u2019t you?\nBut this week the Times is back with an update and somebody in Congress apparently noticed the Oregon money pit and would like a word with a few folks in in the Pacific Northwest.\nSince we\u2019ve heard no more about it in the intervening time I\u2019d assumed that this was just more taxpayer money down yet another rathole.\nWhile it\u2019s not all that common, there is precedent aplenty for states being forced to pay back inappropriately allocated funds.\nFairly recently Wisconsin was facing paying back federal grant money for for an economic development scheme which was supposed to lure a new employer to the state."}
