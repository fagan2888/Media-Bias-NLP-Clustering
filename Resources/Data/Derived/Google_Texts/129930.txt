Racists and xenophobes rejoice! Donald Trump is now polling stronger than ever, widening his lead even further over his Republican competitors for the presidential nomination. That’s according to a new poll conducted by the New York Times and CBS, which found that Trump is the top pick for 35 percent of Republicans around the country. That’s way ahead of Ted Cruz, at just 16 percent, and Ben Carson, at 13 percent.

Business Insider notes that the survey was conducted just ahead of Trump’s statement on Monday that Muslim immigration to the United States should be halted “until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”

But other polls conducted after Trump’s Islamophobic remarks show his anti-Muslim sentiments are likely to help him with his base. Business Insider cites a Bloomberg Politics/Purple Strategies PulsePoll which finds nearly two-thirds of likely Republican primary voters are in favor of Trump’s proposed Muslim ban. A Fox News survey of South Carolina Republicans found an 8 percent increase in support for Trump following those comments.
