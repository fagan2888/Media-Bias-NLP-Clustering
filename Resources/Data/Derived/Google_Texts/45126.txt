Fort Snelling State Park is one of nine sites around the state where opportunities for winter fat-bike riding have been expanded. Fat bikes are bicycles with large, low-pressure tires designed for travel on snow or sandy soil.

The park now has 6 miles of multiuse trails packed for nonmotorized recreation, including fat biking. The park is located on Post Road off State Hwy. 5, just west of the main terminal exit for Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Minnesota state parks and trails now have 78 miles suitable for winter fat-bike riding, according to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Other sites in the metro area include:

• Luce Line State Trail (Wayzata), with 7 miles of multiuse trails groomed for nonmotorized recreation.

• Gateway State Trail (St. Paul). The trail from Cayuga Street to Jamaica Avenue (11.9 miles) is open to winter biking, but east from Jamaica is groomed for cross-country skiing only.

The DNR advises people riding a fat bike to avoid snowmobile and cross-country ski trails, because almost all of those trails are not open to other uses during the winter. Skier and snowmobiler user fees pay for grooming and maintenance of these trails.
