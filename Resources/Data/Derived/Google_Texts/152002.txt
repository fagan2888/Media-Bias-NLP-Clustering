Costly building renovations at the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are raising more congressional concerns that the agency’s spending is out of control.

A government report pegs the price of the work at $215 million—that’s $120 million more than initial estimates, with off-site leasing costs included.

“That’s more per square foot than the Bellagio hotel-casino in Las Vegas,” said John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

Lawmakers have mocked the project, which includes a glass staircase, concession kiosk and a ‘water wall’ ending in a splash pool.
