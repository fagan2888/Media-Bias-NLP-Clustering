I don\u2019t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that\u2019ll do it every time. Donald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone. Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds. It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz after Donald Trump threatened earlier this week to \u2018spill the beans\u201d on Heidi Cruz\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is going to happen in the United States.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump on the TODAY Show following the suicide bombings in Brussels\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI would close up our borders until we figure out what is going on. Look at Brussels, look at Paris, look at so many cities that were great cities. Paris is almost as bad. Paris is no longer the City of Lights, Paris has a lot of problems. All you have to do is speak to the people who live there where the same thing has happened and they are in fear. The city is in fear. And we have to be smart in the United States.\u201d The U.S. is \u201ctaking in people without any real documentation. We don't know where they're from, who they are. They could be ISIS. They could be ISIS related. We just don't learn.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump on FOX\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant Al Qaeda or ISIS presence. We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s attacks in Brussels underscores this is a war. This is not a lone war. ISIS has declared jihad. It is way past time we have a president who will acknowledge this evil and will call it by its name and use the full force and fury to defeat ISIS. Until they are defeated, these attacks will continue. Their target is each and every one of us. We need a president who sets aside political correctness. We don\u2019t need another lecture about Islamophobia.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don't send a picture of yourself laughing while people have just been blown up at a level that...is the equivalent of September 11 to our allies.\u201d\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ripped into President Barack Obama for attending a baseball game in Cuba instead of jumping on his plane and coming home after the Brussels attacks. Republicans are criticizing Obama for staying in Cuba in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Belgium and going about his day as planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the time to be the leader. So much of politics and national security is a combination of symbolism and reality. The reality is that we did have that attack. It was unnerving to us, it was devastating in Europe.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, the symbolism is that the president stayed at the baseball game all day long where you would have thought he would have said, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got more business that I have to deal with, I wish you well,\u2019 get on the phone. We\u2019ve got to put together some kind of a bulletproof syndicate to deal with all this. There\u2019s a real urgency about it, and he has got to convey that, not just to the American people but to the world.\u2019\n\nTom Brokaw, the former anchor of NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News,\u201d criticized President Barack Obama for going to a baseball game in Cuba after learning about the Brussels terror attack\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters should support Hillary Clinton \u201cif you believe we\u2019ve finally come to the point where we can put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us and the seven years before that.\u201d\n\nBill Clinton at a campaign stop for his wife provided this gaffe\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe biggest difference today between the Left and Right, when it comes to racial issues, is that liberals tend to take the side of those blacks who are doing the wrong things \u2013 hoodlums the Left depicts as martyrs \u2013 while the Right defends those blacks more likely to be the victims of those hoodlums.\u201d\n\nSyndicated columnist Thomas Sowell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOUTRAGE OF THE WEEK\n\n\n\n\n\nObama dances while the world burns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOST UNDER-REPORTED STORY OF THE WEEK\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump isn't inevitable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOST OVER-HYPED STORY OF THE WEEK\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump's attacks on Ted Cruz and his wife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTRANGEST, MOST UNUSUAL STORY OF THE WEEK\n\n\n\n\n\nKids vs. prison inmates\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat money does to men\n\n\n\n\n\nPole dancing at 8 1/2 months pregnant\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.southmilwaukeenow.com/blogs/communityblogs/373572311.html", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/cni-share-logo.jpg", "height": 700}, "type": "article", "description": "Week-ends (03/26/16)", "title": "Week-ends (03/26/16)"}, "fb": {"app_id": 306563356138684}, "twitter": {"description": "Week-ends (03/26/16)", "title": "Week-ends (03/26/16)", "url": "http://www.franklinnow.com/blogs/communityblogs/373572311.html", "image": {"src": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/cni-share-logo.jpg"}, "site": "@MyCommunityNOW", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1", "title": "Week-ends (03/26/16)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29cb\"", "article_summary": "Look at Brussels, look at Paris, look at so many cities that were great cities.\nWeek-ends is a regular weekly feature of This Just In...\nI don\u2019t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that\u2019ll do it every time.\nAnd we have to be smart in the United States.\u201d The U.S. is \u201ctaking in people without any real documentation.\nWe need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.\u201dTed Cruz\u201cToday\u2019s attacks in Brussels underscores this is a war."}
