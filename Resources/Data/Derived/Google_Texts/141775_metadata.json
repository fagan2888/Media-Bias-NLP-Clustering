The pro-abortion feminist group released a list of 100 organizations that have filed lawsuits against the HHS mandate of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare.\n\nThat provision requires all but a narrowly defined group of religious organizations to provide contraception, sterilization, and abortifacient drugs to their employees with no co-pay. The Supreme Court ruled that the HHS mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act last month in a 5-4 decision.\n\nNOW made headlines by naming the Little Sisters of the Poor one of the \u201cDirty 100.\u201d Also on the list are several Catholic dioceses, the archbishop of Miami, several evangelical Christian universities, and the ministry of Dr. James Dobson.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\nLess reported was the fact that NOW likened the ecumenical belief that it is wrong to participate in potentially abortion-inducing \u201ccontraceptive\u201d practices with slavery, apartheid, and...the ecumenical belief that marriage is between one man and one woman:\n\n[T]here are some \u201cbeliefs,\u201d no matter how sincerely held, that should simply not be respected by the United States government or by any government. A \u201cbelief\u201d that works to the detriment of a specific demographic group that has historically been subjected to discrimination and oppression is simply a religious mask for bigotry. The world has rejected the religious \u201cbeliefs\u201d that were offered to justify the apartheid regime in South Africa. Our nation long ago rejected the Southern Baptist Association\u2019s religious \u201cbelief\u201d in slavery and segregation. And more recently, the religious \u201cbeliefs\u201d offered up in 2008 to justify California\u2019s Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage are now being roundly rejected. So it should be with the \u201cbelief\u201d that women can be singled out for restrictions on their access to preventive health care like contraception. (We note that Catholic doctrine considers vasectomy a sin, but the Catholic bishops have not been walking up and down the halls of Congress, or orchestrating federal lawsuits, to demand the government create special rules blocking men\u2019s access to that procedure.)\n\nThe feminist group encourages people to \u201c[s]tand with NOW and tell them it is not acceptable for employers to impose their personal beliefs on their employees.\u201d You may wish to keep these groups in mind when making your business, college, or donation plans.\n\nThey are:\n\nAmerican Family Association\n\nAmerican MFG Co\n\nAmerican Pulverizer Co\n\nAnnex Medical\n\nAutocam Corp\n\nAve Maria School of Law\n\nAve Maria University\n\nBarron Industries\n\nBeckwith Electric Co\n\nBelmont Abbey College\n\nBick Holdings, Inc.\n\nCherry Creek Mortgage Co\n\nCNS Ministries\n\nColorado Christian University\n\nConestoga Wood Specialities Corp\n\nContinuum Health Partnership/Management\n\nCriswell College\n\nDoboszenski & Sons\n\nDordt College\n\nDr. James Dobson\u2019s Family Talk\n\nEast Texas Baptist University\n\nEden Foods\n\nEncompass, Develop, Design & Construct LLC\n\nEternal Word Television Network Inc.\n\nFellowship of Catholic University\n\nFeltl & Co., Inc.\n\nFranciscan University of Steubenville\n\nFreshway Foods\n\nGilardi\n\nGrace College and Seminary\n\nGrote Industries\n\nHart electric LLC\n\nHastings Automotive\n\nHercules Industries Inc.\n\nHobby Lobby\n\nHolland Chevrolet\n\nInfrastructure Alternatives\n\nJohnson Welded Products\n\nKorte & Luitjohan Contractors\n\nLiberty University\n\nLindsay Rappaport and Postel LLC\n\nLittle Sisters of the Poor\n\nLouisiana College\n\nM&N Plastics\n\nMersino Management Company\n\nMichigan Catholic Conference\n\nMK Chambers Company\n\nO\u2019Brien Industrial Holdings\n\nOzinga\n\nPaul Wieland\n\nPriests for Life\n\nQC Group Inc.\n\nRandy Reed Automotives\n\nReaching Souls International\n\nRight to Life Michigan\n\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta\n\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of New York\n\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Beaumont\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Biloxi\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Dallas\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Erie\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Fort-Wayne \u2013 South Bend\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Nashville\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh\n\nSchool of the Ozarks\n\nSeneca Hardwood\n\nSharpe Holdings, Inc.\n\nSioux Chief MFG Co\n\nSMA LLC\n\nSouthern Nazarene University\n\nThe Most Reverend Thomas Wenski\n\nTonn and Blank Construction\n\nTrijicon, Inc.
