If it weren’t for that pesky thing called journalism ethics and professionalism, former “View” co-host Barbara Walters could have been, by her estimation, “Mrs. Clint Eastwood.”

The two shared an awkward moment in a 1982 interview, but Walters denied his advances. She recalled the flirtatious encounter on “The Tonight Show,” telling Jimmy Fallon, “He was very flirtatious, and I was very taken (with him). He asked me if I wanted to have dinner … and I said, ‘No, I have to work.’ You know, I don’t mix business with pleasure.”

Decades later, filled with renewed hope, Walters ran into Eastwood at the “Jersey Boys” premiere to see if there was still a spark. “I thought maybe it’s not too late,” she explained. “I’m not kidding. I really did. I put on the right outfit. The false eyelashes — the whole thing.”
