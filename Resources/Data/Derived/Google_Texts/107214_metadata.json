Green Energy, gay rights and ObamaCare. Especially ObamaCare, because it was Obama's political oxygen.\n\nIt had to take priority.\n\nIn another indicator of how low a priority veterans have with this administration, a whistleblower in Atlanta has revealed that VA employees were switched from processing VA applications to those of the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare. He later appeared on the Neil Cavuto show and claimed that 17,000 applications for VA Healthcare were destroyed. He also said they\u2019re \u201calso looking into a backlog of over 600,000 pending applications for VA Healthcare.\u201d Davis said the applications were purged as a way to deal with pressure from Washington D.C. Cavuto: How is that performance measured? Davis: That performance is measured based on our ability to turn around an application from beginning to end within a five-day turn around. There\u2019s an acceptable percentage that we have to have, which is in excess of 80% for all applications that comes into that office. What you find is that there\u2019s extensive pressure on the staff to process applications, to focus our attention to applications based on specific campaigns. For example, I shared with your producer that we actually put incoming applications aside so we could focus on the ACA related applications that came in over last summer. That\u2019s wrong. We should treat each veteran equally and focus on applications, as they come in, not because of special campaigns coming out of D.C.\n\nUnfortunately Obama Inc. doesn't care about veterans, it cares about its ideological priorities and those always come first.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Obama's ideological priorities always come first.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Obama's ideological priorities always come first.", "title": "VA Switched to Processing ObamaCare Applications", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/235595/va-switched-processing-obamacare-applications-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:44:54-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/235595/va-switched-processing-obamacare-applications-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Obama's ideological priorities always come first.", "card": "summary", "title": "VA Switched to Processing ObamaCare Applications"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-03T16:00:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:44:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d2b\"", "article_summary": "In another indicator of how low a priority veterans have with this administration, a whistleblower in Atlanta has revealed that VA employees were switched from processing VA applications to those of the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare.\nHe later appeared on the Neil Cavuto show and claimed that 17,000 applications for VA Healthcare were destroyed.\nIt's all about priorities and the VA had the same priorities as the rest of Obama Inc.
