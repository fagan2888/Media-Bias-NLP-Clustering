The latest example is the portrayal of the five Taliban officials traded for Bowe Bergdahl.\n\nThe media of course has an incentive to accentuate controversy. In the Bergdahl deal, this includes portraying the five Taliban prisoners as, in Sen. John McCain\u2019s words, \u201chard-core jihadists responsible for 9/11.\u201d McCain is wrong, but the major news outlets don\u2019t care. Over and over again, the five are identified as terrorists. Facts take a backseat to drama and conflict.\n\nPresident Obama fed this narrative:\n\nIn terms of potential threats, the release of the Taliban who were being held in Guant\u00e1namo was conditioned on the Qataris keeping eyes on them and creating a structure in which we can monitor their activities. We will be keeping eyes on them. Is there a possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely.\n\nThe media simply takes the government\u2019s word that the five Taliban figures are international terrorists. But the Taliban is not al-Qaeda. It is the theocratic government overthrown by U.S. forces. So when Taliban insurgents attack American forces, it is not terrorism but war\u2014war that the U.S. government started.\n\nThere have been a few hints that the prisoners are not accurately described. A rare example came from the government\u2019s former chief prosecutor at the American prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, retired Air Force Colonel Morris Davis. Davis punctured the \u201chardest of the hardcore\u201d narrative when he said:\n\nWe had screened all of the detainees and we had focused on about 75 that had the potential to be charged with a crime. When I saw the names [of those traded] \u2026 [I] wasn\u2019t familiar with any of these names.\u2026 If we could have proven that they had done something wrong that we could prosecute them for I\u2019m confident we would have done it, and we didn\u2019t.\n\nIn fact, the story behind the five Taliban prisoners reflects poorly on the U.S. government\u2019s conduct of its supposedly good war. Maybe that\u2019s why this story gets so little attention.\n\nBefore being captured, these Taliban officers were treated as potential allies by the CIA or the U.S.\u2013installed government of Hamid Karzai. Anand Gopal, author of No Good Men Among the Living: America, the Taliban, and the War Through Afghan Eyes, writes:\n\nAll five of the swapped prisoners were initially captured while trying to cut deals, and \u2026 three had been attempting to join, or had already joined, the Afghan government at the time of their arrest. This history shows that the categories we take as rigid and unchanging, such as \u201cterrorist,\u201d are in fact remarkably fluid in the context of Afghan politics. Uncovering the stories of these men tells us much about Guantanamo, the Taliban, and the possibility of a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\nHow did these men end up in U.S. custody? The U.S. government offered attractive bounties to Afghans who turned alleged Taliban and al-Qaeda members over to American authorities. This created a strong incentive to rat out personal enemies, rival warlords, and others, many of whom had nothing to do with the Afghan insurgency or international terrorism. Many were sent to Guant\u00e1namo.\n\nFor example, Gopal writes, Mohammad Nabi Omari, who was part of the Bergdahl exchange,\n\nwas a small-time commander linked to pro-Taliban strongman Jalaluddin Haqqani in the 1990s. After 2001, he was among the many Haqqani followers who switched allegiances to the Karzai government.\u2026 [Omari] and other former Haqqani commanders began working for the CIA.\u2026 Some Afghan officials in Khost allege that Omari reaped profits from falsely accusing others of al Qaeda membership. If so, he certainly accrued enemies, and in September 2002, he, too, was accused of insurgent membership by rival warlords and politicians, despite being publicly aligned with the Karzai government.\n\nHis next stop was Guant\u00e1namo.\n\n\u201cInstead of being recalcitrant terrorists bent on fighting America, this history indicates that all five can make pragmatic deals if the conditions are right,\" wrote Gopal.\n\nThe U.S. invasion and occupation of Afghanistan was a war of choice, not necessity. American forces made it worse by indiscriminately placing a price on the head of any Afghan whom someone else was willing to destroy.\n\nThis article originally appeared at the Future of Freedom Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The story behind the five Taliban prisoners reflects poorly on the U.S. government.", "title": "The Media Is Misleading Americans About the Bergdahl Swap", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/06/11/the-media-is-misleading-americans-about", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14024521868483.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14024521868483.jpg", "description": "The story behind the five Taliban prisoners reflects poorly on the U.S. government.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Media Is Misleading Americans About the Bergdahl Swap"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-06-11T12:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/sheldon-richman"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "In the Bergdahl deal, this includes portraying the five Taliban prisoners as, in Sen.
