An Anderson man started his day with a cup of coffee and a lottery ticket.

But it was the ticket that gave him a jolt, winning $300,000.

“I feel great,” he said seated with his girlfriend awaiting his prize money.

“She’s my soon-to-be wife,” he said turning toward her.

“Let’s get a house first,” she proposed.

Two top prizes of $300,000 remain in the $10 Mighty Jumbo Bucks game, at odds of 1 in 750,000.

For selling the claimed ticket, High Volume 2 in Anderson received a commission of $3,000.
