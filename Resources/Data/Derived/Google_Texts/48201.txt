ASPEN, Colo. (AP) — The Aspen City Council has approved a new law that will require construction contractors to keep the noise down in the summertime as part of an effort to get people to spend more time outdoors in warmer months.

The measure could require builders to put up sound-blocking walls.

According to the Aspen Daily News (http://bit.ly/1nHeF2W ), temporary sound-blocking walls were used in Aspen near the Pitkin County Courthouse as a part of the recent Galena Plaza work and at several residential construction projects.

Last summer, contractors were required to file plans to reduce landfill waste and minimize traffic and parking. They were also ordered to limit detours on streets and sidewalks.
