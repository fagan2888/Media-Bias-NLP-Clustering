One troublesome sentence: \u201cIt takes a two-thirds majority of the council to force (emphasis mine) amendments to the annual budget, although Hancock typically has accepted some revisions requested by the council and has incorporated its annual budget priorities.\u201d\n\nFor more than 100 years, Denver\u2019s constitution required a super-majority (nine votes out of 13) to amend the city budget. No override provision was necessary. Budgets were seldom amended, except for non-controversial items.\n\nIn March 1991, the voters of Denver approved a charter change that normalized this unique system. American laws are passed with a simple majority; vetoes require a super-majority. Only once since March 1991 has any controversial amendment to our city budget been presented.\n\nCarol Boigon sponsored such an amendment during the Webb administration. She secured 10 votes for her wish to add personnel to the police deptartment. The word \u201cveto\u201d was not uttered by the mayor\u2019s office. Since only one such amendment has been presented during the past 20 years, council members have ignored their new power. They must have thought Mayors John Hickenlooper and Michael Hancock were flawless city managers \u2014 an amazing fact, if it were true.\n\nAmending a government budget is a very common practice. The word \u201cforce,\u201d as used in this article, reads like an editorial comment rather than a news item. There is not much \u201cforcing\u201d going on if only one controversial amendment pops up in more than 20 years.\n\nI hope the new council members understand the power that had been given to them in 1991, and that they use it wisely.\n\nCathy Donohue is a retired member of the Denver City Council.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Amending a budget is a common practice", "title": "Guest Commentary: Amending a budget is a common practice", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/31/guest-commentary-amending-a-budget-is-a-common-practice/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150731__20150802_Z00_OP02G_DONOHUEp1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150731__20150802_Z00_OP02G_DONOHUEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-31T10:06:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T04:06:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Cathy Donohue is a retired member of the Denver City Council.\nOnly once since March 1991 has any controversial amendment to our city budget been presented.\nAmending a government budget is a very common practice.\nSince only one such amendment has been presented during the past 20 years, council members have ignored their new power.\nIn March 1991, the voters of Denver approved a charter change that normalized this unique system."}
