(Elections Code section 9004(a).)\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHarris has until May 4 to prepare the initiative and forward it to the Secretary of State. Once the bill reaches the Secretary of State\u2019s office, backers would have 90 days to secure the 365,000 signatures needed to be placed on the 2016 ballot.\n\nMatt McLaughlin, a lawyer from Huntington Beach, created the initiative and paid the $200 filing fee on Feb. 26. The initiative\u2019s language states it is \u201cbetter that offenders should die rather than that all of us should be killed by God\u2019s just wrath,\u201d adding that anyone making sexual contact with someone of the same gender be executed by \u201cbullets to the head or by any other convenient method.\u201d\n\nThe bill calls homosexual activity, \u201ca monstrous evil that Almighty God, giver of freedom and liberty, commands us to suppress on pain of our utter destruction even as he overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha.\u201d\n\nIf the state refuses to implement the provisions of the bill, the bill states, \u201cthe general public is empowered and deputized to execute all the provisions hereunder extra-judicially, immune from any charge and indemnified by the state against any and all liability.\u201d In addition, anyone supporting gay rights to minors would spend 10 years in prison and be forced to leave the state.\n\nThe state Supreme Court can keep measures off the ballot if they violate the California Constitution.\n\nThe Chronicle reports that Sen. Richard Lara, D-Bell Gardens (Los Angeles County), called for McLaughlin\u2019s disbarment, arguing, \u201cI support freedom of speech, but calling for state-sanctioned execution of a protected class calls into question the proponent\u2019s character and judgment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Law, California Must Circulate 'Shoot the Gays' Referendum", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "By Law, California Must Circulate 'Shoot the Gays' Referendum", "title": "By Law, California Must Circulate 'Shoot the Gays' Referendum - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/demonstration-for-gay-marriage-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/03/19/by-law-california-must-circulate-shoot-the-gays-referendum/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By Law, California Must Circulate 'Shoot the Gays' Referendum", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/demonstration-for-gay-marriage-AP.jpg", "title": "By Law, California Must Circulate 'Shoot the Gays' Referendum - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ballot Initiaitive, Gays, Kamala Harris, Matt McLaughlin,Breitbart California, Weird News,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "Matt McLaughlin", "published_time": "2015-03-19T08:17:42-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California,Weird News"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8bf\"", "article_summary": ")\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHarris has until May 4 to prepare the initiative and forward it to the Secretary of State.\nThe state Supreme Court can keep measures off the ballot if they violate the California Constitution.\nMatt McLaughlin, a lawyer from Huntington Beach, created the initiative and paid the $200 filing fee on Feb. 26.\nOnce the bill reaches the Secretary of State\u2019s office, backers would have 90 days to secure the 365,000 signatures needed to be placed on the 2016 ballot.\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s website notes: \u201cUpon receipt of the fee and request, the Attorney General will prepare a circulating title and summary, which will be the official summary of the initiative measure."}
