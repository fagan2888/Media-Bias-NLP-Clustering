The U.N. secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, has advocated for LGBT equality but faced opposition from African, Arab and Muslim states as well as Russia and China.\u201d\n\nIt seems as though other countries aren\u2019t so open-minded on transgender rights.\n\nSamantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., has taken issue with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups being blocked from the meeting and wrote to the UN\u2019s general assembly President Morgens Lykketoft: \u201cGiven that transgender people are 49 times more likely to be living with HIV than the general population, their exclusion from the high-level meeting will only impede global progress in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned that at every negotiation on a new general assembly gathering, the matter of NGO [non-governmental organization] participation is questioned and scrutinized,\u201d Mrs. Power wrote.\n\nHmm. She wants the decision to be \u201cquestioned and scrutinized.\u201d The language seems pretty soft, especially compared to the words President Obama has used to criticize Republicans for their opposition to his transgender bathroom policy.\n\nIn an interview Monday with Buzzfeed News, Mr. Obama said anyone opposed to his bathroom directive, in essence, supported childhood bullying.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about kids, and anybody who\u2019s been in school, been in high school, who\u2019s been a parent, I think should realize that kids who are sometimes in the minority \u2014 kids who have a different sexual orientation or are transgender \u2014 are subject to a lot of bullying, potentially they are vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think that it is part of our obligation as a society to make sure that everybody is treated fairly, and our kids are all loved, and that they\u2019re protected and that their dignity is affirmed.\u201d\n\nThen Wednesday, after further criticism of the issued order, White Press Secretary Josh Earnest called out Republicans for being obsessed with sex.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Republicans in the Congress that have created a special congressional committee to take a look at Planned Parenthood,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cIt\u2019s Republicans who have sued the administration over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including as it relates to women being able to get access to their birth control.\u201d\n\nOfficials in several states have said they will fight the administration\u2019s guidance, which requires schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom relating to their gender identity rather than the gender on their birth certificate. Schools that don\u2019t comply with the directive face the risk of losing federal funding.\n\nU.S. taxpayers fund more than one-fifth of the U.N.\u2019s budget, yet no funding threats are issued after confirmed reports of LGBT mistreatment and murdering from member nations.\n\nFor example, in Saudi Arabia, if a person comes out online, they could face the death penalty. In Russia, president Vladimir Putin signed an anti-gay law banning \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations.\u201d In Turkey, top government officials have called being gay a \u201cdisease\u201d and films frequently depict the murder of LGBT persons as \u201chonor killings.\u201d\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "If President Obama really wants to improve the rights of LGBT persons, he should look externally and take a hard line against those countries that are murdering this population on a daily basis, instead of looking internally and picking a fight with Republicans.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "If President Obama really wants to improve the rights of LGBT persons, he should look externally and take a hard line against those countries that are murdering this population on a daily basis, instead of looking internally and picking a fight with Republicans.", "title": "Obama\u2019s transgender hypocrisy", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/18/obamas-transgender-hypocrisy/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/17/aptopix_lgbt_one_school.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/17/aptopix_lgbt_one_school.jpeg", "description": "If President Obama really wants to improve the rights of LGBT persons, he should look externally and take a hard line against those countries that are murdering this population on a daily basis, inste", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s transgender hypocrisy"}, "Author": "Kelly Riddell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, United Nations"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb922\"", "article_summary": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:I wonder how the United Nations would feel about instituting President Obama\u2019s transgender bathroom guidance in their New York City headquarters.\nShe wants the decision to be \u201cquestioned and scrutinized.\u201d The language seems pretty soft, especially compared to the words President Obama has used to criticize Republicans for their opposition to his transgender bathroom policy.\nIf it\u2019s policy blocking gay and transgender groups from attending its next meeting regarding the AIDS epidemic is any indication, it\u2019s safe to say the U.N. wouldn\u2019t be too keen on the idea.\nA group of 51 Muslim states has banned 11 gay and transgender organizations from participating in a high-level meeting at the U.N. next month about ending AIDS, according to a report from the Guardian.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Republicans in the Congress that have created a special congressional committee to take a look at Planned Parenthood,\u201d Mr."}
