(bit.ly/1o3jfH9)\n\nUK lawmakers in December gave their final approval to reforms aimed at tackling structural failings at banks, that came to light following the 2007/8 financial crisis and a series of mis-selling and rate-fixing scandals.\n\nThe main feature of the bill was a rule to force banks to separate their retail and investment activities.\n\nFollowing the government's decision, Britain's competition watchdog in July said it would most likely launch an 18-month long in-depth investigation into bank services for small business customers and personal accounts later this year because of a lack of competition in the industry.\n\nSky said HSBC was concerned that the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) could call for structural reforms, including a disposal of operations, on which it is already spending significant sums in preparation for the introduction of ring-fencing rules.\n\nCMA, which has the power to order a break up of banks considered too dominant, will decide in autumn whether to launch the full investigation.\n\nHSBC could not immediately be reached for a comment outside of regular business hours in the UK.\n\nPrudential Regulation Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey, and Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee and Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PCBS), had also received Flint's letter, Sky said.\n\n(Reporting
