While Republicans may have been the target of much of the president\u2019s sarcasm and mockery, Obama saved a few choice lines for his fellow head of state, Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn the section of his address dedicated to foreign policy, Obama claimed credit for the dire condition of the Russian economy, which is suffering primarily because of falling oil prices. He also took a swipe at Republicans who, sometimes subtly, sometimes not, suggested after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year that Vladimir Putin was a stronger leader than Obama.\n\nRelated: Putin Suffers a One-Two Punch on Sanctions and Bonds\n\n\u201cWe are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re upholding the principle that bigger nations can\u2019t bully the small \u2013 by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine\u2019s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.\n\n\u201cLast year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s how America leads \u2013 not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks did not go unnoticed in the Kremlin. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking Wednesday at a press conference said, \u201cWe hear from our Western partners that Russia has to be isolated. Specifically, Barack Obama has just repeated that. These attempts won\u2019t be effective. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia will never resort to self-isolation.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Plan B \u2013 Blame U.S. for Russia\u2019s Woes\n\nLavrov blasted the U.S. for a foreign policy stance that, he said, could be paraphrased as, \u201c\u2019We are number one and everyone else has to recognize that.\u2019\u201d The U.S., he continued, \u201c[W]ants\u2026to dominate the world and not merely be first among equals.\u201d\n\nHe spoke in Moscow before traveling to Berlin to meet with the foreign affairs representatives of Ukraine, France and Germany. The meeting is part of an effort to secure a cease-fire in Ukraine, where Russia-backed rebels have been trying to carve out an independent republic since shortly after Russian troops invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula last year and subsequently declared it part of Russia.\n\nToeing the Kremlin party line, Lavrov on Wednesday denied that Russia is actively supporting Ukrainian rebels. He also described the mounting tension in Ukraine, where the intensity of fighting has spiked in the last month, as the fault of the U.S. and its allies, going so far as to imply that the U.S. is trying to start another Cold War.\n\nRelated: State of the Union 2015 \u2013 Text of the President\u2019s Speech\n\n\u201cNATO followed the US in its drive for confrontation. NATO made an absolutely politicized decision to halt civil and military cooperation. Almost all projects have been frozen,\u201d Lavrov said. However, he said, the Putin government \u201cwill not allow a new Cold War.\u201d\n\nLavrov was expected to propose a cease fire in Ukraine on Wednesday, a position seemingly at odds with reports that Russia continues to supply troops and advanced weapons to the rebels. Lavrov dismissed such claims as \u201cabsolute nonsense.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama didn\u2019t just go after Republicans in his State of the Union Address Tuesday.
