It was shocking still to see it all in high definition on YouTube \u2013 multiple times. But what is yet even more shocking is how the Gruberian gymnastics required by ObamaCare are the tip of an iceberg which has been growing for 30 years. On December 9th, Republican Representative Darrell Issa will convene a hearing of the House Oversight Committee at which Gruber is expected to testify. The topics at hand should include more than just ObamaCare \u2013 the tip of the Gruberian iceberg.\n\nThat 70\u2019s Show: The Misery Index\n\nThose who are old enough to remember the 1970\u2019s \u2013 you know, back when we had only three national news outlets on TV \u2013 will probably recall the \u201cmisery index.\u201d This was the combination of, inflation, unemployment, and interest rates. It was the media\u2019s effort to take what President Carter called a \u201cmalaise\u201d and stick a number on it. It is hard to overstate how politically potent this was. It was a single number that measured the social and political dynamics which came to a head in 1980 when Ronald Reagan was elected President.\n\nWhen we look at these numbers \u2013 and what has been done with them over the past 30 years \u2013 it becomes clear that Gruberianism is nothing new. We just have a name and face for it now. And we also discover that the Grubercrats certainly do not have a monopoly on this nonsense. The Grubericans are equally, if not more complicit.\n\nLet\u2019s start with inflation and the Consumer Price Index. After 1945 this was called the \u201cCost of Living Index.\u201d It was used primarily to adjust Social Security benefits, measuring the cost of living by the price of a fixed basket of goods and services. The underlying idea is that a consumer has a \u201cstandard of living\u201d and is out of pocket a certain amount of money in maintaining that standard of living. The index measured how much more out of pocket the consumer was, year over year.\n\nIn the 1990s, to lower the fiscal impact of Social Security and other federal programs by lowering benefit growth \u2013 but without actually having to vote to do so \u2013 the Grubericans and Grubercrats together with their Gruberian economists touted a \u201cmore accurate\u201d CPI which allowed for the substitution of cheaper products in the \u201cbasket\u201d used to calculate the number. For example, if the price of steak were to rise, the consumer might settle for hamburger instead. They dressed this up as a \u201cConsumer Satisfaction Index.\u201d Now just imagine the price of hamburger rising for the fixed income pensioner \u2013 and they have to be \u201csatisfied\u201d with dog food instead \u2013 and you have the logical end of this substitution model.\n\nAs if this were not enough, the Bureau of Labor Statistics introduced a Gruberian tweak: \u201chedonic\u201d quality adjustments. If the price of gasoline were increased because of required additives to the gas, that increase would not be counted in the CPI because it supposedly reflected an increase in \u201cquality\u201d \u2013 even though the consumer had no choice in the matter and was still out of packet the extra few cents per gallon. Textbooks were considered of better quality if they had color pictures in them, even though the student could care less in the face of ever-increasing textbook costs.\n\nThe result for inflation is a relatively stable discrepancy since 1999 of 7.1 \u2013 7.2 percent underreporting in the \u201cheadline\u201d rate. Simply put, when the Grubereaucrats report inflation to us at 2.0 percent, the real rate of inflation in \u201cout-of-pocket-to-maintain-your-standard-of-living\u201d terms is 9.1 to 9.2 percent.\n\nWhy This Matters: Interest Rates\n\nAt the end of the day \u201cstandard of living\u201d is about \u201cpurchasing power.\u201d Even if your dollar \u2013 which once had the power to buy you steak for dinner \u2013 now only has the power to buy you hamburger at roughly the same price, the forced substitution is still a reduction in your \u201cstandard of living.\u201d When prices go up, purchasing power goes down and standard of living is lost. So when money is lent out, the first question for the lender is how badly eroded that purchasing power will be during the term of the loan.\n\nTake a 16 oz. bottle of Coke going for $2 from the machine in the break room: Two dollars today represents 100 percent of the power needed to purchase that bottle of Coke. If, in 10 years, that price will double to $4 (a 10 percent annual rate of inflation), that same $2 will only be one-half of the needed purchasing power. When prices double, purchasing power declines by half.\n\nSo if I were to look over our shared cubicle wall and ask you to lend me $2 \u2013 and allow me to pay you back 10 years from now \u2013 you would have to set terms on that deal to make sure your $2 became $4 over those 10 years. That would require 10 percent interest (or the \u201ccoupon\u201d rate in bond terms): 10 percent of $2 is $0.20. Paid annually over 10 years, $0.20 per year becomes $2. When the original loan of $2 (the face value of the bond) is added to the coupon payments after 10 years by \u201credeeming\u201d the bond \u201cat par\u201d you now have the $4 you need to buy that same 16 oz. bottle of Coke.\n\nBut 10 year rates are in the 2 percent ballpark today, not 10 percent. The only way this makes sense is if you artificially suppress the inflation rate. If the CPI reflected an accurate, \u201cout-of-pocket-to-maintain-your-standard-of-living\u201d rate of 9.2 percent, the interest charged to borrowers like the federal government would have to at least match that rate. And at $18T of public debt, the impact of rates more than quadrupling like that would be catastrophic to the ability of politicians to keep making promises that cannot possibly be kept \u2013 ObamaCare merely being the latest in a 30+ year series of such Gruberian promises.\n\nUnemployment: The Ultimate in Gruberian Numbers Games\n\nA common aphorism about unemployment says that there really are only two possible numbers. If you have a job, the unemployment rate is 0 percent. And if you don\u2019t it is 100 percent. While pithy, all one has to do is watch as their kids approach adulthood to realize this how little sense this makes.\n\nBut while inflation is the magic number behind things like interest rates and indices of government benefits, the unemployment rate measures the actual economic condition of ordinary Americans more than any other number \u2013 and is thus the lynchpin of political fortunes for both the Grubercrats and Grubericans \u2013 and their ability to keep making promises that cannot possibly be kept.\n\nThis metric is easier to understand. Since 1994 the Bureau of Labor Statistics has basically defined out of existence those who are considered \u201clong-term discouraged\u201d \u2013 meaning those who have been out of work longer than 12 months and have given up looking for a job \u2013 from the \u201cheadline\u201d rate. They retain two numbers: the \u201cU3\u201d \u2013 or headline \u2013 rate reported by the media, and the \u201cU6\u201d rate which includes the \u201cshort-term discouraged\u201d \u2013 those who have given up, but who have been out of a job less than 12 months.\n\nThe average American probably knows someone unemployed and who would qualify under the \u201clong-term discouraged\u201d rubric. This only highlights how completely divorced from reality the Gruberian numbers have become.\n\nAnd the real numbers tell an appalling story. As of October 2014, the unemployment rate is a shocking 23 percent when the numbers include both short-term and long-term discouraged workers. This aligns well with the \u201clabor force participation rate\u201d of under 63 percent \u2013 the lowest since the mid-70\u2019s. The popular excuse for this is the retirement of the Baby Boomers. But the 55+ labor force participation rate has increased from the mid-70\u2019s (about 34 percent) to around 40 percent today. Not only can\u2019t the Baby Boomer age bracket account for the decline, but the increase in labor force participation by \u201cretirees\u201d is likely out of necessity as miniscule interest rates paired with near 10 percent real inflation robs them of their savings. Remaining in the workforce is the only way to make ends meet.\n\nEven if we include only the short-term discouraged, the unemployment rate is 11.5 percent. The headline rate of 5.8 percent is a fiction of the Gruberian imagination.\n\nThe Tip of the Gruberian Iceberg\n\nObamaCare is only the latest \u2013 the tip of the iceberg \u2013 in a 30+ year game of statistical manipulations designed to avoid a repeat of the political overhaul led by Ronald Reagan. The Gruberian deception centers on the three numbers which made up the misery index of the 70\u2019s: inflation, interest rates and unemployment. Suppressing inflation stats allows the Federal Reserve to justify its Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) and \u201cprinting\u201d money to buy government and mortgage bonds guarantees the bond market will not point out that the emperor has no clothes.\n\nHaving rejected the \u201cCulture of Experts\u201d in 2014, if the American public can get past their statistical lies, 2016 just may harken an awakening to the truth: Inflation of around 10 percent, the Federal Reserve\u2019s turning the free market into a den of thieves, and the resulting 23 percent unemployment. Representative Issa should begin this awakening in his House hearings on ObamaCare.\n\nCan you say \u201cMisery Index?\u201d\n\n(Statistics for this article were drawn from copyrighted subscription content at http://www.shadowstats.com/)", "article_metadata": {"description": "2016 just may be an awakening to the truth: Inflation at 10%, Fed Res turning the free market into a den of thieves, and 23 percent unemployment.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "John H.
