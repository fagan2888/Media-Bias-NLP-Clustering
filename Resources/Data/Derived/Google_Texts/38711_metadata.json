The very vast majority of Americans are not as fortunate. John Oliver, fellow Brit, comedian, and host of Last Week Tonight, said Sunday in a skit about Big Pharma that the cost of drug spending in the U.S. last year \u201cworks out to be about a thousand dollars per person.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why my biannual trek is so important. Though it\u2019s nice to see friends and family, they are not the point. The drugs are. Without them, it would be worthless. I wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy my loved ones anyway. Without my pills I would barely be able to stand, let alone walk. I wouldn\u2019t be able to string a sentence together. Vocal as I would be, it would be mostly groans of agony and then sudden clashes of curse words.\n\nZack Whittaker About Zack Whittaker is a New York-based freelancer who writes mostly about security for ZDNet and CNET. You can follow him on Twitter @zackwhitaker.\n\nI suffer from severe Tourette\u2019s syndrome. The hallmark \u201cswearing tic,\u201d seen as a common trait of the condition, is by far the least of my troubles. The symptoms can be so bad that my arms flail out and hit walls and people. And when there isn\u2019t anyone else around none other than my own my crotch bears the brunt of my body\u2019s abuse. My legs will shake so intensely that the muscles burn. My head jerks and throws itself back\u2014sideways, frontwards, and any other way it can as though it\u2019s an oversized cantaloupe attached to a Slinky toy.\n\nTourette\u2019s won\u2019t kill me\u2014at least not directly\u2014but it does affect my ability to function properly. But there is good news. Mercifully, I can be brought back from this jibbering, flubbering, and dribbling mess for a mere $12 every six months\u2014the cost of a large and complicated mug of Starbucks coffee (and a pastry on the side).\n\nBut not in America. Here in New York, where I live and work, to fill my prescription at any pharmacy in the city would cost just shy of $720 per month. And that figure is one of the cheapest \u201cquotes\u201d I\u2019ve heard in my quest; the price varies depending on where you go in the city. Some pharmacies further out into Queens and Brooklyn will sometimes charge as low as $548 for a month\u2019s supply of the correct dosage, but the figure can fluctuate wildly.\n\nI\u2019m in my 20s, making ends meet as a writer. Needless to say, I cannot pay those prices. But here\u2019s a fact you may not expect: I have health insurance. It\u2019s just my health insurance won\u2019t help.\n\nThe root of the problem is this: There is no generic version of my medicine available in America.\n\nAnd as it turns out, that\u2019s the rub. You see, America\u2019s health insurance system is uniquely bizarre. Here\u2019s a common phenomenon: You are prescribed an expensive, name-brand drug by your doctor, but before your insurance will pay for it, it requires you to try a less costly or generic version first. If those don\u2019t work, your insurance will consider covering the cost of the more expensive drug. This process is called \u201cstep therapy\u201d. But you see, if there isn\u2019t a generic version available, you may not be covered at all. The insurance company may simply require you to take a totally different drug that\u2019s cheaper. If you need what\u2019s on the prescription, you might have to pay full price for it. It depends entirely on your insurance.\n\nI arrived in America just as Obamacare was rolling out. Since I couldn\u2019t meet the deadline for insurance, I sought out private health coverage through a company (as a freelance writer, it was my only option). The plan offered good choices for about $400 a month \u2014 it even had dental. I could get hit by a car a dozen times over and I would be patched up with great care and minimal costs. I could take a baseball bat to the teeth, and only pay a few bucks for the dentist\u2019s time. But then I learned that it wouldn\u2019t cover the one drug I needed. For that one drug, I would have to pay the full price out of pocket on top of what I was already paying for my coverage.\n\nIs this a unique situation? Do I need a specialist drug that\u2019s sold to just a handful people each year? Not even slightly. The drug I need happens to be the most prescribed (and profitable) in America.\n\nOtsuka Pharmaceutical, which makes Abilify, is said to have made $6.9 billion in sales from the drug last year. Abilify treats bipolar disorder, depression, conditions associated with autistic spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia \u2014 illnesses that affect tens of millions of Americans. In a low dose, it also happens to reduce my symptoms by as much 90 percent with no side effects.\n\nFor me, Abilify is a wonder drug. And that\u2019s probably why Otsuka can sell it for as much as it does.\n\nFor the $720 a month (or $4,320 every six months) my medication costs in America, I may as well fly back to the U.K. in style\u2014a first-class flight, a room in the Ritz London hotel for two nights, and yet still have a few dollars left to pick up my drugs.\n\nThe reality is that a coach ticket and a modest hotel for a couple of nights can save thousands of dollars a year on necessary drugs. I pretend it\u2019s a vacation, but, in fact, it\u2019s a laborious and disruptive journey that I should not have to take, and yet am grateful I can afford.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem just with Abilify. New figures from The Commonwealth Fund\u2019s biennial health insurance survey reported 12 million working-age American adults with insurance who suffer from a chronic illness (like hypertension, diabetes, and asthma) and require medication for it did not fill prescriptions or missed doses because they couldn\u2019t afford the drugs.\n\nBecause so many of these life-changing brand-name drugs are not regulated in price, those who need them may have to pay whatever price the drug maker sets. Drug companies regularly patent their inventions, and can drive wild profits annually by being the sole provider. But when those patents expire\u2014typically after 20 years\u2014other drug companies can create cheaper, yet identical generic versions. Otsuka\u2019s patent on Abilify will expire in April, costing it an estimated $65 billion over the next four years. A generic version of the drug could follow soon after, barring any legal spats. My fingers are crossed.\n\nThe U.S. government does not regulate the price of branded drugs, but its neighbors do.\n\nFor two hours on a plane to Canada, you can pick up Abilify and most other common prescription drugs for a fraction of the cost. One drug store quoted me $78 for a month\u2019s supply. (For me, though, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to fly to Canada instead of the U.K. The overall expense, including doctor\u2019s visits and flight costs, would equal that of a trip to London, where I do get the added bonus of a visit with family.)\n\nFor anyone out there in a similar circumstance who would rather not go all the way to Britain, I suggest cashing in a few vacation days, and packing a bag. I hear Toronto is beautiful this time of year. Or you could head south to Mexico, where you can buy Abilify without a prescription for about $65 a month.", "article_metadata": {"Subsection": "WIRED", "description": "Every six months, like clockwork, I fly home to the UK for three days for one reason: to pick up my supply of prescription medication.", "application-name": "WIRED: WIRED", "Author": "Zack Whittaker", "og": {"site_name": "WIRED", "description": "Every six months, like clockwork, I fly home to the UK for three days for one reason: to pick up my supply of prescription medication.", "title": "US Healthcare Is So Screwed I Fly to Britain for My Medication", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1102, "identifier": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/124034985.jpg", "height": 630}, "url": "http://www.wired.com/2015/02/us-healthcare-screwed-fly-britain-medication/", "type": "article"}, "Section": "Blog", "msapplication-TileColor": "#cb0004", "msapplication-tooltip": "Read in-depth coverage of current and future trends in technology, and how they are shaping business, entertainment, communications, science, politics, and culture at Wired.com.", "twitter": {"domain": "WIRED", "description": "Every six months, like clockwork, I fly home to the UK for three days for one reason: to pick up my supply of prescription medication.", "title": "US Healthcare Is So Screwed I Fly to Britain for My Medication", "image": {"src": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/124034985-660x377.jpg"}, "creator": "@wired", "site": "@wired", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "gmapkey": "ABQIAAAAF5yd_X_vTzike6sB6lp3wBQ4h890iMeKvsDZGQOc75SG0lWKAhQW755bw9E_-3ijKe6eqE5sg_NLEw", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373903654", "fb": {"page_id": 19440638720}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/themes/Phoenix/assets/images/favicon_ie.png", "DisplayDate": "2015-02-10", "robots": "index, follow", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "insurance"}, "ExpiryDate": "2060-12-31", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"US Healthcare Is So Screwed I Fly to Britain for My Medication\", \"link\": \"http://www.wired.com/2015/02/us-healthcare-screwed-fly-britain-medication/\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/124034985-150x150-e1423611002645.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1728443\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-10T19:36:13+00:00\", \"section\": \"WIRED\", \"author\": \"Wired Opinion\", \"tags\": [\"healthcare\",\"insurance\"]}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimal-ui, shrink-to-fit=no", "news_keywords": "healthcare, insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4ad\"", "article_summary": "But here\u2019s a fact you may not expect: I have health insurance.\nYou see, America\u2019s health insurance system is uniquely bizarre.\nIt\u2019s just my health insurance won\u2019t help.\nEvery six months, like clockwork, I fly home to the UK for three days for one reason: to pick up my supply of prescription medication.\nFor two hours on a plane to Canada, you can pick up Abilify and most other common prescription drugs for a fraction of the cost."}
