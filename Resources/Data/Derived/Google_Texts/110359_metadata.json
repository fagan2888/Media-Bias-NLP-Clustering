We're trying to fix that very early on by getting students interacting with faculty and advisers from the day they commit.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28466136/cu-boulder-unveils-aggressive-goals-new-funding-research", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28466136:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-11T11:45:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "SILVERTHORNE \u2014 Leaders at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus are setting lofty goals for themselves, including a dream to more than double the amount of revenue it brings in from sources other than in-state tuition and state funding allocations.", "title": "CU-Boulder unveils aggressive goals for new funding, research", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28466136/cu-boulder-unveils-aggressive-goals-new-funding-research", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0711/20150711__12DCAGOAw.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "modificationDate": "2015-07-13T08:38:39-0600", "endDate": "2025-07-10T15:59:26-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaStaff", "pubDate": "2015-07-11T10:54:07-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-11T11:45:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder unveils aggressive goals for new funding, research", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0711/20150711__12DCAGOAw_300.jpg", "description": "SILVERTHORNE \u2014 Leaders at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus are setting lofty goals for themselves, including a dream to more than double the amount of revenue it brings in from sources other than in-state tuition and state funding allocations.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28466136/cu-boulder-unveils-aggressive-goals-new-funding-research", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "SILVERTHORNE \u2014 Leaders at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus are setting lofty goals for themselves, including a dream to more than double the amount of revenue it brings in from sources other than in-state tuition and state funding allocations.", "title": "CU-Boulder unveils aggressive goals for new funding, research"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0711/20150711__12DCAGOAw.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12a5\"", "article_summary": "The campus also wants to increase the total number of transfer students by 10.7 percent and increase sponsored research awards by $192 million.\n\"That's an aggressive goal, just so you know,\" CU-Boulder chief financial officer Kelly Fox told the board.\nChancellor Phil DiStefano presented a set of aggressive goals he wants to reach by 2019-2020 to CU's Board of Regents at their two-day retreat which concluded Friday.\nThat high mark reflects the Boulder campus's commitment to keeping resident tuition low in the face of projected funding cuts from the state.\nDiStefano also said he wants to improve fundraising efforts to increase private support to the campus to $100 million or $120 million a year."}
