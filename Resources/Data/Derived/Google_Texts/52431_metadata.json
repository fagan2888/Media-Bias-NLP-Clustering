Even he is not sure how a divided nation would adjust to the first 100 days of a Trump presidency.\n\nWhat he does know, however, is what he wants to do in those early months. In a series of recent interviews, he sketched out plans that include showdowns with business leaders over jobs and key roles for military generals, executives and possibly even family members in advising him about running the country.\n\nShortly after the Nov. 8 election, President-elect Trump and his vice president \u2014 most likely a governor or member of Congress \u2014 would begin interviewing candidates for the open Supreme Court seat and quickly settle on a nominee in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nHe would launch a charm offensive to start \u201cbuilding a government based on relationships,\u201d perhaps inviting Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan and Mitch McConnell to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at Mar-a-Lago over golf and 2-pound lobsters.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, he would go to a \u201cbeautiful\u201d gala ball or two, but focus mostly on rescinding Obama executive orders on immigration and calling up company executives to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs out of the United States.\n\nAnd by the end of his first 100 days as the nation\u2019s 45th leader, the wall with Mexico would be designed, the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place, the audit of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion.\n\n\u201cI know people aren\u2019t sure right now what a President Trump will be like,\u201d he said. \u201cBut things will be fine. I\u2019m not running for president to make things unstable for the country.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times interviewed Trump three times over the past two months, most recently on Saturday, as well as several campaign advisers and Trump confidants.\n\nThe possibility of Trump in the Oval Office \u2014 an outcome that once seemed fanciful \u2014 became less remote Tuesday night when Trump\u2019s main challenger, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, quit the race and Wednesday, as Gov. John Kasich of Ohio indicated he would withdraw too.\n\nDespite his radical vision of how to remake America, and all his outrageous talk about juvenile subjects like the size of his anatomy \u2014 to say nothing of the polls showing him behind Hillary Clinton \u2014 Jan. 20 may find the most underestimated politician in America assuming the presidency.\n\nWhile professing some surprise at his success, Trump increasingly sounds like a man who thinks he knows where he will be eight months from now, and the unrivaled power he will hold. He described turning the Oval Office into a high-powered boardroom, empowering military leaders over foreign affairs specialists in national security debates, and continuing to speak harshly about adversaries. He may post on Twitter less, but everyone will still know what he thinks.\n\n\u201cAs president, I\u2019ll be working from the first day with my vice president and staff to make clear that America will be changing in major ways for the better,\u201d Trump said in a telephone interview on Saturday. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to waste time. I want a vice president who will help me have a major impact quickly on Capitol Hill, and the message will be clear to the nation and to people abroad that the American government will be using its power differently.\u201d\n\nBut he also acknowledged that he might face significant and incessant protests \u2014 even thousands of demonstrators massing on the National Mall as he takes the oath of office nearby at the Capitol.\n\nTrump said he would try to unite Republicans and disaffected Democrats and independents over the next six months before the November election, and then work in office to show Americans that his chief interest is fighting for their needs. He argued that the fact that he will not have to rely on wealthy donors to finance his campaign will ultimately prove appealing to many voters as they realize he is not \u201cbought and paid for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know everyone won\u2019t like everything I do, but I\u2019m not running to be everyone\u2019s favorite president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThings are seriously wrong in this country. People are hurting, business is hurting. I\u2019m running to move quickly to make big changes.\u201d\n\nSeveral friends and allies of Trump said that \u201cnegotiating\u201d is the word he uses the most to encapsulate his first 100 days in office. He wants to put strong-willed people \u2014 business executives and generals are mentioned most often \u2014 in charge of Cabinet agencies and throughout his senior staff, and direct them to negotiate deals and plans with congressional leaders and state officials, as well as insurance companies and others in the private sector. They say he would accomplish the things he has promised or else keep trying, well aware that his supporters would have his head if he did not.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to depart from the agenda he\u2019s laid out, not a bit,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime adviser and confidant. Stone declined to describe details of his private conversations with Trump, except to say: \u201cHaving gone out a thousand times to say \u2018I\u2019m going to build a wall,\u2019 he has to build a wall. He has said he would scrap trade deals; his voters will demand he scrap trade deals. He knows that.\u201d\n\nModern America has never seen anything like a Trump administration. Business leaders and even entertainment figures new to politics have been elected governors, of course, and insurgents like Newt Gingrich rose to power.\n\nBut this is different. A Manhattan real estate developer and bombastic reality television star, Trump would be a president like no other. Yet most historians suggest the country would adjust: He would quickly find himself consumed with the urgent and normalizing tasks of building a Cabinet and senior staff and reassuring Wall Street and the public that he was capable of governing America.\n\n\u201cTrump is predicting he\u2019ll be able to do all these things, but his workload will be pretty enormous, and his power would be so limited by precedent, by the bureaucracy, by the Constitution,\u201d said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. \u201cEven in trade and immigration, where Trump says he will make revolutionary changes, Congress has a say on those things. A lot of people have a say. The president is not king.\u201d\n\nBut Trump pledged in the interviews to deliver on his campaign promises, even if they prove disruptive or explosive.\n\nOn his first day in office, he said, he would meet with Homeland Security officials, generals, and others \u2014 he did not mention diplomats \u2014 to take steps to seal the Southern border and assign more security agents along the perimeter. He would also call the heads of companies like Pfizer, Carrier Corp., Ford and Nabisco and warn them that their products face 35 percent tariffs because they are moving jobs out of the country. Democrats and some Republicans have warned that financial markets would react poorly and that Trump\u2019s protectionist stances might plunge the country into recession, but he insisted that trade is \u201ckilling the country\u201d and \u201cthe markets would be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBilateral talks with Mexico would start pretty quickly on the wall, and I would have chief executives into the Oval Office soon, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Oval Office would be an amazing place to negotiate. It would command immediate respect from the other side, immediate understanding about the nation\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nAs for which foreign leader he would call first as president, he said, \u201cThey would not necessarily be a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to take a tougher stand with foreign countries,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re like the policemen of the world right now. So I wouldn\u2019t be calling them up right away and getting more entangled.\u201d\n\nFor good or ill, he would command the nation\u2019s attention unlike any modern president, and not simply because of his penchant for redecorating in gold and renaming planes, buildings \u2014 everything he can get his hands on \u2014 after himself. (For the record, he said he had no ambitious renovation plans.)\n\n\u201cHis first 100 days would be riveting,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush. \u201cThe question would be whether he is capable of downshifting from the hot rhetoric of his campaign to the serious business of building a presidency based on sound judgment and necessary coalition building.\u201d\n\nFleischer said it was possible that Trump might make the adjustment, given his frequent comments about negotiating with Democrats and Republicans to reach compromises.\n\n\u201cThat side of him intrigues me,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cHe keeps alluding to how well he gets along with people. It\u2019s almost like Trump is playing a shrewd game. Tough campaigner today. Great deal maker later.\u201d He added, \u201cOf course, if he wins he\u2019ll have some level of strength and momentum akin to a mandate. That would help.\u201d\n\nTrump did seem aware that his early months could be consumed with trying to win confirmation for his Cabinet and perhaps a new Supreme Court justice and with making appointments throughout the bureaucracy.\n\nHe made clear that he was not interested in delegating these tasks and that he wanted to make sure his appointees shared his governing philosophy. One of his closest advisers, his daughter Ivanka, would probably stay with his company, but he said he would seek counsel from her and her husband, businessman Jared Kushner, and noted that family members had served in administrations before.\n\nEven jobs that might seem incidental in a Trump universe, like a U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, have apparently crossed his mind.\n\n\u201cI think about a U.N. ambassador, about a secretary of defense and secretary of treasury, but I think more about winning first,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019m wasting time. I want people in those jobs who care about winning. The U.N. isn\u2019t doing anything to end the big conflicts in the world, so you need an ambassador who would win by really shaking up the U.N.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but he is also keenly aware that many in his own party \u2014 and many Americans, frankly \u2014 are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office.", "author": "By Patrick Healy - The New York Times", "og": {"url": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/president-trump-heres-how-he-says-it-would-look/nrHmT/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/05/05/b0/5d/President_Trump.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but he is also keenly aware that many in his own party \u2014 and many Americans, frankly \u2014 are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office.", "title": "\u2018President Trump?\u2019 Here\u2019s how he says it would look"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/05/05/b0/5d/President_Trump.jpg", "description": "Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but he is also keenly aware that many in his own party &mdash; and many Americans, frankly &mdash; are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office.", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018President Trump?\u2019 Here\u2019s how he says it would look"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myajc", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/president-trump-heres-how-he-says-it-would-look/nrHmT/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3334712/news/news/president-trump-heres-how-he-says-it-would-look/nrHmT/", "keywords": "politics_pbp,politics_ddn,politics_ajc,politics_aas,national_pbp,national_ddn,national_ajc,national_aas", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI know people aren\u2019t sure right now what a President Trump will be like,\u201d he said.\nA Manhattan real estate developer and bombastic reality television star, Trump would be a president like no other.\nThe president is not king.\u201dBut Trump pledged in the interviews to deliver on his campaign promises, even if they prove disruptive or explosive.\nI\u2019m not running for president to make things unstable for the country.\u201dThe New York Times interviewed Trump three times over the past two months, most recently on Saturday, as well as several campaign advisers and Trump confidants.\n\u201cEven in trade and immigration, where Trump says he will make revolutionary changes, Congress has a say on those things."}
