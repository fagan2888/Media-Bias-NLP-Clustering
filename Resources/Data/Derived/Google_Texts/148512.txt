If you've taken a wrong turn on the GOP's website lately, you may have come across an unusual error message.

First pointed out by TIME's Zeke Miller, the 404 error page reads: "What do Hillary Clinton and this link have in common? They're both 'dead broke.'"

The former secretary of state told Diane Sawyer earlier this year that she and President Bill Clinton "came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt" following his presidency. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton reportedly makes an average of $200,000 per individual speaking appearance.

The Republican National Committee decided to take advantage of Clinton's choice of words on its website's error page.

"Just like Hillary Clinton never misses a chance to charge quarter-million dollar speaking fees, we never miss a chance to hold her accountable for being out-of-touch," RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said. "When we revamped GOP.com, this '404 error' page for broken links just seemed right on many levels: First, there's the infamous 'dead broke' comment - self-explanatory. Second, if you try to go to a page that's devoid of content, you see a picture of [Clinton's book] 'Hard Choices.' Third, what better symbol for a page that's disconnected than Hillary Clinton?"

When asked for their opinion on the page, the Democratic National Committee had a tart reply.

"We're not surprised that people would have trouble finding what they're looking for on GOP.com," DNC spokesman Michael Czin said.
