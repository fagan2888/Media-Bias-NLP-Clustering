I\u2019m really, really scared,\u201d she told the emergency dispatcher. He violently destroyed her iPad, she said, allegedly cutting through the device with his pocketknife. He also apparently came to blows with her father, and allegedly exhibited the complete lack of self-control and dangerously poor judgment for which the public has come to know him.\n\nBut because Shellie changed her story only hours later \u2014 saying she never saw a firearm, and that she wouldn\u2019t press charges \u2014 there was no domestic violence report filed. Absent that, the police didn\u2019t pursue a warrant to search Zimmerman\u2019s vehicle for the gun he may or may not have used to threaten Shellie.\n\nWhether or not Zimmerman had a gun on him that day, one thing remains clear: The gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin may still be lawfully returned to him. And he is, according to recent reports, looking to buy more.\n\nWhich invites the question: What does a person have to do in this country to get a gun taken away? Or lose the right to a concealed carry permit? And, more specifically, what does a man with a noted history of both domestic violence complaints and a willingness to use deadly force, who is currently in the news for what may still turn out to be another such incident, have to do?\n\nTurns out: quite a terrifying lot. Because, put mildly, the laws in Florida and elsewhere regulating gun ownership among domestic abusers and men suspected of domestic violence are, shall we say, permissive.\n\n\u201cIn our country, and in most states, the scales have been very, very heavily tipped toward the individual rights of gun owners,\u201d Dr. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, tells Salon. \u201cUnited States policy almost always gives the benefit of the doubt to the gun owner,\u201d and things are no different in cases of domestic violence.\n\nAccording to recent data, more than 60 percent of women killed by a firearm in 2010 were murdered by a current or former intimate partner. The presence of a firearm during a domestic violence incident increases the likelihood of a homicide by an astounding 500 percent. In general, guns are very, very bad for women\u2019s health.\n\nBut in spite of all of the evidence identifying a strong and deadly correlation between gun deaths and violence against women, our policies to protect women (victims of intimate partner-related gun violence are, overwhelmingly, female) are full of holes.\n\nFor an example of this, look no further than Florida. In Zimmerman\u2019s home state, as a result of federal law, it is illegal for a person subjected to a protective order to own or purchase firearms, and it is a crime for that person to refuse to surrender them to law enforcement. This is a good law that, when effectively enforced, can save women\u2019s lives. \u201cThere are actually three studies now published in scientific journals showing how this policy [barring people subjected to restraining orders from owning or purchasing firearms] is associated with a significant reduction in risk of intimate partner homicide \u2014 ranging from a 6 to 19 percent reduction,\u201d Webster notes.\n\nBut because the law does not explicitly compel courts to authorize police to take the firearms away, many people who are subjected to domestic violence-related restraining orders are still able to keep and carry their guns, undeterred. And those who do have their guns taken away will just as soon have them returned at the expiration of that order. \u201cThe minute it expires,\u201d Webster says, \u201cthe person who has been under the order can legally possess as many guns as they like. And in places like Florida, this person can also carry a concealed and loaded gun more or less wherever they want.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "What exactly does it take for a man with domestic abuse complaints and a fatal shooting to lose access to weapons?", "title": "Take his guns away, already: Why the George Zimmermans are so protected", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "What exactly does it take for a man with domestic abuse complaints and a fatal shooting to lose access to weapons?", "title": "Take his guns away, already: Why the George Zimmermans are so protected", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/12/take_his_guns_away_already_why_the_george_zimmermans_are_so_protected/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/george_zimmerman3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What exactly does it take for a man with domestic abuse complaints and a fatal shooting to lose access to weapons?", "title": "Take his guns away, already: Why the George Zimmermans are so protected", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/george_zimmerman3.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, domestic violence, Editor's Picks, Florida, George Zimmerman, Gun Control, Gun Laws, gun reform, gun regulations, Gun Violence, Guns, Violence, Violence Against Women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The presence of a firearm during a domestic violence incident increases the likelihood of a homicide by an astounding 500 percent.\nAnd those who do have their guns taken away will just as soon have them returned at the expiration of that order.\nWhich invites the question: What does a person have to do in this country to get a gun taken away?\n\u201cUnited States policy almost always gives the benefit of the doubt to the gun owner,\u201d and things are no different in cases of domestic violence.\n\u201cThe minute it expires,\u201d Webster says, \u201cthe person who has been under the order can legally possess as many guns as they like."}
