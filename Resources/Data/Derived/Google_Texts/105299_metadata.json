Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., wants to lift the \u201cveil of secrecy\u201d he said obscures the dealings of the Federal Reserve.\n\nWould enhanced congressional oversight of the central bank\u2019s decision-making help the economy? Or would it lead to counterproductive meddling?\n\nThat was the question members mulled Thursday in a hearing Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThe hearing dealt with The Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act, which Huizenga and Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J., introduced Monday in an attempt to reinvigorate oversight.\n\nThe legislation would require the bank \u201cto conduct cost-benefit analysis when adopting new rules and require transparency for Fed stress tests on banks and on international regulations,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt would simply require that the Federal Reserve stipulate its policy rules or strategies,\u201d said Stanford University Economist John Taylor, a witness at the hearing. \u201cCongress would not tell the Federal Reserve what policy to follow. That\u2019s the job of the Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans seemed on board with this attempt to increase transparency and accountability. Huizenga framed it as an attempt by Congress to regain some of its constitutional power of oversight.\n\n\u201cWhat I can\u2019t figure out is why my colleagues here are willing day in and day out to hand that responsibility over to an administration regardless of whether there\u2019s a D or an R behind it,\u201d Huizenga said.\n\nBut Democrats worried too much congressional involvement would impede the ability of the bank to fulfill its responsibilities.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., went so far as to claim the bill would \u201cgut the agency\u2019s ability to do its job\u201d and \u201cundermine the independence\u201d of the bank.\n\nTaylor disagreed, saying the bill \u201cprovides the appropriate degree of Congressional oversight without in any way restricting the independence of the Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\nMark Calabria, Cato Institute\u2019s Director of Financial Regulation, said he supported the bill, but he pointed to a \u201cfar more pressing concern\u201d echoed by multiple panelists throughout the hearing.\n\n\u201cI believe our ultimate effort should be to get the Fed out of financial regulation,\u201d Calabria said. \u201cTo me, that would increase independence of monetary policy. I think this Fed and I think previous Feds have acted as adjuncts of the executive branch, and I find that far more problematic.\u201d\n\nTaylor said the bill would improve economic performance significantly and that the debate among Democrats and Republicans is not on whether it should be passed, but when.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are huge,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this should be a partisan issue in any way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
