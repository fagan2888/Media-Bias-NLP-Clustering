The author: California Rep. Tom McClintock, a Republican with a 90 percent conservative rating on the Heritage Action scorecard (the average House Republican scores 68 percent) and a member of Jim Jordan\u2019s Freedom Caucus of tea partiers.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus is vowing to vote no on any GOP spending bill that funds Planned Parenthood. Without them Boehner probably doesn\u2019t have the votes to pass anything, which means he\u2019ll need to make concessions to Pelosi in order to convince Democrats to join with GOP centrists and pass a bill. Thus does a conservative stand on principle produce Democratic gains. How many more times do we need to watch that happen before we learn our lesson, wonders McClintock?\n\nAt least once more, apparently. And so he\u2019s done with the caucus.\n\nOn February 27th, we faced the imminent shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security over the funding of Obama\u2019s unlawful amnesty orders for illegal immigrants. Although the American people overwhelmingly opposed these orders, they also overwhelmingly opposed shutting down DHS. House Republicans attempted to pass a three-week stop gap bill so we could avoid a catastrophic shutdown of our security agencies while continuing to bring public opinion to bear to de-fund the orders. At the behest of its board, most HFC members combined with House Democrats to defeat this effort, resulting in the full funding of these illegal orders for the fiscal year. In May, the House had the opportunity to adopt the most important free trade bill in nearly two decades, restoring the long-standing and essential process that has made it possible for our nation to negotiate free trade agreements with other nations. At the behest of its board, most HFC members combined with the vast majority of House Democrats in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat this legislation. Last week, the House was scheduled to adopt the Resolution of Disapproval of the disastrous Iran nuclear agreement \u2013 the only legally binding action available to Congress under the Corker Act. Once again, the House Freedom Caucus leadership threatened to combine with House Democrats to defeat the Resolution, forcing the House leadership to abandon it in favor of a symbolic and legally meaningless vote. Ironically, while Harry Reid and Senate Democrats blocked a vote on the Resolution of Disapproval in the Senate, the House Freedom Caucus leadership was instrumental in blocking its consideration in the House\u2026 A common theme through each of these incidents is a willingness \u2013 indeed, an eagerness \u2013 to strip the House Republican majority of its ability to set the House agenda by combining with House Democrats on procedural motions. As a result, it has thwarted vital conservative policy objectives and unwittingly become Nancy Pelosi\u2019s tactical ally.\n\nWhy not present a united Republican front on lower spending even at the price of funding Planned Parenthood, asks McClintock, so that when Reid inevitably filibusters the bill in the Senate the GOP will have a clean party-line argument that he\u2019s the one who\u2019s shutting down the government? As it is, Reid and Pelosi will be able to boast that some House Republicans, namely the Freedom Caucus, are with them in opposing Boehner\u2019s spending bill. Then again, if you\u2019re worried about the PR battle during a shutdown, what does it really matter whether the divisions are straight party-line or more heterogeneous? The GOP always loses in the polls on who\u2019s to blame for a shutdown because they\u2019re the party known for being anti-government. And Boehner and his deputies know that, which is why they\u2019re reportedly circulating some of those polls right now to wavering House Republicans.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s not exactly true that these shutdown efforts are always futile, as McClintock claims. They may not achieve anything policy-wise for conservatives \u2014 on the contrary, they\u2019re likely to force Boehner to meet some of Pelosi\u2019s demands \u2014 but they do accomplish one important conservative goal. They grow the perception that Boehner\u2019s a weak Speaker who won\u2019t fight, who\u2019s lost control of his caucus, and who somehow can\u2019t avoid situations in which a huge Republican majority in the House fractures and leaves Democrats to profit by it. If the goal of all this is a palace coup this fall, then undermining Boehner yet again by standing firm against Planned Parenthood probably advances the ball. The base will be angrier than ever, Trump will pound the table about being led by dummies, and Mark Meadows et al. will have even more juice to float a resolution that would topple Boehner. Is that worth making new spending concessions to Pelosi and Reid? We could be one more crushing defeat away from total victory.\n\nThe latest idea in the Senate, by the way, is to beat Reid\u2019s filibuster by using reconciliation to pass a spending bill that defunds Planned Parenthood (assuming that Boehner\u2019s willing to pass it in the House). Maybe that\u2019s the key to making this defeat more palatable for conservatives \u2014 as they failed to do with the resolution disapproving of the Iran deal, if they can at least get a bill out of Congress and onto Obama\u2019s desk for a veto, that\u2019ll make O the lightning rod for right-wing anger instead of Boehner and McConnell. Would that be good enough? If not, sketch me a path by which Planned Parenthood actually gets defunded. A long shutdown in which the GOP gets lots of media support in publicizing the PP sting videos might theoretically force Obama to cave, I guess, even though he\u2019s the most pro-abortion president in American history and has nothing at all to lose as a lame-duck by standing firm on this. You trust the media to lend the GOP a hand against him, no?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201c[This caucus] has thwarted vital conservative policy objectives and unwittingly become Nancy Pelosi\u2019s tactical ally.\u201d", "title": "House conservative quits Freedom Caucus because he\u2019s tired of futile shutdown fights that only help Democrats", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/17/house-conservative-quits-freedom-caucus-because-hes-tired-of-futile-shutdown-fights-that-only-help-democrats/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-17T22:01:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T21:40:15+00:00"}, "keywords": "Democrats, freedom caucus, Iran, Jordan, mcclintock, nuclear, Planned Parenthood, reid,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf01b\"", "article_summary": "The Freedom Caucus is vowing to vote no on any GOP spending bill that funds Planned Parenthood.\nOnce again, the House Freedom Caucus leadership threatened to combine with House Democrats to defeat the Resolution, forcing the House leadership to abandon it in favor of a symbolic and legally meaningless vote.\nAt the behest of its board, most HFC members combined with the vast majority of House Democrats in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat this legislation.\nAt the behest of its board, most HFC members combined with House Democrats to defeat this effort, resulting in the full funding of these illegal orders for the fiscal year.\nAs it is, Reid and Pelosi will be able to boast that some House Republicans, namely the Freedom Caucus, are with them in opposing Boehner\u2019s spending bill."}
