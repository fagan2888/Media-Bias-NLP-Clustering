And, according to early analyses of the ongoing wave of hospital consolidation, they\u2019re giving way to more accountable care organizations and producing improved outcomes, but at higher prices.\n\nOne question that hasn\u2019t been explored quite as much is: What does this mean for innovation? Hospital administrators and care providers are central to identifying problems and inefficiencies within the organization, and figuring out the best ways to solve them.\n\nOn the surface it seems that having fewer competitors and more negotiating power over insurers would make growing health systems less likely to innovate to try new processes, products and services, or come up with new solutions of their own. And, as HealthLeaders-InterStudy market analyst Sarah Wilson wrote in a white paper on consolidation, larger health systems tend to give less control to individual physicians and concentrate decision-making power among fewer individuals.\n\nBut, Wilson said in an interview, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make them less innovative.\n\nRisk-takers and innovators by nature\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that consolidation generally makes organizations more inclined to take on risk, whether it be financial risk or large technology investments like new EHRs,\u201d she said.\n\nIn many instances, smaller hospitals look to partnerships or acquisitions for more financial stability, for access to more resources and to be able to better meet the needs of their communities \u2014 essentially, to survive in the post-Affordable Care Act world. Likewise, bigger systems look to smaller ones to spread their reach and expand their service offerings.\n\nThose market forces driving M&A also warrant actual integration within the guts of the facilities involved, rather than one health system just adding another hospital to its balance sheet, said Dr. Mitch Morris, a former senior vice president at MD Anderson Cancer Center who now leads Deloitte\u2019s national healthcare practice. Thus, the organizations that are ahead of the curve with consolidation are oftentimes ahead of the curve with strategy, too.\n\n\u201cThe hospital systems that are getting bigger, they not only have the interest in innovating but they also have the money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re able to create investment funds where they seek out new business models to healthcare. Those that are doing that tend to be pretty innovative and tend to be willing to take on some risk.\u201d\n\nFor example, HCA, the nation\u2019s largest for-profit health system which bought three Tampa Bay hospitals this year, makes venture capital investments through its Health Insight Capital subsidiary. Mobile health company AirStrip Technologies and health IT firm InVivoLink have both been on the receiving end of that fund.\n\nCleveland Clinic, a nonprofit that made a few purchases last year, has a commercialization arm that\u2019s spun off more than 60 startups with technology developed by its employees. Meanwhile, it\u2019s gotten creative on the strategy side too, forming an innovation alliance through which it collaborates with and offers its tech transfer know-how to seven other institutions, bringing in additional revenue in the process.\n\nA bigger testing ground\n\nAside from seeding new technologies and exploring new business models, larger health systems also have the benefit of learning from mistakes in one part of the organization, Wilson pointed out. \u201cThey\u2019re able to roll out their new technologies and new practices in stages as opposed to all at one time, which is maybe something you see with smaller systems,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s one thing that\u2019s been helpful for Kaiser Permanente, a frequent recipient of accolades for clinical quality and safety. While Kaiser hasn\u2019t been active on the M&A front recently, the group operates 38 hospitals and more than 600 outpatient facilities, so it knows a thing or two about innovating in a big shop.\n\nVice President of Innovation Technology Faye Sahai said the group has an extensive innovation infrastructure that includes a venture fund, a research division, an external learning network and an innovation consultancy that works with care teams to address their challenges. It also has the Garfield Innovation Center \u2013 a simulation environment that functions as a sandbox to test new ideas. Sahai said Kaiser will also consider working with portfolio companies of the venture fund on pilot projects, when it makes sense for both parties.\n\nSahai said Kaiser has deliberately built an innovation community to make sure there are experimentation and creative thinking throughout all of Kaiser\u2019s properties. \u201cWe have a designated innovation hunter in each business line and in each geography \u2013 they\u2019re our ambassadors,\u201d she said. Once a year, Kaiser holds an innovation retreat that brings executives, staff and \u201cexternal provocateurs\u201d to showcase their work, share ideas and be recognized.\n\n\u201cFor most employees, we\u2019re asking them to innovate on top of their current job, so that recognition part and learning and spreading ideas is critical,\u201d Sahai said.\n\nCollaboration\n\nNot all of the big guys have those kinds of resources, though, which is why more joint ventures and alliances have emerged too.
