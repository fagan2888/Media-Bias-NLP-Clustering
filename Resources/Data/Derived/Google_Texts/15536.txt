The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office is investigating a body found in a burning car in the 9500 block of Cougar Road Sunday morning.

Jacki Kelley, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office, said police and fire responded to a report of a car on fire on Cougar Road in the Deer Creek area at about 11:40 a.m. Sunday.

“It was a fully involved fire, a significant fire,” Kelley said.

When the fire was put out, a body was discovered inside the vehicle. The gender of the body, or identification, was not known at this time. Kelley said it could be a while before an ID or cause of death is determined.

Anyone with any information about the fire or suspicious behavior in the area is asked to call the department’s tipline at 303-271-5612.
