Health plan costs that may trigger the excise tax on high-cost plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) do not just include the basic cost of coverage, notes Tracy Watts, Washington, D.C.-based U.S. leader for health care reform for Mercer. They include the cost of onsite clinics, as well as pre-tax contributions made to health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs).

Speaking to attendees of a Mercer webcast, Watts shared that a recent survey by Mercer found, if employers made no changes to their plans, considering basic plan costs only, 31% will trigger the excise tax in 2018, and 51% will trigger it by 2022. “This is before you add other components,” she said.

To date, the most popular strategies employers have been using to try to avoid triggering the 40% tax are adding or increasing enrollment in consumer-driven health plans (CDHPs) and changing plan design to shift costs to employees.

Joe Kra, a Mercer actuary based in New York, said there are several things to consider to reduce basic health plan costs, including revisiting actuarial methodologies such as plan pooling and tier ratios; changing plan design, for example, covered benefits, copays and deductibles; using health management or efficient provider networks; and reconsidering the tax treatment or limits of account contributions.
