The regulation stems from the nearly eight-year-old Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act signed into law by President George W. Bush.\n\nWhile opiate addiction is a chronic disease, just as diabetes and arthritis are, insurance plans and state Medicaid programs often haven\u2019t treated it as such. Case in point: The limited availability through Medicaid of the three medications approved by the FDA to treat opiate addictions and lifetime limits on their use.\n\nA 2013 report published by the American Society of Addiction Medicine found that only 28 states\u2019 Medicaid programs covered all three medications: methadone, buprenorphine (known commercially as Suboxone) and injectable naltrexone (sold as Vivitrol).\n\nFortunately, Maine is among those 28 states, but since 2013 the state generally has limited Medicaid recipients to two years on methadone and Suboxone. (Doctors can request special authorization from the state, so patients can continue their treatment.) Maine is one of 10 states, along with Washington, D.C., that impose a lifetime limit on Suboxone, according to a 2014 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration report.\n\nMaine is the only state with a time limit on methadone out of the 33 whose Medicaid programs pay for methadone maintenance therapy, according to the SAMSHA report.\n\nThe lifetime limits on Suboxone and methadone are clear violations of the principles of parity and equity. No person with diabetes is subject to a two-year limit on insulin, after all, and no cancer patient is told that treatment coverage will simply stop after two years as a matter of policy.\n\nAs the SAMSHA report notes in its discussion of states\u2019 lifetime limits on Suboxone: \u201cThis benefit design element is one that should be carefully considered by payers, because it can impose significant challenges for individuals with opioid use disorders. Opioid addiction is a chronic disease; as a result, individuals remain at risk for relapse even after long periods of abstinence and despite the potentially devastating consequences.\u201d\n\nIn other words, treatment for an opiate addiction rarely works within a neatly defined, two-year timeframe. Nevertheless, it has been legal for a state to impose lifetime limits on Medicaid coverage for methadone and Suboxone even as it imposes no such limits on other medications or treatments.\n\nThe newly issued federal regulation could prevent some of those Medicaid-imposed limits. If a Medicaid managed care organization \u2014 a privately managed organization a state contracts with to deliver Medicaid services and control costs \u2014 sought to impose a two-year limit on Suboxone, for example, it wouldn\u2019t be allowed to unless it also imposed similar limits on other medications.\n\nBut Maine\u2019s Medicaid program is exempt from the regulation.\n\nThe 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act applies primarily to private insurers, including managed care organizations. And Maine is one of 12 states that doesn\u2019t contract with managed care organizations for most Medicaid services. The parity requirements also extend to the plans offered to low-income residents who qualify for expanded Medicaid, but Maine has refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMaine\u2019s two-year limits on methadone and Suboxone clearly go against the nature of addiction and inhibit effective treatment. It\u2019s time for lawmakers to make lifting those limits a priority. And at the federal level, policymakers should do everything in their power to prevent states from following Maine\u2019s path on addiction treatment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The lifetime limits on Suboxone and methadone are clear violations of the principles of parity and equity.
