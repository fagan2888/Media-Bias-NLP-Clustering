In a Jan. 2010 email, Clinton sought to bolster the spirits of Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski , who was frustrated with the rollout of Obamacare and the stalling economy.\n\nFor inspiration Clinton quoted her \u201chome girl,\u201d abolitionist Harriet Tubman.\n\n\u201cKeep going,\u201d Clinton wrote to Mikulski, referring to a quote from a speech attributed to the Underground Railroad hero.\n\n\u201cHome girl\u201d is believed to have originated with the Latino community in the 19th century. That term \u2014 and derivations like \u201chomeboy\u201d and \u201chomie\u201d \u2014 are commonly used by Latino and black youth, and not by 60-plus-year-old white women.\n\nClinton flip-flopped on Colombian trade deal\n\nOne April 6, 2011 email appears to show Clinton lobbying for a Colombian trade deal that she had pledged to oppose during the 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nIn the message, Clinton shared details with several aides about her conversations about the deal with Michigan Rep. Sandy Levin, who was then the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nAs the International Business Times notes, Clinton said during the 2008 presidential campaign that she opposed the trade pact because she was \u201cvery concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI oppose the deal. I have spoken out against the deal, I will vote against the deal, and I will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement,\u201d she said later.\n\nBut in her conversation with Levin, Clinton appears to have touted reforms she said had been implemented by Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos. She also insisted that the deal was so good that Colombian workers would end up having \u201cbetter rights\u201d than some American workers.\n\n\u201cIn the \u2018couldn\u2019t resist category\u2019, I told him that at the rate we were going, Columbian [sic] workers were going to end up w the same or better rights than workers in Wisconsin and Indiana and, maybe even, Michigan,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of Clinton\u2019s aides, Robert Hormats, a former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, praised Clinton\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cGREAT line on Columbian [sic] workers!!!!!\u201d he wrote to Clinton.\n\nDespite Clinton\u2019s assurances about the protections in the Colombian trade deal, few reforms appears to have been enacted since it was implemented.\n\nAs the International Business Times notes, the AFL-CIO reported last year that in the four years since the deal was enacted, Colombian workers have been the victims of \u201c1,933 threats and acts of violence, including 105 assassinations of union activists and 1,337 death threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know this agency existed!\u201d\n\nAs Phil Kerpen, the executive director of the free market group American Commitment noted on Twitter, one May 2010 Clinton email helps make the case that the federal government is entirely too large.\n\nThat\u2019s because Hillary Clinton, who by then had spent 18 years working in and around the federal government, was unaware that an independent federal agency created in 1961 even existed.\n\nIn the email, Clinton was provided a history of the U.S. Trade Development Agency, a small, independent federal agency that aims to advance U.S. trade interests.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know this agency existed!\u201d Clinton exclaimed to her aide, Michael Fuchs.\n\n\u201cSee what else you can find out,\u201d Clinton added in the email.\n\nSid \u2018Vicious\u2019 Blumenthal trashes Obama\u2019s \u201cassassin-priest\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the many releases of Clinton emails that the former secretary of state\u2019s friend, Sidney Blumenthal, was no great fan of the Obama administration. After all, it was Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who vetoed the idea of Blumenthal working at Clinton\u2019s State Department in the summer of 2009. (RELATED: Did Sid \u2018Vicious\u2019 Blumenthal Commission Rahm Emanuel Hit Pieces After State Dept Snub?)\n\nVicious Sid\u2019s anti-Obama bent is evident in a Nov. 21, 2009 memo that he sent to Clinton which was chock full of gossip about inner turmoil at the White House.\n\nHe slammed Emanuel and his \u201cunderling,\u201d Denis McDonough, in the memo, calling the latter an \u201cassassin-priest.\u201d He also labeled current CIA director John Brennan, who then served as Obama\u2019s Homeland Security Adviser, a \u201cmole for the Tenet clique.\u201d George Tenet served as CIA director during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.\n\nClinton has defended Obama\u2019s presidency at every turn during the 2016 presidential campaign, but her emails show that she rarely if ever defended Obama when her friends, allies, and aides criticized him or his initiatives.\n\nNancy Pelosi allegedly talked trash on President Obama\n\nAs The Daily Caller reported on Friday, Blumenthal reported to Clinton that he was told of disparaging remarks that California Rep. Nancy Pelosi made of President Obama during a meeting with wealthy donors in the weeks after Democrats suffered a devastating defeat in the 2010 mid-term elections. (RELATED: Email: Nancy Pelosi Said Dealing With Obama Was Like Dealing With \u2018The Junior Senator From Illinois\u2019)\n\n\u201cWhen I go to the White House I feel like I\u2019m dealing with the junior senator from Illinois,\u201d is what Pelosi allegedly told members of the Democracy Alliance.\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "Flip flops, trash talk, \"home girls,\" and \"assassin-priests.\" That's a good summation of the most interesting of the 881 Hillary Clinton State Department emails", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Flip flops, trash talk, \"home girls,\" and \"assassin-priests.\" That's a good summation of the most interesting of the 881 Hillary Clinton emails that the State Department released Friday afternoon.", "title": "Hillary\u2019s \u2018Home Girl,\u2019 And Other Notable Emails From The Latest State Dept.
