The middleweight champion still finished it with his usual show-stopping flourish.\n\nGolovkin stopped Willie Monroe Jr. 45 seconds into the sixth round Saturday night, retaining the 160-pound belts with his 20th consecutive knockout victory.\n\nGolovkin (33-0, 30 KOs) put on another masterful performance in his adopted home, knocking down Monroe twice in the second round and again in the sixth round of his 14th consecutive title defense.\n\nThe former Kazakh Olympian has stopped each of his 20 opponents since June 2008, and even a surprisingly strong fourth round from Monroe couldn\u2019t throw Golovkin off his path to the top.\n\n\u201cIt was a good big drama show,\u201d Golovkin said. \u201cI was happy with my performance. Willie is a very tough fighter. I felt very strong tonight. I knocked him down twice, but I didn\u2019t want an easy round the next round. I wanted to keep working.\u201d\n\nWhen Golovkin floored Monroe (19-2) with a long series of heavy punches in the sixth, the challenger declined to continue after his final trip to the canvas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d Monroe told referee Jack Reiss.\n\nNicaragua\u2019s Roman \u201cChocolatito\u201d Gonzalez also defended his WBC flyweight title in style at the historic Forum with a furious second-round stoppage of Mexican veteran Edgar Sosa.\n\nBut Golovkin delighted a Southern California crowd of 12,372 backing the Kazakh champion who has gone from anonymity to stardom in less than three years. Golovkin realized a southpaw counterpuncher with Monroe\u2019s pedigree would provide a new challenge while he waits for the world\u2019s best fighters to take him on, and Monroe proved to be tough and elusive while hitting Golovkin regularly.\n\nYet Golovkin still delivered for his large fan base in Southern California, where he now lives with his family.\n\nAfter Monroe tagged the champion repeatedly in the fourth, Golovkin\u2019s trainer, Abel Sanchez, implored his fighter to \u201cnot show how tough we are. Let\u2019s start working.\u201d\n\nSo Golovkin went back to work and finished with force.\n\n\u201cI think Gennady wanted to give the fans a little more value for their money, because the Rubio fight only lasted two rounds,\u201d promoter Tom Loeffler said, referring to Golovkin\u2019s second-round stoppage of Marco Antonio Rubio in his California debut last fall.\n\nAfter a solid first round, Golovkin backed Monroe against the ropes in the second and knocked him flat with a textbook-perfect left hook to the head. Monroe wobbled while getting up slowly, and Golovkin put him back down moments later with a big right hand.\n\nMonroe made it to the bell and even recovered to land several big shots in the fourth round, but Golovkin buckled his knees again in the fifth. Golovkin finished the sixth in style, pursuing a ducking Monroe around the ring until finally landing the knockdown punches in the sixth.\n\nGolovkin made the fight with Monroe when he couldn\u2019t entice bigger-name boxers into the ring, and he named names after the fight, calling out Miguel Cotto and Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez. Golovkin intends to fight two more times this year, staying busy and growing his own reputation as one of the world\u2019s pound-for-pound best fighters.\n\nGolovkin wants to win every middleweight belt, He is the WBC\u2019s interim 160-pound champion and the mandatory challenger for Cotto\u2019s permanent belt, but Cotto is fighting Daniel Geale in New York next month.\n\nIf Cotto beats Geale, WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman said he would sanction Cotto\u2019s much-rumored fight with Alvarez in the fall as long as the winner agrees in writing to fight Golovkin next.\n\nGonzalez (43-0, 37 KOs) seized the chance provided by his first showcase on HBO with a masterful performance against Sosa, a talented veteran contender. Chocolatito battered Sosa around the ring in the first round and dropped him three times in the second.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy with my performance,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cHe was a tough fighter, but my power was too much.\u201d\n\nThrowing sharp combinations and showcasing power in both hands, Gonzalez floored Sosa (51-9) twice with brutal right hands before finishing him with a multi-punch barrage against the ropes with 23 seconds left in the second round.\n\nGonzalez already sits high on most pound-for-pound lists, but had never received such a broadcast showcase due to networks\u2019 traditional reluctance to feature lighter weight classes.\n\nGolovkin wore trunks trimmed with Los Angeles Lakers colors in the Forum for the second boxing show since the Madison Square Garden Co. bought and refurbished the arena as a venue for concerts and fights.\n\nThe fans arrived early and packed the arena in a remarkable turnout for both Golovkin and Gonzalez, who is wildly popular in Southern California\u2019s expatriate Nicaraguan community.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gennady Golovkin stops Willie Monroe in 6th in middleweight bout", "title": "Gennady Golovkin stops Willie Monroe in 6th in middleweight bout", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/17/gennady-golovkin-stops-willie-monroe-in-6th-in-middleweight-bout/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150517_100624_gennady-golovkin.jpg", "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150517_100624_gennady-golovkin.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-17T10:02:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T05:23:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Golovkin stopped Willie Monroe Jr. 45 seconds into the sixth round Saturday night, retaining the 160-pound belts with his 20th consecutive knockout victory.\nAfter a solid first round, Golovkin backed Monroe against the ropes in the second and knocked him flat with a textbook-perfect left hook to the head.\nIf Cotto beats Geale, WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman said he would sanction Cotto\u2019s much-rumored fight with Alvarez in the fall as long as the winner agrees in writing to fight Golovkin next.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy with my performance,\u201d Gonzalez said.\nGolovkin finished the sixth in style, pursuing a ducking Monroe around the ring until finally landing the knockdown punches in the sixth."}
