After all, in the post-Obamacare world, the Republican Congress has assured that very little, if any, of the president\u2019s agenda is worthy of its time.\n\nBut with his endorsement of a paid sick leave law \u2014 part of Obama\u2019s \u201cmiddle class economics\u201d plan, which included middle-class tax cuts and free community college tuition \u2014 the president joined a battle that\u2019s been waging in the states for the past eight years.\n\nMandatory paid sick leave is a government policy position that requires businesses of a certain size to give its employees a certain amount of time off. Seems simple. But the fight over such a law has actually made and broken political careers, pitted Democrats against Democrats, business trade groups against workers, state governments against local municipalities. And it\u2019s a policy, according to the data, that seems to contradict just about every philosophy business interests have been telling us about government burdens.\n\n\u201cBusinesses always claimed doom is just around the corner any time you try to increase the lives and fortunes of working people,\u201d says Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party.\n\nConservatives often reject the idea on principle \u2014 that it oversteps the bounds of government\u2019s role in the private sector. Liberals, on the other hand, often chalk it up as a basic right for workers. A number of states and municipalities have now enacted mandatory paid sick leave and the data show conclusions that go way beyond the philosophical debate.\n\nExhibit A: Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. Less than a month after the State of the Union, Nutter, a Democrat, signed that city\u2019s paid sick leave ordinance into law, making Philly the second city this year to do so. Philadelphia\u2019s new law says that businesses with 10 or more employees must allow workers to accrue at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 worked. Other cities\u2019 and states\u2019 laws around the country have been written similarly.\n\nNutter\u2019s history on paid sick leave makes the timing of this statute particularly interesting. Nutter actually vetoed prior legislation in 2011 and 2013, citing conservative arguments about economic burdens on business and the idea that a Philadelphia law would be bad for the economy.\n\nThat may seem at odds with where the Philadelphia mayor is coming from \u2014 a dark blue city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by about eight-to-one. But Nutter\u2019s not the first liberal to mount opposition to this controversial law.\n\nIn 2008, Connecticut became the first state to seriously debate such a bill in its legislature. Mandatory paid sick leave there was lobbied for by the labor-backed Working Families Party before basically anyone else, and would have forced earned sick days at businesses with more than 50 employees throughout the state. The Connecticut bill died three times in the legislature, but rose to prominence again during the 2010 gubernatorial primary, in which Democratic foes Dan Malloy and Ned Lamont attempted to distinguish themselves in a race where most big issues were uniform. Malloy supported paid sick leave; Lamont did not.\n\nLamont, a businessman who had lost to Joe Lieberman for a Senate seat in 2006, said he would not support a paid sick leave bill. \u201cI do believe it sort of sends the wrong signal out there at a time when we have a very high unemployment rate, and I\u2019m doing everything as a candidate for governor to recruit, to expand job creation in our state,\u201d he said shortly before announcing his campaign.\n\nConnecticut Governor Dan Malloy meeting with Vice President Joe Biden in 2013. (Photo: Dannel Malloy/Flickr)\n\nLamont\u2019s sentiment was echoed by business and restaurant associations across Connecticut. In a Register Citizen editorial endorsing Lamont in the primary, the paper\u2019s editorial board used Malloy\u2019s support of paid sick leave as part of its rationale. \u201cLamont knows what a career politician like Malloy is deaf to \u2014 that putting yet another mandate on business at this critical juncture for Connecticut\u2019s economy would be insane. It\u2019s about tone, and priorities, and independence,\u201d the board wrote.\n\nBut Malloy won, and Connecticut soon became the first state in the country with a mandated sick leave policy.\n\nThe paid sick leave policy was opposed vigorously by business groups, particularly the 10,000-member Connecticut Business and Industry Association and the Connecticut Restaurant Association. Both groups argued such a law would drive new business out of state and hurt current business\u2019 profits. Rather, requiring all businesses give their employees time off was supposed to cut into profits, freeze hiring, and chase new commerce out of the state.\n\n\u201cBusinesses always claimed doom is just around the corner any time you try to increase the lives and fortunes of working people,\u201d says Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party. \u201cWe pushed the rock up the hill in Connecticut, but it\u2019s getting easier each time.\u201d\n\nAfter Connecticut, that push continued. Residents of Massachusetts; Montclair, New Jersey; and Trenton, New Jersey, were all asked via ballot referendum if they supported paid sick leave. They did. Residents of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, voted overwhelmingly in favor of a ballot measure, with 69 percent supporting. Nationally, a 2013 YouGov poll found 74 percent of the U.S. public (Democrats, Independents, and Republicans) support mandatory paid sick leave.\n\nSimilar bills passed in 17 cities, coast to coast. This has happened in spite of big business-aligned conservatives enacting laws in 11 states barring local municipalities from putting their own paid sick leave bills into law (the most infamous being Wisconsin, which overruled the Milwaukee ballot measure).\n\nData collected by jurisdictions that have passed paid sick leave show that most of what the naysayers predicted about such a law is false.\n\nWhen Bloomberg News looked at three separate studies concerning the effects on San Francisco\u2019s, Seattle\u2019s, and Connecticut\u2019s business climates post-sick leave, the consensus was overwhelmingly positive.\n\n\n\nIn San Francisco, just one in seven businesses said profits were hurt by paid sick leave. On costs, in Connecticut, a majority of businesses surveyed by the Center for Economic and Policy Research at the City University of New York found either no increases in costs, or less than a two-percent increase.\n\nMeanwhile, about one in six Connecticut businesses, one in 10 San Francisco businesses, and one in 12 Seattle businesses have reported responding to paid sick leave by increasing prices for the consumer.\n\nOther issues pushed by detractors, like abuse of time off by workers and the need to cut other benefits due to sick leave mandates, have proven mostly moot. In Connecticut, just one percent of businesses report cuts to wages. In San Francisco, just seven percent said the same, and in Seattle, just over six percent.\n\nMeanwhile, about one in six Connecticut businesses, one in 10 San Francisco businesses, and one in 12 Seattle businesses have reported responding to paid sick leave by increasing prices for the consumer.\n\nSuch findings led the author of the Bloomberg story to conclude that \u201cmandating paid sick leave has limited effect on businesses, workers and consumers. That doesn\u2019t solve the philosophical debate; it just shows that this is an argument about something bigger than economics.\u201d\n\nThis sort of information has been argued by the Working Families Party and other state organizations \u2014 like the left-leaning Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, whose positive statistics on paid sick leave were often cited by proponents during Philadelphia\u2019s seven-year battle \u2014 but new, independent information based on the law being in place will likely help push paid sick leave over the edge in places where new and expanded policies are currently being debated.\n\n\u201c[Our research] was never decisive in itself for some legislators, but what\u2019s exciting here is that now the opposition cannot say anything that isn\u2019t immediately discredited\u2026. Business groups still say they\u2019re going to lay people off but there\u2019s no actual evidence to support them,\u201d says Cantor of the Working Families Party.\n\nAnd for those politicians seeking mass approval in the coming days, support for this \u201cmiddle class economics\u201d idea could prove important for coming elections.\n\nAfter Philly Mayor Nutter gave his stamp of approval, presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton endorsed the new Philly law, which goes into effect in May, via Twitter.\n\n\u201cGood week for #Philadelphia,\u201d Clinton wrote, with a link to a Philly.com story about the sick leave ordinance. (Nutter\u2019s signature, of course, came the same week the Democratic National Committee announced that the 2016 National Convention would take place in Philadelphia.)\n\nAssuming this trend continues, paid sick leave will likely become a much-debated topic in the 2016 elections. And assuming the overwhelming amount of data is correct, conservatives may want to begin shifting their allegiances.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To those who were listening, President Barack Obama\u2019s call for a national mandatory paid sick leave law at last month\u2019s State of the Union address probably\u2026", "author": "Pacific Standard", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "To those who were listening, President Barack Obama\u2019s call for a national mandatory paid sick leave law at last month\u2019s State of the Union address probably\u2026", "title": "How Paid Sick Leave Became a Major Issue for the Left \u2014 Pacific Standard", "url": "https://psmag.com/how-paid-sick-leave-became-a-major-issue-for-the-left-b0b4572027c7", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*l1id578GedL3iw6z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"creator": "@PacificStand", "label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*l1id578GedL3iw6z.jpg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "6 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/b0b4572027c7"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary"}, "title": "How Paid Sick Leave Became a Major Issue for the Left \u2014 Pacific Standard", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://psmag.com/how-paid-sick-leave-became-a-major-issue-for-the-left-b0b4572027c7"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/b0b4572027c7", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/b0b4572027c7", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2015-02-20T15:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://psmag.com/@pacificstand"}, "theme-color": "#000000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf370\"", "article_summary": "How Paid Sick Leave Became a Major Issue for the LeftPhiladelphia Mayor Michael Nutter.\nAssuming this trend continues, paid sick leave will likely become a much-debated topic in the 2016 elections.\nNationally, a 2013 YouGov poll found 74 percent of the U.S. public (Democrats, Independents, and Republicans) support mandatory paid sick leave.\nA number of states and municipalities have now enacted mandatory paid sick leave and the data show conclusions that go way beyond the philosophical debate.\nResidents of Massachusetts; Montclair, New Jersey; and Trenton, New Jersey, were all asked via ballot referendum if they supported paid sick leave."}
