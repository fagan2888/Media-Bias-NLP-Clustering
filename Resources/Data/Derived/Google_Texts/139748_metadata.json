John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion put nearly half a million Ohioans on Medicaid.\n\nFrom December 2013 through December 2014, Ohio\u2019s labor force declined by 20,506, based on U.S. Department of Labor data. Enrollment in Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion, which took effect in January 2014, had rocketed to 485,462 by December.\n\nKasich, a Republican, unilaterally expanded Medicaid after critics expressed concern about federal spending, future state costs, access to care and the workforce impact of putting able-bodied, working-age adults on Ohio\u2019s largest welfare program.\n\nOhio\u2019s labor force declined by 71,498 during Kasich\u2019s first term, narrowly increasing in 2013 after dropping in 2011 and 2012. Kasich boasts of reducing unemployment, although lower unemployment rates have resulted partly from the state\u2019s shrinking workforce.\n\nA study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in mid-2013 found Tennessee\u2019s workforce participation grew after the state removed able-bodied, working-age adults \u2014 the same people added to Medicaid by Obamacare \u2014 from its Medicaid rolls.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office affirmed in early 2014 that states implementing Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion would see their workforce participation drop because the expansion would \u201creduce incentives to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhio\u2019s labor force participation is at near-historic lows due to many reasons including demographic changes and a troubling increase in prime working age adults receiving disability,\u201d Greg Lawson, policy analyst at the free-market Buckeye Institute, told Ohio Watchdog via email.\n\nLawson pointed to Buckeye Institute research showing an increasing percentage of Ohioans ages 18 to 64 receiving government disability benefits.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Medicaid expansion does nothing to make this better. In fact, it is likely to exacerbate the underlying trend as research from both the non-partisan National Bureau for Economic Research and the Congressional Budget Office shows,\u201d Lawson continued.\n\n\u201cUnless Ohio policymakers figure out a way to move people on Medicaid quickly off, we can expect less Ohioans bothering to look for jobs and further erosion of our long-term economic vibrancy,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAccording to Kasich, putting more Ohioans on Medicaid allows them to share in the state\u2019s terrific economic recovery. Ohio\u2019s job creation rate ranked 36th of the 50 states from December 2013 through December 2014.\n\nOhio\u2019s seasonally adjusted total non-farm employment grew by 269,400 from December 2010 through December 2014, with net job creation during Kasich\u2019s first term far short of Obamacare expansion enrollment in just one year.\n\nIn 2013, the year Kasich unilaterally expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, Ohio\u2019s economy added only 51,000 jobs. In 2014, Ohio\u2019s economy added 61,500 jobs while Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion put 485,462 Ohioans on Medicaid.\n\nWith enrollment in his Obamacare Medicaid expansion likely to exceed 500,000 this month, Kasich insists his priority is helping people break the cycle of government dependence.\n\nKasich claims his Obamacare expansion is paid for with \u201cOhio dollars\u201d and has nothing to do with Obamacare. Kasich is also promoting a federal balanced budget amendment, but his Medicaid expansion increased federal spending by more than $2 billion in its first year.\n\nKasich\u2019s press secretary did not respond to a request for comment on the disparities between the governor\u2019s rhetoric and the latest employment, labor force and Medicaid enrollment data.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio's labor force shrank last year while Gov.
