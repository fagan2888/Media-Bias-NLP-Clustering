It has been corrected since it first published.\n\nWhen then-freshman Vermont Congressman Bernie Sanders first arrived in Washington, D.C., he didn\u2019t first tend to the great social democratic causes that he spent his life working on: a national living wage, health care for all, or expanding labor unions.\n\nRather, the very first bill he introduced was H.R. 695 \u2013 the Guard and Reserve Family Protection Act of 1991. The purpose of the bill was to make sure that reserve and National Guard soldiers who were deployed to serve in the Gulf War were entitled to any pay they may have missed as a result of going to war, to ensure that their deployment wages were equal to their civilian wages.\n\nSanders\u2019 career in Congress has been living testimony to the fact that opposing wars but supporting our soldiers are not mutually exclusive goals. He has been a consistent advocate for both active duty military and veterans, and there are now signs that those veterans are returning the favor, organizing for his campaign.\n\nA Steadfast Advocate For Veterans\n\n\u201cHe works for veterans. He\u2019s not just saying that. He does do the work,\u201d said Brenda Cruickshank a retired Army nurse who served as the past commander of the Vermont Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), over the summer. Indeed, last spring the national VFW presented Sanders with its 2015 Congressional Award.\n\nThat award came after Sanders forged a successful compromise to overhaul the Veterans Administration (VA), which had been plagued in scandals over its inability to handle its intake. \u201cLast year when we had the scandal at the VA, he was incredibly effective, engaged in getting the legislation passed, in getting it funded. Frankly, without him, I don\u2019t think we would have gotten it done because there was a lot of name-calling but there wasn\u2019t a lot of constructive, \u2018OK, here\u2019s the resources. \u2026\u2019 And he did it,\u201d said Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), noting how crucial Sanders was to the overhaul.\n\nThe praise for Sanders for his leadership on the VA issue was bipartisan. The deal wouldn\u2019t have gone down without the support of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who worked closely with Sanders. \u201cI found him to be honorable and good as his word. And his word was good,\u201d said McCain. \u201cSenator Sanders understands what it takes to get legislation across the goal line,\u201d said Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) of the VA compromise. \u201cI think he\u2019s very outspoken in terms of where he is ideologically. But when he gets down to the need of get legislation into law, then I find him to be one who\u2019s willing to sit down and compromise and negotiate to get a final product.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sanders' congressional record is proof that actively opposing armed conflict doesn't preclude supporting our troops", "title": "Veterans for Bernie Sanders: Why the anti-war candidate is so beloved by former soldiers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sanders' congressional record is proof that actively opposing armed conflict doesn't preclude supporting our troops", "title": "Veterans for Bernie Sanders: Why the anti-war candidate is so beloved by former soldiers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/24/vets_for_bernie_why_the_most_anti_war_candidate_has_many_military_supporters_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/bernie_sanders19.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sanders' congressional record is proof that actively opposing armed conflict doesn't preclude supporting our troops", "title": "Veterans for Bernie Sanders: Why the anti-war candidate is so beloved by former soldiers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/bernie_sanders19.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Zaid Jilani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bernie Sanders, National Guard, Pacifism, Vermont, veterans administration", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09a4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Bernie Sanders, National Guard, Pacifism, Vermont, veterans administration, Elections News, Social News, Life News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNet .\n\u201cSenator Sanders understands what it takes to get legislation across the goal line,\u201d said Sen.
