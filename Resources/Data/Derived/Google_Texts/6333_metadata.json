Admits Medicaid expansion costs more than projected.\u201d Michael and I disagree on everything. He is the Cato Institute firebrand who has apparently dedicated his life to destroying the Affordable Care Act. But he is a smart guy. I often learn from what he writes even as I disagree with it. Cannon quotes from a recently-released Medicaid actuary report, which bears careful reading.\n\nMichael\u2019s first sentence made my heart sink: \u201cIt appears that Medicaid-expansion enrollees are going to cost the states a lot more than they thought.\u201d Given the current knife fight over getting states to expand their Medicaid programs, this would be quite damaging. We know, for for example, that behavioral health costs are significant in a subset of new enrollees. There are also complicated interactions with other state and federal assistance programs. It\u2019s certainly plausible that Medicaid expansion will turn out to be more costly than originally thought.\n\nBecause he is such a firebrand happy warrior, I have learned to follow up on his hotlinks to see what else might be going on. So I hunted down the report and ran the numbers. The actuaries did indeed predict higher costs\u2014but almost all in the first year when states wouldn\u2019t have to pay any of these costs. (The higher costs seem to reflect pent-up demand and perhaps more pregnant women than predicted in this particular Medicaid pool. I would like to learn more about what\u2019s happening as states gain experience in the expansion population.)\n\nI also ran the actual numbers from this year and last-year\u2019s reports. The increase in predicted annual* costs per enrollee are shown below, broken down between the states and the federal government. The increased cost to the states averages that Michael warns us about are\u2026. about $5/enrollee per year between 2014 and 2022. If you\u2019re having trouble finding it, its the blue line visually indistinguishable from zero. To Michael\u2019s credit, he\u2019s told me he will modify the post. He certainly should.\n\nThe increased costs to the federal government are shown in red. The difference here is about $881 in the first year as the Medicaid expansion gets rolling, and then plunges in subsequent years, averaging out at about $95/enrollee per year. That\u2019s something like 2.2% of average non-disabled adult Medicaid costs. Despite the initial upward bump, things are quite manageable. It\u2019s certainly not the sort of bad news one must conceal in a Friday news dump.\n\nThe main good news about the overall Medicaid program is below the fold.\n\nDespite Cannon\u2019s scary headline and a one-year upward-bump in estimated costs, , these are deeply unalarming findings.\n\nThe real story in the latest Medicaid actuary report is more hopeful. The entire Medicaid program is experiencing slower cost growth than was expected at the signing of ACA or even a few years ago. Forecasting out to 2022, this makes a huge difference.\n\nBetween last year\u2019s report and this year\u2019s, Medicaid actuaries reduced their estimate of how much the entire Medicaid program will spend seven years from now by 7.9 percent. That\u2019s a trend that reflects a real slowdown over the past several years. These costs savings\u2014assuming current predictions are borne out\u2014swamp anything that might go well or poorly in ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n*I added the word annual there, since commenter Stuart_Levine notes that the chart labels are unclear.", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Admits Medicaid expansion costs more than projected.\u201d Michael and I disagree on everything.\nThese costs savings\u2014assuming current predictions are borne out\u2014swamp anything that might go well or poorly in ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nIt\u2019s certainly plausible that Medicaid expansion will turn out to be more costly than originally thought.\nThat\u2019s something like 2.2% of average non-disabled adult Medicaid costs.\nThe difference here is about $881 in the first year as the Medicaid expansion gets rolling, and then plunges in subsequent years, averaging out at about $95/enrollee per year."}
