Catalonia will hold a nonbinding vote on independence in November, and a number of other European regions are contemplating going it alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s always some idle secession chatter in the freedom-and-independence-loving United States, too. A new poll shows one in four Americans support \u201cthe idea of your state peacefully withdrawing from the United States of America and the federal government.\u201d\n\nBut could it ever be more than a rhetorical phenomenon in the States? It seems unlikely, given that those who benefit most from union are those most interested in secession.\n\nHere\u2019s from a recent poll on who wants to leave:\n\nSecession got more support from Republicans than Democrats, more from right- than left-leaning independents, more from younger than older people, more from lower- than higher-income brackets, more from high school than college grads. \u2026 Of the people who said they identified with the Tea Party, supporters of secession were actually in the majority, with 53 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s recipients of government largess who want to get out. It\u2019s net donors to the government who want to stay. To wit, only one in five residents of the wealthy New England states supports secession, separatist-lusty Vermont included, versus one in three residents of the poorer southwest, where the urge is more pronounced.\n\nIn the United States, the most likely breakaway is Texas, and there\u2019s at least some reason to believe it might do fine as an independent republic. It has access to international waterways. It has a diversified economy, with all that cattle and oil money coming in. It has a long foreign border with Mexico. Most of all, it has that independent spirit.\n\nBut it takes a lot more than grit to make it as a new country\u2014and generally, the poorer, smaller, and less-diversified the state, the worse it would fare after independence. Secession itself would also be extremely costly, though how costly would depend on whether the United States acceded to the plan (not likely) and how much it wanted to antagonize New Kansas or Free Texas or what have you. Would it forgive said state's debts? Would it implement airspace restrictions, travel restrictions, sanctions, or even a full embargo? Might it bar a new country from the global payments system?\n\nBut let\u2019s say we\u2019re in a heartless, rationalist thunderdome-type situation. In that case, who deserves to get kicked out?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAlas, it probably makes sense to ax a poor state like West Virginia. A few states send Washington more money in taxes than they receive in benefits. But most get a lot more than they give. In West Virginia, the disparity ranks among the highest, primarily because the state is so poor. The average household there makes $43,500 a year. In Maryland, it\u2019s $72,000. Combine that with high rates of disability and heavy use of social programs, and West Virginians take almost $3 for every $1 they pay in. That\u2019s using 2010 data. Now that the hugely redistributive Affordable Care Act is in place\u2014taxing the rich, giving health insurance to the poor\u2014the skew is likely greater.\n\nBy the same token, rich states like New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut end up donating tax dollars to get pushed out to the lower-income frontier. Such rich economies would be well suited to going alone\u2014especially if they banded together to maximize their economic diversity and the potential of their physical infrastructure. The Thirteen Colonies, for instance, might make for a lovely new country.\n\nAll else equal, we\u2019d probably notice the change the least if we got rid of Wyoming, which has the smallest population. Since it\u2019s part of the contiguous lower-48, though, it might make more sense to dispense with the former monarchy of Hawaii, which as the economist Tyler Cowen has noted, is culturally distinct and hard to defend. Alaska also seems like a good option. It has oil resources to support it. It has a small, hardy, heavily armed population. And, along with Texas and Vermont, it keeps threatening to secede anyway.\n\nBut finally, we come to the States that are just asking for it, namely Florida, America\u2019s lunatic dongle, and Ohio, our land of pool-raft fuckers and skyline chili. If they left, would we really miss them?\n\nBut there is, of course, a reason they never do\u2014just like why Scotland never did. Cleaving a part of a country away from another makes sense in some rare cases\u2014when countries\u2019 polities are deeply cleaved on political, economic, or social lines, for instance. It\u2019s hard to imagine the largely united if decidedly federalist United States ever wanting to go down the same path. And it is worth noting that it\u2019s more likely that we\u2019ll get additions rather than subtractions in the coming years.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "us secession, scotland, europe secession movements, economics of secession", "sailthru.author": "Annie Lowrey", "description": "This article originally appeared in the Daily Intelligencer.
