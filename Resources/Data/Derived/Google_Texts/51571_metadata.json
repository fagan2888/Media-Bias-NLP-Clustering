On her final run, with her victory secured, she almost stuck a first-ever cab 1080.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely a strategic rider. I go out and put down the run I want to do that day and then I give myself the opportunity to kind of push myself and push my riding,\u201d said the 30-year-old, who has won more contests that any snowboarder in history. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to do tricks and really push yourself regardless of being a U.S. Open final. For me, even my victory laps I\u2019m still pushing it because it is about the riding for me. For me it is about the sport of snowboarding. It is about progression. It is about inspiring people and if I\u2019ve ever been in that position to inspire someone to dream big and believe that nothing is impossible \u2026 if I can do one thing that would be at the top of my list.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s Queralt Castellet stomped a pair of 900s, with solid grabs on a pair of 540s and an off-axis 720 on her first run to score 85.73 and win second place. Castellet struggled to land a run at the Winter Olympics last month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough, intense season,\u201d she said, noting that she had looked forward to the U.S. Open all season. \u201cFor me it was more doing a contest that I could just enjoy and close the season with a fun contest. It was a pipe I was able to have fun in.\u201d\n\nChloe Kim, the 13-year-old prodigy whose spectacular season has left her heralded as the future of halfpipe snowboarding, won third with off-axis tricks sandwiched between style-drenched switch straight airs that earned 83.95 points.\n\nThe switch airs were something she had worked on in practice but never thrown in competition. She said she was partly inspired to throw the trick after Danny Davis floated his signature switch method \u2014 a style-over-spinning tossback to snowboarding\u2019s roots \u2014 to win the Aspen X Games last month.\n\n\u201cIt could be a Danny thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best switch method I\u2019ve ever seen. So I was like, \u2018Yeah I want to do that too.\u2019 \u201c\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kelly Clark wins 7th Burton U.S. Open title", "title": "Kelly Clark wins 7th Burton U.S. Open title", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/08/kelly-clark-wins-7th-burton-u-s-open-title/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140308__kelly-clarkp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140308__kelly-clarkp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-08T15:02:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:15:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7d4\"", "article_summary": "VAIL \u2014 Kelly Clark rebounded from Olympic bronze last month to win her seventh Burton U.S. Open title in Vail on Saturday, spinning the loftiest, most technical tricks of the contest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough, intense season,\u201d she said, noting that she had looked forward to the U.S. Open all season.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to do tricks and really push yourself regardless of being a U.S. Open final.\nImproving her score on her first two runs, Clark steadily increased the difficulty of her tricks to earn 89.33 points and the win.\nOn her final run, with her victory secured, she almost stuck a first-ever cab 1080."}
