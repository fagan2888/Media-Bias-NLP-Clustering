When Mason came out of Schneider\u2019s office he was missing four teeth \u2013 but there had been no consultation on that decision, Phillips said.\n\nOn a follow-up appointment Mason came out of the office with bruises around his neck and gauze around his lower teeth, even though he\u2019d come in for work on his uppers. Phillips took Mason to his pediatrician, and they were startled.\n\n\u201cThe pediatrician the following day discovered a scalpel slice from ear to ear on Mason\u2019s gum,\u201d Phillips said. She is among dozens of people suing Schneider in a complaint filed by attorney Gust Sarris. Another woman in the suit says her daughter was to have one tooth removed and ended up with seven extractions.\n\n\u201cWhat appeared from the outside to be an unremarkable pediatric dentistry practice, on the inside was a house of horrors ... where the most defenseless members of our society, indigent children ... are regularly assaulted,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s attorney Sarris wrote in the complaint.\n\nSchneider is the only pediatric dentist in Jacksonville who took Medicaid, so his practice attracted poorer clients, according to the lawsuit.\n\nParents of the children in his care also say the unnecessary tooth extractions were done without anesthetic, and that their children often came out of his care with cuts and bruises on their necks.\n\nSchneider is also accused of wearing scary costumes and threatening the children with statements like \u201cyour mom will die if you tell her what happened.\u201d\n\nSo far, Sarris\u2019 complaint claims that more than 60 former patients have joined the lawsuit\n\nAnother attorney representing dozens of other patients has also sued Schneider for medical malpractice.\n\nSchneider has faced two previous medical malpractice lawsuits. Both were dismissed after mediation, one with a settlement.\n\nThe Florida attorney general\u2019s fraud unit has also launched an inquiry into the case. Schneider has billed the government nearly $4 million in Medicaid reimbursements between 2010 and 2014, according to WJAX-TV.\n\nAttorney Will Durden, who is working with Sarris, says the Florida Department of Health has contacted them for an inquiry seeking an emergency order to shut Schneider down.\n\nThe department said it could not confirm or deny an investigation until 10 days after its investigators discover probable cause for such an action.\n\nMeanwhile, Phillips said she has been reassured, but also saddened, by the stories of so many other parents who have come forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helped in some ways, and in other ways made it\u2019s me only sicker because there\u2019s obviously worse stories,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A Florida children\u2019s dentist accused of running a \u201chouse of horrors\u201d that included performing surgical procedures without anesthetic agreed late last week", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/child-dentist-accused-horrors-quits", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201505/0435773715_15260210_8col.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Florida children\u2019s dentist accused of running a \u201chouse of horrors\u201d that included performing surgical procedures without anesthetic agreed late last week", "title": "Child Dentist Accused of \u2018Horrors\u2019 Quits"}, "story_id": 409690858, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Child Dentist Accused of \u2018Horrors\u2019 Quits"}, "nid": 10764, "datePublished": "2015-05-26", "keywords": "pediatric dentist, Dr. Howard Schneider, Florida Department of Health, Medicaid", "wordCount": 599, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce281\"", "article_summary": "Phillips took Mason to his pediatrician, and they were startled.\nA Florida children\u2019s dentist accused of running a \u201chouse of horrors\u201d that included performing surgical procedures without anesthetic agreed late last week to stop practicing medicine.\nThe Florida attorney general\u2019s fraud unit has also launched an inquiry into the case.\nSchneider is the only pediatric dentist in Jacksonville who took Medicaid, so his practice attracted poorer clients, according to the lawsuit.\nThe Florida Department of Health said Schneider voluntarily relinquished his license to practice in the state."}
