(Facebook)\n\nIn posts dating back to 2013, Bruner claimed humans lived alongside dinosaurs and added they went extinct in a Biblical flood, not due to a meteor smashing into the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nShe also believed pre-K programs were designed to make children gay and Obamacare was implemented to reduce the nation\u2019s population by 200 million.\n\nProf. who claims Newtown is hoax suing university that axed him\n\nBruner defended her social media activity to WFAA-TV over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote those things, I wasn't even intending to run for the State Board of Education,\u201d Bruner said. \u201cI had no idea that I would.\u201d\n\nWith News Wire Services\n\nnhensley@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "NICOLE HENSLEY", "twitter": {"description": "A candidate who was poised to win a Texas State Board of Education seat lost after a watchdog group exposed her hawking conspiracy theories.", "title": "Ex-Texas teach who shared conspiracy theories loses school race", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ex-texas-teach-shared-conspiracy-theories-loses-school-race-article-1.2649067", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2649065.1464158904!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/texas26n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Mary Lou Bruner, Texas State Board of Education GOP primary, Obama gay prostitute, JFK assassination conspiracy theories", "parsely-author": "Nicole Hensley", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Mary Lou Bruner, Texas State Board of Education GOP primary, Obama gay prostitute, JFK assassination conspiracy theories", "nydn_tags": "texas, faceebook, barack obama, lgbt news, climate change, religion", "news_keywords": "Mary Lou Bruner, Texas State Board of Education GOP primary, Obama gay prostitute, JFK assassination conspiracy theories", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ex-texas-teach-shared-conspiracy-theories-loses-school-race-article-1.2649067", "parsely-title": "Ex-Texas teach who shared conspiracy theories loses school race", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-25T03:30:06-0400", "sailthru.title": "Ex-Texas teach who shared conspiracy theories loses school race", "nydn_section": "U.S.", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-25T07:30:06", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2649065.1464158904!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/texas26n-1-web.jpg", "description": "A candidate who was poised to win a Texas State Board of Education seat lost after a watchdog group exposed her hawking conspiracy theories.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "A candidate who was poised to win a Texas State Board of Education seat lost after a watchdog group exposed her hawking conspiracy theories.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "U.S.", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "A candidate who was poised to win a Texas State Board of Education seat lost after a watchdog group exposed her hawking conspiracy theories.", "title": "Ex-Texas teach who shared conspiracy theories loses school race", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ex-texas-teach-shared-conspiracy-theories-loses-school-race-article-1.2649067", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2649065.1464158904!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/texas26n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "texas, faceebook, barack obama, lgbt news, climate change, religion", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2649065.1464158904!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/texas26n-1-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "NICOLE HENSLEY", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33c5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen I wrote those things, I wasn't even intending to run for the State Board of Education,\u201d Bruner said.\nIn 2011, the Texas State Board of Education rejected proposed creationism and intelligent design materials as an alternative to evolution in science classes.\nMary Lou Bruner, 69, once claimed that President Obama was a gay prostitute and climate change was a Communist plot.\nA candidate who was poised to win a Texas State Board of Education seat suffered an astonishing primary runoff loss Tuesday after a watchdog group exposed her Facebook posts hawking conspiracy theories.\n\u201cTexas escaped an education train wreck tonight,\u201d Texas Freedom Network president Kathy Miller said in a statement as primary results trickled in."}
