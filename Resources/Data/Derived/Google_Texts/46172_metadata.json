Thankfully, the family got out safely.\n\nOn a holiday that often generates a lot of family memories, for one Broken Arrow family, the memory of this year's Fourth of July isn't a good one. A fire heavily damaged their home and destroyed a car in the driveway.\n\nFirefighters kept it from spreading to the house next door.\n\n\"Whenever they arrived, the garage was fully involved and it had already vented through to the attic that was directly above the garage,\" said Deputy Chief, Phil Reid, with BAFD.\n\nA couple and their nine-year-old daughter made it out safely. The mom and daughter had already gone to bed, and as the dad was locking the house up for the night, he saw flames coming from the garage.\n\nThe garage door had been up, so some in the neighborhood speculate a stray firework could have started the Fourth of July fire.\n\nFirefighters haven't determined how the fire started yet, but are certainly looking into whether fireworks could be to blame. Pinpointing fireworks as a cause, however, could be difficult.\n\n\"There's no one we can go to and say \u2018hey did anyone see a firework go into the garage,'\" Reid said.\n\nSince 2008, Broken Arrow has allowed people to shoot off fireworks inside the city limits as long as they get a $20 permit beforehand. The permits are for July third and fourth.\n\n\"If we do notice there are large amounts of permits in one concentrated area, we'll keep an eye on that area,\" said Reid.\n\nWhile it's not known yet if fireworks caused the house fire, the owners said they're not speculating on a cause. They're too busy meeting with insurance adjustors, restoration crews and figuring out what they'll be able to save.\n\nThe Broken Arrow Fire Department said any change to the ordinance allowing fireworks within the city limits, for people with permits, would have to go through the city council.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Fire investigators are looking at the possibility fireworks caused a fire that heavily damaged a Broken Arrow home on July 4, 2014.", "author": "Craig Day", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/25956700/investigators-fireworks-may-to-be-blame-for-broken-arrow-house-fire", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25956700_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fire investigators are looking at the possibility fireworks caused a fire that heavily damaged a Broken Arrow home on July 4, 2014.", "title": "Investigators: Fireworks May Be To Blame For Broken Arrow House Fire"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25956700_SA.jpg", "description": "Fire investigators are looking at the possibility fireworks caused a fire that heavily damaged a Broken Arrow home on July 4, 2014.", "card": "summary", "title": "Investigators: Fireworks May Be To Blame For Broken Arrow House Fire"}, "wnreadableurl": "investigators-fireworks-may-to-be-blame-for-broken-arrow-house-fire", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2014/07/07", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS17", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8e6\"", "article_summary": "On a holiday that often generates a lot of family memories, for one Broken Arrow family, the memory of this year's Fourth of July isn't a good one.\nSince 2008, Broken Arrow has allowed people to shoot off fireworks inside the city limits as long as they get a $20 permit beforehand.\nWhile it's not known yet if fireworks caused the house fire, the owners said they're not speculating on a cause.\nInvestigators in Broken Arrow are working to see if fireworks may have caused a Fourth of July house fire that heavily damaged a home near 81st Street South and 129th East Avenue.\nThe Broken Arrow Fire Department said any change to the ordinance allowing fireworks within the city limits, for people with permits, would have to go through the city council."}
