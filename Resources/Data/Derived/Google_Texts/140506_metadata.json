Though some media have reported that Kaleka, a Democrat, announced his bid Oct. 16, Kaleka clarified to India-West that he would formally announce his bid in late November. Kaleka has filed papers to form an exploratory committee and to raise funds for a possible Congressional run.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe outpouring of support has been tremendous,\u201d said Kaleka, noting that he has received a lot of support from within Wisconsin\u2019s Congressional District 1, which Ryan currently represents. \u201cNot since last August have we had such support,\u201d he said. Ryan has raised $1.7 million total towards his 2014 re-election campaign, $824,000 in this last quarter, according to Associated Press reports. The numbers could not be verified on the FEC database, which is behaving inconsistently during the government shutdown.\n\n\n\nKaleka said he has raised $5,000 unofficially thus far, and likened his bid for Congress as a classic \u2018David versus Goliath\u2019 battle. \u201cBut do I really need more money than Paul Ryan to run a successful campaign?\u201d queried Kaleka, adding that he hopes his vision for the nation will appeal to voters regardless of his campaign\u2019s funds.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning Aug. 5, 2012, Amardeep\u2019s father, former Oak Creek, Wisc., temple president Satwant Kaleka, was killed in a murderous rampage, when neo-Nazi Wade Michael Page stormed the gurdwara during Sunday prayers and killed six worshippers before killing himself. The tragedy at the temple is one of the worst acts of mass violence in Sikh American history.\n\n\n\nIn an interview last December, shortly after Adam Lanza attacked Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Dec. 14 and killed 20 primary school children and six adults, Kaleka told this newspaper, \u201cGun control laws would have saved my father\u2019s life. Gun control laws help limit the number of weapons in the nation. When it\u2019s harder to get a gun, people don\u2019t think about committing this type of crime.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an interview this week, a day before he filed papers with the FEC, Kaleka told India-West he believes gun violence can be controlled by better background checks. \u201cGetting the guns out of wrong hands is the first tool to controlling gun violence,\u201d he asserted.\n\n\n\nThe young Indian American noted that a restorative justice system \u2013 which teaches criminals how to function within society \u2013 rather than the current punitive justice system would throw $800 billion back in to the national economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeace is far more lucrative than crime. We spend so much money on crime, which is hurting our GDP,\u201d Kaleka stated.\n\n\n\nPardeep Kaleka, Amardeep\u2019s brother, told India-West that he owns three guns, including a 357 magnum and two handguns. Pardeep, an ex-police officer, said registering guns \u2013 \u201cknowing where they are and who owns them\u201d and the buyer\u2019s medical and mental health background \u2013 would cut down a lot of crime.\n\n\n\nAmardeep Kaleka told India-West that economic reform \u2013 not gun control \u2013 would be the focus of his campaign.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need Clintonian reform of stepping up the middle class with proper government stimulation. We were on the right track when (President Barack) Obama took office, but then back-tracked when the obstructionists took over in 2010,\u201d Kaleka stated.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, \u2018are we a trickle-down economy of crony capitalism, or a step-up economy that\u2019s raising the middle class,\u201d Kaleka stated.\n\n\n\nOne immediate fix would be to create a faster transit system between Chicago, Ill., and Milwaukee, Wisc., the heart of District 1. Both cities have booming economies that could benefit each other.\n\n\n\nKaleka characterized Ryan as a career politician, one who has barely visited his district since he took office 13 years ago. \u201cRyan is a pivotal member of the House, and we see the mess the House has created,\u201d stated Kaleka, referring to the current government shutdown and a looming threat of the nation being unable to pay its bills by Oct. 25, unless the debt ceiling is raised.\n\n\n\nRyan chairs the House Budget Committee, and earlier this year, introduced a plan known as the \u201cPath to Prosperity,\u201d which drastically cuts government spending \u2013 including entitlement benefits in health care \u2013 and tightens tax loopholes. The report noted that the U.S. is currently spending about 15 percent more than it is raising through tax revenue, and that figure is expected to rise to 60 percent by the year 2077.\n\n\n\nKaleka said the decision to run has been a slow process, adding that his mother has been afraid of racial backlash and violence against her son.\n\n\n\nKaleka said he often thinks about violence against him. \u201cIt\u2019s something that goes through every minority\u2019s mind of doing or saying something that will incite violence,\u201d he said, referencing former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt at a Tucson, Ariz., mall after expressing her support for the Affordable Care Act\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fear is always there. But this is what we are trying to change,\u201d stated Kaleka, who has launched the Web site votekaleka.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
