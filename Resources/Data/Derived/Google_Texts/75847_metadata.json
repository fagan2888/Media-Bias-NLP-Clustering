How that would work is unclear, but so far Clinton has offered far more specific economic proposals than her rivals. What impact would they have?\n\nThis story is part of the Deseret News National Edition , which focuses on the issues that resonate with American families.\n\nThe problem with Hillary Clinton, the pundits say, is that she lacks a clear economic message.\n\nDonald Trump wants to make America great again. He\u2019ll build a wall, impose steep tariffs and cut taxes for everybody.\n\nBernie Sanders wants to start a political revolution. He\u2019ll break up the banks, force billionaires to pay higher taxes and make college free.\n\nHillary Clinton? A lot harder to say.\n\nWhen NPR asked David Axelrod to explain Clinton\u2019s economic policy in one sentence he said Clinton doesn\u2019t want to do anything in one sentence.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem, right? She wants to do things in paragraphs and pages. This has always been a problem in that she is incredibly fluent in policy, she embraces good policy ideas, but she has a hard time weaving them into a coherent narrative that cuts through.\u201d\n\nThis week, though, Clinton broke from character and did offer an economic policy solution that is both simple and straightforward: turn it over to her husband.\n\nThe former president, she told voters in Kentucky, would be \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, you know, he knows how to do it. Especially in places like coal country and inner cities and other parts of our country that have really been left out.\u201d\n\nClinton immediately took flak for the comment \u2014 what kind of message would it send if the first female president of the United States turned what is perhaps the most important job of the president over to her husband?\n\nAll of which brings up an important question: What would Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic plan actually look like?\n\nAs Gail Collins of the New York Times pointed out, it\u2019s tough to say with any certainty. \u201cShe\u2019s pledged to do more to crack down on Wall Street, but she hasn\u2019t really said whether the deregulation during her husband\u2019s administration was a mistake. She\u2019s disagreed \u2014 briefly \u2014 with Obama on matters like immigration, trade and Arctic drilling, but the details are very hard to pin down.\u201d\n\nWould Clinton follow the centrist path of her husband, who repealed Glass-Steagall, deregulated the telecom industry and passed welfare reform? Or will the populist candidacy of Bernie Sanders push her even further to the left of Obama, who raised taxes on the country\u2019s highest earners for the first time since the late '90s, pushed through Obamacare and signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act?\n\nClinton has suggested she\u2019ll do both, to some extent, hewing to a centrist path while trying to keep her base happy, which is hungry for Wall Street reform.\n\nWhat Clinton won\u2019t do, no matter how much Sanders pushes her, is break up the country\u2019s largest banks, notes The Street. Instead, she\u2019d focus on tighter regulation of hedge funds and what she has called a \u201cshadow banking\u201d system.\n\nHer tax reform policies are also much more modest than either of her rivals, according to The Street: she\u2019d close tax loopholes, raise taxes on capital gains and levy a 4 percent surcharge on people earning more than $5 million, which would generate about $150 billion in revenue over 10 years. As NPR recently noted, most of Clinton\u2019s tax policies will affect a small number of Americans: those who make more than $5 million a year, the rich who take advantage of certain tax breaks and people who make over $1 million. (As an example, her surcharge proposal would affect 34,000 people.)\n\nShe\u2019s also said she\u2019d push for a nationwide $12-an-hour minimum wage and more or less continue the free trade policies of her husband and Obama, which is starkly different than the proposals of Trump (heavy tariffs) and Sanders (who wants to scrap free trade deals with Canada and Mexico).", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "This week, Hillary Clinton said she'd turn the economy over to her husband if elected president.
