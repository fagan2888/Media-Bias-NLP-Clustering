Martinez is becoming a late-game playoff legend after also scoring in overtime in Game 7 against Chicago in the Western Conference finals.\n\nChris Kreider scored a power-play goal and Brian Boyle added a tiebreaking short-handed goal late in the second period for the Rangers, who showed no nerves while facing elimination for the sixth time this spring.\n\nLundqvist stopped 48 shots in another standout performance for the Eastern Conference champions, but the Rangers repeatedly came up one goal short against the Kings despite their goalie\u2019s brilliance.\n\nMartinez started the final rush with a pass to Kyle Clifford, who dropped it to Toffoli for a shot. The rebound went straight to Martinez, and the depth defenseman buried it for his fifth goal of the postseason.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the rebound came to me and I was able to put it in,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThe New York Rangers are a hell of a hockey team. We knew it was going to be a tough series.\u201d\n\nThe Kings gathered for a huge group hug near the Rangers\u2019 net, while coach Darryl Sutter nonchalantly walked onto the ice with almost no celebration.\n\nBoth teams had tantalizing scoring chances in overtime, but couldn\u2019t convert.\n\nRyan McDonagh hit Quick\u2019s post with a long shot during an early power play. Toffoli rang a shot off Lundqvist\u2019s post with 7:15 left, and the Kings trapped New York in its own end for an exhausting stretch late in the period.\n\nKreider got a breakaway in the final minute after Drew Doughty fell down, but he missed the net.\n\nA few minutes after Carter\u2019s tip shot hit Lundqvist\u2019s post early in the second overtime, the Rangers put a tipped slap shot off Quick\u2019s post during their second fruitless overtime power play.\n\nRick Nash had an open net moments later, but Slava Voynov deflected the shot just high with the shaft of his stick.\n\nIn stark contrast to their rampage through the playoffs two years ago, the Kings earned this Cup with an incredible degree of difficulty.\n\nGame 5 was the Kings\u2019 26th playoff game of the spring, matching the NHL record for the longest postseason run. Los Angeles has played 64 playoff games over the last three years, setting another league record.\n\nWith Sutter and a solid veteran leadership group emphasizing consistency, the Kings have calmly handled everything the NHL could throw at them. After fighting through three straight seven-game series to emerge from the tough Western Conference, the Kings won the first three games of the finals, starting with consecutive OT wins at Staples Center on goals by Williams and captain Dustin Brown.\n\nBut New York staved off elimination with a 2-1 victory in Game 4 at Madison Square Garden, earning another cross-country trip.\n\nStaples Center was packed well before the opening faceoff with fans eager for another celebration, rocking the arena with chants of \u201cGo Kings Go!\u201d while both teams were still in their dressing rooms.\n\nLos Angeles started out with yet another big-game goal from Williams, who put the Kings ahead with his ninth goal of the postseason on a loose puck after linemates Dwight King and Jarret Stoll applied pressure on Lundqvist.\n\nThe Kings never led in their two overtime victories at home earlier in the series. But even after falling behind early, New York showed no semblance of nerves, largely outplaying the Kings in the first two periods.\n\nThe Rangers finally equalized when McDonagh found Kreider in front. Boyle then got a stunner after Carl Hagelin got the puck away from Voynov, skating around Doughty and wiring a pinpoint shot into the far top corner behind Quick with 29 seconds left for his third goal in 25 postseason games.\n\nBut the Kings showed the same determination that has characterized their entire spring run, and they finally equalized with Mats Zuccarello in the box.\n\nDoughty\u2019s long shot hit Lundqvist in the chest and dropped in front of him before Gaborik alertly poked it between his legs for the 14th goal of a spectacular postseason by the Kings\u2019 newest acquisition.\n\nNOTES: Both teams kept the same lineups from Game 4. Sutter never used D Robyn Regehr, who has recovered from his May 3 knee injury. \u2026 The Kings never led in their two overtime victories at home earlier in the series. \u2026 The 1987 Philadelphia Flyers and the 2004 Calgary Flames also played 26 postseason games, but neither won the Cup.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Los Angeles Kings top Rangers 3-2 in 2 OTs to win Stanley Cup", "title": "Los Angeles Kings top Rangers 3-2 in 2 OTs to win Stanley Cup", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/los-angeles-kings-top-rangers-3-2-in-2-ots-to-win-stanley-cup/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613_085550_kings-rangers.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613_085550_kings-rangers.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T21:16:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:54:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Alec Martinez scored 14:43 into the second overtime, and the Los Angeles Kings won the Stanley Cup for the second time in three years with a 3-2 victory over the New York Rangers in Game 5 on Friday night.\n\u201cThe New York Rangers are a hell of a hockey team.\nA few minutes after Carter\u2019s tip shot hit Lundqvist\u2019s post early in the second overtime, the Rangers put a tipped slap shot off Quick\u2019s post during their second fruitless overtime power play.\nGame 5 was the Kings\u2019 26th playoff game of the spring, matching the NHL record for the longest postseason run.\nMartinez is becoming a late-game playoff legend after also scoring in overtime in Game 7 against Chicago in the Western Conference finals."}
