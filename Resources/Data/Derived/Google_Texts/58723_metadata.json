Around 600 people rallied at the steps of the capital building to protest Brownback's reversal of a measure that barred discrimination against LGBT state workers.\n\n\"Disappointing, its on the wrong side of history, and its going the wrong direction,\" says a protester named Jerry.\n\nBrownback's executive order means gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender state employees are no longer protected from being fired, harassed, or discriminated for their sexual orientation or gender identity. Elle Boatman made the trip from Wichita to the statehouse rally for her equal rights.\n\n\"I was devastated because to me as a state employee, it was not just an unwillingness to provide protections to LGBT citizens but went one step further and rescinded protections that have been there for several years.\"\n\nBrownback argues the anti-discrimination measure issued in 2007 by then-governor Kathleen Sebelius should have gone through the legislature first.\n\n\"This is Sam Brownback unequivocally saying that he does not care about the people that work directly for him,\" says Boatman.\n\nProtesters are now urging people to back a House Bill that would once again add sexual orientation and gender identity to Kansas anti-discrimination laws. Boatman says from what she saw at the Statehouse on Saturday, she has high hopes there will be enough support.\n\n\"It was just amazing to see how many kansans not only support LGBT people or are LGBT people, but are willing to stand up for equal rights for them and for everyone publicly and without shame,\" she says.\n\nBrownback's decision means Kansas joins 28 other states that do not have protections preventing state employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Protesters gathered at the Statehouse to rally against Gov.
