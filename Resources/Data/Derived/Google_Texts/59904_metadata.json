Published in The Lancet Oncology, the study found that doctors who are young, friendly, and na\u00efve might not be as good at carrying out objective, truthful decisions \u2014 particularly to patients they like.\n\nThe researchers analyzed 338 oncologists under the age of 40 and found that 60 percent of them felt that being too close to their patients could prevent them from making objective decisions about that person\u2019s care. In addition, some two-thirds of doctors under the age of 30 struggle with being completely honest with patients they like.\n\n\u201cOncology is a specialty that can be enormously rewarding but is fraught with many challenges,\u201d Lesley Fallowfield of Brighton and Sussex Medical School, and an author of the study, said in the study. \u201cYoung oncologists have to master dealing with anxious patients who are facing a life-threatening disease; conveying the true prognosis; discussing the complexity of modern treatments; and explaining the unavailability of some drugs, the side effects of treatment, and likely therapeutic aims.\u201d\n\nAbout half of the doctors in the study had given patients their personal cell phone numbers, and about 14 percent had accepted patients as friends on Facebook. \u201cThe difficulty, if you hug and kiss patients, if you allow them to call you by your first name, is that quickly the relationship can become confused as a social one rather than a professional one,\u201d Fallowfield said. \u201cDoctors become confused, \u2018I really like this person, how can I bear to tell them that they\u2019re going to die?\u2019 They find it more difficult to be objective.\u201d\n\nBut most people certainly don\u2019t want their doctors to be cold, detached, and careless, either. In the 19th and early 20th century, doctors would come to patients\u2019 houses and treat them at home, in a far more relaxed and informal environment. The relationship between doctor and patient wasn\u2019t so aggressively watched and regulated as it is now \u2014 as most doctors now work at large, bureaucratic health institutions and the stakes are higher. The General Medical Council offers doctors guidelines in maintaining a boundary between them and their patients, in particular focusing on the downfalls of a sexual or financial relationship. But what if acts of kindness to patients are smaller, and more subtle? Such as doctors occasionally paying for a $30 prescription the patient couldn\u2019t afford, or even accepting a gift from the patient themselves.\n\n\u201cKindness to friend and duty to patient: Are they one and the same? Or separated by a barbed-wire fence? Opinion is all over the map,\u201d Dr. Abigail Zurer wrote in The New York Times. Indeed, doctors are polarized on the issue, with some believing that professional boundaries shouldn\u2019t be crossed at any point \u2014 and others believing that compassion shouldn\u2019t be boxed and regulated.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, it's better to be safe than sorry, Fallowfield believes, noting that too friendly of doctors could lead to a harmful impact on a patient's health care. Fallowfield points out that patients who are friends with their doctors might \u201cfeel intimidated about complaining\u201d or refrain from raising issues about treatment, and that doctors need to be especially careful in the age of social media.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "friendly doctors, medical ethics", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study finds that doctors who are nice to patients often find it more difficult to remain objective.", "title": "When Doctors Are Too Nice To Deliver Bad News", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/friendly-doctors-find-it-harder-be-honest-patients-they-hurting-objectivity-312158", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/doctor-hugging-patient.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study finds that doctors who are nice to patients often find it more difficult to remain objective.", "title": "When Doctors Are Too Nice To Deliver Bad News", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/friendly-doctors-find-it-harder-be-honest-patients-they-hurting-objectivity-312158", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/doctor-hugging-patient.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/doctor-hugging-patient.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-11-25T15:27:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-25T15:27:33-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study finds that doctors who are nice to patients often find it more difficult to remain objective."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb439\"", "article_summary": "In addition, some two-thirds of doctors under the age of 30 struggle with being completely honest with patients they like.\nPublished in The Lancet Oncology, the study found that doctors who are young, friendly, and na\u00efve might not be as good at carrying out objective, truthful decisions \u2014 particularly to patients they like.\nSuch as doctors occasionally paying for a $30 prescription the patient couldn\u2019t afford, or even accepting a gift from the patient themselves.\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, doctors would come to patients\u2019 houses and treat them at home, in a far more relaxed and informal environment.\nWhen it comes down to it, it's better to be safe than sorry, Fallowfield believes, noting that too friendly of doctors could lead to a harmful impact on a patient's health care."}
