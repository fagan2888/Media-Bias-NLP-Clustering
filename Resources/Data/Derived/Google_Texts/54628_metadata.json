An advisory evacuation notice is in place as of about 3 p.m.\n\nA reverse 9-1-1 call had been issued around 12:30 p.m., telling citizens in the area that flooding in the area was \u201cimminent\u201d after water breached the headgate of the Oligarchy Ditch.\n\nEmergency workers have dug another ditch to carry water from the Oligarchy ditch into the lake, said Cmndr. Jeffrey Satur.\n\nThe ditch runs north of the lake, Satur said. \u201cNormally, there isn\u2019t water in it but we had it open to release pressure on the river, but the whole head gate ruptured so water is flowing into the ditch more than we wanted.\u201d\n\nCrews are digging a second ditch near the headgate to funnel water back into the river.\n\nThe St. Vrain River has been rising, and earlier on Sunday the city ordered evacuations along the river corridor.\n\nGauges at the river show that as much as an inch-and-a-half of rain has fallen in one hour, Satur said. \u201cAll that rain is dumping into the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlooding is imminent in your area, residents are urged to evacuate and move to higher ground immediately,\u201d the city said in a release announcing the Lake Macintosh evacuations.\n\nAt about 2 p.m., Satur said there had been no flooding, and that with luck, there might not be any. \u201cIt will be several hours before we see some impact in Longmont. We are monitoring the levels of water.\u201d\n\nLongmont is asking residents along Left Hand Creek to shelter in place, prepare for evacuations, and monitor the creek for flooding. Residents will be notified if they must evacuate.\n\nEvacuation centers are open at the Memorial (Longs Peak Ave and Coffman St.), Silver Creek High School and the Recreation Center on Quail Road, east of Main St.\n\nResidents can check the City of Longmont\u2019s website for updates. www.ci.longmont.co.us.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Longmont rescinds evacuation order for homes in Lake Macintosh area", "title": "Longmont rescinds evacuation order for homes in Lake Macintosh area", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/15/longmont-rescinds-evacuation-order-for-homes-in-lake-macintosh-area/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__CD15FLOODSp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__CD15FLOODSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-15T15:15:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:11:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc3a\"", "article_summary": "Longmont has rescinded its evacuation of about 1,000 homes in the Lake Macintosh area that was issued after a gate that separates an irrigation ditch from the St. Vrain River ruptured on Sunday afternoon.\nThe city is urging people in the affected area to \u201cshelter in place,\u201d according to the Longmont Times-Call.\nEmergency workers have dug another ditch to carry water from the Oligarchy ditch into the lake, said Cmndr.\nThe ditch runs north of the lake, Satur said.\nThe St. Vrain River has been rising, and earlier on Sunday the city ordered evacuations along the river corridor."}
