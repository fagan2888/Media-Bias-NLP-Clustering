Results covering the period before and after implementation of the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces and Medicaid expansion were included in the report.\n\nThe survey data covered a total of 111,682 people. A single family representative responded to survey questions about every member of his or her household, explained Cohen. The interview period ran from January to December 2014, just as the Affordable Care Act reforms were being implemented. Respondents were asked about their insurance status at the time of the interview and also over the preceding year.\n\nAs of when respondents were interviewed:\n\nUninsurance rates for adults ages 18 to 64 fell from 20.4% in 2013 to 16.3% in 2014\n\nPercentage of \"young invincibles\" -- those 19 to 25 who lacked health insurance -- dropped from 26.5% in 2013 to 20.0% in 2014\n\nWithin the 18 to 64 age group, those lacking a high school diploma accounted for 34% of the uninsured; 38.7% of those lacking insurance were unemployed in 2014. Only 14.9% of employed adults lack coverage\n\nAmong those under 65, Hispanics were the most likely to lack coverage (25%), far above rates for non-Hispanic blacks (13.5%), Asians (10.6%), and non-Hispanic whites (9.8%)\n\nWith the exception of children under 18, all age groups saw \"significant decreases\" in uninsurance rate for at least a portion of the year before the interview was conducted, between 2013 and 2014, the report noted.\n\nJust over 8% of respondents had lacked insurance for more than a year when interviewed, the report said.\n\nThe report included tables and maps showing the geographic variation in insurance and uninsurance rates. Cohen noted that the West South Central region of the country had the greatest lack of insurance coverage for adults under 65, while New England had the lowest rate for that age group.\n\nHawaii led all states in coverage, just 2.5% of adults under age 65 lacking health insurance. At the bottom, Texas and Oklahoma tied for the highest rates of uninsurance, for the same demographic, at 21.5%, with Alaska close behind at 21.2% and Florida at 18.8%.\n\nThe report also identified states that showed significant gains in healthcare coverage from 2013 to 2014.\n\nWest Virginia showed the sharpest decline in uninsurance rates with a 14.8 percentage point decrease from 2013 to 2014; Arkansas, Washington, and Nevada followed with declines of 8.5, 7.4, and 7.2 percentage points, respectively.\n\nAlso in the report were analyses of states with different insurance marketplace systems created under the reform law. \"Irregardless of the marketplace type, we saw a decrease in the percentage in uninsured and an increase in the percentage with private coverage,\" Cohen said. But researchers did not see any significant change in public health coverage among states on the federally facilitated marketplace, she added.\n\nSimilarly, states that expanded Medicaid saw a decrease in uninsurance rates for those 18 to 64 and an increase in public coverage as well as private coverage. Cohen noted a \"similar decrease, if not a little less\" in uninsurance rates in non-Medicaid expansion states and an increase in private coverage, \"but no change in public coverage for that age group.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Shannon  Firth", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/PublicHealth/52260", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/52xxx/52260.jpg", "description": "Some 9 million gained coverage in 2014, but nearly 12% of Americans still had no insurance", "card": "Summary", "title": "CDC: Uninsured Population Shrinks, But Still Substantial"}, "dc.date.issued": "2015-06-23 14:00:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "infectiousdisease,primarycare,publichealthpolicy,publichealth,healthpolicy,generalprimarycare,washington-watch,hospitalbasedmedicine,nursing,nursing,theguptaguide", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-23 14:00:00", "sailthru.title": "CDC: Uninsured Population Shrinks, But Still Substantial", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "Some 9 million gained coverage in 2014, but nearly 12% of Americans still had no insurance", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-06-24 14:06:00", "date": "2015-06-23 14:00:00", "sailthru.description": "Some 9 million gained coverage in 2014, but nearly 12% of Americans still had no insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/PublicHealth/52260", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/52xxx/52260.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some 9 million gained coverage in 2014, but nearly 12% of Americans still had no insurance", "title": "CDC: Uninsured Population Shrinks, But Still Substantial"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2015-06-23 14:00:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "infectiousdiseases,Other,primarycare,hospitalmedicine", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/52xxx/52260.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e5e\"", "article_summary": "But researchers did not see any significant change in public health coverage among states on the federally facilitated marketplace, she added.\n\"Irregardless of the marketplace type, we saw a decrease in the percentage in uninsured and an increase in the percentage with private coverage,\" Cohen said.\nWASHINGTON -- Approximately 36 million Americans, or 11.5% of the total population, still had no health insurance in 2014, although that was down from the 44.8 million (14.4%) uninsured in 2013, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).\nHawaii led all states in coverage, just 2.5% of adults under age 65 lacking health insurance.\nThe report included tables and maps showing the geographic variation in insurance and uninsurance rates."}
