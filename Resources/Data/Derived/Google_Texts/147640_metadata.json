Hopefully in that debate the moderator will actually ask a question on health care, and I look forward to talking to him about it.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s been clear from Matt Bevin, and he can\u2019t get away from this, is that in the early days of his campaign when asked a question about whether he would undo Gov. (Steve) Beshear\u2019s executive order expanding Medicaid, he said absolutely, no question about it, I would reverse that immediately. And that would, in effect, kick nearly half a million people off of their health insurance, and I think that\u2019s callous.\u201d\n\nConway is referencing a statement from Bevin during a February press conference, which has been widely quoted in political advertising. Bevin has since said he would seek 1115 waivers from CMS to serve Kentucky\u2019s health care needs.\n\nConway disagreed with Bevin and others who point to Kentucky Health Cooperative\u2019s failure as an indictment against the Affordable Care Act, saying the co-op suffered from insurmountable growing pains in the two years it offered health coverage. He added that seven insurers will offer health plans on kynect, the state-based exchange, when open enrollment begins Nov. 1, up from three in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt was a question of sort of a not-for-profit starting up, trying to put it together,\u201d he said. \u201cWere they managed the right way? Did they have adequate reserves? It\u2019s more market forces coming down on them in terms of how they ran their particular operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this the Kentucky way, and we\u2019re doing this the right way,\u201d he continued, adding that any financial shortfalls at the co-op \u201cwould have to be picked up by the federal government.\u201d\n\nBevin\u2019s campaign seized on that remark, quoting an editorial published by The Wall Street Journal that said Kentucky Health Cooperative operated at a 158 percent premium-to-expense ratio and the $146.5 million in federal loans would be flushed \u201cdown the tubes\u201d with the co-op\u2019s closure.\n\nJessica Ditto, Bevin\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, called Conway\u2019s comments \u201coffensive\u201d and said the Democratic nominee \u201ccontinues to make broken promises when we see the very real impact of this unsustainable program hurting families today.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack Conway calls a $146.5 million loss a success?\u201d she said in a statement to Pure Politics. \u201cJack Conway needs to explain to the voters of Kentucky why he didn\u2019t do anything when the state\u2019s largest ObamaCare co-op was on the brink of collapse. Under his watch 51,000 Kentuckians have lost their insurance and what has he done to protect them?\u201d\n\nGov. Steve Beshear, speaking to Pure Politics at a Kentucky National Guard event in Frankfort, said Kentucky Health Cooperative\u2019s decision \u201cis really not going to make any big difference in terms of health care in Kentucky.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that seven insurers are offering plans on kynect and those who had been enrolled in coverage through the co-op \u201care going to be able to transition to another company, they\u2019ll have a choice, they will get just as good a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re marching right on, and our folks are getting the health care that they need for the first time in their lives,\u201d Beshear said, \u201cand over a generation it\u2019s going to make a huge difference in the success of Kentucky.\u201d\n\nPure Politics managing editor Nick Storm contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "cn|2", "description": "Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway says he hopes the next two gubernatorial debates feature questions on the Affordable Care Act, but he will not accept his opponent\u2019s invitation for a forum focused solely on the topic.\n\n\tRepublican Matt Bevin challenged Conway to debate the federal health...", "title": "Conway declines Bevin's invitation for health care debate after Kentucky insurance co-op's closure", "url": "http://mycn2.com/politics/conway-declines-bevin-s-invitation-for-health-care-debate-after-kentucky-insurance-co-op-s-closure", "image": "http://mycn2.com/images/11510.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mycn2.com/images/11510.jpg", "description": "<p>Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway says he hopes the next two gubernatorial debates feature questions on the Affordable Care Act, but he will not accept his opponent\u2019s invitation for a forum focused solely on the topic.</p>\n\n\t<p>Republican Matt Bevin challenged Conway to debate the federal health law on Tuesday, saying \u201cKentuckians deserve to know how each of us would handle the very real and costly flaws of Obamacare.\u201d Bevin\u2019s invitation came days after officials with Kentucky Health Cooperative, a co-op created under the Affordable Care Act that operated in all 120 counties, announced the non-profit insurer would not offer health plans during this year\u2019s open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1. </p>\n\n\t<p>The co-op, which had received $146.5 million in federal loans according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and covered about 51,000 Kentuckians, is the sixth such program to shut down by the end of 2015, joining co-ops in New York, Tennessee, Louisiana, Iowa and Nevada. </p>\n\n\t<p>U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a vocal critic of the federal health law who promised to repeal it \u201croot and branch\u201d in his re-election campaign last year, called the co-op\u2019s closure \u201cthe latest in a string of broken promises with real consequences for the people of Kentucky who may now be losing the health insurance they had and liked twice within the past three years because of Obamacare\u2019s failures.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>Kentucky Health Cooperative interim <span class=\"caps\">CEO</span> Glenn Jennings said in a news release Friday that the nonprofit had reduced its deficit from about $50 million at the end of 2014 to $4 million by midyear, but CMS\u2019s decision to only grant 12.6 percent in risk corridor reimbursements to co-ops across the country \u201cled to an unavoidable outcome.\u201d </p>\n\n\t<p>Kentucky\u2019s risk corridor reimbursement totaled $9.7 million compared to an initial share of $77 million, according to the news release.</p>\n\n\t<p>Conway, speaking after a United Auto Workers retirees luncheon on Wednesday, said his opponent has \u201cbeen debating himself on health care it seems like for the last four or five months.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cLet him continue to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two more debates scheduled on the 25th and 26th.
