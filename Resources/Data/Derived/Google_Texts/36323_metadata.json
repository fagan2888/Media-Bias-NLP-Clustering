We\u2019ll see if we can get back to our winning ways.\u201d\n\nThe Braves finished 79-83, a daunting 17 games behind Washington in the NL East and only their third losing season in the last 24 years.\n\nGM Frank Wren was fired with a week to go in the season, after the team was eliminated from the playoffs, and Gonzalez thought his status would be on hold until the hiring of Wren\u2019s permanent replacement.\n\nBut, with no timetable for making that decision, the Braves decided to stick with Gonzalez for at least one more season. He is under contract through 2015.\n\n\u201cI guess they felt it was good to keep me, give me another year, and work from there,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nThere have been no talks about a contract extension, at least for now, but he doesn\u2019t think that will put him in an uncomfortable situation next season.\n\n\u201cAll of my coaching career, other than my managing career, I was always on one-year contracts,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me one bit.\u201d\n\nWhile the manager is staying, there will be some changes on his staff.\n\nHitting coach Greg Walker already announced his resignation, and two more coaches were let go as part of Friday\u2019s announcement: third-base coach Doug Dascenzo and assistant hitting coach Scott Fletcher.\n\nDascenzo will be replaced by former Houston Astros manager Bo Porter. The other two spots have yet to be filled.\n\nPorter managed the Astros for less than two seasons, posting a record of 110-190 before he was fired on Sept. 1. He previously played for Gonzalez in the Braves\u2018 minor-league system and was the third-base coach when Gonzalez managed the Marlins.\n\n\u201cI have a rapport with him,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a very good third-base coach and base-running guy who will help us get back to the playoffs.\u201d\n\nDascenzo lasted only one year on Gonzalez\u2019s staff after being named to replace Brian Snitker. Gonzalez said the change was no reflection on Dascenzo\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cSometimes people get caught in situations that are not under their control,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Dougie did anything wrong. He\u2019s a hell of a third-base coach.\u201d\n\nGonzalez, who has led the Braves to a pair of postseason appearances and an NL East title during his four years as manager, had strong support among the three-man committee selecting a new GM \u2014 especially his predecessor, Bobby Cox.\n\n\u201cThere was no quit at all,\u201d Cox has said. \u201cI\u2019m very familiar with the clubhouse, and it was as high energy as you could get under the circumstances. I think Fredi has done a remarkable job since taking over for me.\u201d\n\nCox, Hart and team president John Schuerholz are conducting the search for Wren\u2019s replacement. There is a chance that Hart, a former GM with both Cleveland and Texas, could take the job, though he has made it clear that at age 66 his preference is to remain a team adviser.\n\nGonzalez said Monday he didn\u2019t mind waiting a few weeks to be told if he still had a job with the Braves, even if the delay limited his chances of landing another managing job.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a hot commodity out there,\u201d he joked. \u201cMaybe if somebody needs a bullpen coach or something.\u201d\n\nFor one more year, at least, he\u2019s still the manager of the Braves.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Less than a week after the end of a disappointing season, interim general manager John Hart announced Friday that Gonzalez will continue to manage the team in 2015, ending speculation about a possible change in the dugout.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Less than a week after the end of a disappointing season, interim general manager John Hart announced Friday that Gonzalez will continue to manage the team in 2015, ending speculation about a possible change in the dugout.", "title": "Fredi Gonzalez staying as Braves manager", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/3/fredi-gonzalez-staying-as-braves-manager/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/03/affdd0bbe1247926610f6a7067003582.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/03/affdd0bbe1247926610f6a7067003582.jpg", "description": "Less than a week after the end of a disappointing season, interim general manager John Hart announced Friday that Gonzalez will continue to manage the team in 2015, ending speculation about a possible", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Fredi Gonzalez staying as Braves manager"}, "Author": "Paul Newberry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez, Atlanta Braves, John Hart, Frank Wren"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc13d\"", "article_summary": "He previously played for Gonzalez in the Braves\u2018 minor-league system and was the third-base coach when Gonzalez managed the Marlins.\nATLANTA \u2014 Fredi Gonzalez figured it would be a while before he learned his future with the Atlanta Braves.\n\u201cMaybe if somebody needs a bullpen coach or something.\u201dFor one more year, at least, he\u2019s still the manager of the Braves.\nBut, with no timetable for making that decision, the Braves decided to stick with Gonzalez for at least one more season.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me one bit.\u201dWhile the manager is staying, there will be some changes on his staff."}
