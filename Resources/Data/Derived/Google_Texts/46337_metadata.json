The unification becomes official Jan. 1, though the students won\u2019t all be on one campus until the fall of 2016.\n\nTo solidify the identity of the new school, students were asked for input into the new mascot.\n\n\u201cWe started about a month ago asking students to submit some possible mascots or team names,\u201d said Carol Cox, current head of school at North Georgia Christian and soon-to-be lower school principal for Lanier Christian. \u201cWe asked them to think about, for our school, what kind of character qualities those mascots might represent that we would be proud to say at Lanier Christian Academy this is what we stand for.\u201d\n\nThe students submitted nearly two pages of possible mascots, Cox said, and the administration narrowed it to two team names: Lanier Lakers and Lanier Lightning.\n\nA Heritage Academy parent, who is a professional artist, then drew renderings of the mascots for students to see and consider.\n\n\u201cAll the students on both campuses, from kindergarten through 12th grade, got to look at the artist renderings, think about the character qualities and vote,\u201d Cox said.\n\nCox said the Lanier Lightning rendering included a bird of prey, similar to a redtail hawk, that would be a physical mascot, and his name will likely be Bolt.\n\nAlong with the new mascot, the new school\u2019s administration has been selected.\n\nAl Gainey, current board chair for North Georgia Christian School, was named president and chief executive officer of Lanier Christian Academy, according to a release from the school. Heritage Academy Board Chair Fran Hasson will serve as board chair of Lanier Christian Academy.\n\n\u201cI am honored to be chosen to lead the new Lanier Christian Academy as president,\u201d Gainey said. \u201cWe are combining two well-established and respected Christian schools to create a win-win for students, families and our community.\u201d\n\nAlong with Cox\u2019s new appointment is David Douglas, current head of school at Heritage, who will become vice president for operations and program development. Dwayne Daniels, current upper school principal at North Georgia Christian, will serve in the same role at the new school, and former Atlanta Falcons player Todd Weiner, athletic director at Heritage, will serve as Lanier Christian\u2019s athletic director.\n\nThe new school will combine and offer the two teaching models previously offered at the other schools. North Georgia Christian\u2019s traditional five-day model and Heritage\u2019s three-day university model will be available to students.\n\nThe three-day model allows two days of independent home schooling. The school plans for a third online learning option as well.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to ground and equip students for long-term success in college, their careers, church and life,\u201d Gainey said.\n\nA new site for Lanier Christian Academy has been secured on Poplar Springs Road in South Hall. A capital campaign to fund the construction will kick off with the official unification in January.\n\nIn the meantime, students previously at Heritage will begin the next school year at the current North Georgia Christian School, at Chestnut Mountain Church on Ga. 53.\n\nCox said students on the current campus are looking forward to having more classmates and growing their student body.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely thinking of all the many ways we can have these groups of different models combine and come together,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the biggest ways that student body will come together as one is through the athletics, the mascot and all of that. That\u2019s a really unifying piece.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/113622/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/11/22/Carol-Cox_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "You can call them the Lanier Lightning.", "title": "Lanier Christian Academy gets mascot, leadership"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Lanier Christian Academy gets mascot, leadership"}, "article_summary": "Heritage Academy Board Chair Fran Hasson will serve as board chair of Lanier Christian Academy.\n\u201cI am honored to be chosen to lead the new Lanier Christian Academy as president,\u201d Gainey said.\nA new site for Lanier Christian Academy has been secured on Poplar Springs Road in South Hall.\nThe school is the product of the unified North Georgia Christian School in Flowery Branch and Heritage Academy in Braselton.\nAl Gainey, current board chair for North Georgia Christian School, was named president and chief executive officer of Lanier Christian Academy, according to a release from the school."}
