The company has repeatedly denied such allegations and has defended its business model on several occasions.\n\n\u201cHerbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC,\u201d the company said in a news release Wednesday. \u201cWe are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nThe company added that it doesn\u2019t plan to make further comments on this matter until there are material developments. Read the full WSJ story here.\n\nAn FTC representative confirmed the agency\u2019s investigation but declined to comment further.\n\nHerbalife shares, which had risen as high as $69.41 Wednesday before the news, hit a low of $54.59 after disclosing the investigation. The stock later rebounded a bit, again trading above $60.\n\nHerbalife sells a range of products, including weight-loss shakes and fitness supplements, through a wide global network of independent distributors.\n\nThe company has been under pressure regarding its business model by Pershing Square Capital Management LP\u2019s William Ackman, who has pressed lawmakers and regulators to investigate the company.\n\nIn December 2012, Mr. Ackman announced he had made a $1 billion bet that the company\u2019s stock price would fall. Since then, Herbalife\u2019s shares have risen, causing a big loss for the investor, and Mr. Ackman\u2019s stance has drawn harsh criticism from fellow hedge-fund managers, including Carl Icahn and Daniel Loeb.\n\nTuesday, Mr. Ackman reiterated his opinion that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme, and he said the company was guilty of violations in China.\n\nA Pershing Square spokesman declined to comment Wednesday, and Mr. Icahn was unavailable.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has started a civil investigation into Herbalife Ltd., the company said Wednesday.", "title": "Federal Trade Commission Starts Herbalife Probe", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/03/12/federal-trade-commission-starts-herbalife-probe/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Federal Trade Commission Starts Herbalife Probe", "description": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has started a civil investigation into Herbalife Ltd., the company said Wednesday.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tess Stynes", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has started a civil investigation into Herbalife Ltd., the company said Wednesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-03-12T20:38:53-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/03/12/federal-trade-commission-starts-herbalife-probe/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-47424", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has started a civil investigation into Herbalife Ltd., the company said Wednesday.", "title": "Federal Trade Commission Starts Herbalife Probe", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/03/12/federal-trade-commission-starts-herbalife-probe/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-47424", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-12T20:41:48-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe52c5\"", "article_summary": "Bloomberg NewsThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission has started a civil investigation into Herbalife Ltd., the company said Wednesday.\nHerbalife shares, which had risen as high as $69.41 Wednesday before the news, hit a low of $54.59 after disclosing the investigation.\nTuesday, Mr. Ackman reiterated his opinion that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme, and he said the company was guilty of violations in China.\nIn December 2012, Mr. Ackman announced he had made a $1 billion bet that the company\u2019s stock price would fall.\nThe maker of nutritional supplements didn\u2019t reveal the nature of the investigation; however, Herbalife has been accused of operating as a pyramid scheme."}
