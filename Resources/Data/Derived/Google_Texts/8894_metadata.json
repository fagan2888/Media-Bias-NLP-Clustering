As a result, there was a good chance those refunds would be automatically released by computer before the agency could verify the accuracy of reported income and withholding information.\n\nThe IRS and its enforcement operations have become a popular punching bag in Washington in recent years, especially after Republican lawmakers began hammering officials and slashing their budgets amid accusations of legally suspect oversight of conservative, tax-exempt organizations. In this case, the shortcomings in the review process appear relatively minor compared to the billions of dollars of tax fraud thwarted by agency\u2019s Integrity and verification operations.\n\nRelated: IRS Scandal Strikes a Severe Blow to Big Government\n\nHowever, the IG cautioned that even minor errors in issuing tax returns before questions have been cleared up can snowball into much larger losses of tax revenue to the government.\n\n\u201cWhile the IRS has made important strides in its programs that prevent the issuance of fraudulent refunds, our auditors found that it is not always ensuring that tax examiners timely complete their verification work before releasing refunds,\u201d J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, said in a statement accompanying the audit.\n\nFor example, IG investigators found that, because of a computer programming glitch, more than $27 million of refunds were erroneously issued for 13,043 tax returns for 2013. That programming error essentially was overriding the agency\u2019s two-week processing delay on some refund tax returns that the IRS identified as potentially fraudulent, according to the report.\n\nInvestigators also identified 3,910 tax returns for 2013 that the IRS had selected for verification with no indication that tax examiners verified the returns. \u201cThe IRS issued refunds totaling over $19 million for these tax returns,\u201d according to the report. \u201cRefund holds were either not set correctly or not functioning as intended.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obamacare\u2019s Next Challenge: IRS Verification\n\nThe IG\u2019s report suggested a number of recommendations for improving the fraud review process and correcting the programing, which IRS officials promptly accepted.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As it braces for another tax season, the beleaguered Internal Revenue Service has rece", "title": "IRS Whistleblower Finds Millions in Unverified Refunds", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/IRS-Whistleblower-Finds-Millions-Unverified-Refunds", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05162013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/IRS-Whistleblower-Finds-Millions-Unverified-Refunds", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05162013_IRS_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As it braces for another tax season, the beleaguered Internal Revenue Service has rece", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe IRS issued refunds totaling over $19 million for these tax returns,\u201d according to the report.\nThe IG\u2019s investigative staff initiated the audit after an IRS whistleblower reported that the IRS was not working some taxpayer cases involving refunds.\nInvestigators also identified 3,910 tax returns for 2013 that the IRS had selected for verification with no indication that tax examiners verified the returns.\nThat programming error essentially was overriding the agency\u2019s two-week processing delay on some refund tax returns that the IRS identified as potentially fraudulent, according to the report.\nFor example, IG investigators found that, because of a computer programming glitch, more than $27 million of refunds were erroneously issued for 13,043 tax returns for 2013."}
