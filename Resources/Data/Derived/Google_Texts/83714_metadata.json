There\u2019s still plenty of time. The deadline for filing candidacy for the Apr. 26 primary is Feb. 3. So far four Democrats, two Republicans and two unaffiliated candidates have filed. None of them are well known.\n\nTwo announced Democrats and presumed front runners, Reps. Donna Edwards (D - 4th District) and Chris Van Hollen (D - 8th District) have not yet filed. Edwards is from Prince George\u2019s County and Van Hollen is from Montgomery County.\n\nVan Hollen (show at left and above)made an early swing through Southern Maryland on Sunday, Aug. 23 with receptions at the homes of Barbara and Jim Bershon in Leonardtown and Ed and Sue Apple in Prince Frederick.\n\nThe event at the waterfront Bershorn home on Breton Bay was co-hosted by Linda and Mike Colina, Martha and Bill Jones and Susan Messitte. Mrs. Bershon said she and her husband endorsed Van Hollen because, \u201cHe exhibits great ability to lead and communicate.\u201d\n\nBefore the candidate addressed the assembled guests, The BayNet asked Van Hollen how he as a Democrat would get those disaffected party members who switched to vote for Larry Hogan for governor last year. Van Hollen said that would be done by focusing on the issues and taking them to the voters. He said he is not just focusing on the urban areas, noting he had just visited the Eastern Shore and was in Southern Maryland all day.\n\nThose issues that he stressed in his stump speech are core democratic issues, as befitting a candidate who has risen in the ranks of his party and was past chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nAmong the issues are a steadfast support of the Affordable Care Act, additional gun control measures, including universal background checks (such as Maryland has), climate change and protecting the Chesapeake Bay, campaign finance controls, and of course education.\n\nVan Hollen says he has a history of bipartisanship that goes back to his time in the Maryland General Assembly before being elected to Congress in 2003. He mentioned the bill that killed oil drilling in the Chesapeake Bay as an example.\n\nVan Hollen said as a member of Congress he has not just worked on issues affecting his home district in suburban DC, but also the whole state. He mentioned support for the Southern Maryland Higher Education Center and St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland, both of which had representatives at the reception. \u201cI believe the reason for my broad support is that I work on issues not just in the 8th District,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding the polarization in Washington, Van Hollen said, \u201cI believe in the end of the day what people care about is delivering results.\u201d He said he always looks for \u201copportunities for common ground,\u201d although he said he would remain steadfast to those core Democratic principles. For example on the universal background checks, he said, \u201cI believe we will prevail on this issue.\u201d\n\nOn education, he said, \u201cWe need a world class education system,\u201d and that extended from early childhood education to higher education. He touted his role in advancing the Thornton Commission education initiatives when he was in the Maryland General Assembly and decried the Hogan Administration\u2019s raid on that commission\u2019s education funding formula.\n\nRegarding higher education, he said it needed to do a better job of developing student skills that match employer needs. \u201cJobs and wages will be at the center of the campaign going forward,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring a question and answer session, St. Mary\u2019s County Democratic Central Committee member Mike Brown asked Van Hollen if he had read all of the Iran agreement. He said he had and that he supports it. The issue will be front and center when Congress convenes next month from summer recess. He predicted Congress would overturn the agreement and the President vetoing that and then the issue is whether there are enough votes to overturn the veto.\n\nAbout the agreement, Van Hollen asked \u201cthe major issue is \u2013 what\u2019s the alternative/\u201d He said the agreement won\u2019t \u201cchange the nature of the Iran regime\u201d but he said there are many parts of it that are in the best interest of the United States.\n\nAttendees at the reception included former commissioner presidents Jack Russell and Julie Randall.\n\nDemocrats who have filed so far for the U.S. Senate race are Ralph Jaffe of Baltimore County, Violet Staley of Prince George\u2019s County, Ed Tinus of Worcester County and Lih Young of Montgomery County. Republican candidates are Richard Douglas of Prince George\u2019s County and Anthony Seda of Harford County. The Unaffiliated are Greg Dorsey of Baltimore and Edward Shlikas of Baltimore County. The Unaffiliated will only be on the general election ballot.\n\nA names of a number of high profile Republican candidates have been bandied about by prognosticators, such as former governor Robert Ehrlich and former lieutenant governor Michael Steele, although there has been no official announcement from either of them so far.\n\nContact Dick Myers at dick.myers@thebaynet.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Van Hollen attended receptions in St. Mary's and Calvert.", "og": {"site_name": "thebaynet.com", "description": "Leonardtown, MD -- With the longest-serving woman in the history of the United States Congress, U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski retiring after five terms in the Senate, the primary is wide op...", "title": "U.S. Senate candidate visits Southern Maryland", "url": "http://www.thebaynet.com/articles/0815/ussenatecandidatevisitssouthernmaryland.html", "image": "http://www.thebaynet.com/site_media/photos/gallery/ebe9ec18-5341-467a-a6af-ae2a7347dd63.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thebaynet.com", "description": "Leonardtown, MD -- With the longest-serving woman in the history of the United States Congress, U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski retiring after five terms in the Senate, the primary is wide op...", "title": "U.S. Senate candidate visits Southern Maryland", "url": "http://www.thebaynet.com/articles/0815/ussenatecandidatevisitssouthernmaryland.html", "image": "http://www.thebaynet.com/site_media/photos/gallery/ebe9ec18-5341-467a-a6af-ae2a7347dd63.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "keywords": "Chris Van Hollen, Senatoe, candidate, Democrat, Barbara Mikulski, receptions, St Marys, Calvert, southern, Maryland breaking, news, thebaynet, Iran agreement, gun control, Affordable Care Act, core principles", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He mentioned support for the Southern Maryland Higher Education Center and St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland, both of which had representatives at the reception.\nTwo announced Democrats and presumed front runners, Reps.
