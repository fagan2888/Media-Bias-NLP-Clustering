According to Hogan, when some people smoke this it can prohibit them from talking or moving, and in some cases cause them to fall out and start to die.\n\n\"There are about 2,000 people per month who go to an emergency room due to using this drug,\" Hogan said. \"There have been people who have said that 'I could not see. I could not feel.' They said that this must be what death is like.\"\n\nIn Part 2 of our report, Newscenter 11 talks with one user who says she knows all too well about how deadly this illegal drug can be.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A growing trend, especially among young people, is the use of Spice, a substance that can be as easy to buy as chips and a soft drink.", "language": "english", "author": "Andrea Williams", "og": {"description": "A growing trend, especially among young people, is the use of Spice, a substance that can be as easy to buy as chips and a soft drink.", "title": "Dangers of Synthetic Marijuana, Part 1", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Dangers-of-Synthetic-Marijuana-Part-1-260700241.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A92/809/A92809F1AFCE415AAB92ED5D8F4298A0", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/62E/D49/62ED49739FF947E4ABE570258D020613.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A growing trend, especially among young people, is the use of Spice, a substance that can be as easy to buy as chips and a soft drink.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Dangers-of-Synthetic-Marijuana-Part-1-260700241.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Synthetic+Marijuana+One.jpg", "title": "Dangers of Synthetic Marijuana, Part 1", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Dangers of Synthetic Marijuana, Part 1", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Dangers of Synthetic Marijuana"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1c0\"", "article_summary": "Synthetic marijuana is made up of a mixture that contains common herbs that have been sprayed with synthetic chemicals that mimic the effects of marijuana, but are actually much more lethal.\nBehind marijuana, this synthetic marijuana that some bill as being safe, natural and legal in some cases only helps to boost the popularity of this sometimes deadly drug.\nIllegal in Mississippi, Alabama and at least ten other states, synthetic marijuana is referred to by the Drug Enforcement Administration as possibly being five times more powerful than marijuana.\nSmoking synthetic marijuana affects the cerebellum of the brain, which controls movement.\n\"There are about 2,000 people per month who go to an emergency room due to using this drug,\" Hogan said."}
