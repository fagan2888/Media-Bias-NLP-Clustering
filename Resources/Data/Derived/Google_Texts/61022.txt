Covered California Launches Hotline for Those With Canceled Plans

On Monday, Covered California launched a hotline to assist individuals whose health plans are being canceled at the end of this year because they do not comply with the Affordable Care Act, the Sacramento Bee reports (Glover, Sacramento Bee, 11/26).

Background

About one million individual policyholders in California recently were notified that their current insurance plans will be discontinued at the end of the year because the policies do not meet minimum coverage requirements under the ACA.

Last week, state officials rejected a plan by President Obama that would have allowed insurers to continue selling policies in 2014 that do not meet the ACA's minimum coverage requirements (California Healthline, 11/22).

Details of Hotline

The new "Coverage Options Hotline" is staffed by 25 representatives at Covered California's service center in Rancho Cordova.

The representatives offer customers information on:

The ACA;

Coverage transitions;

Health plans and benefits; and

Options for affordable health coverage (Sacramento Bee, 11/26).

The hotline is available on Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The hotline can be reached at 855-857-0445 (Robertson, Sacramento Business Journal, 11/26).
