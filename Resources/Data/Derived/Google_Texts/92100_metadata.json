Pat Quinn\u2019s top political donors, raising questions about \u201cpay to play\u201d politics amid the state\u2019s highly competitive governor\u2019s race.\n\nThe Roosevelt Group is hosting a breakfast fundraiser Tuesday for the Democratic Governors Association \u201chonoring Pat Quinn,\u201d according to an invitation sent out last week that lists suggested sponsorship levels of between $20,000 and $2,500. The Democratic Governors Association formed a political action committee last fall to support Quinn\u2019s re-election and has contributed $260,000 to it so far this year. In 2010, the group gave about $1.8 million to Quinn - making it the Chicago Democrat\u2019s second-biggest donor, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.\n\nRoosevelt Group was co-founded by its two partners, Mike Noonan and Victor Reyes. A third person, Maze Jackson, is a lobbyist for the company. The three own Compass Public Affairs, a political strategy consulting firm that has a $250,000 state subcontract for the \u201cGet Covered Illinois\u201d marketing campaign. The contract, which paid Compass at a rate of $282 per hour, may be renewed when it ends in August.\n\nIllinois\u2019 \u201cpay to play\u201d law bars contractors from making certain contributions to prevent politicians from steering lucrative government work to businesses that make donations to their campaigns. Kent Redfield, a campaign finance expert, said the \u201cdegrees of separation\u201d between DGA, Quinn\u2019s campaign, Roosevelt and Compass may keep the event from violating the letter of the law. But he said the fundraiser raises ethical issues.\n\n\u201cClearly you\u2019ve got people who are benefiting from state government contracts trying to facilitate contributions to re-elect the governor,\u201d said Redfield, professor emeritus of political science at University of Illinois at Springfield.\n\nQuinn campaign spokeswoman Brooke Anderson said the event \u201cis not a fundraiser for the governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not attending this breakfast,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIf the DGA holds an event to support their organization that is their prerogative and fully within campaign finance law.\u201d\n\nThe invitation shows a photo of Quinn with the governor\u2019s name in the largest size font on the page. It reads: \u201cYou are cordially invited to a Breakfast Fundraiser for the: Democratic Governors Association honoring: Pat Quinn.\u201d\n\nThe Roosevelt Group principals are among the best-known Democratic political strategists in Illinois. Noonan is a former staffer for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and a former campaign manager for Attorney General Lisa Madigan. Reyes is an ex-aide to former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and founded the powerful Hispanic Democratic Organization. Jackson is a former statewide field director for Quinn.\n\nThe men\u2019s political strategy company, Compass, is part of a team working with FleishmanHillard to promote President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law in his home state under a $33 million contract that ends in August, but is up for renewal. Compass helped develop the \u201cGet Covered Illinois\u201d campaign\u2019s grassroots strategy and supervised outreach to church leaders, black business leaders and ethnic media.\n\n\u201cThe Roosevelt Group and (the law firm) Reyes Kurson have been supportive of the Democratic Governors Association for many years,\u201d Roosevelt co-founder Reyes said in an email to The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to assist in the election of Democratic governors across the United States.\u201d Reyes Kurson, listed as a co-host of the Tuesday event, shares an address with Roosevelt and Compass.\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based Democratic Governors Association is hosting a two-day regional policy conference in Chicago next week. The fundraising breakfast is on the first day of the conference. DGA describes itself as \u201cthe only organization dedicated to electing Democratic governors and candidates.\u201d\n\nIllinois campaign contribution records show DGA has given $260,000 this year to its Jobs and Opportunity for Illinois PAC, which was formed to support Quinn\u2019s re-election. The DGA also gave $50,000 to a union-backed PAC fighting Republican candidate for governor Bruce Rauner and $84,300 in in-kind contributions to Quinn\u2019s campaign.\n\nDGA spokesman Danny Kanner said the breakfast \u201cis a fundraiser for the DGA, to support its programs across the country, not any specific candidate.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Carla K.
