They can\u2019t run the football. They average only 2.6 yards per attempt, worst in the NFL. This makes no sense for a team coached by Gary Kubiak.\n\nHis teams average a 10th-place ranking in rushing yards over the past 20 seasons. Wolves howl, suns set, Kubiak\u2019s teams run the ball well.\n\nFiguring out why the Broncos aren\u2019t doing that has become an increasingly interesting topic. The obvious explanation is poor offensive line play. But listening to Kubiak and offensive coordinator Rick Dennison last week, it\u2019s obvious they see a layered problem. They blame themselves, always first pointing the finger at teaching and practicing.\n\nAnd the offensive linemen share responsibility, something they readily admit. Nobody can say with a straight face that the group is clicking. The pass protection improved dramatically last week, an encouraging sign for a team trying to keep its 39-year-old quarterback upright. But the ground game went nowhere, and two plays left C.J. Anderson and Juwan Thompson injured.\n\nBetter coaching, better execution from the grunts, and, yes, improved performance from the backs is needed. It didn\u2019t take a decoder ring Friday to realize Kubiak is not pleased with his running backs.\n\nThere is clearly a chicken-and-egg issue percolating. Are the running backs not gaining yards because the linemen aren\u2019t blocking? Or are the running backs failing to break tackles and undermining the blocking?\n\nKubiak wants to see more from his runners, starting with Anderson, who is clinging to his starting job.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re evaluating the running game, we\u2019re talking about being better up front, getting more creases. That\u2019s a coaches thing. We\u2019ve got to get space for these guys,\u201d Kubiak said before adding, \u201cThen you go to the backs and you say, \u2018Sometimes you\u2019ve got to create your own space.\u2019 C.J.\u2019s worked really hard this week, and responded in practice. Sometimes as a back, you\u2019ve got to do a little more. You\u2019re in this league to make some plays that nobody else can make. We\u2019re calling on those guys to do some of that.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe the Broncos hold the backs to a high standard, think about the final cuts. Montee Ball made it for 24 hours, then was jettisoned for a tight end. Ball performed poorly in the preseason. The blocking created few holes. And he\u2019s no longer in Denver. That\u2019s telling, when you consider how the Broncos\u2019 coaches grade the overall running game. Ball didn\u2019t have much to work with, but he didn\u2019t make anyone look better. He couldn\u2019t turn graffiti into a Monet. He lacked explosion and burst, which clearly the rest of the league witnessed because he remains unsigned.\n\nThe offensive line remains a focal point with Ryan Harris switching to left tackle and untested Michael Schofield manning right tackle in his first NFL snaps against Minnesota on Sunday. The running backs, though, have been put on notice. This system produces yards and plays no favorites.\n\nAnderson (a Pro Bowler), Ronnie Hillman and Thompson are proud, motivated and tough. They will embrace the challenge and block out the outside noise. Ideally, they will receive a few blocks and make a few cuts to spring loose, creating a new debate on who deserves the most credit for reviving the running game.\n\nTroy E. Renck: trenck@denverpost.com or @troyrenck\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nJulio Jones, wide receiver, Atlanta Falcons\n\nWhat\u2019s up: When Demaryius Thomas signed his five-year, $70 million contract, which guarantees $43 million, he said his goal this year was to break Calvin Johnson\u2019s NFL season record for yards receiving. So far, the threat to that record is Jones, not Thomas. Jones continues to wreck game plans and break hearts. He has 34 catches, the most in NFL history by a player through his team\u2019s first three games. He has 440 yards receiving and 23 first downs.\n\nBackground: Jones was the NFC offensive player of the month for September and could become a league MVP candidate. A wide receiver is unlikely to win the MVP award, but Jones creates reason for debate. He arrived with huge expectations in 2011. The Falcons traded five picks to Cleveland, moving up from the 27th slot to sixth overall to draft Jones, a former Alabama star. He has become the Falcons\u2019 best player, receiving a $71 million contract that includes $47 million guaranteed.\n\nRenck\u2019s take: Bold moves bring huge risks. The Falcons needed someone to play catch with Matt Ryan every weekend. Jones is on pace for 2,346 yards receiving. Johnson holds the record with 1,964 yards. There\u2019s no reason to think the brutish yet speedy Jones can\u2019t reach 2,000. Each time Jones catches a touchdown pass, it\u2019s a reminder of one of the worst deals in Browns history. No player attached to the acquired picks remains in Cleveland, including running back Trent Richardson, who was a bust.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Renck: Tailbacks are tasked with reviving Denver run game", "title": "Renck: Tailbacks are tasked with reviving Denver run game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/renck-tailbacks-are-tasked-with-reviving-denver-run-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150915__CJ-Andersonp1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150915__CJ-Andersonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T19:20:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:33:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Troy Renck"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen you\u2019re evaluating the running game, we\u2019re talking about being better up front, getting more creases.\nIt didn\u2019t take a decoder ring Friday to realize Kubiak is not pleased with his running backs.\nThat\u2019s telling, when you consider how the Broncos\u2019 coaches grade the overall running game.\nIdeally, they will receive a few blocks and make a few cuts to spring loose, creating a new debate on who deserves the most credit for reviving the running game.\nOr are the running backs failing to break tackles and undermining the blocking?"}
