These workers, getting free or low-cost health insurance, will by choice reduce their connection to work.\n\nBut this is preliminary thinking -- and a hypothesis not clearly based on previous evidence.\n\nThe worry that if you give people economic benefits they will become dependent is as old as poverty itself. In the 1870s, private social agencies responded to government poor laws with Charity Organization Societies. Local government relief was seen as indiscriminate, creating lifelong paupers. The Societies sent professional caseworkers (\u201cfriendly visitors\u201d) to instill morality and self-sufficiency -- work -- in the poor in return for cash.\n\nThe Budget Office is working from traditional economic theory, which assumes that if you give people money or other resources, they will always work less. But to prove this, we need to look at empirical studies that have tested this thesis. Unfortunately, there haven\u2019t been many.\n\nThis is partly because studying the effects of social programs on labor supply is difficult and the results uncertain. Programs do not have the same benefits, types of benefits or tax rates (points at which increases in income create ineligibility) Some are cash, some in-kind. You could study a specific population or everybody; or at one point in time or over a period of time.\n\nSo the research has had mixed results, some contradictory. However, most studies have found that social programs did not reduce work effort or reduced it only slightly.\n\nRobert Moffitt, arguably the expert in this field, did two reviews of studies of existing social programs, in 2002 for the National Bureau of Economic Research and in 2010 for the Institute for Research on Poverty. All of the food stamp studies showed no decrease in work by those receiving them. The Earned Income Tax Credit, by contrast, produced a big positive effect on work -- especially for single mothers who worked more as a result. Studies of Medicaid showed mixed results, some saying the program increased work effort and earlier ones claiming the opposite.\n\nIn 1981 during the Reagan administration, Congress tightened welfare standards for single mothers. Families with working mothers had to earn less to be eligible for Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and those still working and getting welfare would have their benefits reduced. The expectation was that these single mothers would cut back their hours of work in order to stay on welfare.\n\nThe results proved the opposite. Several studies were done to determine whether these single mothers actually decreased their work effort; they are summarized in another Institute for Research on Poverty paper. They had different geographic locations, different study populations and different methodologies. But they all came to the same conclusion: The tighter standards had no effect on welfare mothers\u2019 work behavior.\n\nMany forces are at play in determining how much people work -- economic conditions, the unemployment rate, the prevailing level of wages and the size of the social benefit itself. As they muddied policymakers\u2019 foregone conclusions in the past, they will likely make it impossible to predict the effect the Affordable Care Act will have on Americans\u2019 work effort.\n\nAnd health insurance doesn\u2019t lend itself to safe predictions either. It\u2019s designated for one purpose. It cannot take the place of basic cash income for food and housing. The health insurance benefit is complementary to other (work) income, not a substitute for it. It can also be seen as optional to a certain degree. Some people will choose to pay the penalty and do without it -- as they do now.\n\nHealth insurance is also a universal benefit and doesn\u2019t go only to poor people. This would dilute the total effect of any voluntary reduction in work effort. While previous studies dealt mainly with programs whose participants were single mothers, the health care law has a much larger and more diverse target population.\n\nMany factors will have an effect on whether or not 2 million workers or any other number decide to reduce their work effort.\n\nWe now have 10 million people who want to work and for whom there are no jobs. This is a forced reduction in the labor force. If corporations continue to be highly productive with fewer workers, and if this is the way of the future, a small voluntary reduction in the labor force in ten years might prove to be a good thing -- to help to solve this structural problem.\n\nMildred Rein, who has a Ph.D. from the Heller School for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare at Brandeis University, has published two books on poverty, social services and social welfare.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'affordable-care-act','obamacare','us-workforce'", "title": "The myth of the Affordable Care Act eroding the U.S. labor supply: Mildred Rein", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"The myth of the Affordable Care Act eroding the U.S. labor supply: Mildred Rein\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/02/the_myth_of_the_affordable_car.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/14311258-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12234341\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-19T20:44:08Z\", \"author\": \"Guest Columnist/cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"affordable-care-act\",\"obamacare\",\"us-workforce\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/opinion_impact/photo/14311258-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The worry that if you give people economic benefits they will become dependent is as old as poverty itself, but there aren't a lot of empirical studies to support the assumptions, writes Mildred Rein.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, February 19, 2014,  4:41 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/opinion_impact/photo/health-overhaul-employer-requirement-16178713jpg-4d88856f787ab50d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"neomgguest\", \"author_nickname\": \"Guest Columnist/cleveland.com\", \"author_id\": \"10949015\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Opinion, Editorials, Letters and Columns\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The worry that if you give people economic benefits they will become dependent is as old as poverty itself, but there aren't a lot of empirical studies to support the assumptions, writes Mildred Rein.", "title": "The myth of the Affordable Care Act eroding the U.S. labor supply: Mildred Rein", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/02/the_myth_of_the_affordable_car.html", "image": "http://www.cleveland.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, February 19, 2014,  4:00 PM", "article_author": "Guest Columnist/cleveland.com", "Description": "The worry that if you give people economic benefits they will become dependent is as old as poverty itself, but there aren't a lot of empirical studies to support the assumptions, writes Mildred Rein."}, "article_summary": "Mildred Rein, who has a Ph.D. from the Heller School for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare at Brandeis University, has published two books on poverty, social services and social welfare.\nThis is partly because studying the effects of social programs on labor supply is difficult and the results uncertain.\nBut they all came to the same conclusion: The tighter standards had no effect on welfare mothers\u2019 work behavior.\nThe expectation was that these single mothers would cut back their hours of work in order to stay on welfare.\nHowever, most studies have found that social programs did not reduce work effort or reduced it only slightly."}
