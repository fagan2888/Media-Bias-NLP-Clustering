Would this be a reason for you to decline and interview (sic) if offered one?\u201d Lindsey wrote.\n\nHellwege confirmed she was a member of the group and said she could not prescribe abortifacient drugs due to religious guidelines. Hellwege is a practicing Christian. She remained open, however, to other forms of contraception and even inquired about other open positions.\n\n\u201cDue to the fact that we are a Title X organization and you are an (sic) member of AAPLOG, we would be unable to move forward in the interviewing process,\u201d Lindsey responded.\n\nWatchdog.org contacted Tampa Family Health Centers for comment but did not receive a response.\n\nTitle X, or the Title X Family Planning Program, is part of the Public Service Health Act. It\u2019s designed to provide health services for low-income families and uninsured people at reduced prices, or no cost at all. Tampa Family Health Centers has 13 locations throughout Hillsborough County and receives significant funding from the federal government.\n\nIt\u2019s TFHC\u2019s Title X funding that arguably makes it illegal for the health center to reject Hellwege\u2019s attempt at gaining employment.\n\n\u201cAny religious objection or any non-religious moral objection to participating in something like early abortion hormones cannot be used to discriminate against someone who applies to a program funded by the federal Department of Health and Human Services,\u201d Matt Bowman, senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, told Watchdog.org.\n\nADF filed the lawsuit alleging employment discrimination.\n\nBowman contends Hellwege was otherwise qualified for the job and had nothing in her history that would have disqualified her. The statutory protection applies to all religions, he said.\n\nThe allegations come in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 Hobby Lobby decision in which the high court ruled in favor of the owners of the Oklahoma-based arts and crafts retail chain. As devout Christians, the owners objected to paying for health insurance covering abortifacient forms of birth control. That put them at odds with an Affordable Care Act mandate and the Obama administration.\n\nThe court\u2019s majority relied on an interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prevents the government from substantially burdening a person\u2019s exercise of their religion. The legislation passed Congress in 1993 with just three dissenting votes and was signed into law by President Clinton.\n\nThe Tampa Family Health Center case is much simpler, said Bowman.\n\n\u201cThe email exchange is a smoking gun,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they did was illegal. There\u2019s really no excuse for it. I hope they will admit that they were wrong and allow Ms. Hellwege to apply for the job.\u201d\n\nContact William Patrick at wpatrick@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Sara Hellwege was allegedly snuffed out of the job application process with Tampa Family Health Centers because of her pro-life religious beliefs.", "title": "Federally funded health center may be nixing job applicants with pro-life views - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/tampafamilyhealthcenter.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-11T08:11:16+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/158822/federally-funded-prolife/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Florida", "tag": "American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynocologists,prolife,Tampa Family Health Centers", "published_time": "2014-07-10T11:33:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-11T08:11:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Sara Hellwege was allegedly snuffed out of the job application process with Tampa Family Health Centers because of her pro-life religious beliefs.", "title": "Federally funded health center may be nixing job applicants with pro-life views - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/tampafamilyhealthcenter.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Sara Hellwege was allegedly snuffed out of the job application process with Tampa Family Health Centers because of her pro-life religious beliefs."}, "article_summary": "Title X, or the Title X Family Planning Program, is part of the Public Service Health Act.\nTampa Family Health Centers has 13 locations throughout Hillsborough County and receives significant funding from the federal government.\nThe Tampa Family Health Center case is much simpler, said Bowman.\nWatchdog.org contacted Tampa Family Health Centers for comment but did not receive a response.\nIt\u2019s TFHC\u2019s Title X funding that arguably makes it illegal for the health center to reject Hellwege\u2019s attempt at gaining employment."}
