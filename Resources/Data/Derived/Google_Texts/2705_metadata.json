There are three new carriers participating, the OIR said in a news release.\n\nNearly 1 million Floridians signed up for insurance on the federal health exchange in 2014. Most state residents get insurance in other ways: through the workplace, or through a government program, such as Medicare.\n\nThe state's report shows that two insurers have proposed average rate increases of 20 percent or more over the past year: a Health First Insurance Inc. PPO and an HMO from Health Options Inc.\n\nHowever, these plans are not the most expensive monthly premium rates. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, or Florida Blue, lists a $503 monthly premium for its PPO, before any possible subsidies for people with low or middle incomes. Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company is not far behind: its PPO rate for next year is $497 a month, before subsidies are considered.\n\nThree insurers decreased their HMO rates for 2015, according to OIR data. Molina Healthcare has the largest premium decrease, 12 percent, while Sunshine State Health Plans Inc. dropped its monthly premium 10 percent. Aetna Health Inc. reduced its rate by 5 percent.\n\nFlorida is one of 36 states that offer policies through the federal health care marketplace. Health economists note that some states are seeing the marketplace rates go down, and in others they\u2019re going up. This depends in part on how tightly the state regulated the market before the ACA was passed.\n\nIn the market for individuals buying their own plans, Florida had allowed insurers to screen out sick applicants. When the ACA went into effect, insurers were supposed to take all comers. But at the last minute, President Obama allowed states to \u201cgrandfather in\u201d some of the old plans with low rates. That prevented a lot of healthy people from joining the less-healthy people in Healthcare.gov plans.\n\nAlso, actuaries who determine the premiums insurers should propose still don\u2019t have enough experience with the new enrollees to tell how expensive they will be to cover. The plans had to come up with bids for 2015 only a few weeks after this year\u2019s open enrollment closed.\n\n\u201cThey know a little bit more about who they enrolled as far as demographics, but they still don\u2019t know much about their health,\u201d said Gary Claxton, a vice president with the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent non-partisan research organization.\n\nAnd as it was last year, premiums in 2015 will vary by income and county.\n\nFor example, in Hillsborough County, a single 28-year-old with an income of $27,000 will pay about $18 a month more next year, or around $238 a month. This price includes a federal subsidy to help pay for the premium.\n\nIn Pinellas County, the average premium for an individual will rise by $30 a month, to $245.\n\nSee these price comparisons for 2015 and 2014, as provided by the state.\n\nThe OIR analysis of the rates is again being criticized by Florida CHAIN, a consumer group and staunch advocate for the Affordable Care Act. In a statement, CHAIN said the state's political opposition to the ACA translates to \"misleading\" information about the new proposed rates.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Floridians who bought plans on the exchange this year received subsidies, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The average premium they paid was $68 a month, far lower than the hundreds of dollars listed in the OIR report, according to CHAIN Policy Director Greg Mellowe.\n\n\"It\u2019s essential that Floridians understand that the numbers in these scenarios tell them very little or nothing about the premiums that they will actually pay next year,\" he said in a statement. \"Rather, what nearly all of the almost 1 million Floridians who purchased coverage in the Marketplace will continue to pay is a price that is based mainly on their income and on the specific plan they choose.\u201d\n\nThe three insurers offering new plans on the 2015 Florida exchange include UnitedHealthCare of Florida Inc. which proposed an average monthly premium of $404, before tax credits. An Assurant Health subsidiary, Time Insurance Company, also has filed a PPO plan with a $457-a-month premium, before subsidies.\n\nThe third additional plan is Brevard County\u2019s Health First, which is offering an HMO in addition to a PPO plan it sold on the exchange in 2014. Before it was a commercial insurer, Health First was better known as the owner of four Space Coast hospitals and a physician\u2019s group.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
