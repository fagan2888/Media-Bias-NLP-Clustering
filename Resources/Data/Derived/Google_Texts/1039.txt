Howard Glaser, Gov. Andrew Cuomoâ€™s top deputy, cleaned out his offices last week, and his deputy Fran Reiter is planning to move in, according to people close to the Cuomo administration.

After several days of being unable to say when Glaser was leaving, an administration official revealed on Sunday afternoon that he had actually departed on Friday.

Glaser, the state director of operations, had been trying to leave for some time but waited until the end of the legislative session a week ago. He is planning to join the private sector, according a person who associates with him, perhaps as CEO of a company.

Glaser had also worked with Gov. Andrew Cuomo when he was the secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
