POLAND, Ohio-- President Obama highlighted the story of a 23-year-old cancer patient from Poland, Ohio in his speech promoting the successes of the Affordable Health Care Law.

Justine Ula lives near Youngstown but receives treatment at University Hospitals in Cleveland.

Justine and her mother Joanne wrote the White House praising the aspect of Obamacare that allows children to stay on their parents' health care plan until the reach the age of 26.

Justine's pharmacy bills alone would cost thousands of dollars a month without the coverage.

"It has helped our family tremendously," she said. "If I didn't have this health care, then I wouldn't be getting the treatment I needed and I wouldn't be getting the prescriptions I needed."

Justine and her mother found out Monday that President Obama would mention Justine in his speech.

"I couldn't breathe. She was crying. It was one of those surreal moments. It was pretty cool," Justine said.

Justine and Joanne watched the speech together.

"And of course when the President mentioned her name she was crying. She couldn't believe the President would actually know her and name her," Joanne said.

Justine battled cancer once before and won. She plans to win this battle too.
