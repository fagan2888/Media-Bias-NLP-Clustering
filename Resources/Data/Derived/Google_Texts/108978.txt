MILLINOCKET, Maine, August 3, 2014 – On Friday, in an unprecedented breach of protocol, Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the House, left her seat and sauntered over to where Tom Marino, who had the floor, was speaking. She wagged her finger at him and let loose a tirade.

Rep. Marino had dared to suggest that even though Democrats had a majority in 2009 and 2010, they did nothing to address immigration.

Pelosi countered that they had passed the “Dream Act.”

Well, thank you for that, Nancy. It’s wonderful that you admit to creating the very cause of today’s crisis on the border. Your display of indignance seems to have triggered a bout of unintended honesty.

But Nancy, have you forgotten the old saw, “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen?” You should have noticed by now that there’s a lot of heat in the political kitchen.

While most Americans see open borders as a bad idea, the Democrats haven’t gotten the message. They are trying to promote amnesty as a way to solve the job crisis, eliminate the deficit and enhance “diversity.”

Funny thing, though, the public just isn’t buying it; most polls show people are dead set against it.

By the way, in her tirade, Ms. Pelosi referred to Rep. Marino as an “insignificant person.” That’s her opinion of the man who represents Pennsylvania’s Tenth District. What do you suppose she thinks about us lesser Americans who only represent ourselves?
