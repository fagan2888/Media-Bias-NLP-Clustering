Did you wake up with a runny nose and a nasty cough? If so, you might be debating on whether or not to take a sick day from work. But how do you tell when you're too sick to function?

At least a quarter of workers will choose to head to work while sick. The number one fear -- having too much work to catch up on the when they return.

Here's a mental check list of sorts you can go through to decide, stay home or go to work.

First, if you're starting to feel sick, doctors say you are highly contagious right when you start feeling symptoms. And by staying home when everything starts, you may be able to sleep it off.

But, if you've had symptoms for a few days and went into work, doctors advise you to take a day to allow your body to recover.

If you have a fever, doctors say take it easy on the couch for the day. That's especially if your thermometer reads over 100-degrees. Then away from work until your fever is gone for 24 hours.

If you feel you won't get a lot of work done due to your symptoms, just call out then as well.

Here's a big one. You might want to take a day off if you're taking antibiotics or other medications that have side effects. One example, if it may cause drowsiness. That could make it dangerous driving to work or using heavy equipment.
