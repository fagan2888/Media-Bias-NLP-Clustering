The Islamic State is planning to murder Jewish schoolchildren in Turkey by targeting their schools and youth centers, SkyNews reports.

According to intelligence officials the attack is “imminent” and has been confirmed by six ISIS operatives who were arrested in Turkey last week.

The jihadists likely have their sights set on a synagogue in Istanbul’s Beyoglu, which also has a school and community center.

"In light of these circumstances, extraordinary security measures are being taken above and beyond the high alert level already in place by the Turkish police, as well as vigilance within the Jewish community," an intelligence source told Sky News. "Undercover and other covert counter-terror measures are being implemented around the clock. "This is a more than credible threat. This is an active plot," the source added.

Intelligence officials are not aware of when, exactly, the terrorists are planning to strike. It could be tomorrow, or in the next few days, the source told SkyNews.

News of the plan comes after a suicide bomber killed five people in Istanbul earlier this month. Intelligence officials believe the Islamic State was also behind this attack.
