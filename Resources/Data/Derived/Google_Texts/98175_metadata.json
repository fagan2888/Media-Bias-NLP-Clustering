The World Health Organization estimates that 35 million people globally have the virus, which was once thought to be an immediate killer. But new medicines have been able to keep HIV in check \u2014 former sports superstar Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson announced in 1991 that he was HIV-positive and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe report covers the years 2002-2011, when nearly 500,000 patients were diagnosed with HIV. \"Statistically significant decreases\" in diagnosis rates were found in nearly every demographic group, the study says, with the biggest changes for women and individuals 35-44 years old and persons of multiple races.\n\nThe findings show 16 out of every 100,000 people ages 13 and older were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2011, a steady decline from 24 out of 100,000 people in 2002.\n\nThere is bad news from the study: Infection rates among presumed gay men didn't trend downward. \"Increases were found among certain age groups of men who have sex with men, especially young men,\" the study says. \"Because of delays in diagnosis, temporal trends in diagnoses and variations among groups may reflect earlier changes in HIV incidence.\"\n\nThe study blames unprotected sex as the chief culprit for the increase.\n\nCoates says most of the young men getting infected are African-American. \"Access remains a problem,\" he says. \"Even with the Affordable Care Act, this is a population not used to having access to care. We need to make sure health services are available.\"\n\nAdditionally, the study points out that it only reports on people who have taken the time to be diagnosed. \"Reports show that many at high risk do not test annually and the overall percentage of youth who had ever tested for HIV during the period of analysis was low compared to other age groups.\"\n\nThe study is based on HIV diagnoses from health departments in 50 states, which get results from medical offices.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1mrIOLG", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The AIDS crisis has some good news: the rate of diagnosis for HIV infections has fallen in the United States by over a third.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "The AIDS crisis has some good news: the rate of diagnosis for HIV infections has fallen in the United States by over a third.", "title": "HIV diagnosis rate down by a third in the U.S.", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/19/aids-diagnosis-down/12887823/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The AIDS crisis has some good news: the rate of diagnosis for HIV infections has fallen in the United States by over a third.", "creator": "@usatoday", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/207e35d38a1663f0e699bf78159dd16d35733099/c=0-204-2830-3034&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/19/1405805927000-USP-MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers.jpg", "title": "HIV diagnosis rate down by a third in the U.S.", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f7646cb43cea1bc773bc2f14f88b016aeefc45d/c=0-48-2830-3828/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/19/1405805927000-USP-MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98a108425b67c5ce80a967b66f80fa368ff1dd60/c=0-204-2830-3034/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/19/1405805927000-USP-MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c1eb4fd6a0c23fa3fc2fa2b4ddc38cd24e8f848/c=0-271-2830-2404/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/19/1405805927000-USP-MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f7ddd72ec73eba1ce9bbcefad2536eee5c3d599e/c=0-300-2830-1900&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/19/1405805927000-USP-MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-19T19:24:10.390000-04:00", "shorthed": "HIV diagnosis rate down by a third in the U.S.", "articleid": 12887823, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee4e038c299d36e31cb424ee7869a6e1ed66f471/c=0-300-2830-1900/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/19/1405805927000-USP-MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3eab8686b924d5c1de6529b68862ea78c7b0a5c5/c=330-0-2491-3870/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/19/1405805927000-USP-MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers.jpg"}, "author": "Jefferson Graham", "title": "HIV diagnosis rate down by a third in the U.S.", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "aids, hiv, journal of american medicine association, infection, gay men, african americans, world health organization, affordable care act,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13f9\"", "article_summary": "\"Because of delays in diagnosis, temporal trends in diagnoses and variations among groups may reflect earlier changes in HIV incidence.\"\n\"Increases were found among certain age groups of men who have sex with men, especially young men,\" the study says.\n(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports)LOS ANGELES \u2014 There is some good news in the fight against AIDS: The rate of diagnosis for HIV infections has fallen in the United States by a third over the past decade, a study finds.\nThe study is based on HIV diagnoses from health departments in 50 states, which get results from medical offices.\nCoates says most of the young men getting infected are African-American."}
