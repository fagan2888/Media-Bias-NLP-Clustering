Coty, director of the Maine Office of Judicial Marshals, said Monday.\n\nJudicial marshals wear blue blazers. Penobscot County Sheriff\u2019s Office employees wear brown.\n\nCoty\u2019s office, which is part of the state judicial system, took over providing security and entry screening from the sheriff\u2019s office after the sheriff\u2019s office and marshal service could not come to terms in October on a new contract. The sheriff\u2019s office provided court security in Bangor for decades \u2014 first at the historic county courthouse and district court on Hammond Street and, since November 2009, at the Penobscot Judicial Center on Exchange Street.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office also provided security at courthouses in Newport, Millinocket and Lincoln. The judicial marshals office now is covering those locations in addition to Bangor.\n\nPenobscot County Sheriff Glenn Ross said Monday that his organization\u2019s contract with the judicial marshals office expired on June 30 but employees had continued to work while he kept negotiating.\n\nThe transition did not involve any layoffs, both Ross and Coty said. Many of the 23 people who worked for Ross now work for Coty but will be paid at an hourly rate rather than on a per diem basis. Ross had four court officers working full time and 19 part-timers, many of whom were retired military police or law enforcement officers.\n\nThe judicial marshals office has seven full-timers and seven part-timers, Coty said. Of the 14 people hired in Bangor, 11 of them worked for Ross, Coty said. Fifteen former sheriff\u2019s department employees applied for jobs with Coty but some withdrew their applications when they found other employment. Others chose not to apply.\n\nCoty also has the ability to move judicial marshals from surrounding counties, including Aroostook, Hancock, Waldo and Knox, to Bangor when things are busy at the judicial center. That was done in 2010 for the murder trial of Rory Holland, which was moved from York County to Penobscot County due to pretrial publicity.\n\nThe judicial marshals office now provides security at courthouses in all but three counties. County sheriff\u2019s offices still provide security and entry screening at courthouses in Kennebec, Somerset and Lincoln counties, Coty said.\n\nIn Penobscot County, the proposed annual contract with the sheriff\u2019s office for the next two fiscal years beginning July 1 included $434,217 for courtroom security and an additional $130,000 for entry screening, which is funded separately by the Legislature, the sheriff said.\n\nThe decision came down to money, Ross said.\n\n\u201cWe were flat funded from last year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was problematic because we didn\u2019t make money on the contract. There were cost increases through step increases we\u2019d negotiated with our employees that weren\u2019t covered, but the real decider was the fact that we\u2019d be on the hook for the Affordable Health Care Act.\u201d\n\nRoss said that in the past, the contract covered pay increases negotiated between the county and the union representing the court officers and other sheriff\u2019s department employees.\n\n\u201cBecause the Affordable Care Act would require us to provide health insurance for employees working 30 hours a week or more, we expected that cost to be $22,750 between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state would not pay that cost.\u201d\n\nCoty said that he could not discuss the details of the negotiations but said the Legislature flat funded money for court security and entry screening in Penobscot County this fiscal year and next. He said he would provide for security within the budget constraints.\n\nThe Penobscot Judicial Center still is the only courthouse in the state that has full-time entry screening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty close to 100 percent [entry screening] in Cumberland County and in Lewiston and Biddeford,\u201d Coty said. \u201cBut in the smaller courthouses, it\u2019s much less often.\n\nChief Justice Leigh I. Saufley in February set a goal of having entry screening 70 percent of the time in all courthouses excluding the one in Bangor. Coty said Monday the statewide average for entry screening was now at between 68 and 69 percent.\n\nHe said that the new judicial building under construction in Augusta behind the Kennebec County Courthouse will have full-time entry screening when it opens in 2015.\n\nCORRECTION:\n\nAn earlier version of this story requires clarification. The Maine Office of Judicial Marshals will oversee court security in Penobscot County.
