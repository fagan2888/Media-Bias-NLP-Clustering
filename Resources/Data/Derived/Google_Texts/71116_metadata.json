Take the path through Leyland Avenue, she said.\n\nBut you know how 13-year-olds can be. Jehovah Copeland rode his bicycle across Route 22, the new bicycle that his great-grandmother and legal guardian had just bought for his younger brother.\n\nThe car accident nearly ended his life.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether Jehovah would awake from his coma and doctors suggested his great-grandmother, Patricia Copeland, call a priest.\n\nJehovah did survive but the traumatic brain injury he suffered left him forever changed. He has impulse control problems and anger issues. He is in a wheelchair and can\u2019t remember to wash himself or brush his teeth.\n\nIt\u2019s an all-too-common story. A child is hurt diving into a swimming pool or is in a bad car accident. He needs to relearn how to walk, write or speak. Sometimes these children make remarkable progress, sometimes they never fully recover. After the media goes away, after the community stops holding fundraisers, the children continue to battle \u2014 sometimes for years \u2014 at Children\u2019s Specialized Hospital in Mountainside \u2014 a nursing home for children.\n\nThere is another branch in Toms River, and between them the facilities house about 70 children, most of whom have congenital defects that have left them physically and mentally incapable of living at home.\n\nThe concept of a nursing home for children, where kids might spend 21 years, is unsettling, almost unnatural, but there is a growing need for places like these, and Mountainside recently received state approval to add four new beds. Because of improvements in neo-natal care, babies have a better chance of survival than ever before, but surviving and thriving are two very different things. Some children are mobile and communicative, some have very little brain activity at all.\n\n\"We have a vision that every child should reach their maximum potential,\" said Amy Mansue, president and CEO. \"For some that means going home, for others, that they can somehow let us know they are not feeling well, maybe through a grunt or blink of an eye.\"\n\nFor Ivy Goldstein, a 4-year-old born three months\u2019 premature with a host of medical problems, the goal is getting her to recognize the difference between yes and no, her parents, Heather and Scott, said. That\u2019s ambitious given her cognitive impairment, but her parents have hope and have seen progress. Ivy can now grab at something she wants. She seems to recognize mom and dad.\n\nBut her father, Scott, says he knows there will be limitations. He will never take her for ice cream, or play with her the way he does with Ivy\u2019s twin sister, Cara.\n\nThat\u2019s a common theme at this hospital \u2014 there is a mix of hope and heartache, small steps and impossibly long journeys. The hospital\u2019s stated goal is to have every child return home, but in reality only about 5 percent ever live outside a hospital or nursing home.\n\nTo work as a staffer in a room full of these children is to redefine success. Maybe a child will one day learn the difference between yes and no or be able to express approval or disapproval.\n\n\"When you\u2019re here your expectations change,\" said Jeanette Golden, nurse manager at the Toms River facility. \"We do see the progress others might not see. When new people come on board, I tell them, \u2018You will with time \u2014 if you invest the time \u2014 you will see it.\u2019\"\n\nTYPICAL DAY\n\nDuring the week, the day begins around 6 a.m. New Jersey law requires that every child receive a free and appropriate education. About one-third are too fragile to leave the facility, so teachers are brought in. The rest attend special schools. That means getting up, getting fed, getting dressed and getting on a bus.\n\n\"Getting 44 kids ready for school, fed by a tube, and giving them all their medications is no minor feat,\" Mansue said.\n\nThe school day varies depending on the program. Ivy, for example, is in school from 8 until 3.\n\nAfter they return, there is recreational activity, then dinner, which many take though a tube. After dinner the children might watch television or listen to music, \"gearing them down, making them realize we are going to sleep soon,\" Golden said. Lights are usually out by 10.\n\nThe long-term care unit is a small wing off the main hospital, brightly lit and colorfully painted. It is hard to forget this is a hospital: There are children lying in hospital beds, a nurses station and rounds when medication is dispensed.\n\nBut the staff works hard to have it feel like something else. There are plenty of toys and games, soft music, large-screen televisions, special programs and activities tailored to meet a child\u2019s needs. Most of the day, the children are outside their room, either at school, at therapy or sitting in special wheelchairs in front of the television.\n\nRegardless of their conditions, they receive attention, care and a personalized education plan paid for with a mix of Medicaid, private insurance, state funding and private donations.\n\nThe care for each child costs about $800 per day, or nearly $300,000 per year, Mansue said. Most of the costs, she said, are paid by Medicaid.\n\nThat does not include costs for education, which are paid for by the child\u2019s local school district. Those costs are harder to measure because each child\u2019s needs are so different, but it can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollar per year.\n\nWhat we pay for says something about a society, said Peter Smith, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago.\n\n\"When we spend money on the most vulnerable citizens that says something about us that\u2019s good,\" said Smith, who also is medical director at Almost Home Kids, a transitional home for children with complicated medical needs.\n\n\"Just like how the Romans spent money on big circuses says something about them. As a society, do we get a bang for a buck when we spend money on the opera? I think we do. When opera goes away, even those of us who don\u2019t go are lessened.\"\n\nJudy Marie Potter, a nurse and administrative director at Mountainside, faces complex decisions every day.\n\n\"My personal feeling and philosophy is: Our job is to always be the best stewards of the money that we are given so that we maximize it to care for as many children in the best way possible,\" she said. \"If we are not wasting, if we are figuring out how to do things efficiently, being vigilant to reduce costs, that answers that question across the board.\"\n\nTHE SUCCESSES\n\nJehovah, a year after the accident that nearly took his life, is walking. It\u2019s a slow process. He needs a walker to balance but the leg braces he needs are getting smaller. There has been significant improvement in the last few months, and he may well one day return home.\n\nThe former safety, running back, tight-end keeps pictures of his uniformed self in his room.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to play again,\" he said. \"I have to.\"\n\nAside from the therapy and the school, there are special programs to try to give the kids a sense of normalcy. Santa comes in the winter with his elves. There is a \"Beach Day\" in the summer, complete with buckets of sand, shells and shovels. The children are wheeled to different stations where their hands can be dipped in sand or their faces painted.\n\nSome of the children seem to react, squeak or squeal. Some smile, but many seem not to notice or understand what is happening.\n\n\"Just because we cannot tell, we\u2019re not going to not do it,\" Potter said. \"We do know it gives great joy and comfort to the families.\"\n\nThat\u2019s an important mantra for the staff and volunteers who regularly walk the halls. A child may make little progress, but the comfort afforded to a family who knows their son or daughter is safe may be the greatest benefit provided.\n\nAnd there is satisfaction in knowing the children are well cared for and protected.\n\n\"You are not sure if they hear you or if they understand you, but you touch them and you know they are safe, and if that is something they can experience, you are giving them that,\" Potter said.\n\n\"There are definitely times we cannot tell, but we know they are safe and are well cared for and we know the parents know that, too. This place allows a parent to put their head on a pillow and think \u2018I don\u2019t have to worry about my child.\u2019 If (parents) do that, then I\u2019ve done my job.\"", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@river','@starledger','health-news','mountainside','toms-river'", "title": "A nursing home for children: long-term care unit cares for kids, helps families", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"A nursing home for children: long-term care unit cares for kids, helps families\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/a_nursing_home_for_children_long-term_care_unit_cares_for_kids_helps_families.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/08/13330045-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11157071\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-01T11:45:29Z\", \"author\": \"Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"@starledger\",\"health-news\",\"mountainside\",\"toms-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/08/13330045-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "After the media goes away, after the community stops holding fundraisers, these children continue to battle &#8211; sometimes for years &#8211; at Children&#8217;s Specialized Hospital in Mountainside &mdash; a nursing home for children.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, September 02, 2013,  5:30 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/08/ivyjpg-9633b1d641b30c2d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dgoldberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"8007378\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "After the media goes away, after the community stops holding fundraisers, these children continue to battle &#8211; sometimes for years &#8211; at Children&#8217;s Specialized Hospital in Mountainside &mdash; a nursing home for children.", "title": "A nursing home for children: long-term care unit cares for kids, helps families", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/a_nursing_home_for_children_long-term_care_unit_cares_for_kids_helps_families.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, September 01, 2013,  7:45 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "After the media goes away, after the community stops holding fundraisers, these children continue to battle &#8211; sometimes for years &#8211; at Children&#8217;s Specialized Hospital in Mountainside &mdash; a nursing home for children."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda7f\"", "article_summary": "That means getting up, getting fed, getting dressed and getting on a bus.\nThe care for each child costs about $800 per day, or nearly $300,000 per year, Mansue said.\nThe school day varies depending on the program.\nThe long-term care unit is a small wing off the main hospital, brightly lit and colorfully painted.\nAfter the media goes away, after the community stops holding fundraisers, the children continue to battle \u2014 sometimes for years \u2014 at Children\u2019s Specialized Hospital in Mountainside \u2014 a nursing home for children."}
