As we receive a paycheck from our employer\u2013or draw payments from a business we own\u2013we report the income we generate to Uncle Sam, who takes a portion in the form of taxes, and the rest is used for some combination of consumption for our current needs, and saving to fund our spending in the future.\n\nAt the point of transition into retirement (or at least, \u201cfinancial independence\u201d from work), the basic goal is relatively straightforward: to replace the income we had during our working years, with income from the assets we have saved for retirement. Simply put, we aim to replace one income stream with another, thereby allowing us to maintain our lifestyle.\n\nThe problem, however, is that the word \u201cincome\u201d does not mean the same thing in retirement that it does while we work.\n\nThe first issue is simply that if all we do is spend the \u201cincome\u201d from our assets in retirement, we leave over all the assets themselves; while some may wish to leave such a generous inheritance to their heirs, for many retirees, the reality is that they can\u2019t afford to not use their principal at any point in their retirement. While it\u2019s obviously dangerous to spend too much principal too soon, it\u2019s an unnecessary constraint on lifestyle to avoid spending it ever. The end result: At some point, retirement spending needs to include principal, too. Especially in low-yield environments where relying solely on \u201cincome\u201d alone can severely (and potentially unnecessarily) constrain retirement spending.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the most confusing problems in the world of investing is that sometimes payments are a combination of principal and income already, and investors don\u2019t even realize it! For instance, one of the reasons that master limited partnerships (MLPs) have \u201ctax preferences\u201d is that they\u2019re paying back a portion of the principal along the way (which is why those payments are \u201ctax free\u201d!). The same is true of immediate lifetime \u201cincome\u201d annuities, that also pay out what is actually a combination of income and principal. And in the case of many variable or equity-indexed annuities with \u201cincome\u201d guarantees, all the annuity guarantees may do for most retirees is pay them back their own principal over time, without actually generating any \u201cincome\u201d at all.\n\nIn the context of retirement accounts, the matter is even more confusing. As an accumulated asset, the account balance of an IRA is \u201cprincipal\u201d in any normal accounting of investment results, yet it is treated as \u201cincome\u201d for tax purposes\u2013because the principal is actually a deferral of income back when it was wages during the working years!\n\nThese confusing overlaps in what constitutes retirement \u201cincome\u201d can lead to serious problems. Retirees may purchase \u201cincome\u201d guarantees that are actually just a return of principal, or spend principal thinking that it\u2019s income, or rely too heavily on income and unnecessarily constrain their spending by not tapping principal when it is appropriate to do so.\n\nSo what\u2019s the resolution? It\u2019s time to stop talking about retirement \u201cincome\u201d, and instead focus on what really matters: generating after-tax retirement cash flows that can fund real-world retirement goals, not \u201cincome\u201d as some investment product or the tax code inconsistently define it. And with a focus on cash flows, it\u2019s easier to then talk about all the ways those cash flows can be effectively created, and retirees can more appropriately evaluate what sustainable cash flow can be withdrawn in the first place!\n\nMichael Kitces is a partner and the director of research for Pinnacle Advisory Group, and publisher of the financial planning industry blog Nerd\u2019s Eye View.
