Here, such rules are still in the works.\n\nThe Oregon Insurance Division, an agency within the state\u2019s Department of Consumer & Business Services that regulates the insurance marketplace, has for years been working to develop those rules, called network adequacy rules. A bill that outlines the basics of network adequacy earned all but one \u201cyes\u201d vote in the Oregon House and now awaits hearings in the Senate, where it\u2019s likely to be approved. The regulations would take effect Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nThe issue of narrow provider networks has become especially visible since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance mandate took effect at the beginning of 2014. Many Americans soon realized buying the cheapest plans possible generally means having the least amount of choice over which doctor they\u2019ll see. In extreme cases, some people found none of those listed by their insurance carrier were accepting new patients, or they had to drive long distances or wait weeks or months for an appointment.\n\nAlmost all insurance carriers list the providers they contract with one their websites, but they often aren\u2019t updated when the providers aren\u2019t seeing new patients, said Gayle Woods, a senior policy adviser with the Oregon Insurance Division and a leader on the network adequacy work.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenge for carriers, too, because many of them place the responsibility on the provider to update the system to indicate whether they\u2019re accepting new patients,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new rules in Oregon, unless they\u2019re changed in the Senate, would require carriers to submit annual reports to the state on their plans for ensuring network adequacy, and their websites must feature lists of in-network providers.\n\nThe law would not apply to large group plans, but it would apply to individual policies and small group policies that cover fewer than 100 people. A large proportion of Oregon\u2019s insured are covered under large group plans, usually through employers or associations, but Woods said insurance carriers and business groups had concerns about applying the regulations to large group plans because they\u2019re structured differently from small group and individual plans. The division hopes to develop rules for large group plans in the future, she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe we have convincing evidence that people who are enrolled in large group plans shouldn\u2019t have the same level of protection that this bill provides otherwise for individual and small group members,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we really didn\u2019t want to compromise the ability to get the bill passed.\u201d\n\nThe law\u2019s most crucial details, such as how many providers are covered, where they\u2019re located and whether patients can see them, will be hashed out by the Oregon Insurance Division when it clarifies specific rules after it\u2019s approved by the Legislature.\n\nThe division will likely allow carriers to choose one of two methods to prove their networks are adequate. One would be using nationally recognized standards around proving network adequacy, likely those already used with Medicare Advantage plans, because carriers are familiar with those formats, Woods said. The other method would be using a \u201cfactor\u201d-based approach using four sets of criteria: access to care, consumer satisfaction, quality and cost containment and transparency. The specifics of those four categories still need to be defined, but Woods said they could include distance to the providers and the time it takes to travel there.\n\nThe process is complicated by the fact that certain areas of the state are vastly different from others. Consider a city like Portland, where dozens of doctors could be located within a few miles of one\u2019s home, and Prineville, a city that likely has fewer than a dozen doctors.\n\n\u201cIf we were to set prescriptive specific standards and require ratios of specialists in membership, that could force some carriers out of certain areas of the state because they wouldn\u2019t be able to develop networks to comply,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create impossible requirements.\u201d\n\nModa Health, a prominent insurer in Oregon, and the Oregon Business Association, both took issue with the four \u201cfactors,\u201d arguing they\u2019re too open-ended. But Jesse Ellis O\u2019Brien, a health care advocate with the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group Foundation, a Portland-based consumer advocacy group, said the whole idea behind the process was to provide flexibility for rulemaking while not creating burdensome regulations for carriers.\n\n\u201cThe intent is for it to still have some teeth, so it won\u2019t be totally flexible,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the intent is to provide a different way for insurance companies to show that they are delivering high-value care to people.\u201d\n\nNaturopathic physicians in Oregon hoped the network adequacy regulations would compel insurers to cover them as primary care providers \u2014 a move many in the medical community disagreed with \u2014 but Woods said the rules do not do that. The division can\u2019t tell insurers who to contract with, she said. There is a federal nondiscrimination law, however, that says insurers can\u2019t exclude certain types of providers so long as they\u2019re licensed in states, they just don\u2019t necessarily need to cover them as primary care providers. Some insurers cover naturopathic physicians under \u201calternative\u201d or \u201cholistic\u201d sections of their policies.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-383-0304,\n\ntbannow@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oregon\u2019s neighbors to the north and south have strict rules around the number, type and location of providers insurance carriers must include within their policies\u2019 networks.
