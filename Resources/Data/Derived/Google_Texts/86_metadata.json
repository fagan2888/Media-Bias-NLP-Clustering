I mean reall, you can\u2019t make this stuff up.\n\nITV News reports, the Russian President has ordered his navy to make contact with a French aircraft carrier heading to the Gulf and work as allies. Mr. Putin has also called for a joint air and sea plan to be developed with the French navy. The announcement came after he held a telephone conversation with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in which they agreed to greater cooperation, the Kremlin said.\n\nMr. Putin has long wanted to drive a wedge between NATO allies in order to weaken the alliance and reduce the chance of further sanctions against Russia over the Kremlin\u2019s behavior in Ukraine. The European Union also said it will provide assistance to France per the organization\u2019s internal charter in the first request of this kind since the EU\u2019s creation.\n\nI find it striking that NATO was not mobilized as happened after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I am sure France would like to have the backing of the United States and the full alliance. The fact that this is not happening is most likely due to President Obama\u2019s refusal to provide such assurances.\n\nThis outcome should be an embarrassment to the American public. The fact that France has to lean on Russia for military assistance in the face of such a grave threat, while our president refuses to even acknowledge the danger is absurd.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin, a master reader of geopolitical tea leaves, just picked off France, one of the largest and most powerful countries in the European Union and a member of NATO, as an ally for Russia in the fight against the Islamic State, and more importantly, Russia's attempt to keep the Assad regime in power.
