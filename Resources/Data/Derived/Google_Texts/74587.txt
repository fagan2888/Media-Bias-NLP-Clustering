BACOLOD CITY, Sept. 5 (PNA) — The Kasadya Bacolod Foundation Inc., lead organizer of MassKara 2013, is tapping the social media to promote this year’s festival themed “Rediscover and Celebrate Bacolod.”

Alfred Lucot, festival media affairs and online business head, told a press briefing Thursday that organizers aim to increase the online presence of MassKara Festival through enhanced user engagement in the social media and the worldwide web.

He said they are encouraging Bacolodnons across the globe to use #MassKara2013 (HashtagMassKara2013) on social media.

The festival organizers will use various social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SoundCloud, YouTube, and Google Plus, to enforce the #MassKara2013.

“It is the people sharing their experience of MassKara Festival to the world. This is what #MassKara2013 is all about, and this how we will promote tourism in this city,” Lucot said.

Through #MassKara2013, online data and conversations can be filtered and monitored by organizers to assist them in packaging the festival in the coming years.

Lucot added that his team will also put up soon the MassKara Festival 2013 official website at www.bacolodmasskarafestival.com.

“We are still developing the website. We are equipping it with digital tools such as social media plug-ins to make it more user-friendly,” he said.

Among the features of the website is the special tab “#MassKara2013” which will be the home of all filtered data from the social media.

“We want to fill this website with contents not only coming from us but from the people who experienced and about to experience the happiest festival in the country.

Festival director Rhoderick Samonte had earlier said this year’s celebration, set from Oct. 1-20, promises “20 days of non-stop fun in the Philippines only happening in the City of Smiles.”

On Oct. 19, Bacolod will also mark its 75th Charter Anniversary.

Mayor Monico Puentevella had also said that 2013 is a “special year” for the city, not only because it is celebrating its Diamond Year but also because of the innovations and changes brought by the new MassKara festival organizer.
