The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an Obamacare-related appeal from Liberty University, effectively ending a case that many saw as a last-ditch attempt to overturn the 2010 law.

The Virginia-based, Christian college had raised issues about the mandate aspect of the law, a key provision that — if overturned — would have shaken the very foundation of Obamacare, Reuters reported. Justices had already upheld the constitutional aspects of Obamacare in 2012, with a 5-4 vote.

But Liberty University had launched a separate appeal, asking for legal clarification on the mandate that employers had to provide insurance to workers, or pay a fine. The Fourth U.S. Circuit of Appeals in Richmond, Va., had already turned down Liberty’s claims — and that decision now stands, given the high court’s refusal to take up the case, The Associated Press reported.

The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is considering another Obamacare case that will settle the question of whether the federal government can lawfully require businesses with religious objections to provide birth control in insurance plans, AP said.
