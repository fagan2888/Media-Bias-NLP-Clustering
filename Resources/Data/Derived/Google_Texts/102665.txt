There has been a second leak of briny wastewater from oil production on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, this time 3,000 barrels, or 126,000 gallons.

As with the last time—when a million gallons of the stuff leaked from an underground pipeline and possibly into the lake supplying the reservation’s water—the leaky line occurred near the town of Mandaree, North Dakota, and is owned by Arrow Water LLC, a subsidiary of Crestwood Midstream Partners LP, which is based in Houston.

Some environmental officials from the Three Affiliated Tribes say that many questions remain unanswered in that spill, even though tribal and company authorities have lent assurances that the spill, which left a swath of dead vegetation in its two-mile path to a ravine, did not reach the lake. The results of water tests have not yet been made public.

The second spill was discovered on Friday August 22, according to a report by the Associated Press. Both instances involve a substance that is many times saltier than seawater. Details have not been forthcoming on this one either.

“There are few details about the latest spill,” the Associated Press reported. “A spill report said soil and vegetation could be polluted. It adds that the spill has been isolated and cleanup crews have been mobilized.”

The oil fields are part of the Bakken formation and are being mined for bituminous crude.
