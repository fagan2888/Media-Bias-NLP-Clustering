We think people should be able to believe or not believe as they please. And putting 'In God We Trust' on the back of the police cars, that says something about us.\"\n\nAccording to Wells, this isn't actually the first time the four word saying has been displayed on Bonifay police cars.\n\nHe says the saying has actually been on cars ever since the department started displaying shields on their cars since the 1980s.\n\nBut Wells says Sunday marked a day where many came to stand behind a motto deeply rooted in a community.\n\n\"United we stand, divided we fall. And our community is united behind this motto. It's united behind 'In God We Trust,\" said Wells. \"Sheriff McKeithen had this idea. I think it's a good idea. It shows what we stand for. Our community's behind it, and that's why we're supporting it.\"\n\nWells says the Holmes County Sheriff's Office cars will begin displaying 'In God We Trust' stickers this week, and the county ambulances will begin displaying the stickers next week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many came to one Holmes County city Sunday to protest both for and against 'In God We Trust' being displayed on its fire trucks and police cars.", "language": "english", "author": "Zak Dahlheimer", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Many-Protest-For-and-Against-In-God-We-Trust-Stickers-in-Bonifay-320439722.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_02821.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Many came to one Holmes County city Sunday to protest both for and against 'In God We Trust' being displayed on its fire trucks and police cars.", "title": "Protests Held Both For and Against 'In God We Trust' Stickers in Bonifay"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many came to one Holmes County city Sunday to protest both for and against 'In God We Trust' being displayed on its fire trucks and police cars.", "title": "Protests Held Both For and Against 'In God We Trust' Stickers in Bonifay", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Many-Protest-For-and-Against-In-God-We-Trust-Stickers-in-Bonifay-320439722.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_02821.JPG", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Protests Held Both For and Against 'In God We Trust' Stickers in Bonifay", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Protests Held Both For and, Against In God We Trust"}, "article_summary": "Wells says the Holmes County Sheriff's Office cars will begin displaying 'In God We Trust' stickers this week, and the county ambulances will begin displaying the stickers next week.\nAnd putting 'In God We Trust' on the back of the police cars, that says something about us.\"\n'In God We Trust.'\nIt's united behind 'In God We Trust,\" said Wells.\nBut police Chief Chris Wells says ever since the station started putting on the stickers, the response has been overwhelmingly positive."}
