He will be sentenced to life in prison later this week following a competency hearing. The Ocala Star-Banner reported that Stevens was previously found to be incompetent to stand trial.\n\nAuthorities say Stevens fatally shot his grandmother - 70-year-old Yolanda Fruto - and his great-grandmother - 93-year-old Fautina Bontteg - at their Marion Oaks home in September 2012. He also shot and wounded their friend - then-47-year-old Jacqueline Gonzalez - in front of the woman's 8-year-old son. Authorities say Stevens then loaded items from the home into Gonzalez's car and drove off.\n\nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
