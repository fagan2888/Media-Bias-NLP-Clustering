Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania entered the debate Monday by rolling out a proposal that calls for a 20 percent flat tax on individual and business income and wipes away every tax deduction except for those that apply to charitable giving and the interest paid on home mortgage payments.\n\nHe wants to impose a $25,000 cap on the mortgage interest deduction.\n\nSome of his competitors say the mortgage interest deduction should be maintained completely. Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who in releasing his tax plan late last month, said the mortgage interest deduction is critical to the health of the economy.\n\n\u201cYou know, a lot of people were worried about real estate. Try taking the mortgage interest deduction out, you\u2019ll see what\u2019s going to happen to real estate. You want to see a crash? Try that one,\u201d he said at a rally in New Hampshire.\n\nUnder current law, taxpayers can claim the deduction on interest paid up to $1 million of mortgage interest on a first or second home, as well as on interest paid on up to $100,000 of home equity debt.\n\nSo taxpayers with $20,000 a year in mortgage interest on their homes can deduct that from their taxable income.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge boost for taxpayers and the real estate market, but it saps the federal government of tax money it would otherwise collect \u2014 to the tune of about $75 billion in 2015, Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation estimated.\n\nThat would be enough money to cancel almost all of the \u201csequester\u201d budget cuts or increase the federal road-building fund.\n\nRepublicans are reluctant to raise more revenue for spending, but those who have released overhaul plans have called for canceling many of the special breaks and using the money to lower the income tax rates.\n\nKnown on Capitol Hill as \u201ctax expenditures,\u201d the breaks range from excluding military disability benefits from income to energy-efficient equipment purchases to college expenses. The Treasury Department lists more than 150 line items that can be claimed.\n\nBusinesses\u2019 deductions for employees\u2019 health care costs are the biggest, at more than $200 billion a year.\n\nThe charitable giving deduction is also popular, at a cost nearly $50 billion a year.\n\nThe Republican field splits on exactly how to handle the mortgage interest deduction.\n\nMr. Trump and Sen. Rand Paul leave it untouched, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush caps the value at 2 percent of adjusted gross income. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal caps the deduction at $550,000 of interest payments, while Sen. Marco Rubio imposes a cap at $300,000 of payments.\n\nWhile some say the deduction encourages homeownership, others question the claim and the Congressional Research Service released an analysis last year that found \u201cmost of the total dollar amount of mortgage interest claims is done by middle- and upper-income households.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s National Commission on Fiscal and Responsibility and Reform recommend that the mortgage deduction be converted into a 12 percent credit and capped at $500,000 of mortgage interest.\n\nThe commission also called for elimination of the deduction for second homes and equity.\n\nThat proposal is collecting dust on Capitol Hill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While demanding an end to many tax breaks, Republican presidential candidates have been reluctant to do much about the biggest one of all: the mortgage interest deduction, which saps tens of billions of dollars from the federal Treasury every year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "While demanding an end to many tax breaks, Republican presidential candidates have been reluctant to do much about the biggest one of all: the mortgage interest deduction, which saps tens of billions of dollars from the federal Treasury every year.", "title": "Mortgage interest tax deduction safe in Republican candidates\u2019 reform plans", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/12/mortgage-interest-tax-deduction-safe-in-republican/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/11/10/20091109-173904-pic-905846076.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/11/10/20091109-173904-pic-905846076.jpg", "description": "While demanding an end to many tax breaks, Republican presidential candidates have been reluctant to do much about the biggest one of all: the mortgage interest deduction, which saps tens of billions", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mortgage interest tax deduction safe in Republican candidates\u2019 r"}, "Author": "Seth McLaughlin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce95\"", "article_summary": "Some of his competitors say the mortgage interest deduction should be maintained completely.\nHe wants to impose a $25,000 cap on the mortgage interest deduction.\nRepublican front-runner Donald Trump, who in releasing his tax plan late last month, said the mortgage interest deduction is critical to the health of the economy.\nTry taking the mortgage interest deduction out, you\u2019ll see what\u2019s going to happen to real estate.\nThe Republican field splits on exactly how to handle the mortgage interest deduction."}
