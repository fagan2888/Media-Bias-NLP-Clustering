Over at National Review, Ian Tuttle notes that last night it was also MIA:\n\nBeyond a few brief in media res mentions from candidates, a repeal line in Cruz\u2019s closing address, and an allusion or two (e.g., the question about John Roberts), the president\u2019s signature piece of legislation was a non-issue. Which makes one wonder: Is it a non-issue?....I suspect that the anti-Obamacare fervor is in a period of quiescence. We have now seen Obamacare implemented sans \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d The website works. The Supreme Court has handed the Obama administration two affirmative Supreme Court decisions. And the president has made sure to do much in the interim \u2014 immigration executive actions and Iran deals, for example \u2014 to draw fire away from his healthcare law. Conservative heads have a limited supply of steam.\n\nTuttle is right. Obamacare has become a brief, pro forma applause line these days, but not much more. Partly this is for the reason Tuttle rather surprisingly concedes: It's up, it's running, and it's working reasonably well. The nation still stands, and it's hard to keep whipping up hysteria for years and years over something that, it turns out, just isn't affecting all that many people.\n\nI don't think this means that Obamacare is going away as a political issue. But I do think that the repeal movement has lost a lot of steam as a winning issue for Republicans. The tea party types are starting to realize that nothing in their lives has changed, and the more moderate types realize\u2014maybe via personal experience, maybe via news reports\u2014that it's doing a lot of good for poor and working class folks. So it's become something of a wedge issue: Pounding on it loses about as many votes as it gains.\n\nThis is becoming a real problem for the GOP. A lot of issues that used to be pretty reliable winners have now turned into dangerous wedge issues: gay marriage, taxes, terrorism, illegal immigration, military adventurism, abortion, crime, education, global warming, Ukraine, free trade, Social Security cuts\u2014the list goes on and on. And this is coming at the same time that their bread and butter, the angry white guy demographic, is declining. I'm not sure what they're going to end up doing about this. The GOP has a tough decade ahead.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/09/obamacare-has-now-been-mia-two-debates", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare has now been MIA in two debates"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obamacare has now been MIA in two debates", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/09/obamacare-has-now-been-mia-two-debates", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0565\"", "article_summary": "So it's become something of a wedge issue: Pounding on it loses about as many votes as it gains.\nI don't think this means that Obamacare is going away as a political issue.\nWe have now seen Obamacare implemented sans \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d The website works.\nObamacare has become a brief, pro forma applause line these days, but not much more.\nBut I do think that the repeal movement has lost a lot of steam as a winning issue for Republicans."}
