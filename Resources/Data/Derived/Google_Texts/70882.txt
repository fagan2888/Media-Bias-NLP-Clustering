A shooting late Friday night at a Denver apartment complex left four people injured, police said Saturday morning.

The shooting happened around 11:30 p.m. at the Lowry Park Apartments at 8501 E. Alameda Ave., said Denver police spokesman Eranda Piyasena.

Two victims were taken to a local hospital with serious but non-life threatening wounds and two victims had less serious injuries after being grazed by a bullet.

Further information on the victims or their conditions were not available at this time.

The shooting began as an argument that escalated, Piyasena said.

Police are still trying to develop suspect information.
