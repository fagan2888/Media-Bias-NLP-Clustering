He, too, is a card-carrying member of the country club. He formerly served as Republican National Committee chairman and advised Mitt Romney\u2019s failed White House bid.\n\nBut in the aftermath of Romney\u2019s defeat, strategists like Gillespie saw the writing on the wall: The GOP needed to rethink it\u2019s messaging strategy (or lack thereof), especially when it came to women, Hispanics and African-Americans.\n\nThe supposed \u201cautopsy report\u201d delivered by RNC chairman Reince Preibus in March 2013 concluded that voters see the GOP as a \u201cscary\u201d group of \u201cstuffy old men\u201d who are \u201cout of touch\u201d with an increasingly diverse country. Indeed, 91 percent of congressional Republicans are white males, and its leadership has the dubious honor of remaining 100 percent white.\n\nMajority Whip Kevin McCarthy, a 49-year-old Republican from California, became the House majority leader in the mid-session ballot necessitated by Eric Cantor\u2019s humbling defeat in this month\u2019s Virginia primary. McCarthy\u2019s promotion opened up the No. 3 spot for whip, which was filled by Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise.\n\nScalise, who leads a powerful faction of conservatives in the House Caucus, was boosted by a concerted effort to elect a leader from a red state. Until now, the GOP\u2019s leadership has been dominated by lawmakers from blue states, despite the party\u2019s stronghold in the South.\n\nIn fact, he becomes the first Republican from a red state to take a leadership role since President Obama came into office. The Washington chattering classes opine that Scalise\u2019s election will provide House Speaker John Boehner political coverage on tough votes. But it also underscores a party in peril, as Scalise is aligned to the far-right intransigence, obstinacy and anti-government sentiment that have come to characterize GOP politics in the Obama era.\n\nIn the past, Scalise has opposed funding the government and extending the debt ceiling \u2013 political wars that have been waged as a way to undermine Obama\u2019s ability to govern, but have also made Republicans increasingly unpopular with mainstream voters.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nScalise\u2019s ascendance appears to represent the GOP\u2019s doubling down on its strategy to win not by growing its coalition from without \u2014 with women and Hispanics \u2014 but rather by reinforcing the conservative base from within, solidifying its coalition of white voters from the South and Midwest.\n\nBoehner, McCarthy and Scalise do not reflect the face of the broader American electorate, but they do reflect the average Republican voter. And Scalise, 48, represents the Southern establishment who are just as conservative as their parents and grandparents were. As Nate Cohn of the New York Times recently explained, though white Southerners have been voting Republican for decades, the gap has increased significantly under Obama\u2019s tenure and it appears to be largely a matter of race.\n\n\u201cSouthern politics are deeply polarized along racial lines,\u201d Cohn writes. \u201cIt is no exaggeration to suggest that \u2026 Republicans are the party of whites.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Scalise infamously resorted to race-baiting tactics during his 2008 election, during which he exploited racial sentiments by running a series of advertisements against his Democratic opponent, which featured Obama\u2019s former pastor Rev Jeremiah Wright shouting, \u201cGod damn America!\u201d\n\nThis, of course, is a tried, true and tested tactic in the Louisiana district Scalise represents. There\u2019s already a memorial there to the late Sheriff Harry Lee, the man who unapologetically won office on a platform of keeping \u201cyoung black men in rinky-dink cars\u201d out of the Jefferson, Louisiana, town limits. Curiously, Scalise scolded Harry Reid last August for questioning that some of the opposition to the nation\u2019s first African-American president might be racially motivated, exclaiming, \u201cShame on Harry Reid for bringing race into [the] conversation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Party calls its demographic destiny \"scary,\" then picks two more white men as its leaders.
