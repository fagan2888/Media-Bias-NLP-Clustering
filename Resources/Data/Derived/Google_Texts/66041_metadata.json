Elizabeth Warren is defending Bernie Sanders\u2019 decision to keep campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination and calling out Donald Trump for being the worst kind of predatory capitalist.\n\nWarren spoke to reporters after visiting a community health center in suburban Boston and made the following six points about Sanders and Trump, which were quickly picked up by Associated Press.\n\n1. Sanders is good for Democrats and the country. \u201cHe\u2019s out there. He fights from the heart. This is who Bernie is,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe has put the right issues on the table both for the Democratic Party and for the country in general, so I\u2019m still cheering Bernie on.\u201d\n\n2. Trump\u2019s riches come from exploiting others\u2019 pain. Warren said Trump\u2019s fortune was acquired \u201cby cheating people, by defrauding people, and by skipping out on paying his creditors through Chapter 11\u201d bankruptcy protection.\n\n3. Trump\u2019s primary qualification is a big lie. \u201cDonald Trump claims that the reason he\u2019s qualified to be president of the United States is that he is a very, very, very successful businessman,\u201d Warren said. \u201cDonald Trump is not a great business success and it\u2019s time he\u2019s called on it.\u201d\n\n4. Trump quotes fascists and thinks that\u2019s just fine. Last month, Trump recited a quote from Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, \u201cIt is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep,\u201d and said he didn\u2019t care who said it because he liked it. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who quotes Mussolini,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is really scary and the American people should pay very close attention.\u201d\n\n5. There is no good Republican candidate. Warren talked about how debating Obamacare is but one example of how bad all of the Republican candidates are. \u201cWhile the Democrats are saying, \u2018Gee, is the right answer to improve the Affordable Care Act in the following six ways or go all the way to single payer?\u2019\u2014which is a good debate to have\u2014the Republicans are saying they are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something they can\u2019t quite describe,\u201d she said.\n\n6. Old GOP attacks on her won\u2019t work. Warren said Trump\u2019s attacks on her, which are recycling her 2012 GOP opponent\u2019s claim that she does not have some Native American blood, were pathetic. \u201cIf Donald Trump thinks that by using Scott Brown\u2019s hate-filled attacks on my family he\u2019s going to shut me down then he better think again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work before and it\u2019s not going to work now.\u201d\n\nWarren has not endorsed either Sanders or Clinton in the 2016 Democratic nominating contests. But her remarks this past week have prompted some commentators to speculate that should Sanders win the nomination, she would be an excellent running mate.\n\nA Higher Profile\n\nWarren\u2019s comments are also signaling that she is taking on a new role in the presidential campaign. On Monday, she slammed Trump in more detail on her Facebook page, but said Democrats need to take Trump\u2019s candidacy seriously, because he could win and cause real harm.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest\u2014Donald Trump is a loser,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCount all his failed businesses. See how he kept his father\u2019s empire afloat by cheating people with scams like Trump University and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy (excuse me, bankruptcies) to skip out on debt. Listen to the experts who\u2019ve concluded he\u2019s so bad at business that he might have more money today if he\u2019d put his entire inheritance into an index fund and just left it alone.\u201d\n\nWarren continued, saying, \u201cTrump seems to know he\u2019s a loser. His embarrassing insecurities are on parade: petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, and flagrant narcissism. But just because Trump is a loser everywhere else doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll lose this election. People have been underestimating his campaign for nearly a year\u2014and it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d\n\nWarren said this election really matters\u2014and that\u2019s not a clich\u00e9. \u201cConsider what hangs in the balance,\u201d she said. \u201cAffordable college. Accountability for Wall Street. Healthcare for millions of Americans. The Supreme Court. Big corporations and billionaires paying their fair share of taxes. Expanded Social Security. Investments in infrastructure and medical research and jobs right here in America. The chance to turn our back on the ugliness of hatred, sexism, racism and xenophobia. The chance to be a better people.\u201d\n\nWarren concluded that a Trump presidency could \u201ctear apart an America that was built on values like decency, community, and concern for our neighbors.\u201d She said, \u201cMany of history\u2019s worst authoritarians started out as losers\u2014and Trump is a serious threat. The way I see it, it\u2019s our job to make sure he ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/elizabeth-warren-flickr-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Here are 6 ways Elizabeth Warren trashed Trump this week \u2014 and stood by Bernie Sanders"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Massachusetts Sen.
