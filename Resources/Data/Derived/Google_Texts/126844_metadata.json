Most hospitals have an eligibility system to verify a patient\u2019s coverage for a specific set of services from specific insurance companies. But as coverage expands and gets more complex, so do the pressures on hospitals.\n\n\u201cBut it can be difficult as people churn in and out of different plans,\u201d said Ed Hock, researcher on revenue cycle at The Advisory Board Company. They may be eligible for Medicaid or certain plans that depend on income levels that can vary for members throughout the course of the year.\n\nHospitals may have benefited from the rocky rollout of the health insurance exchanges and the slow buildup of enrollees so they could get a better handle on the complexities in verifying patient coverage under new health plans.\n\nThe American Hospital Association noted that hospitals have seen an uptick in activity since January due to the new enrollment, but they were ready, including for patient coverage verification. \u201cWe are not hearing of significant issues from the hospital field. Significant work went into preparations and helping people get enrolled,\u201d said Jeff Goldman, AHA vice president of coverage policy.\n\nLooming larger, however, is that patients are going to be responsible for a much larger portion of their healthcare costs whether they obtain coverage in health plans through public or private exchanges, said Zac Stillerman, general manager of revenue cycle solutions at The Advisory Board Company.\n\nAs a result, hospitals may also have to take on a greater role as bill collector. Hospitals are traditionally staffed to pursue insurance companies for payment, not point-of-service cash collections from lots of patients.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is starting to snowball\u2026 where hospitals will start to see significant portions of their revenues from patients -- not from insurance companies -- and Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a combination of the Affordable Care Act activities, public and private exchanges, and traditional companies offering employees an option of a high deductible plan.\n\n\u201cOne of the big challenges that hospitals have to face is how do they redo their staffing, their systems, and the way they collect payments, when a larger portion of the revenue stream is coming from a different source,\u201d Stillerman said.\n\nHospitals need to invest in more robust financial counseling around payments than they do now and eligibility software that will be sophisticated enough to also determine how much they can expect to collect of a patient\u2019s co-pays and deductibles for a specific procedure even before the patient has the procedure.\n\nIf a patient is coming in for knee surgery and has a deductible of $6,000, which hasn\u2019t been met yet, hospitals need to determine how much of that to go after in order to get some payment, be it a discount if it is paid up front or a monthly coupon process, he said. Should the hospital cancel the surgery if the patient doesn\u2019t pay a certain amount of it before the day of service?\n\nResearch has shown that the moment a patient leaves the hospital after their procedure, 50 percent are less likely to pay the bill. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t leveraging data and better processes to work with them on what will eventually be their payment before they even come into the hospital, you\u2019re leaving on the table a huge opportunity,\u201d Stillerman said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/verifying-coverage-collecting-payments-get-more-complex-hospitals", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Zac_Stillerman_The_Advisory_Board_Company.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Identifying an individual's health plan sounds pretty straightforward.
