With about 140,000 members, Samaritan is among the largest of such groups in the country.\n\nChristian sharing ministries are experiencing a spike in membership as people look for alternatives to government-mandated health insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act, which was passed in 2010.\n\nThere are three national ministries that have about 425,000 members, said Joel Noble, vice president of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, a Washington, Ill.-based advocacy group.\n\nSmall church-based ministries add another 25,000 members, bringing total membership this year to about 450,000, he said. That's more than double the 200,000 total ministry members in 2013.\n\nHealth law exemption\n\nSome people go to sharing ministries looking for a better deal than traditional carriers offer. Others are motivated to avoid the law's requirements that insurers cover contraception and abortions.\n\nWhile not insurance, health care sharing ministries qualify as coverage under the federal law, an exemption that was carved out for them as a result of lobbying by the alliance.\n\n\u201cWe have seen pretty significant growth since 2010,\u201d said Tony Meggs, CEO of Christian Care Ministry, a Melbourne, Fla.-based organization that runs Medi-Share, one of the three national ministries.\n\nMedi-Share's membership has more than tripled since the law passed, and stands at about 106,000 members as of this year.\n\nThe exemption for sharing ministries is key because it means members meet the law's individual mandate \u2014 and can't be penalized for not having health insurance.\n\nThe health law has driven membership gains at Samaritan, Lansberry said. The organization has seen its ranks increase by 30 percent in each of the past three years, he said.\n\nWhile a sharing ministry may count as coverage under federal law, experts warn that people considering membership in one need to be aware that they aren't buying insurance, and they won't have the same financial protections, or robust coverage requirements, of a health plan.\n\n\u201cClearly, if they run out of money there's no money to back it up,\u201d said Gary Claxton, a vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation, a California nonprofit health care research organization.\n\nMoral commitments\n\nThe ministries hold no money in reserve to cover unexpected claims. In fact, they aren't allowed to do so without being under the scrutiny of state insurance regulators, Claxton said. They rely solely on the continued monthly payments of members to cover costs.\n\n\u201cIt's something that's always been a concern ... because there are no financial protections,\u201d he said.\n\nMeggs doesn't shy away from financial questions, calling them a \u201cvalid concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's no guarantee that your medical bills are going to be paid,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, our members know that since 1993, every medical bill that we've ever published through the network has been paid. (Members) are simply placing their faith in the community that has the collective moral commitment to share their resources on a monthly basis.\u201d\n\nSome states aren't interested in moral commitments.\n\nMeggs said Medi-Share doesn't operate in Montana because of a dispute with the state over insurance regulations.\n\nThe state in 2007 ordered Medi-Share to deposit a minimum of $1.5 million to cover pending claims when a state court found the organization was \u201can insurer acting in Montana without authority,\u201d according to a statement from the state.\n\nThe state of Kentucky fought a 10-year legal battle with Medi-Share, which culminated with a 2012 state Supreme Court ruling that the organization was an insurer and wasn't exempt from oversight, said Ronda Sloan, a spokeswoman for the Department of Insurance.\n\nThe decision was negated by a 2013 state law that exempted health care sharing ministries from insurance regulations.\n\nLower costs\n\nMinistries are exempt from regulation in Pennsylvania so long as they don't represent themselves as insurance, said Alison Fogarty, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Insurance.\n\nRegulation aside, health care ministries are popular because monthly sharing payments are typically less than insurance premiums.\n\nLisa Letonek and her husband pay $460 a month for family coverage that includes a 17-year-old son. Letonek, 55, of Dutch Hill in Clarion County, said when she last priced insurance premiums for family coverage they were more than twice the amount.\n\n\u201cWe've had no problems with it. We show a card when we go to a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt works pretty much like insurance.\u201d\n\nBut Letonek hasn't shopped on the federal marketplace set under the health reform law, HealthCare.gov, where some working families can receive tax credits that offset part of the cost of insurance.\n\nFor that reason, Meggs said health sharing ministries savings are now most pronounced among families with higher incomes that don't qualify for federal subsidies.\n\n\u201cOur membership would probably skew upper middle class,\u201d he said.\n\nJaime Wilson said she and her husband pay $405 a month for a family of five through Samaritan.\n\n\u201cIt's not going to some corporate office,\u201d she said, referring to one of the reasons she prefers a health care ministry over traditional insurance. \u201cIt's going straight to a Christian family that has a need.\u201d\n\nThe groups keep costs low by not paying for some procedures, not offering dental or vision coverage, and requiring their members to live a \u201cChristian\u201d lifestyle in which they don't smoke or do drugs, limit alcohol and don't have sex outside of marriage.\n\nSamaritan and Medi-Share require members to prove they are active in a Christian church, typically by having a pastor sign off on an application form.\n\nLansberry argues faith produces savings.\n\n\u201cOur members are praying for one another,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that helps keep the cost down.\u201d\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
