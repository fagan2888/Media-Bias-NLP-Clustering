He was the truth.\n\nThe comedic genius, who died six years ago this month, understood the hidden duplicity of language and politicians better than any American satirist of the modern era.\n\nHe once blasphemously said the following about the Ten Commandments and courthouses.\n\n\u201cThe reason why you can\u2019t post thou shall not steal, commit adultery, or lie in a building full of lawyers, judges and politicians is simple.\n\n\u201cIt would create a hostile work environment.\u201d\n\nI think he was right, especially, with the part about the lie. Our nation\u2019s political system has always been rife with lies: \u201cAll men are created equal,\u201d easily being offered as exhibit No. 1.\n\nWhat would Carlin say now, however, about a decision handed down Monday by the United States Supreme Court involving a free speech case from Ohio? The case is all about abortion, lies and the freedom to lie about politicians.\n\nThe court ruled unanimously that an anti-abortion group can challenge an Ohio law that bars advocacy groups from lying about politicians \u2013 and possibly facing criminal penalties - during an election.\n\nIt\u2019s a solid, highly-defensible ruling. Would you really expect a journalist to feel any differently? I loathe liars. But I love free political speech more.\n\nThe decision comes too late for former Cincinnati-area Congressman Steve Driehaus, a Democrat, who lost an election in 2011 after the Susan B. Anthony List, an advocacy group, attempted to sponsor an advertisement that accused Driehaus of supporting \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d\n\nIt was a lie.\n\nDriehaus was anti-abortion. He threatened legal action. As a result the inflammatory billboard never went up.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop the group from effectively linking Driehaus to a pro-abortion platform because he had voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act. The subsequent negative publicity the brouhaha generated affected what should have been a competitive political race.\n\nAfter Driehaus lost the election, he withdrew his fraud complaint with the state. But the camel\u2019s nose was already under the speech tent. The Susan B. Anthony List saw a golden opportunity to challenge the law on the grounds of protected discourse and it prevailed on Monday.\n\nSo now what?\n\nWe can expect our politics to become even more coarse, crude, perhaps even vulgar. I can live with that. A strong case can be made that we've become too politically correct for our own national interest. Politicians have never been above distorting their records, their accomplishments or even outright lying.\n\nThe American electorate has always countenanced the elected with a healthy grain of political salt. But now that special interest and advocacy groups have been given a green light to advance their own myopic versions of what is true, let the buyer beware that each individual is ultimately responsible for his or her own voter education.\n\nVoters must constantly educate themselves on the veracity of candidates, issues and the forces that attempt to influence political outcomes. America needs a more vigorous debate about the issues that define our domestic and global agendas. Lies, half-lies and the truth all have a place at the table and can be a part of a healthy and evolved national discourse.\n\n\u201cThe truth or falsity of political speech should be judged by voters, not government bureaucrats,\u201d said a spokesperson with the Susan B. Anthony List, the group that labeled Driehaus an abortion-rights supporter.\n\nThose are fighting words that will likely echo loudly in an expanded and amplified political arena.\n\nOr, as Carlin once said: \u201cBy and large, language is a tool for concealing the truth.\u201d\n\nWhich only goes to suggest that the freer and more robust political speech remains, the greater the ability to ferret out those who would use language to deceive.\n\nUltimately, truth will prevail and liars will be exposed and hoisted with their own petards.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Phillip Morris, The Plain Dealer", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "steve-driehaus, supreme-court-political-lies, susan-b-anthony-list, united-states-supreme-court-and-free-political-speech, news", "title": "Pretty Little (political) Liars and the United States Supreme Court: Phillip Morris", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "So now what?
