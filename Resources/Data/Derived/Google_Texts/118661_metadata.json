Not to mention a higher chance of developing high blood pressure, stress, attention deficit disorder, depression, and even obesity.\n\nNow, researchers are beginning to examine the impact sleep deprivation might have on brain size. In a new study out of the University of Oxford, scientists examined 147 adults who were aged 20 to 84. They analyzed the link between lack of sleep and brain volume, finding that on average sleeping difficulties were associated with the \u201crapid decline in brain volume.\u201d All of the participants underwent two MRI brain scans \u2014 about 3.5 years apart \u2014 and completed questionnaires about how they slept: whether they had a difficult time falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping a solid amount of hours every night. About 35 percent of the participants were shown to have poor sleep quality, according to the authors.\n\nBut the researchers still aren\u2019t sure whether they can determine from this study that people with low sleep quality will indeed experience a decline in brain volume. Though there is a link, there is no telling if it\u2019s a causation or just a correlation. What they did find, however, was that rapid decline in brain volume was more strongly apparent in people over the age of 60.\n\n\u201cIt is not yet known whether poor sleep quality is a cause or consequence of changes in brain structure,\u201d study author Claire E. Sexton of the University of Oxford said in the press release. \u201cThere are effective treatments for sleep problems, so future research needs to test whether improving people\u2019s quality of sleep could slow the rate of brain volume loss. If that is the case, improving people\u2019s sleep habits could be an important way to improve brain health.\u201d\n\nThis is just another study that suggests how important sleep is for the brain. Sleep is something of the \u201cbrain\u2019s housekeeper,\u201d due to its ability to \u201ccleanse\u201d the brain and repair it. A recent study out of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found that chronic sleep deprivation could be quite serious in that it causes your brain to lose neurons.\n\n\u201cIn general, we\u2019ve always assumed full recovery of cognition following short- and long-term sleep loss,\u201d Dr. Sigrid Veasey, an author of the UPenn study and associate professor of Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine, said in a press release. \u201cBut some of the research in humans has shown that attention span and several other aspects of cognition may not normalize even with three days of recovery sleep, raising the question of lasting injury in the brain. We wanted to figure out exactly whether chronic sleep loss injures neurons, whether the injury is reversible, and which neurons are involved\u2026 This is the first report that sleep loss can actually result in a loss of neurons.\u201d\n\nSo give sleep a chance to be your \u201cbrain\u2019s housekeeper,\u201d because it is likely far more important to your brain \u2014 and overall health \u2014 than you think.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sleep, brain health, brain size, sleep deprivation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers found that people who reported poor sleep quality had a higher chance of decreasing brain volume in various brain regions.", "title": "Can Sleep Loss Impact The Size Of Your Brain?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/impact-sleep-loss-can-it-affect-size-your-brain-301154", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/sleep-deprivation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers found that people who reported poor sleep quality had a higher chance of decreasing brain volume in various brain regions.", "title": "Can Sleep Loss Impact The Size Of Your Brain?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/impact-sleep-loss-can-it-affect-size-your-brain-301154", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/sleep-deprivation.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/sleep-deprivation.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-03T21:05:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-03T21:07:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers found that people who reported poor sleep quality had a higher chance of decreasing brain volume in various brain regions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02d1\"", "article_summary": "What they did find, however, was that rapid decline in brain volume was more strongly apparent in people over the age of 60.\nNow, researchers are beginning to examine the impact sleep deprivation might have on brain size.\n\u201cThere are effective treatments for sleep problems, so future research needs to test whether improving people\u2019s quality of sleep could slow the rate of brain volume loss.\nAbout 35 percent of the participants were shown to have poor sleep quality, according to the authors.\nBut the researchers still aren\u2019t sure whether they can determine from this study that people with low sleep quality will indeed experience a decline in brain volume."}
