He now speaks and writes on addiction recovery and mental illness.\n\nI was wrong about the anti-squeegee bill introduced by the late Jim Flaherty 15 years ago this December, when he was Ontario attorney-general. As Liberal justice critic, I called the Safe Streets Act, 1999, \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201ca joke.\u201d But it was no joke. It\u2019s been used to ticket the poor for being unwell for 15 years, and it\u2019s time to repeal it.\n\nOf course the better time to repeal it would have been when I was attorney-general from 2003-2007. I failed in that regard, and I\u2019m here to repent. Shoot the messenger all you want, I say, but listen to the voices that say this law hurts people who deserve our help, not an unpayable ticket that can land them in jail or deprive them of a job opportunity.\n\nThe Homeless Hub, a Web-based research library and information centre, provides buckets of social science proving the unhealthy, unconscionable impact of the 1999 law. My own reckoning on this bill came when the street-involved community that frequents Sanctuary Toronto welcomed me into their lunch and dinner drop-ins, three years after my term as attorney-general, and within weeks of my being charged with a serious criminal offence that involved the death of Darcy Sheppard. Where they might have offered me the back of their hand, instead I have been blessed with many cherished friendships; kinship amongst equals, notwithstanding the gross economic inequality they suffer every day.\n\nOne such friend came to me excited that he\u2019d received a job offer to drive a fork lift in Calgary. After years on the street, unwell, and often homeless, he had gotten better, and landed himself a job.\n\nOr so he thought. In order to get the license upgrade to drive the forklift, he had to pay thousands of dollars of unpaid fines arising from Safe Streets Act tickets. Fines that only the wealthy could afford, let alone an indigent man in social housing with a few weeks of recovery from alcoholism under his belt.\n\n\u201cIt was like a game, with the police,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d sometimes have the ticket written up already, with my name on it, then they\u2019d see me and hand it over. They\u2019d let me keep panhandling or drinking wherever I was, as long as they could meet their ticket quota.\u201d Thanks to the Safe Streets Act, my friend may lose the job opportunity \u2013 a devastating result that could ruin his recovery, his sanity, his fleeting hope.\n\nWho gets ticketed? The poor, the homeless, the mentally ill, addicts, alcoholics. My friends, our neighbours.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t get ticketed? \u201cStreet canvassers\u201d who solicit donations on our sidewalks on behalf of well-known charities. The exemptions for charities was carved out via a 2005 private member\u2019s bill by Liberal MPP Jean-Marc Lalonde, after firefighters\u2019 boot drives were found to be in violation of the Safe Streets Act.\n\nAnd herein lies the crux of the ignorance behind this law: registered charities can panhandle with snappy clipboards, colourful vests and cheerful, sophomoric smiles, in contrast to the often grubby faces of homeless panhandlers who get ticketed by the police. Both are quite annoying to passers-by. Politicians who \u201cmainstreet\u201d during an election often get the same reaction. I did. But only the poor are ticketed.\n\nOnly the poor get ticketed, because too many are frightened by street-involved people. The Safe Streets Act capitalized on that fear. Personally, I used to know that childish fear, unnerved but mostly spooked by what I misconstrued as menacing. But now I see how those ticketed under this horrible law are punished for seeking the same charity that many freely give during the office fundraising drive. Having been befriended by the very people I feared, now I stand in awe at what the poor have to carry, rather than in stand in judgment at how they carry it, to paraphrase Los Angeles gang pastor Greg Boyle.\n\nOf the many things that Queen\u2019s Park ought to do to improve the lives of people in pain, they can start by repealing the Safe Streets Act before its 15-year anniversary on Dec. 14. It\u2019s never too late to be what you might have been, said George Eliot, and it\u2019s never too late to repeal a rotten bill.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.333", "description": "The ruinous Safe Streets Act has been ticketing the homeless, the mentally ill, addicts and alcoholics for 15 years", "last-modified": "2014-11-27 05:09:46 EST", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "The ruinous Safe Streets Act has been ticketing the homeless, the mentally ill, addicts and alcoholics for 15 years", "title": "Squeegee law hurts the poor.
