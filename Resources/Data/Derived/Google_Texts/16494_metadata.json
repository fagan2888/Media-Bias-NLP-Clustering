They also passed the committee\u2019s 2016 budget proposal. Sen. Crapo\u2019s Operation Choke Point amendment will now go to the full Senate with the budget package for a vote. Debate in the Senate will begin at 2 p.m. on Monday.\n\nThe Daily Signal has exclusively learned that Sen. Mike Crapo will offer an amendment Thursday to the Senate\u2019s budget proposal that would defund the Justice Department\u2019s controversial program known as Operation Choke Point.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice must not politicize its enforcement policies, and we must not let Operation Choke Point become an end run around the Second Amendment by threatening the financial security of gun and ammunition manufacturers,\u201d said Crapo, R-Idaho, in a statement to The Daily Signal.\n\nIn Idaho, we have heard from several business owners involved in the guns and ammunition business who experienced difficulty finding essential banking services as a result of this fear and uncertainty on the part of the banks.\n\nCrapo\u2019s measure would be the strongest effort yet to shut down the program by creating a \u201cdeficit-neutral reserve fund\u201d that authorizes Congress to end Operation Choke Point in the future with fewer procedural hurdles.\n\nNorbert Michel, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s expert in financial regulations, said, \u201cThis is great news and shows that Congress is making progress toward stopping the program. Gun owners should be happy, but Choke Point targeted many lawful businesses outside of the gun industry.\u201d\n\nCrapo is a member of the Senate Budget Committee and was previously a ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, where he initiated his probe into Operation Choke Point.\n\nThe program was originally designed in 2013 as a way to stamp out consumer fraud, but has since come under fire for denying legal business owners access to the financial sector.\n\nThe introduction of Crapo\u2019s measure before the Senate Budget Committee will mark the first time since the start of Operation Choke Point that committee members will be forced to go on the record regarding their stance on the program.\n\nIf the Banking Committee approves Crapo\u2019s amendment, it would then move to the Senate floor for a full vote as an amendment to the budget proposal.\n\nCrapo has been an outspoken critic of Operation Choke Point.\n\nLast year, he released a statement saying the program \u201chas morphed into an attempt to shut down entire industries of law-abiding and legitimate merchants.\u201d He also sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder expressing \u201cstrong concerns\u201d about its impact on merchants, financial institutions and consumers.\n\nSince then, The Daily Signal has reported on multiple instances of banks and third-party payment processors suddenly refusing to do business with long-time customers\u2014all lawful business owners.\n\nMany of those business owners happen to sell guns.\n\nThe Justice Department, on the other hand, maintains that it has \u201cno interest in pursuing or discouraging lawful conduct.\u201d\n\nBut in 2011, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) created a list, subsequently adopted into Operation Choke Point, which labeled a range of both legal and illegal industries \u201chigh risk.\u201d The agency advised banks against doing business with those enterprises.\n\nNext Tuesday, FDIC officials will face questions before the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations about its involvement in Operation Choke Point and why citizens\u2014specifically in the firearms sector\u2014don\u2019t have access to some basic financial services.\n\nThe hearing will be led by Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., who told The Daily Signal his goals are to find out \u201cwho was involved,\u201d \u201chow high does it go,\u201d and whether \u201canyone has been held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe countless people who have been impacted by this deserve those answers,\u201d Duffy said.\n\nA group of House Republicans introduced similar legislation Tuesday also aiming to defund Operation Choke Point.\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect the Budget Committee\u2019s vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
