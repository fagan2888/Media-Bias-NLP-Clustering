The Dakotronics screens are worth $20 million, not $50 million as first reported.

A South Dakota company is sending a strong message at the Los Angeles Airport.

Daktronics installed $20 million in indoor video displays, which are part of a $50 million Integrated Environmental Media System (IEMS) program at the airport. It's made up of a series of screens, including an 84-foot tall welcome wall and a 75-foot wide destination board.

If you put all of the screens together, they total nearly 10,000 square feet.

You'll find them in the new Tom Bradley International Terminal, which opens later this month at LAX.
