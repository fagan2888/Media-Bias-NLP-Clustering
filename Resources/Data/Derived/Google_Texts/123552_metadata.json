Gov. John Kasich is expected to sign the bill, which will effectively end use of the cameras in Ohio.\n\nBut you\u2019ve probably heard about all those. Here are a few you may not know about:\n\nYou could see more health-care professionals volunteering in free clinics, thanks to House Bill 320. It grants immunity from civil liability to health-care professionals who volunteer to provide services in free clinics to those who qualify for \u2014 or are receiving \u2014 Medicaid. It also requires the Ohio Department of Health to maintain a directory and information on its website about free clinics.\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t know about free clinics, lawmakers named December as \u201cFree Clinic Appreciation Month\u201d and required ODH to promote them by selecting a \u201cfree clinic of the year\u201d and a \u201cfree clinic volunteer of the year.\u201d\n\nYoung adults might not be happy with House Bill 511 because it reduces the age limit for including children as dependents on their parent\u2019s health insurance policies. Current law in Ohio is 28, but the bill sets 26 as the maximum age.\n\nBut small business owners might like that the bill increases \u2014 from 25 to 30 \u2014 the number of hours an employee must work to qualify for small employer health benefit plans.\n\nCities and townships were happy to hear the bill clarifies the point that a volunteer fire fighter is not an employee for the purpose of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the House did not concur on changes the Senate made, but the main points of the bill were amended into a Senate measure.\n\nWhile they couldn\u2019t pass it in time for back-to-school shopping this year, Senate Bill 243 finally earned enough votes \u2014 and compromises \u2014 to set a sales tax holiday for 2015.\n\nThe bill will exempt sales of clothing, school supplies and instructional materials from the sales tax if purchased Aug. 7, 8, and 9, 2015.\n\nIt sets limits on the dollar amount for the exemptions: $75 for each article of clothing and $20 each for supplies and instructional material. And it\u2019s only for 2015. It will take another bill to extend the program or make it permanent.\n\nSince current laws on the use of tanning beds weren\u2019t enough, House Bill 131 was needed to further regulate the consent requirements for minors.\n\nThe bill says parents or legal guardians of kids at least 16 but not yet 18 must sign a consent form in the presence of a tanning facility employee. The consent will only be valid for 90 days, and the child cannot exceed 45 sessions during that 90-day time period.\n\nIf the child is younger than 16, a consent form must be signed at each visit, and the parent or guardian must be present for the duration of the tanning session.\n\nThe State Board of Cosmetology is tasked with adopting rules establishing procedures for tanning facility operators in making reasonable efforts to determine the age of an individual seeking to use sun lamp tanning services.\n\nFailure to make reasonable efforts to determine ages or not obtaining the consent form will result in a $500 fine on the tanning operator for a first offense. Fines for further offenses are to be set by the cosmetology board and could include suspension or revocation of their license or permit.\n\nThe bill expands the definition of tanning facility to include businesses that offer chemical applications, also known as spray-on, mist-on, or sunless tans, as well as those that use visible light for cosmetic purposes. Operators of such facilities will have to apply for a permit and renew it every two years.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "It was a busy lame duck session in the Ohio General Assembly as legislators scurried to pass a host of bills before adjourning for the year.", "title": "A busy lame duck session for Ohio lawmakers - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/john-kasich-state-of-ohio-2014-06-11-150x150.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-19T04:31:58+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/187702/ohio-lame-duck-session/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,lame duck,natural gas,Ohio,sales tax holiday,tanning", "published_time": "2014-12-19T04:00:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T04:31:58+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "It was a busy lame duck session in the Ohio General Assembly as legislators scurried to pass a host of bills before adjourning for the year.", "title": "A busy lame duck session for Ohio lawmakers - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/john-kasich-state-of-ohio-2014-06-11.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "It was a busy lame duck session in the Ohio General Assembly as legislators scurried to pass a host of bills before adjourning for the year."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f94\"", "article_summary": "By Maggie Thurber | For Ohio WatchdogIt was a busy lame duck session in the Ohio General Assembly as legislators scurried to pass a host of bills before adjourning.\nHere are a few you may not know about:You could see more health-care professionals volunteering in free clinics, thanks to House Bill 320.\nIt also requires the Ohio Department of Health to maintain a directory and information on its website about free clinics.\nJohn Kasich is expected to sign the bill, which will effectively end use of the cameras in Ohio.\nSince current laws on the use of tanning beds weren\u2019t enough, House Bill 131 was needed to further regulate the consent requirements for minors."}
