Then she got famous. A media firm, which had been tracking the progress of the private option, stayed in touch with Perkins and shot her story for an ad. At the start of January, voters in a special senate election saw Perkins, in her home, explaining how Obamacare actually did her good.\n\n\u201cBecause of my Parkinsons, I\u2019ve been denied health insurance for years,\u201d said Perkins into the camera. \u201cThanks for Arkansas\u2019s private option, I\u2019m covered now.\u201d Her story and the possible fate of Medicaid-deprived hospitals were framed as reasons to vote against Republican state Senate candidate John Cooper.\n\nMillions of dollars have been spent this year on Obamacare-related TV ads. Many of them featured people who look just like Perkins, but blamed the new law for ripping away their coverage at moments of ill health and weakness. Millions were spent in Florida\u2019s special House race, the one that Democrats blew a 20-point lead to lose, the one Republicans claim to have won by ripping apart Obamacare. Democrats, being Democrats, are hopelessly divided. Do they keep panicking and finessing the law, as candidate Alex Sink did in Florida? Or do they \u201cgo on offense\u201d and explain what would be lost if the Republicans won?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Perkins video appears to be an outlier\u2014the only ad in which Democrats defended the health care law by talking to someone who benefited from it. Steve Spencer, who shot the video, said it was easy to shoot but hard to find a taker for it.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThere are compelling stories out there,\u201d says Spencer, \u201cbut who can afford to air enough ads to balance the Koch brothers?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the irony: Democrats perfected this strategy, and Republicans have turned it against them. Americans for Prosperity, founded and partially funded by David and Charles Koch, has found tremendous success with its sob-story ads. When Democrats or fact-checkers have complained about them, they\u2019ve been accused of bullying \u201ccancer patients,\u201d and the search for victims has proceeded.\n\n\u201cSome we've seen from interviews on other news/media,\u201d says AFP spokesman Levi Russell. \u201cSome came to us directly, others we found through their congressman.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRepublicans, whose desires sync up nicely with AFP\u2019s, have crowd-sourced the effort. In January, House Republicans designed an online form to collect complaints from average Americans who hated the law, for whatever reason\u2014\u201chigher premiums,\u201d \u201clost coverage,\u201d \u201cwebsite problems.\u201d Democrats scoffed, but then more than a dozen Republicans showed up at the State of the Union with special guests\u2014real Americans who hated the health care law. In March, when Sen. Harry Reid started attacking the \u201cphony\u201d anti-Obamacare campaigns being funded by \u201cthe Koch brothers,\u201d Republicans accused him of demeaning real people suffering from the law he\u2019d never read.\n\n\u201cThere's no question that all the attacks have a chilling effect,\u201d says Russell. \u201cI've talked with a number of people with very compelling personal stories, but are nervous about speaking out. I have no doubt that is exactly the strategy from Reid and others who are working overtime to destroy the credibility of anyone willing to speak up.\u201d\n\nBut the Kochs, in the depths of their nefariousness, were just copping a trick from the Democrats. In 2012, the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA realized it would be outspent by Republicans\u2014the Koch brothers being the easiest to demonize\u2014and came up with a narrative strategy. Research director Brennan Bilberry, then just 26, tracked down workers who\u2019d felt victimized by Bain Capital\u2019s investments and sell-offs. They appeared on camera, and the resulting ads cut Romney so badly that he never recovered in Michigan or Ohio. Bilberry did the same for Terry McAuliffe\u2019s 2013 campaign for governor of Virginia, driving around coal country to find people who\u2019d lost out on a settlement approved by the Democrat\u2019s opponent.\n\n\u201cPolitical people hate to admit this, but the press is a good partner if you\u2019re looking for stories,\u201d says Bilberry. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been running campaigns for years, you probably can find people through local organizations, through your field team. They probably know people who\u2019ve been affected in a positive way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMaybe they do, but Democrats haven\u2019t figured out how to reach them. Take Families USA, the decades-old health care awareness organization, which regularly connects journalists to sources. Last October, Families USA received $1 million from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to finance more reporting, more vetting, more sharing of stories. That money helped Families USA expand its team of full-time vetters from one to three. It has not, so far, helped any Democrats running terrified from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe do not pass along stories to political campaigns,\u201d says Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA. \u201cWhen reporters are doing stories, we pass on leads\u2014that\u2019s what we call them\u2014if the individuals consent. But we do not ever send stories to political campaigns.\u201d\n\nThe campaigns will simply have to find the stories on their own. They\u2019ve done this before, and located blue-collar-looking people to make the argument for liberalism. Hey, they even did it with Obamacare, when a group called Know Your Care turned the story of one bagel shop owner into a happy cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 case study. But Know Your Care\u2019s been dormant for more than a year. Democrats need to find Obamacare success stories when few want to fund the work, during a midterm election when all the key races are on Republican turf, while the donors are already thinking about 2016.\n\n\u201cThere simply is no liberal Koch operation,\u201d complains Paul Begala, a former Clintonite and a strategist for Priorities USA in 2012. \u201cRather than a national ad campaign, which is not realistic, Dems should look to smart 2014 candidates to engage this issue along [these] lines. Once someone does it, and it works, others will replicate in their states/districts. Do I think Dems should respond to the Koch ads? Absolutely. But it is going to be a piecemeal response.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Why aren\u2019t Democrats running ads showcasing the people who have been helped by Obamacare?", "sailthru.tags": "Alex Sink, Alex Sink Florida 13th, Obamacare hurting Democrats, Obamacare hurting Democrats in midterms, Obamacare pulling down Democrats, Obamacare unpopular, Obamacare election loser, GOP Obamacare, GOP attacking Obamacare, Republicans attacking Obamacare", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Late last year, on the first day that Arkansans could buy into the state\u2019s \u201cprivate option\u201d for expanded Medicaid, a farmer named Mary Francis Perkins  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Late last year, on the first day that Arkansans could buy into the state\u2019s \u201cprivate option\u201d for expanded Medicaid, a farmer named Mary Francis Perkins  ...", "title": "Why Aren\u2019t Democrats Taking This Simple Approach to Defending Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/defending_obamacare_why_aren_t_democrats_using_the_approach_republicans.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/140317_POL_ObamacareVid.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Late last year, on the first day that Arkansans could buy into the state\u2019s \u201cprivate option\u201d for expanded Medicaid, a farmer named Mary Francis Perkins  ...", "creator": "@daveweigel", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/defending_obamacare_why_aren_t_democrats_using_the_approach_republicans.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/140317_POL_ObamacareVid.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "title": "Why Aren\u2019t Democrats Taking This Simple Approach to Defending Obamacare?", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-17T19:05:06Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Why Aren\u2019t Democrats Taking This Simple Approach to Defending Obamacare?", "sailthru.headline": "Obamacare\u2019s Next Top Model", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Why Aren\\u2019t Democrats Taking This Simple Approach to Defending Obamacare?\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/defending_obamacare_why_aren_t_democrats_using_the_approach_republicans.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/140317_POL_ObamacareVid.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100140317019\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-17T19:05:06Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"David Weigel\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"democrats\",\n    \"obamacare\",\n    \"republicans\",\n    \"politics\"\n  ]\n}", "fb-share": "Why Aren\u2019t Democrats Taking This Simple Approach to Defending Obamacare?", "tw-line": "Why Aren\u2019t Democrats Taking This Simple Approach to Defending Obamacare?", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://facebook.com/daveweigel"}, "keywords": "Alex Sink, Alex Sink Florida 13th, Obamacare hurting Democrats, Obamacare hurting Democrats in midterms, Obamacare pulling down Democrats, Obamacare unpopular, Obamacare election loser, GOP Obamacare, GOP attacking Obamacare, Republicans attacking Obamacare", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "Late last year, on the first day that Arkansans could buy into the state\u2019s \u201cprivate option\u201d for expanded Medicaid, a farmer named Mary Francis Perkins  ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/03/140317_POL_ObamacareVid.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2559\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe do not pass along stories to political campaigns,\u201d says Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA.\nLast October, Families USA received $1 million from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to finance more reporting, more vetting, more sharing of stories.\nThat money helped Families USA expand its team of full-time vetters from one to three.\nTake Families USA, the decades-old health care awareness organization, which regularly connects journalists to sources.\nDo I think Dems should respond to the Koch ads?"}
