South Bend is losing a restaurant that's called Western Avenue home for almost 20 years. Sunday will be Top Notch Family Restaurant & Bakery's last day.

Employees found out only a couple of days ago that the restaurant, located on the corner of Mayflower Road and Western Avenue, will shut its doors, manager Rosa Garcilaco said.

"It's sad seeing the restaurant go," she said. "It's like a home."

Garcilaco, who has worked at the restaurant for six years, said many customers have told her Top Notch is like a second home to them. Employees have become close to their regular customers, she said, and that's going to be one of the hardest parts about shutting down.

The restaurant is closing because of a new Martin's Super Market planned for the area, said Gus Bourounis, the owner's son. Last July, Martin's announced it would build a 40,000-square-foot store to replace its nearby Western Avenue location.

As part of its plans, Martin's purchased the property on which Top Notch sits. Bourounis expects the restaurant to be torn down. Martin's was not able to provide information on the planned use of the property.

"At this time, we can confirm we plan to build a new store. Additional details are not available," Cindy Kaplan, a Martin's spokeswoman, wrote in an email.

Although opening at a new location has been discussed, it's too early to know if Top Notch will return, Bourounis said.

"It's heartbreaking that after 20 years we have to close," he said
