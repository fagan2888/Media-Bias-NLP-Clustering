Which is we thought we were going into a surplus and we ended up in a shortage, or vice versa.\u201d\n\nThose warning of a shortage have a strong case. Not only are millions of Americans gaining coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but 10,000 baby boomers are becoming eligible for Medicare every day. And older people tend to have more medical needs.\n\n\u201cWe know essentially with the doubling of the population over the age of 65 over the course of a couple of decades, they\u2019re driving the demand for services,\u201d says Grover.\n\nIn addition to a numerical shortage, there\u2019s also a mismatch between what kind of doctors the nation is producing and the kind of doctors it needs, says Andrew Bazemore, a family physician with the Robert Graham Center.In addition to a numerical shortage, there\u2019s also a mismatch between what kind of doctors the nation is producing and the kind of doctors it needs, says Andrew Bazemore, a family physician with the Robert Graham Center, an independent project of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of our training in the northeastern part of our country, and it\u2019s not surprising that the largest ratio of physicians and other providers, in general, also appear in those areas,\u201d says Bazemore. \u201cWe have shown again and again that where you train matters an awful lot to where you practice.\u201d That ends up resulting in an oversupply in urban centers in the Northeast and an undersupply elsewhere.\n\nEven aside from geography, there are other questions, he says, such as \u201cdo the providers reflect the populations they serve? And that means by their race and ethnicity, by their age, by their gender?\u201d\n\nWhile few dispute the idea that there will be a growing need for primary care in the coming years, it is not at all clear whether all those primary care services have to be provided by doctors.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of services that can be provided by a lot of people other than primary care doctors,\u201d says Wilensky. That includes physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and even pharmacists and social workers.\n\n\u201cHow many physicians we \u2018need\u2019 depends entirely on how the delivery system is organized,\u201d Wilensky says. \u201cWhat we allow other health care professionals to do; whether they are reimbursed in a reasonable way that will increase the interest in having people go into those professions.\u201d\n\nCurrently, physicians who are specialists make considerably more than those who practice primary care, which many experts say is a huge deterrent to doctors becoming generalists, particularly when they have large medical school loans to pay off.\n\nAt the same time, \u201cteam-based care,\u201d in which a physician oversees a group of health professionals, is considered by many to be not only more cost-effective, but also a way to lower the number of doctors the nation needs to train.\n\n\u201cAll of the efforts to the future\u2026are to mold and morph our medical system into one that is less \u2018single-combat warriors\u2019 practicing medicine here and there, and physicians and others practicing in efficient systems,\u201d says Fitzhugh Mullan, a professor of medicine and health policy at George Washington University.\n\nUntil that happens, though, Atul Grover of the AAMC says the nation needs to be training far more physicians.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think we should put patients at risk by saying \u2018Let\u2019s not train enough doctors just in case everything lines up perfectly and we don\u2019t need them,\u2019\u201d Grover said in a recent appearance on C-SPAN.\n\nWilensky is among those who find that attitude wasteful. \u201cAre you really serious?\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about somebody who is potentially 12 to 15 years post high school, to invest in a skill set that we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re going to need?\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the individuals who could be at risk for wasteful spending. \u201cTraining another doctor isn\u2019t cheap,\u201d says Mullan. \u201cIsn\u2019t cheap for the individual doing the training, isn\u2019t cheap for the institution providing the education, and ultimately isn\u2019t cheap for the health system. Because the more doctors we have, the more activity there will be.\u201d\n\nPrinceton health economist Uwe Reinhardt points out that groups like the AAMC have a self-interest in saying there\u2019s a shortage, to move more money towards the medical schools and hospitals it represents.\n\n\u201cAnything that would move money their way they would favor,\u201d he says.\n\nReinhardt also says that a small shortage of physicians would probably be preferable to a surplus, because it would spur innovative ways to provide care.\n\n\u201cMy view is whatever the physician supply is, the system will adjust. And cope with it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if it gets really tight, we will invent stuff to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by Kaiser Health News with support from The SCAN Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many medical groups, led by the Association of American Medical Colleges, say there\u2019s little doubt. \u201cWe think the shortage is going to be close to 130,000 in the next 10 to 12 years,\u201d says Atul Grover, the group\u2019s chief public policy officer.
