Boehner said legal action is \u201can option that\u2019s very possible.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIf you read the provisions in [the congressional review law], it\u2019s pretty clear that the president has not complied,\u201d Boehner said Thursday during his weekly news conference. \u201cBecause it makes clear that any side agreements and any other type of an agreement \u2014 including those that do not directly involve us \u2014 must be turned over as part of it. I do not believe that he\u2019s complied.\u201d\n\nThe speaker said the agreement is \"worse than anything I could\u2019ve ever imagined.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have a pending lawsuit against Obamacare, which a judge ruled this week can proceed.\n\nCongress lacks the votes to stop the Iran agreement, but a lawsuit is one way for Boehner to prolong the fight over the nuclear accord. The House will vote Thursday and Friday on several pieces of legislation related to the pact, including an up-or-down vote on approving the deal, and another to rebuke Obama for not submitting so-called side deals between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran. The agreement will be in place by Sept. 17.\n\nBoehner also said the House might vote on disapproving the agreement, a move that would bring it in line with the Senate, which is set to vote Thursday on whether to proceed on a measure to disapprove of the pact.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "House Republicans have already sued over Obamacare.", "title": "Boehner: I might sue Obama over Iran deal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/john-boehner-barack-obama-sue-iran-nuclear-deal-213496", "image": "http://static.politico.com/49/f2/ce59a35a41ec8e596f490aff444d/150910-boehner-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "House Republicans have already sued over Obamacare.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca80b\"", "article_summary": "AP Photo Boehner: I might sue Obama over Iran dealSpeaker John Boehner said Thursday he might sue President Barack Obama again.\nThe Ohio Republican said Obama has not turned over the entirety of the Iran agreement for congressional review as mandated by law.\nCongress lacks the votes to stop the Iran agreement, but a lawsuit is one way for Boehner to prolong the fight over the nuclear accord.\nI do not believe that he\u2019s complied.\u201dThe speaker said the agreement is \"worse than anything I could\u2019ve ever imagined.\"\nHouse Republicans have a pending lawsuit against Obamacare, which a judge ruled this week can proceed."}
