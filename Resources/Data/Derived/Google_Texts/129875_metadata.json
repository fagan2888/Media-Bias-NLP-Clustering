The chemicals are also a common ingredient in fragrance used in personal care products such as soaps, shampoos, makeup and nail polishes.\n\nPhthalates can escape from products into dust and the air, entering the body through breathing, eating and skin contact. Some studies have found phthalates can disrupt male hormones early in life, while others have tied them to slowed brain development and immune system problems.\n\nThe chemicals already are banned in toys and products marketed to children under 3.\n\nEarlier this month, an advisory panel of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report recommending that the temporary ban on five phthalates used in children\u2019s toys be made permanent. The panel also noted that food, beverages and drugs lead to the highest exposures of some phthalates, rather than children\u2019s toys and personal care products. Phthalates are used in food processing and packaging.\n\nWhile the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found widespread phthalate exposure among Americans, it cautions that the health effects remain unknown. Finding detectable amounts of phthalates in the body doesn\u2019t mean that exposure will harm a person\u2019s health, according to the CDC.\n\nIn a Tuesday letter to Maine DEP Commissioner Patricia Aho, a group of 16 scientists and physicians argued that mounting evidence supports the conclusion that phthalates pose a danger to human health. Studies published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals link phthalate exposure to adverse effects on male sexual development and function, the immune system and behavior, they wrote.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the scientific basis for such action on phthalates is well founded, and that the lack of disclosure of phthalates in most consumer products presents a serious impediment to efforts to reduce human exposure, especially to vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and young children,\u201d wrote the group, which included Dr. Deborah Rice, a retired Maine CDC toxicologist.\n\nMaine DEP has identified several phthalates as \u201cchemicals of high concern\u201d under Maine\u2019s Toxics Chemical in Children\u2019s Products Law. Attendees of Tuesday\u2019s hearing asked DEP to give four of those chemicals \u201cpriority status\u201d under the act, a designation that would allow further regulatory action.\n\nThe proposed rule does not require labeling of products containing phthalates. Instead, manufacturers would report to the DEP, which would then post the information online for consumers.\n\nIn March, the Alliance for a Clean and Healthy Maine tested 25 Mainers, including several lawmakers, for phthalates in their blood. Each member tested positive, some at levels much higher than the national average.\n\nPaige Holmes, a 34-year-old mother of two young boys from Lisbon, said her jaw dropped when she learned she had the highest phthalates level of anyone in the group. She tries to avoid phthalates by using glass and stainless steel containers instead of plastic and switching out her vinyl shower curtain for a cloth one. She also buys organic and local foods and reads product labels to limit her family\u2019s exposure to chemicals.\n\n\u201cBut phthalates are not listed on the labels of products,\u201d she said at the hearing. \u201cIn fact, manufacturers use the term \u2018fragrance\u2019 on labels to hide any number of chemicals, including phthalates, which might be in the product. So, despite being an avid label reader, I am left in the dark, unable to protect my family from these harmful chemicals.\u201d\n\nJeff Gearhart, research director for the Ecology Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which has tested nearly 15,000 products for chemical hazards, called the proposal a \u201ccommon sense effort\u201d toward better understanding the prevalence of phthalates and human exposure to the chemicals.\n\nThe four phthalates under consideration are: di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, or DEHP; dibutyl phthalate, or DBP; benzyl butyl phthalate, or BBP; and diethyl phthalate, known as DEP.\n\nAll of the individuals signed up to speak at the 1 p.m. hearing supported the proposed rule.\n\nThe DEP will collect public comments on the proposal through Sept. 29. The agency then has 120 days to act on the proposal, but isn\u2019t required under law to take any action.\n\nJessamine Logan, a DEP spokeswoman, said the agency will consider the proposal as required by law and \u201creview all of the comments before making a decision.\u201d She said in May that the effects of phthalates on public health are still debated by the scientific community.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 More than 70 people called on the LePage administration Tuesday to require disclosure of potentially dangerous chemicals commonly found in consumer products.
