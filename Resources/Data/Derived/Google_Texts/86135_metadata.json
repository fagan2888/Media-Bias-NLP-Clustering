Think of it as a deep cavity search of your favorite local tunes, a staggeringly authoritative examination of what a song really means, often in ways that the songwriters themselves never considered. In reality, SONG-FREUD is a pro bono psychotherapy session available for public consumption. It is really important for society because therapy can be really expensive, isn\u2019t always covered by ObamaCare and can totally cut into your organic produce budget. Thus, SONG-FREUD is a public service. Thus, it is good karma to write, and thus, it is good karma to read.\n\n***\n\nIn the first installment of SONG-FREUD, we turn our collective piercing gaze to Toro Y Moi\u2019s delightful new song \u201cEmpty Nesters,\u201d the first taste of his upcoming LP What For? The upsettingly-catchy melodies may suggest that \u201cEmpty Nesters,\u201d a sweet tune full of allusions to high school idiosyncratic pastimes like listening to Weezer, writing bubble letters in notebooks and growing up, is cute and innocent and about making out in the backseat of a prototype Prius circa 2000. But, in reality, \u201cEmpty Nesters\u201d is clearly Chaz Bundick\u2019s testament to worldwide infertility rates.\n\nThe song starts on a positive enough note: the crack of a snare heralds the arrival of squiggly guitars and Bundick\u2019s upbeat melodies, yet it quickly turns ominous with the unsettling line \u201cAll those zeroes after this one,\u201d a distinct reference to negative pregnancy tests. This theory is only confirmed by Bundick\u2019s question \u201cDid you meet with your advisor?\u201d who is clearly a sex therapist. Singing in the first person, Bundick says \u201cMy baby wants me back before I even leave.\u201d Obviously, his \u201cbaby\u201d (a poignant and ironic word choice here) wants to take another stab at copulation, with the suggestion of pro-creation. The narrator\u2019s parents\u2019 nest is empty, and in a tragic twist of fate, the narrator\u2019s nest will remain empty too, which is confirmed by the line \u201cSo are you\u201d (that\u2019s what genius.com says he is singing, so it\u2019s probably true), and is likely a reference to a womb as warm and welcoming as Dick Cheney\u2019s gaze.\n\nYet perhaps this is still hope that things won\u2019t turn out like Children of Men. Lines like \u201cLet\u2019s try to make another year for the teens\u201d and incredibly erotic adjectives like \u201csmothered\u201d suggest virility. \u201cToro,\u201d the bull, is known in Egyptian mythology as a pseudo-god of fertility. But that allusion may simply be Bundick\u2019s use of irony, a literary technique often employed by critics of his work and clearly evident in his choice of eyewear.\n\nStream \"Empty Nesters\" below - Toro's new album What For? is out on April 7 on Carpark Records.\n\nTags: Toro y Moi", "article_metadata": {"description": "SONG-FREUD is a new weekly column that finds cold hard truth hidden between the verse and the chorus.
