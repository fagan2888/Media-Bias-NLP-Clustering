John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), who chairs the panel\u2019s subcommittee on cybersecurity, infrastructure protection and security technologies.\n\nThe DHS has played an increasingly important role in the government\u2019s cybersecurity effort over the last year.\n\nCongress late last year passed a series of bills that strengthened the agency\u2019s cyber workforce and codified certain aspects of the DHS cybersecurity mission.\n\nLawmakers are currently considering more bills that would further clarify the agency\u2019s cyber role while strengthening its authority to proactively investigate and defend federal networks across the government.\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee is also drafting a bill that would transform the NPPD.\n\nMcCaul said the committee would soon hold hearings as lawmakers work to draft the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the department's input and look forward to working closely with them on streamlining NPPD's structure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe committee\u2019s bill would rename the NPPD to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection. It would also create two positions to oversee the new wing: a deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity and a deputy undersecretary for infrastructure protection.\n\n\u201cI'd certainly like to see DHS enhance and prioritize NPPD's cyber mission,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cBut I hope DHS will recognize that NPPD's mission is critical and that partnering with Congress, rather than obstruction, will produce a stronger, more effective outcome.\u201d\n\nA DHS spokesman defended the agency's efforts in a statement late Thursday.\n\n\"NPPD is in the planning process of an initiative to become a more unified, agile, and effective organization to better meet the Nation\u2019s needs not only today, but in the future,\" said S.Y. Lee. \"We will closely coordinate these efforts with internal and external stakeholders as we move forward.\"\n\n\u2014 Updated 6:32 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lawmakers say they've been kept in the dark as the DHS reorganizes its departments.", "description": "Lawmakers say they've been kept in the dark as the DHS reorganizes its departments.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lawmakers say they've been kept in the dark as the DHS reorganizes its departments.", "title": "Lawmakers accuse DHS of stonewalling on cybersecurity plans", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/254096-lawmakers-accuse-dhs-of-stonewalling-on-cyber-plans", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mccaulmichael_120214gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-17T18:32:48-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-09-17T18:32-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/254096-lawmakers-accuse-dhs-of-stonewalling-on-cyber-plans", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-17T16:45-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Michael McCaul, John Ratcliffe,DHS", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-17T16:45:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T18:32:48-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/254096-lawmakers-accuse-dhs-of-stonewalling-on-cyber-plans", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lawmakers say they've been kept in the dark as the DHS reorganizes its departments.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers accuse DHS of stonewalling on cybersecurity plans"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmakers accuse DHS of stonewalling on cybersecurity plans"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers are accusing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of stonewalling Congress about a proposed reorganization of a government division that helps protect federal networks.\nADVERTISEMENTBut the agency is keeping lawmakers in the dark about their plans, members of the House Homeland Security Committee said in a letter sent to the agency.\nCongress late last year passed a series of bills that strengthened the agency\u2019s cyber workforce and codified certain aspects of the DHS cybersecurity mission.\n\u201cI'd certainly like to see DHS enhance and prioritize NPPD's cyber mission,\u201d Ratcliffe said.\n\u201cDHS has provided limited information to Congress on this key matter,\u201d Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said in a statement."}
