HANOI, Vietnam (AP) - President Barack Obama has lifted the arms export embargo on Vietnam, in an attempt to shore up the communist country in its territorial dispute with an increasingly aggressive China.

U.S. lawmakers and activists had urged Obama to press for greater human rights freedoms before lifting the embargo.

Washington partially lifted the embargo on arms in 2014, but Vietnam wanted full access as it tries to deal with China's land reclamation and military construction in the disputed South China Sea. Obama is spending three days in Vietnam.
