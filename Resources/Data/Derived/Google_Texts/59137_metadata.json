They will now represent South Dakota in the Regional Tournament.\n\nAfter trailing Humbolt 2-0 early in the Class \"B\" championship game, McCook/Miner went on to outscore their rivals 17 to 3 en route to hoisting the trophy. Skipper Derrin Miller led his squad to a 24-8 record this summer and says he knew from day one his team was capable of finishing on top.\n\n\"The first game,\" Miller exclaimed. \"I had complete confidence in them the whole season. They play so well together and of course we were hosting state, so we knew we would be here. I thought we had as good of a shot as anybody to win this,\" he said.\n\nOne reason Miller was confident in his team was their leader. Luke Loudenburg capped off his prep career by adding a baseball title to his football and wrestling titles earlier in the year. Mister do it all hit .455 with three runs batted and ten runs scored. He also pitched a complete game in the championship, earning him Tournament M.V.P.\n\n\"It's an honor to get that,\" Loudenburg said. \"I couldn't do it without my teammates, but being able to step up in the big times, closing the games, and getting hits when I need to feels amazing,\" he added.\n\n\"Luke excels at everything he does. He's fast and he has a good head. He is just always on top of his game, not just baseball, but any game. He's a stud and he will be missed,\" Miller said.\n\nCoach Miller still has a few more games to enjoy his boys. McCook/Miner will now represent South Dakota in the Central Plains Regional D-II Tournament this weekend in LeSeur, Minnesota.\n\n\"I don't really know much about it, but there will be stiff competition. We will see how it goes. We will play our best and see what happens,\" Miller said.\n\nClick here for more information on the Central Plains Regional Tournament.\n\nHigh School {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
