However, lean practices and data analytics, proven successful in other industries like automobile manufacturing, are now transforming healthcare.\n\nClick to tweet this news.\n\nLeanTaaS Inc., a healthcare analytics software company, today released the LeanTaaS ROI Calculator to help its customers and prospects \u2014 hospitals, cancer centers and infusion clinics \u2014 estimate and then measure the performance impact of applying LeanTaaS iQueue to a cancer center\u2019s infusion operations. By deploying iQueue for Infusion, LeanTaaS customers have been able to serve 20 percent more patients at lower costs while reducing patient wait times more than 30 percent. The average annual per chair financial margin improvement of using iQueue for Infusion is $20,000. So, an infusion center with 30 chairs should be able to improve its bottom line by an estimated $600,000.\n\nThe LeanTaaS ROI Calculator can be found at http://leantaas.com/iqueue_for_infusion/roi-calculator.\n\nHealthcare Operations Are Like Playing Tetris\n\n\u201cRunning an optimized healthcare operation doesn\u2019t mean adding more chairs or hiring more nurses,\u201d explained Mohan Giridharadas, founder and CEO at LeanTaaS. \u201cIt\u2019s playing Tetris with very large numbers well.\u201d\n\nCase in point: A typical daily pattern in an infusion center is that the day starts slow, then things get really busy in the middle of the day, and then it slows down again.\n\nUnderlying this pattern are the three bigger systemic problems:\n\nLong patient wait times, which translate to unhappy patients and overworked nurses\n\nFewer patients served, which results from underutilized resources\n\nHigher labor costs, due to increased staffing levels during peak periods\n\nOver the last couple of years, LeanTaaS has worked with several infusion centers on solving this problem. Solving it requires moving from a peak \u201ctriangular\u201d profile of chair utilization to a level-loaded, flatter \u201ctrapezoid\u201d profile, similar to strategically playing Tetris. Getting to this flatter utilization profile can help healthcare organizations serve 20 percent more patients with reduced labor costs on a per-treatment basis, similar to winning at Tetris. The aggregate financial impact can be as much as $20,000 per chair per year.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get to a flat utilization profile and see more patients every day, you need to steer patient appointments into a precise \u201cfingerprint\u201d pattern that is unique for each center for each hour of each day,\u201d added Giridharadas.\n\nHow to Win at Tetris \u2014 and Healthcare Operations\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in understanding and employing the game of Tetris. If an institution can \u201cslot\u201d all treatments in a day perfectly without any \u201cgaps,\u201d underutilization would be avoided in the mornings and evenings, and overutilization would be avoided in the afternoons. That means more unlocked capacity (and hence, more patients seen), higher revenue, less operational cost, and happy patients and providers.\n\nOptimizing Patient Scheduling Frees Up Capacity and Has Large Benefits\n\nFirst Step: Mine the pattern of prior appointments in order to develop a realistic estimate of the volume and mix of appointment types for each day of the week going forward.\n\nSecond Step: Impose the real operational constraints in the clinic (e.g., the hours of operation, doctor and nurse schedules, the number of chairs, various \u201crules\u201d that depend on clinic schedules, as well as patient-centric policies such as treatments longer than four hours should be assigned to a bed and not a chair).\n\nThird Step: Constraint-based optimization techniques can be applied to create the optimal \u201cfingerprint pattern\u201d of \u201cslots,\u201d which reflects the number of appointments for each duration for each hour of each day of the week.\n\nIn the case of an infusion center, that means a revised scheduling template that helps schedulers see how many one-hour duration, three-hour duration and five-hour duration slots can be made available at each possible start time.\n\nDoing this optimally results in moving the chair utilization graph from the \u201ctriangle\u201d that peaks somewhere between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. to a \u201ctrapezoid\u201d that ramps up smoothly between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., stays mostly flat from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. and then ramps down smoothly from 4:00 p.m. onward.\n\nEstimating the Potential Impact from \u201cPlaying Tetris Right\u201d\n\nDrawing on a mid-sized North American university infusion center, the following facts were collected:\n\n30 infusion chairs\n\n$300 reimbursement per treatment\n\n70 treatments on a typical weekday\n\n8 nurses on the floor in the middle of a typical weekday\n\n20 percent overtime pay on average\n\n$80,000 salary per year per nurse\n\n10 percent growth in projected patient volumes per year\n\nAfter running the LeanTaaS ROI Calculator, a Tetris-approach to patient scheduling was measured to deliver the following operational improvements:\n\n20 percent higher patient volumes 30 percent reduction in patient wait times at the peak $546,000 increase in revenue $128,000 reduced labor costs from dramatically lowering overtime levels $674,000 total savings ($22,466 per chair per year)\n\n\u201cOptimized slotting or \u2018level loading\u2019 of patients, if done right, can be the easiest way to improve patient access and your bottom line \u2014 driving more revenue by avoiding underutilization and reducing operational cost by avoiding overutilization,\u201d concluded Giridharadas.\n\nFor more information about LeanTaaS, please visit http://www.leantaas.com.
