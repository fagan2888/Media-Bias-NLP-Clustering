(Photo: Jenna Esarey, Special to the CJ)Buy Photo\n\nStorm Troopers roamed the book stacks while a Tusken Raider shared fist bumps with children at the Star Wars Day event at New Albany-Floyd County Public Library on Saturday.\n\nNearby, Jim and Wendi Merkle dressed up as Darth Vader and Princess Leia and worked with their own little storm trooper, son Colton, 4, crafting a copy of the Millennium Falcon out of paper plates.\n\nIt may have been held in the children\u2019s section, but the \"Star Wars\" characters in full costume appealed to adults as well.\n\n\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 is going to be so mad he didn\u2019t come,\u201d said Austayia Martell after posing for a quick photo with a gaggle of characters from the Star Wars universe. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know this was happening today, so he didn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\nA variety of \"Star Wars\" themed games and activities kept the kids busy, while adults filled the Strassweg Auditorium for a talk by local author David West Reynolds on The Archaeology of \"Star Wars\".\n\nReynolds has written several \"Star Wars\" reference books, including \u201cStar Wars: the Visual Dictionary,\u201d and he worked for franchise creator George Lucas at his Skywalker Ranch before returning to his native New Albany.\n\nAs a newly minted archaeology Ph.D. in 1995, Reynolds challenged himself to locate the lost shooting locations from Star Wars Episode IV in Tunisia.\n\n\u201cNo one had kept records,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knew the movies were going to be a hit. I went looking for them as a test of my skills as an archaeologist.\u201d\n\nAfter locating the sites, Reynolds was hired by Lucas Films to both share his findings of the original locations and to scout new locations for \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\"\n\nStar Wars costuming groups Rebel Legion and 501st Legion provided realistic costumed characters for the event. The groups make regular public appearances for community and charitable events.\n\n\u201cI told you there\u2019d be storm troopers here!\u201d said Skylar McCall, 10, as she bounced excitedly while collecting autographs from the characters.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a big fan,\u201d said her mother, Erin McCall. \u201cShe\u2019s seen all the movies and couldn\u2019t wait to get here today.\u201d\n\nJon Reiter brought his daughter Tess, 6, in full Princess Leia costume.\n\n\u201cShe loves all the 'Star Wars' movies,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the female characters are really great role models.\u201d\n\nReynolds said he believes the appeal of the \"Star Wars\" movies is universal.\n\n\u201c'Star Wars' went beyond entertainment into being myth,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone could identify with things the characters were feeling; the worries that we\u2019re not good enough. Despite all the sci-fi dressing, there was a real story there.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1OAyOOe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Storm Troopers roamed the book stacks at the Star Wars Day event at New Albany-Floyd County Public Library on Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Storm Troopers roamed the book stacks at the Star Wars Day event at New Albany-Floyd County Public Library on Saturday.", "title": "New Albany 'Star Wars' party draws on the force", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2016/01/02/new-albany-star-wars-party-draws-force/78135910/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Storm Troopers roamed the book stacks at the Star Wars Day event at New Albany-Floyd County Public Library on Saturday.", "title": "New Albany 'Star Wars' party draws on the force", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6472b9ebe1a2b58bf9521247eab6459cf84ea52f/c=134-0-667-533&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/02/Louisville/Louisville/635873467623105320-star-wars-1.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Star Wars", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Star Wars", "title": "New Albany 'Star Wars' party draws on the force", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fd588f0f44b12068efa2339672115e3a8a4c410/c=200-0-600-533/local/-/media/2016/01/02/Louisville/Louisville/635873467623105320-star-wars-1.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/638654ae1d20bc87a2eaa76ee81d38cdcabce667/c=134-0-667-533/local/-/media/2016/01/02/Louisville/Louisville/635873467623105320-star-wars-1.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ee898962cb398c195bec3682dfd24603091a0c6/c=46-0-755-533/local/-/media/2016/01/02/Louisville/Louisville/635873467623105320-star-wars-1.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c205ae106f6dc10a3d7c64ecce13ccd5b7f72574/c=0-41-800-493&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/02/Louisville/Louisville/635873467623105320-star-wars-1.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-02T20:18:57.447000-05:00", "shorthed": "New Albany Star Wars party draws on the force", "articleid": 78135910, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/02b520e98a6300feb44450e90e5ee0de1215e42e/c=0-41-800-493/local/-/media/2016/01/02/Louisville/Louisville/635873467623105320-star-wars-1.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6f265bb877f5a99cdf1006af2b0b9384d009cfcd/c=251-0-549-533/local/-/media/2016/01/02/Louisville/Louisville/635873467623105320-star-wars-1.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "new albany, star wars,  David West Reynolds, George Lucas,"}, "article_summary": "It may have been held in the children\u2019s section, but the \"Star Wars\" characters in full costume appealed to adults as well.\nReynolds has written several \"Star Wars\" reference books, including \u201cStar Wars: the Visual Dictionary,\u201d and he worked for franchise creator George Lucas at his Skywalker Ranch before returning to his native New Albany.\nBuy Photo Tess Reiter, 6, dresses as Princess Leia for Star Wars Day at the New Albany-Floyd County Library on Saturday.\n\u201cShe loves all the 'Star Wars' movies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAll the female characters are really great role models.\u201dReynolds said he believes the appeal of the \"Star Wars\" movies is universal."}
