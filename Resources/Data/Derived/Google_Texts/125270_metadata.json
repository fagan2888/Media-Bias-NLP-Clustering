With that in mind, the Washington Nationals right-hander took a slightly different approach in his second spring training outing.\n\n\u201cI was actually setting guys up, pitching the way I normally would during the season, and for the most part it went well,\u201d Zimmermann said.\n\nIt was a pretty good day for Washington\u2019s hitters, too: The Nationals had seven extra-base hits \u2014 including two doubles by Ryan Zimmerman \u2014 in a 9-2 victory over Detroit on Wednesday.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bryce Harper\u2019s own predictions for Nationals put pressure on him to keep up\n\nZimmermann, who will be a free agent after the 2015 season, went 2 2/3 innings, giving up one run on two hits while striking out four. Unlike his first outing, he was able to command his fastball better, even getting Detroit\u2019s Jefry Marte looking at a called third strike to end the second inning.\n\n\u201cHe must have been looking for something else, because it was down, but it was still [on] the inner third [of the plate],\u201d Zimmermann said.\n\nZimmerman had two RBI, Matt Skole hit a two-run home run and Drew Vettleson added a solo home run for Washington. Wilmer Difo had a double and a triple and scored twice, starting in place of Anthony Rendon, who was scratched from the lineup just before the game because of bruising on one of his knees.\n\nWhile he got knocked around a little bit, David Price said he felt good after his second spring outing. Price lasted just two innings, giving up four runs on four extra-base hits.\n\nHe threw 54 pitches and said after two spring starts he is \u201cgetting into the swing of things.\u201d\n\nThe left-hander didn\u2019t have a good feel for his curveball, but said everything else was working. He just needs to execute his pitches better.\n\n\u201cMy cutter was OK,\u201d Price said. \u201cMy changeup was down for the most part. Curveball, didn\u2019t really have a good feel for it. My fastball was, I guess, up in the zone a little bit, but I made some pretty good pitches with it as well. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201d\n\nZimmermann, meanwhile, enjoys the freedom facing teams the Nationals won\u2019t see during the season. \u201cYou definitely want to face a couple of American League teams [in spring training],\u201d Zimmermann said. \u201cThese guys aren\u2019t going to see us, and we\u2019re not going to see them, so it\u2019s good not having to hold anything back and just going right after them.\u201d\n\nTigers catcher Alex Avila was pulled after the first inning with lower back stiffness. It\u2019s the second time this spring that Avila\u2019s back has tightened up. The first came on Feb. 27 and forced him to miss several workouts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as the last time, but he won\u2019t play tomorrow,\u201d Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.\n\nThe Nationals will face the New York Mets on Thursday, who are scheduled to start rookie of the year Jacob deGrom. Outfielder Nate McLouth will make his first start of the spring, but it will be as the designated hitter.\n\nMcLouth, who went 1-for-2 Wednesday in his spring debut, is still on a throwing program as he recovers from offseason shoulder surgery. If all goes well, he should return to the field sometime next week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was a pretty good day for Washington's hitters, too: The Nationals had seven extra-base hits \u2014 including two doubles by Ryan Zimmerman \u2014 in a 9-2 victory over the Tigers on Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It was a pretty good day for Washington\u2019s hitters, too: The Nationals had seven extra-base hits \u2014 including two doubles by Ryan Zimmerman \u2014 in a 9-2 victory over the Tigers on Wednesday.", "title": "Jordan Zimmerman strikes out four in second spring training start", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/11/jordan-zimmerman-strikes-out-four-second-spring-tr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/06/5b2494d779ec020a700f6a7067003b1a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/06/5b2494d779ec020a700f6a7067003b1a.jpg", "description": "It was a pretty good day for Washington's hitters, too: The Nationals had seven extra-base hits \u2014 including two doubles by Ryan Zimmerman \u2014 in a 9-2 victory over the Tigers on Wednesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jordan Zimmerman strikes out four in second spring training start"}, "Author": "Carl Kotala", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jordan Zimmermann, National Party Of Australia, Detroit Tigers, David Price"}, "article_summary": "With that in mind, the Washington Nationals right-hander took a slightly different approach in his second spring training outing.\nWhile he got knocked around a little bit, David Price said he felt good after his second spring outing.\nIt\u2019s part of the process.\u201dZimmermann, meanwhile, enjoys the freedom facing teams the Nationals won\u2019t see during the season.\n\u201cYou definitely want to face a couple of American League teams [in spring training],\u201d Zimmermann said.\nOutfielder Nate McLouth will make his first start of the spring, but it will be as the designated hitter."}
