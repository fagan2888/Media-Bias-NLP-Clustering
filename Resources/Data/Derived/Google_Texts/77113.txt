Tian Tian rolled around and frolicked in the deep snowfall.

Panda cub Bei Bei was not impressed with the snow National Zoo caretakers placed in his den Saturday. The cub walked through the bucket of snow for only a moment before snacking on some bamboo.

His father on the other hand had a blast in his habitat!

He is kept in a separate habitat from his young cub and its mother.
