Wade being \u201cnuanced and thoughtful\u201d (not even close), and \u201cemotionally manipulative buzzwords like \u2018sanctity of life\u2019\u201d (unlike totally objective language like \u201creproductive rights\u201d or \u201canti-choice\u201d) \u201cand \u2018vulnerable\u2019\u201d (because fetuses can defend themselves from an abortionists\u2019 forceps after all?), Erdreich argues the ban \u201cisn\u2019t pro-life\u201d because its authors just don\u2019t appreciate how hard abortion-seekers have it:\n\nGraham and his anti-choice allies [\u2026] don\u2019t talk about the reasons that a woman would decide to terminate in the late second trimester and third trimester of her pregnancy, even in the face of such significant financial and geographic challenges. In many cases, the decision is driven by health concerns: either the woman\u2019s health is at risk, or the fetus has abnormalities that are incompatible with life (many of which can not be diagnosed until the second trimester). Other reasons hint at equally complex personal struggles: rape survivors that have been in denial about their pregnancies, women that are in domestic violence situations, mothers that didn\u2019t plan to terminate but experienced job loss or other disruptions during the course of their pregnancies.\n\nFirst, I love pro-abortion blog posts that are helpful enough to refute themselves. Erdreich cites \u201crape survivors\u201d even though her own second paragraph admits that \u201cthe bill would allow for termination in cases of rape.\u201d Seriously, TPM: do you guys even have editors?\n\nSecond, as we\u2019ve noted before, the heroic baby-butchers themselves list conditions like Down syndrome and dwarfism among the very \u201cabnormalities\u201d that we\u2019re supposed to believe make these abortions tragic yet unavoidable necessities.\n\nThird, whenever we\u2019re presented with lists of special situations like this, it\u2019s illuminating to substitute abort a fetus with, say, suffocate a one-year-old. If killing still sounds okay to you after that\u2026well, then please seek psychiatric help as far away from me as possible. At least two states away would be nice.\n\nBut if not \u2013 of course \u201cexperienced job loss\u201d isn\u2019t a good reason to kill my daughter! \u2013 then you\u2019ve just admitted that those circumstances aren\u2019t why you support abortion after all \u2013 that they\u2019re just \u201cemotionally manipulative buzzwords.\u201d You really support abortion because you see some fundamental difference between the two victims, and that is the point of contention an honest pro-abortion debater would stick to.\n\nThe odds of Graham\u2019s bill passing the Senate, much less being signed into law by President Obama, are miniscule. But introducing this bill and demanding that it be put to a vote does more than divert lawmakers\u2019 time away from more pressing matters. It also stands as one more way that anti-choice politicians broadcast their distaste for women making their own healthcare decisions, one more way that they do not trust women to know what is best for themselves and their families.\n\nYawn. The sexism slander is getting so clich\u00e9d that I think I\u2019m running out of things to say about it. You and I know it\u2019s not true, and more importantly, so does Erdreich. But at this point it\u2019s become such an integral part of the pro-abortion script that any screed would seem incomplete without it.\n\nLindsey Graham and his supporters are using discredited science and sheer arrogance to single out the most rare form of abortion in the hopes of scoring political points, because that rallies their party in a way that few other issues can\u2013and in a way that the GOP, still reeling from the shutdown debacle, would like right now.\n\nHeaven knows I\u2019ve never been a Graham fan, but exposing where our elected officials stand on protecting our young from one of the cruelest subsets of abortion is an entirely appropriate public service. Besides, we could just as easily say the same about Sen. Richard Blumenthal\u2019s new pro-abortion bill targeting state pro-life laws \u2013 we all know it\u2019s dead on arrival in the House, and Democrats are more than reeling over the spectacular embarrassment of ObamaCare\u2019s roll-out, making their proposal little more than red meat for a disillusioned left-wing base.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially all Erdreich\u2019s writing amounts to, too \u2013 recycled clich\u00e9s that can\u2019t bear the slightest logical scrutiny and won\u2019t guide anyone to better understanding, ethics, or policies, but are only meant to reassure the faithful that their self-absorbed priorities and persecution complexes remain secure.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "10 Like10 Tweet0 +10Having beaten up Republicans for a few posts in a row, it\u2019s time to return to the other side of the political spectrum.
