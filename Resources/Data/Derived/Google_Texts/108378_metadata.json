Robert Bentley to agree to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, as they have for the last two years.\n\nThey say it would provide 325,000 Alabamians with health coverage and would stimulate the economy, create jobs and help resolve the state's budget shortfall.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act allows federal funds to pay for most of the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty limit. That would be about $33,000 for a family of four.\n\nThe state's costs would rise too, but a study by health care economists at UAB concluded that expansion would generate enough new tax revenue to more than offset that.\n\nAnother study by Troy University's Manuel H. Johnson Center for Political Economy reached a different conclusion, finding that expansion would result in a net cost to the state.\n\nBentley opposes expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but has recently said his administration is exploring the idea of a applying for a federal block grant to expand Medicaid.\n\nBentley announced last week he would propose a $700 million tax increase during his State of the State address next week to address a projected shortfall in the state's General Fund.\n\nIn today's news release, the Democrats expressed concern about the burden of increased taxes on families and called for an end to loopholes that they say allow corporations to avoid taxes.\n\nDemocrats said they will work to prevent charter school legislation from reducing funding for public schools. The Republican majority has announced that it plans to pass legislation authorizing charter schools.\n\nCharter schools are publicly funded schools which operate under rules in a charter, rather than all the normal regulations of traditional public schools.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Quinton Ross, D-Montgomery, said he plans to sponsor a bill for universal pre-kindergarten in the state.\n\nPrison reform is expected to be a key topic during the legislative session.\n\nRelated to that, the Democrats plan to support creation of a social justice training program. It would include sensitivity training for law enforcement officers to fight profiling, as well as teaching young people about their legal rights.\n\nDemocrats hold only eight seats in the 35-member Senate, down from 11 last term.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Mike Cason | mcason@al.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Alabama Legislature 2015, news", "title": "Alabama Senate Democrats say Medicaid expansion again their top priority", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "The legislative session starts March 3.", "title": "Alabama Senate Democrats say Medicaid expansion again their top priority", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/02/alabama_senate_democrats_say_m.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/17097199-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The legislative session starts March 3.", "title": "Alabama Senate Democrats say Medicaid expansion again their top priority", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/17097199-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MikeCasonAL", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, February 23, 2015,  6:13 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, February 23, 2015,  6:13 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The legislative session starts March 3."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf244\"", "article_summary": "The Democratic minority in the Alabama Senate says Medicaid expansion is its top priority for the legislative session.\nRobert Bentley to agree to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, as they have for the last two years.\nCharter schools are publicly funded schools which operate under rules in a charter, rather than all the normal regulations of traditional public schools.\nThe Republican majority has announced that it plans to pass legislation authorizing charter schools.\nBentley opposes expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but has recently said his administration is exploring the idea of a applying for a federal block grant to expand Medicaid."}
