She intended to savor this moment by tending to her animals. Her colonoscopy was in an hour.\n\nShe walked through the kitchen and into the sprawling back yard, her new medical insurance card stowed in her pocket. Her silver rings and necklace sat in the house. She wasn\u2019t looking forward to a camera poking around in her large intestine. But she was overdue for it. She was 54. Her stomach had hurt for months and she had avoided seeing a doctor for years. But now she had insurance.\n\nThe back yard came alive with bleats and squawks. Stacy Benesh counted the chickens, making sure the fox from the nearby woods hadn\u2019t again raided overnight. \u201cCome on, girls,\u201d she said, coaxing out the skittish hens. A wild turkey scurried past. Tiny dogs ran underfoot. She greeted two llamas and a spotted saddle horse named Sedona. A goat named Gambler clanked his horns against a wire fence. Daylight washed higher over the Ozarkian hills.\n\n\u201cWe should probably go get this over with,\u201d Benesh said.\n\nIt was time. A colonoscopy is a common procedure. If Benesh\u2019s visit had been covered by private insurance or even Medicare or Medicaid, it would be unremarkable. Ho hum. But her medical insurance was made possible by the Affordable Care Act. The federal law, especially in this part of the country, is often called \u201cObamacare\u201d with a derisive twang.\n\nMissouri\u2019s Republican-led legislature has tried repeatedly to stop the legislation from taking root, including pushing back against an effort by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon to expand Medicaid. So Benesh\u2019s doctor\u2019s visit felt like an act imbued with political motive, a simple hospital trip transformed into a journey through the nation\u2019s caustic battle over health care. Floating above were big questions about the role of government and whether health care is a right.\n\nBenesh was aware of all this. But she cared only about finding out what was wrong was her gut.\n\nShe drove. The battered Prius bounced along the gravel road. Her partner of 24 years, Janet Weilbrenner, sat in the passenger seat, sipping iced tea.\n\nWeilbrenner asked Benesh if she remembered everything she needed. Benesh patted the pockets of her jean shorts. Yes.\n\nThese two were always together, side by side, in sickness and in health. They were known as \u201cJanet and Stacy\u201d or \u201cthe tie-dye girls,\u201d for the shirts they favored. They were artists who traveled the country selling their handmade copper turtles. They sold real animals, too, with a specialty in Nigerian dwarf goats.\n\n\n\nJanet Weilbrenner is photographed at her home in West Plains, Missouri.

(Photo by Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\n\nWeilbrenner and Benesh tended to stand out. \u201cJust two gay women in the Bible Belt,\u201d Weilbrenner said, laughing. But this rural town of 12,000 people, 30 miles from the Arkansas border, was home.\n\nThey\u2019d moved to West Plains 15 years ago, leaving behind Des Moines, Iowa, for a place they knew little about, except they could afford a 12-acre spread and the cost of living was low. The central location meant they could jump in their red pickup and white trailer to reach art fairs in the Midwest or along either coast, blowing past the antiabortion billboard posted outside of town showing a gift box filled with babies under the headline, \u201cGod\u2019s Stimulus Package.\u201d\n\nThey loved that there was a hospital in town. Ozark Medical Center had its own emergency room and specialists. That was important for Weilbrenner, 58, who has high blood pressure, and Benesh, who has multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia.\n\nThey always had health insurance, paying the $1,400-a-month premium, tolerating the $5,000 annual deductible. It was a big expense. They saved money where they could. Art fairs in the Southwest would turn into cross-border dashes, with Weilbrenner and Benesh loading up on cheaper prescriptions in Mexico for themselves and their animals.\n\nThen the recession hit. Makers of \u201cnon-functional eye candy\u201d did not fare well, Weilbrenner said. The market vanished for their $400 turtle sculptures and $1,000 longhorn skulls. Business stumbled and kept falling. They stopped buying the local newspaper. They cut back on cable. They stopped eating out at El Charro, where they had enjoyed Margarita Mondays.\n\nAnd then, for the first time in their lives, they dropped their health insurance.\n\nThey tried to artfully manage their medical needs.\n\n\u201cFor years,\u201d Benesh recalled, \u201cwe almost never went to the doctor for fear they\u2019d find something wrong.\u201d\n\nCoughs and fevers were medicated at home. When Benesh blew out her knee while moving a hay bale, she saw a doctor but didn\u2019t go through with the referral to an orthopedic specialist. She found a $100 knee brace on eBay and lived with a limp, instead. And when a doctor pushed Benesh to get an MRI a couple of years ago, she did so, but regretted it because they\u2019re still paying off the bill. They made friends with the staff at the local low-cost medical clinic, giving them fresh eggs from their hens. Weilbrenner was convinced the eggs were the reason the clinic offered her an unexpected opening for a free pre-diabetic eye exam.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit like egg insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nThen they traded egg insurance for ACA insurance.\n\nThey each pay $100 a month in premiums, with a $500 annual deductible. There\u2019s a prescription benefit, too. Shortly after the insurance kicked in with the new year, Benesh made a doctor\u2019s appointment. She was so proud that she danced into her doctor\u2019s office, waving her insurance card. That\u2019s when she complained to the doctor about her stomach. After a round of antibiotics and an ultrasound of her gall bladder, the doctor recommended she have a colonoscopy.\n\nThe hospital seemed asleep as Weilbrenner and Benesh walked past an empty front desk, down one hall and up another before running into a hospital worker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to have a colonoscopy this morning,\u201d Benesh said.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d the hospital worker said. \u201cI can help you.\u201d\n\nThey sat in a little cubicle.\n\n\u201cBlue Cross is your insurance, is that correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just got insurance January 1,\u201d Benesh replied, beaming.\n\nSoon, Benesh disappeared behind swinging doors labelled \u201cGI lab.\u201d Weilbrenner sat in a seven-chair waiting room. Magazines lined one wall. A bulletin board advertised meetings for enrolling in the Missouri Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\nA wave of publicity had swept across the state encouraging people to sign up. In the rural region served by the Ozark Medical Center, there were radio and newspaper ads, plus four health-care navigators to counsel residents on what to do. But the hospital never saw a hoped-for influx of new patients, despite only a quarter of its clients carrying private insurance. The problem was the county was too poor.\n\nBecause Missouri is among the states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s a coverage gap. The working poor are the ones left out, said hospital spokeswoman Gay Watson. They either didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or thought they couldn\u2019t afford coverage under the Affordable Care Act, Watson said. The hospital, along with the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, has pushed for state lawmakers to expand Medicaid. A few weeks before Benesh\u2019s visit, West Plains had served as the backdrop for Nixon to ask lawmakers to change their minds.\n\nIn the hospital waiting room, the minutes ticked by. Weilbrenner wondered how much the colonoscopy would cost, knowing they never would\u2019ve gotten this far without insurance. Benesh would\u2019ve just ridden out the pain at home. During the five years they were uninsured, every ache or pain was a threat. They imagined losing their home, their animals, their business.\n\n\u201cThe fear of one of us getting sick was always there,\u201d Weilbrenner said. \u201cA huge stress.\u201d\n\nNow, they felt as though they could manage. Visits to the doctor and the hospital might still be expensive, but they had help. Medical calamities might still come, but they would not be financially devastating. And something was wrong with Benesh. They just didn\u2019t know what.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything bad for her, but I would like some kind of identification of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Weilbrenner said.\n\nThe procedure took less than an hour. At 8:20 a.m., a nurse came out to get Weilbrenner.\n\n\u201cSo she survived?\u201d\n\nShe did.\n\nAnd then they were going home. Benesh sat in a wheelchair, talking about the weather and the need for rain with a hospital volunteer pushing her down the hall. Weilbrenner walked beside them. The hospital hummed with doctors and nurses.\n\nWeilbrenner got the car.\n\n\u201cI think a nap\u2019s in order,\u201d Benesh said.\n\nIn the car, Benesh laid out the results. No polyps. No tumors. No signs of cancer. A biopsy was performed to look for colitis. But the doctor found no clear sign of what was causing her pain. The news was comforting, but also frustrating. At least it wasn\u2019t cancer, Weilbrenner said. Benesh said her primary-care doctor probably would want to examine her right ovary to see if it was the culprit.\n\n\u201cBut apparently I\u2019m good to go,\u201d Benesh said.\n\nThe car danced on the rutted road. Soon, Benesh, woozy and worn out, would head back to bed. Weilbrenner would sit at the computer to plan out the summer\u2019s art fairs. The animals in the back yard would need tending. And weeks later, they would learn that their insurance company had been billed $5,583 for colonoscopy.\n\n\u201cSee, you were basically okay,\u201d Weilbrenner said now as they drove. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nShe patted her partner\u2019s hand, wrapped in pink gauze.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Weilbrenner added, \u201cwe just got to get your ovary checked out.\u201d\n\nThat meant another trip to the doctor, another chance to use their insurance, another hunt for a diagnosis. More to come.\n\nBut their fear, at least, was gone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act has been controversial -- but it's changing the many small health decisions that make up everyday life.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Affordable Care Act has been controversial -- but it's changing the many small health decisions that make up everyday life.", "title": "The simple ways health insurance can change your life", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/09/simple-ways-health-insurance-can-change-your-life/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/14/Others/Images/2014-08-14/storyline 16531408027513.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@tcfrankel"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/09/simple-ways-health-insurance-can-change-your-life/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, health care"}, "article_summary": "A bulletin board advertised meetings for enrolling in the Missouri Health Insurance Marketplace.\nShe walked through the kitchen and into the sprawling back yard, her new medical insurance card stowed in her pocket.\nThe couple recently received health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\nThey always had health insurance, paying the $1,400-a-month premium, tolerating the $5,000 annual deductible.\nAnd then, for the first time in their lives, they dropped their health insurance."}
