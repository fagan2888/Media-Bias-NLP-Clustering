Throughout President Obama's career, he has been fighting for young people. Whether it is increasing access to higher education, or expanding health care coverage, giving young people a fair shot has been and always will be a priority.

The President also believes in reaching out to youth across the country to make sure we’re hearing what they have to say, and helping them better understand the policies and programs that impact them. That’s why, on Wednesday, December 4th, we’re hosting over 150 leaders from across the country at the White House for a Youth Summit. The Summit will offer young people coming to the White House and across the country a chance to discuss the Affordable Care Act and others issues important to them.

Even if you can't be at the Summit in person, we still want to hear from you!

On Monday, December 2nd at 8:00 p.m. ET, join White House Senior Commnications Advisor Tara McGuinness, Kal Penn, and Young Invincibles for a Google+ Hangout. During this live video chat, we'll announce the winners of the "Healthy Young America Video Contest," preview the upcoming Youth Summit, and take questions about the Affordable Care Act and what It means for young Americans.

You can watch the Hangout live on the White House Google+ page. Have a comments or questions? Ask them using the hashtag #WHYouth on Twitter and on Google+ and we'll answer some of them during the live Hangout.

Additionally, on December 4th, you can watch the Summit live starting at 2:00 pm ET on Whitehouse.gov/live. Throughout the day White House staff, HHS officials, and other special guests will be taking questions submitted on twitter using the hashtag #WHYouthSummit.
