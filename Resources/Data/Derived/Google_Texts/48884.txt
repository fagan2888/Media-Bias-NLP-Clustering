GI Partners Adds to Health Care Tech M&A with Logibec Deal

The buyer closed a $2B fund in April

GI Partners is buying Canadian health care company Logibec Inc. from Omers Private Equity for an undisclosed amount.

Logibec, headquartered in Montreal, is a health care information technology company that develops, markets, implements and supports clinical and administrative information systems in health care facilities.

GI Partners says it plans to introduce new product lines, expand geographically and make add-on acquisitions to Logibec in order for the company to grow.

San Francisco-based private equity firm GI Partners focuses on control-oriented middle-market investments. In September, the firm agreed to buy Kellermeyer Bergensons Services LLC, which provides management services to grocery stores, from Kohlberg & Co. LLC. GI Partners closed a $2 billion fund in April.

Omers, a private equity firm headquartered in Toronto, is also invested in Accelerated Rehabilitation Centers, Caliber Collision Centers and Husky Injection Molding.

Harris Williams & Co. advised Logibec on the deal.

GI Partners' acquisition comes at a time when many companies are looking to build up their health care technology. That desire is driven in part by an increase in patients coming from the Affordable Care Act, and technology's ability to help take some costs out of the system.

Recent health care technology deals include Global Healthcare Exchange's acquisition of Vendormate, which develops vendor-relationship management software used by health care providers, and Optum's purchase of MedSynergies Inc., which provides services to physician groups.
