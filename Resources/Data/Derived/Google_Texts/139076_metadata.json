(Photo: George Walker IV / The Tennessean )Buy Photo\n\nWhile many students at Vanderbilt University will be heading home this weekend for a fall break full of rest and relaxation, junior Matthew Huffer will be hitting the campaign trail.\n\nBut he\u2019s not knocking on doors as a volunteer for someone else\u2019s campaign. The 21-year-old is the candidate \u2014 he\u2019s running for a seat in the state\u2019s House of Representatives.\n\nThe college junior, who is majoring in political science and economics, decided to join the race in January while he was looking over education statistics for his hometown in Moore County.\n\n\u201cI got intrigued,\u201d he said, mentioning the county\u2019s low ACT scores. \u201cI figured I could do a lot to help our public education system.\u201d\n\nHe researched the requirements to run between sips of root beer in the school cafeteria. After consulting with his parents and professors, he decided to move forward, navigating a maze of paperwork necessary to get his name on the ballot.\n\nHuffer met constituents in a local coffee shop to get signatures for his petition to run.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really go into it with a ton of political connections,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the people who signed it were people who had just gotten out of high school.\u201d\n\nHuffer doesn\u2019t think his age should count against him in voters\u2019 eyes. Instead, he says, his existing relationships with high school students back home could help inform his work to improve state education policy.\n\n\u201cI knew that politics was something I wanted to get into, and I saw this issue that I thought I could help with,\u201d he said. \u201cI think once they see that they\u2019ll realize it\u2019s not just a gimmick.\u201d\n\nHuffer knocked on about 1,000 doors over the summer, and he\u2019s continued to campaign this semester, even though his voter base is across the state. He scheduled his classes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday so he can have long weekends in Tennessee House District 39, which includes parts of Moore, Franklin and Marion counties.\n\nThe pressures of juggling a campaign with a full slate of exams and coursework has forced Huffer to cut back on on-campus events and movie nights with friends.\n\n\u201cFinding a way to keep focused has definitely been a struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to make the most of every moment I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nIf he is elected Nov. 4, Huffer plans to arrange his classes around legislative sessions downtown.\n\nDespite the challenges, Huffer, who is running as a Democrat, believes he has a chance to beat the incumbent in his district, Rep. David Alexander, R-Winchester. He credits the environment at Vanderbilt with sparking his political ambitions.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always around people who are driven to do better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pushes you to strive to do better.\u201d\n\nReach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and on Twitter @tamburintweets.\n\nAbout the incumbent\n\nRep. David Alexander was first elected to the General Assembly in 2010, and then reelected in 2012. He lives in Winchester and owns Reliable Rental, a construction equipment and special event rental store.\n\nHe said his robust life experience, from service in the Army to owning a small business, qualifies him for reelection.\n\n\u201cI believe that I have served them and represented them well,\u201d he said. \u201cI would ask for them to send me back.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1w1C9An", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Student decided to join the race after was looking over education statistics for his hometown.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Student decided to join the race after was looking over education statistics for his hometown.", "title": "Vanderbilt junior runs for seat in Tennessee House", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/12/vanderbilt-junior-runs-seat-tennessee-house/17155453/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Student decided to join the race after was looking over education statistics for his hometown.", "title": "Vanderbilt junior runs for seat in Tennessee House", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7f708985f77c50e3f101b4202cee963e7af0b3a/c=712-0-3544-2832&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/14/nas-vandystudentruns.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. House of Representatives", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. House of Representatives", "title": "Vanderbilt junior runs for seat in Tennessee House", "author": "Adam Tamburin", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab3247e54f417f88f889107d4e536ce8e44c74d7/c=1066-0-3190-2832/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/14/nas-vandystudentruns.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffcf9ffae20ad5cc11182249bf77aaa4aba103f0/c=712-0-3544-2832/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/14/nas-vandystudentruns.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b13be91a9615a9843585fcadc4259939d2a6c7d7/c=240-0-4016-2832/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/14/nas-vandystudentruns.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41fe6ae09d21e093032327224add51a841a440cc/c=0-219-4256-2613&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/14/nas-vandystudentruns.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-10-12T14:19:09-05:00", "shorthed": "Vandy junior runs for Tennessee House", "articleid": 17155453, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eff16e362ab1c55fb18dd4faa6b341e433708ce3/c=0-219-4256-2613/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/14/nas-vandystudentruns.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a983a92c51b952685f5f3df72af1496854487fdb/c=1332-0-2925-2832/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/14/nas-vandystudentruns.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdb2\"", "article_summary": "The 21-year-old is the candidate \u2014 he\u2019s running for a seat in the state\u2019s House of Representatives.\nBuy Photo Vanderbilt junior Matthew Huffer, 20, is running for state representative for District 39. he is trying to balance running his campaign and keeping up with his studies.\nInstead, he says, his existing relationships with high school students back home could help inform his work to improve state education policy.\nHe said his robust life experience, from service in the Army to owning a small business, qualifies him for reelection.\nHe scheduled his classes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday so he can have long weekends in Tennessee House District 39, which includes parts of Moore, Franklin and Marion counties."}
