Saturday afternoon hundreds chipped in for Chip Seal.

"We all grew up with him here in Panama City," said long time friend Scott Bentz. "And we just want to take care of him and do what we can."

The sold out golf tournament was a way for the community to assist Chip Seal, a Panama City Beach Tourist Development Council employee who was diagnosed with squamous Cell Carcinoma, a head and neck Cancer that's triggered by HPV.

"The communities support and all of our friends and family out here, it's just unbelievable," said Seal. "And we're juts very lucky and very pleased to live in Panama City Beach."

Cancer is all too familiar to the Seal family.

After being told by doctors he was in complete remission, Seal found himself in bunker after it spread to his liver, and he was recently notified of a tumor in his abdomen which he will be treated for in a week.

"Its hard to see them go through it," said Virginia Seal, Chip's mother. "But I have seen both Chip and Amy become stronger because of it."

"My motivation is to live like I don't have cancer, " said Seal.

Chip's drive is noticeable and Saturday's tournament was a hole in one

"I know he's going through a lot but I think he's doing really well," said Bentz. "And I know he's got a lot of support here."

"Hes a very positive person," said Virginia. "He realizes that everything that's happening to him, is in gods hands."

The tournament will not only assist with medical bills, but it was an opportunity for everyone to play off Cancer for the day and enjoy themselves.

"You need to live everyday like its your last," said Seal. "And really enjoy and take advantage of all activities. We live in a community that we have a ton of activities and you have to be active."

Chip and his wife Amy are using the diagnosis as a way to spread awareness for HPV because it doesn't only affect women but men as well.

The Seal's say it is crucial to make sure you are vaccinated early on.
