Just last year the state intervened in its finances because of an insurmountable debt facing taxpayers.\n\nSee the truth about abortion, in \u201cLife After Abortion,\u201d \u201cLime 5,\u201d \u201cunPlanned,\u201d \u201cPlanned Bullyhood,\u201d \u201cMaafa 21\u201d and \u201cThe Marketing of Evil.\u201d\n\nThe report blamed a collapse of taxpayer subsidies for contraceptives over recent years, with such funding dropping from more than $5 million in 2006 to about $700,000 in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another public health challenge for Detroit, which is the most dangerous city in America to be a child, according to a Detroit News study. Published in January, the study found that the death rate for children 18 and younger is higher in Detroit than in any U.S. city its size or larger. The highest number of deaths occur in the first year, most related to premature birth. Homicide is the second greatest cause of child deaths in the city,\u201d the News report said.\n\nIt said the U.S. abortion rate in 2011, the most recent data available, was 17 per 1,000 women.\n\n\u201cBoth routine primary care and family planning-specific primary care are not available in Detroit,\u201d Schooley told the newspaper. \u201cTo the extent that a significant proportion of those (pregnancies) are unplanned, it leads to all these decision-making options of which abortion is one lousy choice.\u201d\n\nHealth professionals told the News they expect Obamacare will reduce abortions by providing funding for more birth control, either through expanded Medicaid or separate health insurance.\n\nDr. Jay Berman, chief of gynecology at DMC Hutzel Hospital and division chief for gynecology at Wayne State University Medical School, said the subsidies in Obamacare will give women greater access to the more expensive treatments \u2013 such as injections, intra-uterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal implants.\n\nDetroit has dropped in population over the last decades by hundreds of thousands of residents, and during 2013 the state intervened in its finances because the city was faced with a continued decline in its tax revenue, while costs, especially those for lucrative city pensions negotiated by unions over the years, were skyrocketing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A new report about the high number of abortions in Detroit, considered by many to be a failed city because of its financial devastation, reveals that an estimated 31 percent of pregnancies there end in abortion, what one doctor compared to the worst rates on earth. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a picture that looks more like some [\u2026]", "title": "1 in 3 babies aborted in this American city", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/05/1-in-3-babies-aborted-in-this-american-city/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2012/03/unborn_child.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It said the U.S. abortion rate in 2011, the most recent data available, was 17 per 1,000 women.\nThat translates into a Detroit abortion rate \u2013 the number of abortions by population, including women who weren\u2019t pregnant that year \u2013 of 37.9 per 1,000 women aged 15-44.\n\u201cThat\u2019s up from 27.5 per 1,000 women in 2001,\u201d the report said.\nHomicide is the second greatest cause of child deaths in the city,\u201d the News report said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another public health challenge for Detroit, which is the most dangerous city in America to be a child, according to a Detroit News study."}
