The results he describes in the September/October \u201cOncology Issues,\u201d the journal of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, are simply jaw dropping:\n\n-- Year two of the program: 218 patients received navigation services, reducing out-of-pocket responsibility for patients by more than $2.6 million and saving the hospital system more than $1 million in reduced charity and bad debt;\n\n-- Year three: 168 patients received navigation; patients\u2019 out-of-pocket responsibility reduced by more than $4 million; hospital system savings: $2.5 million.\n\n-- Year four: 211 patients served; out-of-pocket responsibilities reduced by more than $5 million; hospital system savings: $3.7 million.\n\nKey to effective financial navigation, he writes, is \u201cpresenting patients with all the available choices in the context of their medical condition.\u201d\n\nBeginning with a patient\u2019s diagnosis and treatment plan, he evaluates insurance coverage needed to pay for it. What the patient doesn\u2019t have, Sherman goes to work finding and recommending to the patient.\n\nAs a true Bureaucracy Buster, he even fills out those incomprehensible forms for patients to sign.\n\nHe credits the rollout of the federally funded Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan during year two of the Saint Mary\u2019s program, for \u201csignificantly increased savings to both our patients and our cancer program.\u201d\n\nRead his entire article on Oncology Financial Navigators.\n\n\u201cMost often I see patients who are confused about the high out-of-pocket responsibilities that come with the Medicare plan they have enrolled in,\u201d he writes, citing some 30 to 60 different Medicare coverage options.\n\nFor example: Most Medicare Advantage plans have a cost-sharing responsibility of 20 percent for infusion services with out-of-pocket costs ranging from $3,400 to $6,700 a year. In many cases, if the patient has supplemental Medigap coverage, that policy, not the patient, would pay the out-of-pocket charges.\n\nNo surprise: His yearly seminars on Medicare plans offered in October through Saint Mary\u2019s and the Cancer and Hematology Centers of Western Michigan, fill fast.\n\nSherman\u2019s bottom line advice: Don\u2019t assume you can\u2019t afford care and don\u2019t make medical decisions based on financials.\n\n\u201cThere may be avenues to lower your costs.\u201d\n\nTrue, there may not, but you won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t ask.\n\nNext: The Affordable Care Act and more\n\nSue Schroder, former features editor for The Grand Rapids Press, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in late 2009.
