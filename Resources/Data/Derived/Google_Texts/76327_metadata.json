We need to turn farmers loose without restrictive regulations and let them farm the land.\u201d\n\nOn his family\u2019s land \u2014 where he and his wife of 38 years, Laurel, raised five children \u2014 \u201cWe farm walnuts, almonds, pecans and a few other little things,\u201d Cleek said, with evident pride. He mentioned that he\u2019d \u201chad his hands in the dirt\u201d as recent as the day before this interview.\n\nSchools and skills\n\nRegarding education, Cleek again proposes less federal intervention. He believes, \u201cSchools are best run by local school boards, with parents and local communities developing curriculum and testing standards for their students.\u201d\n\nAs for higher education, the costs need to be more affordable for students, he said, and colleges and universities that receive federal tax dollars need to be more accountable \u201cfor their costs, and there must be greater financial transparency so that students and parents can make well-informed decisions regarding higher education.\u201d\n\nCleek also wants better avenues for training in skilled trades, such as paths that lead to careers as mechanics, electricians and plumbers. \u201cNot everyone wants to go to college,\u201d he said,\n\nAnd Cleek believes that he is not alone in being \u201cfed up\u201d with career politicians. \u201cWe need citizens who\u2019ve worked and understand what it takes to make the country real and what we have to do to make it happen.\u201d\n\nHe challenges the notion that his lack of prior experience is a hindrance to being elected. \u201cIf you shoot for nothing, you hit it every time,\u201d Cleek said.\n\nHe explained that part of what has motivated him to run for elected office now \u2014 he was student body president at Orland High School as well as having been elected to the Orland High School board of education \u2014 is a desire to \u201cbring back American to where it is supposed to be,\u201d believing that doing so is rooted in \u201cnot what\u2019s right for me, but what\u2019s right for the United States.\u201d\n\nCleek also said that \u201cI\u2019ve made zero political promises. My commitment is to do the right thing every time, regardless of consequences.\u201d\n\nSuccess breeds success\n\nHe believes that his prior successes in life \u2014 which includes being an Army surgeon in the Gulf War, and caring for wounded soldiers and POWs along the borders of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, as well as 13 years in the Army Reserves \u2014 might be a fitting background to succeed in Congress.\n\n\u201cMaybe we need someone like me who doesn\u2019t need to prove anything,\u201d Cleek said.\n\nCleek also doesn\u2019t completely embrace the distinction of being the Republican candidate. \u201cWhen people ask me what party I am, I say \u2018I\u2019m an American.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIndeed, if elected, Cleek plans to work with Democrats, Republicans and independents. \u201cI\u2019m going to represent them all.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reach Tanya Perez at [email protected] or 530-747-8082.
