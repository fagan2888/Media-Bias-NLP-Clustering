In fact it became a bit of a sensation, at least in libertarian circles. During the confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas, Joseph Biden, then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, pointed to Epstein\u2019s book and sharply criticized it. Epstein followed that book with a series of ambitious academic articles and books, essentially arguing that significant parts of the New Deal and the Great Society were unconstitutional. In his view, much of what modern government does is inconsistent with the constitutional plan. Not by the way, Epstein wrote a whole book contending that in key respects, contemporary civil rights legislation is a very bad idea, at least insofar as it forbids discrimination by private companies, who should generally be entitled to make their own free choices.\n\nMost constitutional scholars continue to think that Epstein\u2019s views are eccentric, but his views have had a large influence. Epstein is far too independent-minded to lead or follow any ideological movement, but if Tea Party constitutionalism has academic roots, or a canonical set of texts, they consist of Epstein\u2019s writings. More than anyone else, he has elaborated the view that our Constitution is libertarian, in the sense that it sharply restricts the power of the national government, and against both the nation and the states, creates strong rights-based protections of private property and freedom of contract.\n\nThat view hardly commands a consensus, but it is not limited to the law schools. In a speech delivered in several places and ultimately published in the Cato Supreme Court Review, a highly respected judge, Douglas Ginsburg of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, wrote that federal judges were faithful to the Constitution until the 1930s, when \u201cthe wheels began to come off.\u201d Among other things, Judge Ginsburg objected that the Court has \u201cblinked away\u201d central provisions of the Bill of Rights, including the Takings Clause, which, he lamented, has been read to provide \u201cno protection against a regulation that deprives the nominal owner of most of the economic value of their property.\u201d\n\nGinsburg\u2019s colleague, Judge Janis Rogers Brown, has spoken in even stronger terms. She asserts that the New Deal \u201cinoculated the federal Constitution with a kind of underground collectivist mentality.\u201d For Judge Brown, changing interpretations in the 1930s \u201cconsumed much of the classical conception of the Constitution.\u201d In this respect, Judge Brown sounds a lot like Epstein, and she is not the only judge who does.\n\nWithin the Republican Party we can sometimes find a similar view, especially among \u201cmovement\u201d conservatives, often associated with the Tea Party, with prominent politicians and ordinary citizens confidently asserting large claims about the Constitution\u2014and notwithstanding current law, the supposed unconstitutionality of much of what federal and state governments now do. Everyone knows who Rand Paul\u2019s father is, but in an intellectual sense it is Richard Epstein who is his daddy.\n\nEpstein has now produced a full-scale and full-throated defense of his unusual vision of the Constitution. This book is his magnum opus. In a revealing confession, he notes that \u201cin a conventional sense I am not a teacher of constitutional law, having taught the structural course and the First Amendment course once each, and over a decade ago.\u201d But he adds that he has also taught many courses \u201cin which constitutional issues play an integral role,\u201d including \u201ccourses in civil procedure, contracts, property, and torts.\u201d This claim is revealing, because those courses sometimes do not touch on constitutional law at all, and when they do, it is usually sparingly.\n\nEpstein is steeped not in American constitutional law but in Anglo-American common law; it provides the foundations for his thinking, and it animates much of what he writes on the Constitution. On his view of the common law, the central ideals include respect for freedom of contract, strong protection of private property, and an individual right to prevent, or to receive damages for, injury to one\u2019s person or one\u2019s things. The set of rights protected by the common law is radically different from the set of rights protected by modern democratic societies. As Epstein notes, he was educated at Oxford in the 1960s, \u201cwhere my common law education contained no serious discussion of either federalism or the basic structure of the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen Epstein comes to constitutional law, he is, in a sense, a stranger in a strange land. That is a big risk, but it is also a potential advantage, because it allows a kind of independence and outsider\u2019s perspective\u2014in his case, the perspective of an outsider who has a particular view of the foundations of private law. When he contends that he aims to defend \u201cwith a passionate intensity the classical liberal vision of the Constitution,\u201d he should be understood to be proceeding not as a scholar of eighteenth-century constitutional debates but as an enthusiast for a certain understanding of Anglo-American common law, one that can be connected with important strands in eighteenth-century political thought.\n\nTo give content to what he calls (controversially) \u201cthe classical liberal vision,\u201d Epstein offers a foil, the villain of the piece, which he calls the \u201cmodern progressive\u201d or \u201csocial democratic\u201d approach. He identifies that approach with the 1930s, when, he urges, policymakers jettisoned \u201cthe traditional safeguards against excessive state power.\u201d As a matter of law, their ill-advised, and constitutionally illegitimate, reforms became possible for two reasons. First, the progressives saw ambiguity in the constitutional text, thus licensing those reforms. Second, the progressives insisted that unelected judges should recede in favor of We the People, acting through elected representatives. Epstein does not deny that the Constitution is sometimes ambiguous. Importantly, he acknowledges that \u201cour basic conception of the proper scope of government action will, and should, influence the resolution of key interpretive disputes.\u201d But he emphasizes that a \u201cdetailed textual analysis\u201d has priority over our preferred views about political theory.\n\nMuch of his book consists of comprehensive and exceptionally detailed accounts of how constitutional provisions ought to be understood. In many places his discussion is highly technical, but in some important respects\u2014of course not in all\u2014you can take it as a careful and sophisticated guide to Tea Party constitutionalism. He believes, for example, that in interpreting the Commerce Clause, courts should not allow Congress to exercise the broad authority that it now has to regulate private activity on the ground that interstate commerce might be involved. He believes that the Affordable Care Act does not fit with the original constitutional plan, and he has written that \u201cknocking out the individual mandate should be a piece of cake,\u201d but he would go much further. In his opinion, the National Labor Relations Act is unconstitutional insofar as it \u201cdid not solve any national problem.\u201d He contends that \u201cone should do everything possible to curtail or at least cut back the affirmative scope of the federal government under the Commerce Clause on the ground that the new powers are chiefly used to create national cartels that are antithetical to the basic provisions of classical liberal theory.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks that the courts have wrongly expanded national power through an unduly broad reading of the Constitution\u2019s Necessary and Proper Clause, which grants Congress the power to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States.\u201d Under this provision, Epstein would require a fairly tight link between an enumerated power (say, the Commerce Clause) and whatever Congress does. He objects that the Constitution does not allow for the independent regulatory agencies, operating apart from the president and including the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. He believes that the National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional, certainly insofar as its members have the authority to adjudicate.\n\nEpstein reiterates his view that the Takings Clause should be understood to impose far greater limits on the power of the national government. He argues that the Court has taken a far too narrow view of the Constitution\u2019s Contracts Clause\u2014and that certain legal requirements, including some in modern telecommunications law, should be struck down as unjustified restrictions on freedom of contract. He contends that the First Amendment imposes severe restrictions on campaign-finance regulation, and hence that the Court has been right, in recent years, to insist on such restrictions. \u201cA general theory of freedom surely allows any person to spend his or her own money on gaining election,\u201d he writes, and it \u201cis very difficult to find a strong justification for the limits on campaign contributions.\u201d And there is much more.\n\nAll of Epstein\u2019s particular discussions are instructive, and most of them are provocative. It is tempting to engage them in detail. But the risk of particularized engagement is that it would lose the forest for the trees. The larger point is that Epstein has a general framework, highly libertarian in character, which he deploys to tackle a large array of problems. He used a similar framework in his early writings on private law. The overlap is no coincidence: a certain conception of classical liberalism, a political theory emphasizing individual immunity from government, lies at the heart of both.\n\nEpstein is quite right to say that if the Supreme Court agreed with him, our constitutional law, and our nation, would be altogether different. We would be a lot closer to what he calls a system of laissez-faire, with a far weaker national government and a more robust set of rights against federal and state interference with private property and contract. To see where his argument is most vulnerable, and where the many people who follow him or concur with him might go wrong, we need to spend some time on the question of methodology. As we shall see, the risk with anything like Tea Party constitutionalism is that it speaks not for the eighteenth-century Constitution, but for the contemporary moral and political views of those who endorse it.\n\nSome people are \u201coriginalists.\u201d Originalists usually ask: what was the public meaning of the Constitution at the time that it was ratified? Many originalists think that if the Equal Protection Clause was originally understood to allow sex discrimination, then it still allows sex discrimination. Or if the Takings Clause was understood to apply only to physical invasions of property\u2014and not to regulations that do not amount to any such invasion\u2014then the constitutional question is settled. Justice Antonin Scalia, a card-carrying originalist, believes that ours is a \u201crock-solid, unchanging Constitution,\u201d and that efforts to see the Constitution as \u201cliving\u201d turn our founding document into putty for judges to mold as they like.\n\nEpstein is not an originalist, certainly not in a strict or narrow sense. (Not incidentally, Scalia was also on the University of Chicago Law School faculty in the early 1980s, and he too had strong disagreements with Epstein.) Epstein insists that \u201cin no legal system at any time could the question of construction be reduced to a search for original public meaning of terms that are found in the constitutional text.\u201d In a crucial passage, he acknowledges that \u201ca bare text raises more questions than it answers, which makes it imperative to isolate the general theory that animates the text\u2014usually the protection of personal autonomy, liberty, and property\u2014and then construct the defenses that are consistent with that world view.\u201d In his account, it \u201cis only through the use of a general theory\u201d that hard questions can be answered. He objects that a risk with modern originalism is that \u201cit ignores the relationships between text, structure, and basic normative theory.\u201d Recall, too, his suggestion that \u201cthe resolution of key interpretive disputes\u201d will, and should, be influenced by \u201cour basic conception of the proper scope of government action.\u201d\n\nBut what is the source of the general theory and \u201cour\u201d basic conception? What does it even mean to say that a general theory \u201canimates the text\u201d? The most convenient answer would come from history. Epstein could have produced a very different kind of book, steeped in the political thought of the late eighteenth century. With such a book, he might have tried to demonstrate such \u201canimation\u201d by carefully linking a theory of the \u201cprotection of personal autonomy, liberty, and property\u201d to the particular choices made by those who ratified the Constitution. That would be a highly interesting book, but it is not at all clear that it would be a convincing account of the views of the Founding generation.\n\nIn any case, Epstein did not write it. He is much closer to being an Anglo-American political theorist than an American constitutional historian. True, he did not produce his general theory out of thin air. What he calls \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d certainly has some connection to the ideas of the great eighteenth-century liberal political theorists, including Locke and Montesquieu, and also to the thinking of America\u2019s founding generation. But we have to be careful here. Epstein\u2019s reading of the theorists and the Founders is not at all obvious or uncontroversial. There are other ways to read them. Many students of the liberal political tradition, such as Stephen Holmes, have raised serious questions about the supposedly libertarian nature of classical liberal theory. It is not at all clear that classical liberal theory, understood in historical terms, is what Epstein thinks it is.\n\nFor lawyers and judges, the broader point is that the general theory cannot be found in the Constitution itself. We might doubt, moreover, that as Epstein elaborates it, it would have commanded any kind of eighteenth-century consensus. Without detailed historical support, it remains unclear what it means to say that Epstein\u2019s preferred general theory \u201canimates\u201d the text.\n\nRonald Dworkin, one of the greatest constitutional thinkers of our time, does not appear in Epstein\u2019s book, but in my view Epstein is playing Dworkin\u2019s game. Dworkin argued in favor of \u201cmoral readings\u201d of the Constitution. In his account, the act of interpretation requires judges both to \u201cfit\u201d and to \u201cjustify\u201d the Constitution. The requirement of fit imposes a duty of fidelity; judges cannot ignore the text (or other relevant materials). If they do, they are not engaged in interpretation at all. The requirement of justification means that judges should put the Constitution in its most attractive light, by identifying the moral principle or theory that makes the best sense of it. Dworkin urges that judges should be moral readers in the sense that they ought to be generating a morally appealing interpretation of the constitutional text. Inevitably, what counts as a morally appealing interpretation is a product of the active judgments of the interpreter.\n\nEpstein is a moral reader. He objects that progressives ignore the constitutional text, and of course he cares about it, but he acknowledges that on many issues that matter, the text, standing alone, does not mandate his interpretation. Where the rubber hits the road, his real argument is not about Madison and Hamilton, the inevitable meaning of words, or the placement of commas; it is an emphatically moral one. Informed though it is by a certain strand in liberal thought, it reflects what he thinks morality requires. Of course other people think differently. There is an important lesson here about Tea Party constitutionalism as a whole, for the supposed project of \u201crestoring\u201d the original Constitution, or going back to the genius of the Founding generation, is often about twenty-first century political convictions, not about the recovery of history.\n\nLike other moral readings, Epstein\u2019s reading has to be evaluated in terms of both fit and justification. Does it fit with the original document? In some ways it does, but to make a full evaluation we would have to go provision-by-provision, and some of his judgments fit better than others. Most judges want their decisions to fit with precedent as well. Epstein is fully aware that on this count his approach fares poorly, and so he has to answer a genuinely hard question about how to treat precedents with which he disagrees. To his credit, Epstein puts his cards on the table: \u201cIn my view, the answer often turns on this simple question: does the original version of the Constitution or its subsequent interpretation do a better job in advancing the ideals of a classical liberal constitution?\u201d\n\nWould our constitutional order be better if judges insisted on moving the nation in the direction of laissez-faire? Would Americans be freer? Would our lives be better? Epstein thinks so. But philosophers and economists have a lot to say on those questions, and there is no consensus, to say the least, that Epstein is right. If we do not accept the libertarian creed (or at least his distinctive version of it), we will emphatically reject his particular moral reading. And even if we did accept that creed, we would have to ask whether federal judges, with their limited place in our constitutional order, should insist on it. Consider in this regard the cautionary words of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.: \u201cIf my fellow citizens want to go to Hell I will help them. It\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nEpstein has written a passionate, learned, and committed book. But he is asking his fellow citizens, and the fallible human beings who populate the federal judiciary, to jettison many decades of constitutional law on the basis of a general theory that the Constitution does not explicitly encode and that the nation has long rejected. Epstein is right to say that in some contexts, a movement toward what he calls \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d would be in the national interest. But a judicially engineered constitutional revolution is not what America needs now.\n\nCass R.
