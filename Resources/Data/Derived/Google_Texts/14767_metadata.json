The stipulation was filed Feb. 10.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that it\u2019s gone, but I wasn\u2019t really worried about it in the first place,\u201d said Forsyth County Sheriff Duane K. Piper, who was one of the defendants.\n\nThe case dated back to shortly after Piper took office, when Sheriff\u2019s Lt. Lisa Frady Selke, four captains, two sergeants and four lieutenants were laid off as part of a \u201crestructuring\u201d of middle management positions.\n\nAccording to court documents, the employees maintained their termination were political retaliation and age discrimination by the then new sheriff.\n\nPiper said that wasn\u2019t the case and that \u201cit would have been irresponsible to [keep the positions] going forward.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the county\u2019s new jail and adjoining courthouse began in July 2013 \u2014 the former is projected to be ready in April while the latter officially opens Monday \u2014 and Piper said he knew the new buildings would require additional positions.\n\nSince the beginning of this process he has maintained that cutting those 11 positions saved the county $2.4 million, even after adding jail staff, because they\u2019re lower-paid jobs.\n\n\u201cThe budget would have been completely out of control,\u201d Piper said. \u201cIt was the product of a well-thought out, well-planned and perfectly implemented business plan moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe former deputies pursued legal channels, beginning with appeals directly to Piper and the county\u2019s personnel services director, Patricia Carson.\n\nAfter Carson denied their request to appeal to the local civil service board in March 2013, on the grounds that layoffs are not appealable under the civil service handbook and policies, they filed suit. The case eventually reached the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe high court dismissed the matter in June on the grounds that they had failed to follow the correct procedure in filing the appeal.\n\n\u201cKnowing someone lost their job is always a tough decision,\u201d Piper said, \u201cbut it was the right decision.\u201d\n\nLance LoRusso, attorney for the plaintiffs, could not be reached for comment last week. It was unclear whether the plaintiffs would pursue any further action.\n\n\u201cOur position from the beginning is that [the plaintiffs] didn\u2019t have a claim,\u201d said Timothy Buckley III, who represented Piper, Carson and the county with attorney Taylor Hensel.\n\n\u201cThe [federal] magistrate judge crafts recommendations on motions to dismiss [a case] and presents them to a federal judge, who can adopt, revise or reject it. We were in that phase.\u201d\n\nHe said there was an \u201coverture of settlement,\u201d which Piper and the other defendants refused.\n\n\u201cIt is in my opinion that [the plaintiffs] evaluated the viability of the case and dismissed it,\u201d Buckley said.\n\nThat attempt to settle was a rehashing of a previous offer from the sheriff\u2019s office of severance to the 11 deputies, which they refused at the time of their terminations in favor of moving forward with a lawsuit.\n\nWhen they brought the offer back up after the dismissal, the county \u201crejected it with our blessing,\u201d Buckley said.\n\n\u201cSheriff Piper was completely vindicated in the sense of his stated objective,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no indication that any rights were violated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/26984/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2015/03/13/Piper_Duane.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORSYTH COUNTY \u2014 A federal lawsuit filed by 11 former Forsyth County Sheriff\u2019s employees who were fired in 2013 has been dismissed, effectively ending their case against the county and sheriff.", "title": "Ex-deputies\u2019 federal case against Forsyth sheriff dismissed"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Ex-deputies\u2019 federal case against Forsyth sheriff dismissed"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea99\"", "article_summary": "FORSYTH COUNTY \u2014 A federal lawsuit filed by 11 former Forsyth County Sheriff\u2019s employees who were fired in 2013 has been dismissed, effectively ending their case against the county and sheriff.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that it\u2019s gone, but I wasn\u2019t really worried about it in the first place,\u201d said Forsyth County Sheriff Duane K.
