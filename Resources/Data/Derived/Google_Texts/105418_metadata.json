Mike Michaud, a Democrat running for Maine governor.\n\nCain says her experience working with Republicans for 10 years in Augusta would serve her well in a divided U.S. Congress.\n\n\u201cWe need leaders who can bring people together, bring the voice of Mainers to the table and get things done,\u201d she told a group of business leaders in Bangor last month.\n\nCain is a respected legislator, and even Republicans praise her inclusive style and smarts.\n\nBut she has a reliably liberal record and many have criticized her life experience. She hasn\u2019t had a full-time job since 2003, working as a coordinator in the University of Maine\u2019s Honors College since 2004, a job she\u2019s now on leave from.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s too extreme for Maine,\u201d Poliquin said of Cain. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t fit the values of the 2nd District.\u201d\n\nStill, Cain has had time to rise in her party, which observers say she\u2019s done with strategic alliances and without burning bridges in Augusta.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a quick study, and I think she saw early on the path to rising in the ranks,\u201d said Cynthia Dill, a former Democratic legislator from Cape Elizabeth who lost the race for minority leader to Cain in 2011. \u201cAnd she took it, obviously successfully.\u201d\n\nRISE IN DIFFICULT TIMES\n\nCain was born in Kentucky and grew up in Illinois. Before she finished high school in New Jersey, her parents moved to Kennebunk, when her father, who was in the shoe business and often moved, got a job with G.H. Bass & Co.\n\nBut she had family in Orono, where she moved to attend UMaine to study music education, graduating in 2002. In 2004, she got a master\u2019s degree in higher education at Harvard, married and got elected.\n\nWhen she got to Augusta, she was put on the Legislature\u2019s Education Committee. There, she said, she found out quickly that \u201ceverything I cared about cost money.\u201d\n\nSo she set out to learn the budgeting process. In 2006, she was appointed to the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, the panel that negotiates the state budget. Two years later, Cain\u2019s friend, then-House Speaker Hannah Pingree, a Democrat from North Haven, picked Cain to co-chair it.\n\nBut Pingree said their friendship had nothing to do with the appointment.\n\n\u201cI trusted Emily and I knew she was going to work well with the Republicans, but she was also going to make sure we came up with a reasonable budget,\u201d she said.\n\nThe budget was difficult. After the 2008 recession, then-Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, signed a two-year state budget that marked the first time Maine\u2019s budget decreased in 30 years.\n\nIt slashed money for schools, property tax relief and aid to cities and towns. Then, Cain said, it wasn\u2019t a budget \u201cthat anyone feels happy about,\u201d but she was proud of the bipartisan effort that went into it.\n\nSen. Patrick Flood, R-Winthrop, who served six years on that committee with Cain, called her one of his favorite legislators. He credited her with helping him in 2014 to find funding to reduce the number of developmentally disabled Mainers on waiting lists for support services.\n\n\u201cShe has very strong opinions, but she worked very hard to find answers to very difficult problems,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Cain was plotting a move from the committee in 2010, as Pingree would be termed out by year\u2019s end. That year, Cain\u2019s leadership political action committee raised $62,000 \u2014 more than that of any Democrat that year, according to Maine Ethics Commission data.\n\nOf that, $50,000 went to the Democrats\u2019 coordinated campaign effort to defend their legislative majorities. That didn\u2019t succeed.\n\nSTRIKING A BALANCE\n\nIn a conservative wave that swept the nation in 2010, Maine Democrats lost the House, Senate and the Blaine House to Republicans, including Gov. Paul LePage.\n\nCain was elected House minority leader, a spot no Democrat had held in Maine since 1974. She said she adopted a philosophy: \u201cI would not be a minority leader that just said \u2018no,'\u201d but \u201cnot that, but this and here\u2019s why.\u201d But LePage was buoyed by his party\u2019s majority to pursue wide changes during his first term, so Cain still would be the often-quoted public face of Democratic opposition.\n\nAfter helping negotiate it, Cain voted for a budget in 2011 that included what Republicans have hailed as the largest tax cut in Maine history. It cut the top income tax rate from 8.5 percent to 7.95 percent and eliminated liability for about 70,000 low-income Mainers.\n\nDemocrats derided the cuts as \u201cfor the rich\u201d and Cain opposed them. But Democrats preserved services in the budget that they supported, including health care for thousands.\n\n\u201cThat period of time was full of a lot of difficult choices; but ultimately, the right thing to do was to stay at the table and get that budget passed,\u201d Cain said.\n\nHowever, Cain put her foot down plenty. After Republicans passed a bill largely along party lines that deregulates Maine\u2019s health insurance market, she said at the time that Republicans bypassed the normal legislative process, making \u201csome of the worst policy that came out of this session.\u201d\n\nOther times, Democrats played successful defense. For example, they turned back proposals to restrict abortion rights with help from a bloc of pro-abortion rights Republicans.\n\nSen. Andre Cushing, R-Hampden, who was assistant majority leader in the House when Cain led Democrats, said she was \u201ca reasonable person to negotiate with.\u201d In 2012, she was elected to the Senate and Democrats retook the legislative majorities.\n\nBut some in her party were frustrated by her deals as leader, even though she has been reliably liberal, supporting the federal Affordable Care Act and universal health care coverage that goes further. During the most recent legislative term, the Sunlight Foundation ranked her as the fifth-most partisan Senate Democrat.\n\nHer deal-making came to the forefront in her June primary against Sen. Troy Jackson, a feisty labor Democrat and logger from Allagash. At the party\u2019s state convention in May, he said he wouldn\u2019t \u201chold hands with the tea party to extend tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,\u201d a reference to the state budget.\n\nBut Cain won nearly two-thirds of the vote on primary election day, touting her history of \u201cstaying at the table\u201d to get bipartisan legislation passed. Dill said she finds that message genuine.\n\n\u201cEmily, I think, values personal relationships perhaps more than she feels passionately about certain issues,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for her to get along with people; and she doesn\u2019t, in my experience, value confrontation.\u201d\n\nREAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE?\n\nCain easily won her primary, but Poliquin has since challenged her background.\n\nHe challenged her youth and work history, saying his outlook is \u201cmore mature\u201d than it would have been if he had run at age 34 and that Cain has \u201calways received a paycheck from the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nCushing, the Republican state senator who praised Cain for her style, said she has a lack of \u201creal-world experience.\u201d That message could resonate with many, including Kathy Preble, of Brownville, an independent who supports Democrat Mike Michaud in the governor\u2019s race but so far is backing Poliquin for the congressional seat.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any background,\u201d Preble said of Cain. \u201cWhat has she done?\u201d\n\nAlso, Cushing said her values don\u2019t fit the district, particularly her pro-abortion rights stance and gun issues. But that\u2019s up for debate.\n\nA poll released in May by Planned Parenthood, a pro-abortion rights group that endorsed Cain, said 62 percent of the 380 district voters who were polled support a woman\u2019s right to make personal decisions on abortion, including half of Republicans, and more than 90 percent of Mainers polled in 2013 supported mandatory background checks on private gun purchases.\n\nBut there has often been a disconnect between those views and the candidates the district elects. Michaud won his seat often as an anti-abortion candidate with National Rifle Association backing.\n\nPoliquin is anti-abortion; Cain is endorsed by pro-abortion rights groups. He is endorsed by the NRA; she has a sub-par rating from that group. On those issues, \u201cI\u2019m really in sync with the district,\u201d Poliquin said, \u201cand my opponent is not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cain\u2019s campaigning largely on the choice issue and her party is driving it home, sending out a series mailers to voters on that issue in September. One said Poliquin \u201cwould put politicians in charge\u201d of women\u2019s health decisions.\n\nBut since the divide between the candidates is so large on so many issues, she said, the difference in the candidates\u2019 styles could be the most important one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also about whether or not you\u2019re going to be the type of member of Congress who\u2019s part of making Congress more productive,\u201d Cain said, \u201cor someone who is going to make Congress more out of touch than they already are with the American people.\u201d\n\nThis story was corrected on Oct. 9 to reflect a full-time job that Cain held at the University of Maine. A Cain staffer was unaware of that job prior to publication.\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic candidate for the 2nd Congressional District says she wants to help Congress be more productive, but critics say she lacks experience.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The Democratic candidate for the 2nd Congressional District says she wants to help Congress be more productive, but critics say she lacks experience.", "title": "Cain highlights bipartisan work - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/331383_720958-emilycain-09172014-6.jpg", "height": 662}, "updated_time": "2014-10-09T10:14:03-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/10/05/cain-highlights-bipartisan-work/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/331383_720958-emilycain-09172014-6.jpg", "description": "The Democratic candidate for the 2nd Congressional District says she wants to help Congress be more productive, but critics say she lacks experience.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cain highlights bipartisan work - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-10-05T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T10:14:03-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb670\"", "article_summary": "In 2006, she was appointed to the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, the panel that negotiates the state budget.\nJohn Baldacci, a Democrat, signed a two-year state budget that marked the first time Maine\u2019s budget decreased in 30 years.\nAdditional Images Emily Cain talks with Matt Cobb during a candidate luncheon for Fusion Bangor, a business organization, in September at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.\nBANGOR \u2014 Just before finishing a master\u2019s degree in 2004, Emily Cain went home to Orono and talked to her state senator about college access and affordability.\nThen, Cain said, it wasn\u2019t a budget \u201cthat anyone feels happy about,\u201d but she was proud of the bipartisan effort that went into it."}
