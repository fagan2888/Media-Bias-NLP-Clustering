It used to be something people could turn to when the commercials came on, but now it has become a must watch program.

The Puppy Bowl has grown to become a Pre-Super Bowl tradition of its own. Last year’s Bowl had over 12 million viewers over the course of the broadcast.

This year’s version will be broadcast six times over a 12 hour period, but you won’t see the same exact broadcast if you watch again. New content will be added to each show.

Puppy Bowl X will feature 66 dogs, 30 untrained kittens, five penguins, three trained cats, eight tailgate party dogs, four service dogs and six hamsters.

Each puppy featured is from an animal shelter and are available for adoption.

Puppy Bowl X airs Super Bowl Sunday. Check your local listings for times and channel.
