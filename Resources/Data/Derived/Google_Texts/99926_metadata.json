Ocean Villas condo owner Jae Fishbein is getting creative this Thanksgiving.\n\nShe and her boyfriend set up camp stoves after she came home Monday night to find the power out.\n\n\"Electricity is not overrated by far when I realized it was out for good I was scrambling for flashlights and I do have some camping equipment, so I was pulling out lanterns and things like that, but it did make a lot of things difficult,\" said Ocean Villa Condo Owner Jae Fishbein.\n\nFishbein is one of twelve full-time residents living at Ocean Villas and was not informed of the outage, until she saw this notice posted outside the building.\n\nAnd for accommodations, they say not a whole lot has been done. \"Not very well at all that's my opinion you know they offered an extension cord,\" said Ocean Villas visitor Ronnie Scott.\n\n\"But there wasn't really any offering of anything it was just an explanation of what was going on,\" said Fishbein.\n\nThe notice said the outage was from a break in the main bus duct, which feeds power to all units.\n\n\"You know I do live here, but there are people here spending their time and their money to come stay here and vacation, I kind of feel worse for them than I do for myself,\" said Fishbein.\n\nFor short-term renters, the notice suggests asking individual unit owners for alternative lodging accommodations. Fishbein said despite the outage, they're still making the most of this Thanksgiving.\n\n\"It's not that difficult to cope with it because I do have my daughter here and that makes things a lot better,\" said Fishbein.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-five units have been affected by the outage. The power will not be back on until a part is made and then installed .\n\nManagement expects they'll have the power back up and running on December 4.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One family is not spending their Thanksgiving the way they had planned.", "language": "english", "author": "Meg Rose", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Family-Coupes-With-Power-Outage-at-Ocean-Villas-284106541.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/ocean+villa.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One family is not spending their Thanksgiving the way they had planned.", "title": "Family Copes With Power Outage at Ocean Villas"}, "twitter": {"description": "One family is not spending their Thanksgiving the way they had planned.", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Family-Coupes-With-Power-Outage-at-Ocean-Villas-284106541.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/ocean+villa.jpg", "title": "Family Copes With Power Outage at Ocean Villas", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Family Copes With Power Outage at Ocean Villas", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Family Copes With Power Outage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16c1\"", "article_summary": "\"Not very well at all that's my opinion you know they offered an extension cord,\" said Ocean Villas visitor Ronnie Scott.\nOcean Villas condo owner Jae Fishbein is getting creative this Thanksgiving.\nOcean Villa condos has been without power since Monday.\nFishbein is one of twelve full-time residents living at Ocean Villas and was not informed of the outage, until she saw this notice posted outside the building.\nThe notice said the outage was from a break in the main bus duct, which feeds power to all units."}
