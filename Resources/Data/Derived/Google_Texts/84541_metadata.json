In the modern world, contraception has somehow garnered a bad reputation, considered by some an unnatural way to toy with pregnancy and bearing children \u2014 particularly among certain religious groups.\n\nThe reality is, birth control is as old as medicine itself. Humans have been trying to prevent pregnancy since having babies was possible (essentially, since human life itself existed) \u2014 either through abstinence or bizarre concoctions that would make any modern day lover squirm. In addition, throughout many different cultures and time periods across the world, abortion was considered a solid means of birth control, as it didn\u2019t hold the negative stigma that it does today.\n\nANCIENT TIMES\n\nThe entrance to Les Combarelles, where archaeologists believe might be the site of the first cave drawings depicting condoms.

Some archaeologists believe that the very first depiction of condoms \u2014 and birth control entirely \u2014 exists on the walls of a cave in France known as the Grotte des Combarelles, where cave drawings dating back to 15,000 years ago show men with a covering of sorts over their genitalia. However, it\u2019s still debated whether these drawings are referring to contraception.\n\nThe Bible. Perhaps the age-old form of birth control is what the Bible refers to as coitus interruptus, more commonly known as \u201cpulling out.\u201d It\u2019s the easiest and simplest way to avoid insemination \u2014 but it\u2019s also known to be risky and often ineffective. The book of Genesis actually instructed men to practice coitus interrupts and to \u201cspill their seed\u201d on the ground instead of inside a woman to prevent children.\n\nThe Ebers papyrus is one of the oldest medical documents from ancient Egypt. CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n1850 BC - 100 BC. Meanwhile, ancient dwellers in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Rome documented their experiences using both abortion and birth control. The Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian medical document from around 1550 BC, is one of the earliest descriptions of birth control. Back then, Egyptian women created a mix of honey, acacia leaves, and lint, then placed it into their vaginas as a way to block sperm. Another mixture included acacia gum \u2014 which is now known to contain spermatocidal qualities and is actually used in some current contraceptives. Perhaps the strangest concoction used in ancient Egypt included crocodile dung, honey, and sodium carbonate placed inside the vagina.\n\nMany of these ancient examples of birth control today seem outlandish, and have been deemed ineffective by science \u2014 and were oftentimes outright dangerous. In ancient China, women who no longer wanted to have children received a \u201cprescription\u201d for a sterilizing mix of oil and quicksilver, which were heated together and then drunk. Other accounts claim that concubines in China drank lead and mercury together to prevent pregnancy, but this was so dangerous that the side effects included brain damage, kidney failure, and even death.\n\nCondom-like creations , such as the bladders or skins of animals, were used inside women as well in ancient Rome and Egypt.\n\nTHE MIDDLE AGES\n\nPope Innocent VIII spurred a \"witch\" hunt, singling out people who had partaken in abortions or birth control. Wikimedia\n\n1484. Contraception and abortion may have been widely accepted and used in ancient civilizations, but enter the Catholic Church in the medieval era and options for women came to a staggering halt, at least in theory. In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII officially approved the Inquisition and the \u201cwitch\u201d hunt that followed. Included in those laws was the demand to find witches who had \u201cslain infants yet in the mother\u2019s womb\u201d and \u201chindered men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving,\u201d referring to abortion and contraception, respectively.\n\nIt has indeed lately come to Our ears, not without afflicting Us with bitter sorrow, that in some parts of Northern Germany\u2026 many persons of both sexes, unmindful of their own salvation and straying from the Catholic Faith, have abandoned themselves to devils\u2026have slain infants yet in the mother\u2019s womb, as also the offspring of cattle, have blasted the produce of the earth, the grapes of the vine, the fruits of the trees\u2026 (The Bull of Innocent VIII )\n\n1494. While the cave paintings in the Grotte des Combarrelles may have hinted at prehistoric condom use, we aren't entirely sure that\u2019s what they mean. And while condom-like animal skins were discovered in ancient Egyptian tombs, the first real documentation of condoms didn\u2019t occur until 1494, when an outbreak of syphilis tore across Europe and Asia. Because Christianity and Islam at the time forbade birth control, instead preaching abstinence, sexually-transmitted diseases spread quickly during the medieval era.\n\nGabriele Falloppio was an Italian physician most notable for his work in anatomy and surgery; he was one of the most important physicians during the Renaissance in Italy. Wikimedia\n\n1564. The medical book of Gabriele Falloppio, an Italian physician, was published, and it was the first to describe the use of what many believe is the initial invention of the condom, at least in Europe. In De Morbo Gallico, Falloppio describes his creation \u2014 linen sheaths soaked in chemicals and dried before being placed on the penis and tied with a ribbon. Falloppio\u2019s \u201cdevice\u201d was developed as a response to the syphilis epidemic, which had continued to rage throughout Europe for the past century. He claimed that when men wore the device, they were protected from syphilis. Since the medieval Catholic Church labeled people who advocated contraception as \u201cwitches,\u201d these early condoms were used primarily to prevent STDs rather than pregnancy \u2014 and many people secretly continued to use homemade remedies of birth control.\n\nThis condom, dating from around 1900, is made of animal intestine. CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nThe Renaissance. In the early medieval period, particularly pre-15th century, certain \u201cglans condoms\u201d were found in Asia. These typically only covered the tip of the penis, and were used as birth control. In China, glans condoms were made of oiled silk paper or lamb intestines (similar to sausage casings \u2014 which also contributed to condom creations). Well into the Renaissance period, people in Europe began using animal intestines and bladder as condoms as well.\n\nTHE MODERN ERA\n\n1827. Scientists discovered the female egg, the ovum, in 1827 \u2014 making a breakthrough in reproductive knowledge. This was the first step in helping scientists better understand how human reproduction occurs, and how to ultimately prevent it.\n\n1839. Charles Goodyear vulcanized rubber for the first time and began manufacturing rubber condoms, intrauterine devices, and diaphragms. In the next 30-40 years, dry-goods stores and pharmacies began offering birth control options across America, including condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps.\n\nMargaret Sanger was a pioneer for women's rights and birth control in America. Wikimedia\n\n1914. Enter Margaret Sanger, a nurse working in New York City\u2019s Lower East Side, who became one of the most staunch supporters of birth control in America. Sanger herself coined the phrase \u201cbirth control\u201d during this time, and published a journal called The Woman Rebel, in which she instructed women on the advantages of avoiding pregnancy if they were exceptionally ill or poor. She also penned her ideas about a \u201cmagic pill\u201d that could prevent pregnancy just as easily as an aspirin.\n\nHowever, the anti-obscenity Comstock Law, passed in 1873, listed contraceptives as \u201cobscene\u201d and barred them from being distributed through the postal service. Still, this didn\u2019t stop a group of NYC women from establishing the National Birth Control League, which would later lead to Planned Parenthood.\n\n1916. Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S., located in Brooklyn, New York, where women could receive information and instruction about birth control. However, 10 days after it opened, the \u201cvice squad\u201d raided it and shut it down, confiscating all the condoms. A few years later, in 1918 \u2014 after Sanger went to court for running the clinic \u2014 the Crane decision became the first to allow birth control for therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe latex condom was much easier to manufacture, wear, and last.

Youngs Rubber Company began producing latex condoms in the 20s.\n\n1937. Finally, after years of secretive contraceptives being sold under the ruse of \u201cfeminine products,\u201d the American Medical Association officially declared birth control to be a legitimate medical practice. One year later, the federal ban on birth control was lifted, and birth control clinics exploded across the country.\n\n1960. On May 9, 1960, the FDA approved the very first oral contraceptive pill. Known as Enovid, or simply \u201cThe Pill,\u201d the oral contraceptive revolutionized birth control. Within five years, over 6 million American women were taking the pill. In addition, until now, states had their own birth control laws \u2014 and many banned contraceptives. But in 1960, the Supreme Court removed state bans \u2014 but only for married couples.\n\n1972. Birth control was declared legal for everyone in 1972, including unmarried women.\n\n1981. In the early 80s, AIDs became a widespread disease that was soon discovered to be sexually-transmitted. As a result, politicians pushed both condoms and abstinence as a way to prevent AIDs from spreading, and everyday supermarkets like Wal-Mart began providing condoms.\n\nToday. By now, millions of women in America and all over the world are using the pill; but criticism of contraception still exists, and perhaps even more so now than before. The Catholic Church still takes an adamant stand against abortion and all contraceptive use. In addition, because Sanger had been associated with eugenics, and had believed in eliminating poor minorities and immigrants through birth control, many still view contraception and Planned Parenthood with suspicion \u2014 claiming that Sanger had wanted to wipe out the African-American population. These concerns are still relevant today in discussions about birth control, abortion, race, and politics.\n\nWhile Sanger\u2019s moral and racial beliefs are certainly questionable, at this point we can rest assured that Planned Parenthood and birth control are not being used to sterilize certain racial or minority groups. Instead, birth control is a choice every woman can make on her own \u2014 and Obamacare providing access to free oral contraceptives marks a breakthrough in how the federal government views choice. Opponents to abortion and birth control still remain, but at least now women have safe, effective, accessible options.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "birth control, history of birth control", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Humans have been using abortions, the pull-out method, and strange concoctions to prevent pregnancy for thousands of years.", "title": "The History Of Birth Control", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/history-birth-control-how-weve-been-trying-prevent-babies-beginning-time-348638", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/19/sanger.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Humans have been using abortions, the pull-out method, and strange concoctions to prevent pregnancy for thousands of years.", "title": "The History Of Birth Control", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/history-birth-control-how-weve-been-trying-prevent-babies-beginning-time-348638", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/19/sanger.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/19/sanger.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-20T07:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T10:58:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Humans have been using abortions, the pull-out method, and strange concoctions to prevent pregnancy for thousands of years."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0188\"", "article_summary": "One year later, the federal ban on birth control was lifted, and birth control clinics exploded across the country.\nHumans have been trying to prevent pregnancy since having babies was possible (essentially, since human life itself existed) \u2014 either through abstinence or bizarre concoctions that would make any modern day lover squirm.\nShe also penned her ideas about a \u201cmagic pill\u201d that could prevent pregnancy just as easily as an aspirin.\nThe Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian medical document from around 1550 BC, is one of the earliest descriptions of birth control.\nThese concerns are still relevant today in discussions about birth control, abortion, race, and politics."}
