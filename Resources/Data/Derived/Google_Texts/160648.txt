There’s been an abundance of maggot stories lately, as if more people have gone into the jungle just to become the target of a botfly, hunting for the home of a new nest of eggs. We’ve seen moths, ticks, fruit flies, crickets, and cockroaches all nestle inside of people’s ears, but it’s a rare occasion when the insect chooses a person’s nose instead. After all, human anatomy would have it that any bug entering the nose would probably end up in that person’s stomach — our mouth, on more horrific occasions. That was exactly what happened to a man in India, however, whose nose ended up with 50 maggots. You can watch them being removed, and relax yourself to the humble sound of the sitar, in the video below.

According to The Independent, surgeon Dr. Meenesh Juvenkar spent two hours removing the maggots, all of which had grown to about a centimeter in length after spending some time chewing into the 55-year-old man’s sinuses. It was important to get them out as soon as possible, because as if having your face eaten from the inside out isn’t already bad enough, the man was in danger of going blind or even dying, as they moved up. Luckily, Juvenkar completed the surgery, and all of the maggots were disposed of — after a dramatic gathering in a stainless steel bowl, of course.

In the 15 years Juvenkar has been practicing ear, nose, and throat medicine, he’s dealt with nasal maggots only six to eight times.
