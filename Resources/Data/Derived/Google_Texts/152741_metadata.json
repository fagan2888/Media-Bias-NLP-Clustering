That announcement could come in the spring.\n\nShe did appear with Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent who for a time was rumored to be considering a presidential run of his own. Current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), a rising star on the left, whose inauguration Clinton attended in January, ran his campaign largely against the record of Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg had warm words for Clinton in introducing her on Monday at the event, hosted by Bloomberg Philanthropies in New York City, calling her \"a great secretary of State, a great senator for New York.\"\n\n\"If my mother and father knew that I was on a first-name basis with Hillary Clinton, it would be a very big deal,\" Bloomberg said.\n\nClinton's speech stayed focused on touting the work and new partnerships of the initiative, called Data 2x, created by Clinton in 2012 to help fill in gaps in data about women and girls around the world.\n\nShe echoed her famous 1995 call in China that women's rights are human rights, but also went further.\n\n\"It is a human rights issue after all. It is an issue of morality,\" she said. \"But we\u2019re not making the progress we should be if that's the principal and in some cases exclusive argument we make.\"\n\nTherefore, she said the goal was to \"build a case strong enough to convince the skeptics based on hard-data and clear-eyed analysis that creating opportunities for women and girls across the globe directly supports everyone\u2019s security and prosperity.\"\n\nClinton said the issues need to be taken seriously, citing experience as secretary of State. \"I got tired of seeing otherwise thoughtful people smile and nod when I raised these issues, foreign leaders, business executives, even senior officials in our own government,\" she said.\n\n\"After all, good decisions in government, in business, in life are based on evidence,\" she said. \"Rather than ideology, or gut feelings or anecdotes.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Clinton touted an initiative to gather data to help women and girls.", "description": "Clinton touted an initiative to gather data to help women and girls.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Clinton touted an initiative to gather data to help women and girls.", "title": "Clinton joins with Bloomberg to promote women's rights", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/227137-clinton-joins-with-bloomberg-to-promote-womens-rights", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/227137-clinton-joins-with-bloomberg-to-promote-womens-rights", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-15T11:58-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-15T11:58:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/227137-clinton-joins-with-bloomberg-to-promote-womens-rights", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Clinton touted an initiative to gather data to help women and girls.", "card": "summary", "title": "Clinton joins with Bloomberg to promote women's rights"}, "dcterms.title": "Clinton joins with Bloomberg to promote women's rights"}, "article_summary": "She echoed her famous 1995 call in China that women's rights are human rights, but also went further.\n\"If my mother and father knew that I was on a first-name basis with Hillary Clinton, it would be a very big deal,\" Bloomberg said.\nCurrent New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), a rising star on the left, whose inauguration Clinton attended in January, ran his campaign largely against the record of Bloomberg.\nBloomberg had warm words for Clinton in introducing her on Monday at the event, hosted by Bloomberg Philanthropies in New York City, calling her \"a great secretary of State, a great senator for New York.\"\nShe did appear with Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent who for a time was rumored to be considering a presidential run of his own."}
