On issues important to conservatives, Walker has shifted positions or adopted new rhetoric as he prepared for his national campaign. The litany of changes includes same-sex marriage, abortion rights, immigration, education standards, Obamacare and corporate subsidies\u2014all litmus tests for the deeply conservative voters in Iowa and South Carolina. And in each case, his new views help his effort to capture the GOP nomination.\n\nBut even among his likely supporters, he still is facing some hesitation. Yes, he\u2019s saying the right things and became a conservative hero when he gutted union rights for state workers. But does he mean it? That\u2019s his biggest challenge he will have to overcome after he makes official his White House run with a rally on Monday then hits the road to campaign in the early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. \u201cInitially, there was some skepticism from social conservatives, especially on the marriage issue,\u201d said Brian Brown, President of the National Organization for Marriage.\n\nFor instance, Walker has acknowledged that he attended the wedding reception for his wife\u2019s cousin, Shelli Marquardt, and her wife, Cathy Priem. \u201cEven though my position on marriage is still that its defined as between a man and a woman, and I support the constitution of the state, but for someone I love, we\u2019ve been to a reception,\u201d Walker told activists earlier this year during a summit in New Hampshire. Walker\u2019s then-19-year-old son Matt was the couple\u2019s best man. The couple later was listed as co-hosts for last year\u2019s Fourth of July barbecue at the Governor\u2019s Mansion in Madison.\n\nYet when the Supreme Court ruled there is a constitutional right for same-sex couples to wed, Walker released a blistering statement and pledged to undo the ruling. It was among the most forceful reactions to the decision among the crowded field of candidates for the 2016 nomination. \u201cOver the course of the last month, Governor Walker and his team have been very strong in calling for a constitutional amendment on marriage,\u201d said Brown, who has conferred with Walker about that issue and others.\n\nStill there is lingering uneasiness that Walker is as steadfast against same-sex marriage as Brown would like. The day after Walker released the fiery statement against the Supreme Court, he was silent on the issue during a campaign trip to Colorado. His wife, Tonette, was with him on that trip and later told the Washington Post that she did not share the Governor\u2019s views on marriage.\n\n\u201cIs it still a concern? Of course,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere seems to be pushback from inside his own family on his views.\u201d But, Brown added: \u201cGovernor Walker is the one who will make the decision if he\u2019s President.\u201d\n\nWalker captured activists\u2019 imaginations early in the race with a biography that fills every box on a conservative wish list. He\u2019s the son of a pastor and spent time as a child in first-off Iowa. He has executive experience, first as a county executive and then as a Governor. He became the first Governor to beat back a recall effort and won three elections over four years. He went head-to-head with Wisconsin\u2019s unions and won. And he has a Midwestern likeability sure to come in handy in must-win states during a general election, namely Ohio. Among the GOP\u2019s elite donor class, he\u2019s known simply as \u201cScott.\u201d\n\nBut there is a nagging feeling that Walker might not be their guy. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that he listens to his wife, and that\u2019s a big influence,\u201d said Michael Farris, founder of the Home School Legal Defense Association. \u201cIt matters. Family members matter, especially your wife. That\u2019s one of the most difficult that Walker is going to have to overcome with our community.\u201d He predicted Walker could overcome those questions, but cautioned it will not be easy. \u201cSomeone with a leftist wife is going to have a hard time,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, Walker\u2019s foreign trip earlier this year\u2014a must-do for any serious candidate\u2014left many backers scratching their heads when, during an appearance at a foreign policy think tank, he compared fighting the Islamic State terrorists to battling union bosses in Wisconsin. He has since been beefing up his foreign policy chops with regular tutors. Former Sen. Jim Talent, a wonk who was a top policy adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential runs, is among Walker\u2019s inner-circle these days.\n\nAnd then there are the flip-flops, those ever-present changes in positions that have moved Walker to the right. During his last campaign, he promised decisions about abortion were between a woman and doctor; this year, he signed a law banning abortion after 20 weeks. Walker has reversed his earlier position in favor of a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. He still hasn\u2019t convinced some activists that he would \u201crepeal Common Core,\u201d even though they are voluntary standards adopted by states and were never a law. He allowed residents of his state to participate in the federal health care law known as Obamacare. And anti-tax activists have been relentless in their criticism of Walker for allowing the Milwaukee Bucks to finance a new arena through $220 million in state-issued bonds.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a strong fighter against liberals,\u201d said Brent Bozell, the chairman of the conservative ForAmerica online community. \u201cWhen you like someone for one thing, then you tend to believe he\u2019s with you on everything. It\u2019s human nature. But once you start looking at his positions, the specifics, you may or may not reach a different conclusion.\u201d\n\nSumming up Walker\u2019s central challenge, Bozell notes that he personally likes the Wisconsin Governor. \u201cWalker starts off with an advantage because of his campaign record. But people ultimately don\u2019t vote for you for the past. They vote for you for the future.\u201d And when it comes to how, exactly, Walker would run the federal government, there remain questions about just how committed he is to his current positions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Wisconsin Governor has shifted views rightward as he prepared for a White House run.
