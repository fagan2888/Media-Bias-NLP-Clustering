Photo: Robert Gauthier / McClatchy-Tribune News Service Trump: close hedge fund tax loophole 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nDonald Trump is their prototypical client \u2014 a risk taker with financial assets galore.\n\nBut not all tycoons stick together, apparently.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, Trump called for closing a loophole on how money management fees earned by hedge fund, venture capital and private equity managers are taxed.\n\n\u201cThe hedge fund guys won\u2019t like me as much as they like me now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know them all, but they\u2019ll pay more.\u201d\n\nConnecticut is ground zero in the debate over what is known as carried interest. It has the third-highest concentration of hedge funds after New York City and London, a $3 trillion industry. Most are located along Fairfield County's Gold Coast, which is also a major private equity hub.\n\nTrump said it\u2019s unfair that the fees are taxed at a lower rate as investment income instead of as regular compensation.\n\nThe discussion of hedge fund carve-outs was part of a broader debate segment on taxes, in which several of the 11 candidates, including Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, advocated for a simplified flat-tax system and Dr. Ben Carson compared the current graduated tax system to socialism.\n\nThe flat tax was a point of departure for Trump, who said under the tax plan that he plans to introduce in two weeks, the rich would shoulder more of the burden, including hedge fund managers.\n\n\u201cIf you make $200 million a year you pay 10 percent, you\u2019re paying very little relatively to somebody that\u2019s making $50,000 a year and has to hire H&R Block because it\u2019s so complicated,\u201d Trump said of a flat tax.\n\n\u201cI know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no taxes, and I think it\u2019s unfair.\u201d\n\nRepublican Peter Schiff, the vocal money manager and financial commentator from Weston, said hedge funds are low-hanging fruit for Trump as he tries to burnish his populist image.\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s kind of Warren Buffetting it,\u201d said Schiff, referring to the billionaire who has called for increasing income taxes on the wealthy.\n\nFellow CNBC talking head Larry Kudlow said the hedge fund niche and the larger financial services industry is eagerly awaiting the fine print of Trump\u2019s tax plan.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going single them out and not give them any relief on the corporate tax, I personally would think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Kudlow, a Redding resident who was a budget adviser to President Ronald Reagan. \u201cI think Donald is going to propose a significant corporate tax cut.\u201d\n\nCarried interest is currently taxed at the capital gains rate of 20 percent, plus an additional 3.8 percent investment tax that is a component of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCritics have long argued that the fees should usually be treated as personal income, where the top tax rate is 39.6 percent.\n\nThey say the change could raise up to $17 billion in tax revenue over the next decade from an industry that has gotten special treatment from the IRS for too long.\n\nSchiff said that Trump self-funding his presidential campaign builds up the narrative that he\u2019s not beholden to special interests and makes it easier for him to go after carried interest.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good issue for Trump because he knows his opponents can\u2019t attack it because they\u2019re trying to get money from Wall Street,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably winning him some support.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "In Wednesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, Trump called for closing a loophole on how money management fees earned by hedge fund, venture capital and private equity managers are taxed.
