Earlier this year, the county worked to enroll inmates in Medicaid who were sent to the hospital and had to stay at least 24 hours. Doing so helped push those medical costs onto Medicaid, saving the county about $501,000 since Jan. 1, Habert said.\n\nThe enrollment program is slightly different. It's a partnership between the Sheriff's Office and the El Paso Department of Human Services, and it's part of a larger Stepping Up Initiative by the National Association of Counties. That organization, led by El Paso County Commissioner Sallie Clark, is pushing governments across the country to find ways of improving mental health care for inmates and dropping recidivism rates.\n\nAt the El Paso County jail, human services workers try to reach each person leaving between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. It will soon expand those hours from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThe service is open to more than just departing inmates, as anyone in the community can visit the jail and speak to an enrollment specialist, Habert said. Still, challenges remain - 171 of the departing inmates contacted by caseworkers declined to sign up for Medicaid, even though they may have been eligible, Habert said.\n\nAnd measuring the enrollment program's effect will take months, perhaps years. Organizers track the names of every person they help to gauge recidivism rates. Once signed up for Medicaid, departing inmates can work to better manage substance abuse issues that may have factored into their arrest. If people end up back in jail, the county may save money on medical costs if inmates are better able to manage conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, while out of jail.\n\nAnd for people receiving medications while in jail, the prospect of Medicaid may help them continue treatment upon their release.\n\n\"If they don't have that coverage or any way to continue receiving that medication once they're released, then that could lead to bigger problems,\" said Kristina Iodice, an El Paso County Human Services spokeswoman.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "One new question awaits nearly all El Paso County jail inmates as they walk...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Colorado Springs Gazette.
