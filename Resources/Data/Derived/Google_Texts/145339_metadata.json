President Obama is pushing a plan to raise the federal rate to $10.10 from $7.25 an hour by 2016, but House Republicans have blocked the proposal.\n\nAs a result, the debate has shifted to individual states. Democrats, workers advocates, and many economists argue that increasing the minimum wage would help not only the working poor, but also the broader economy by putting money in the pockets of people likely to spend it. But Republicans and businesses say a higher minimum wage would increase hiring costs and result in fewer jobs.\n\nIn Massachusetts, the state Senate has passed a bill that would boost the state\u2019s minimum wage to $11 from $8 an hour by 2016, which would make it the highest in the nation. The Senate bill also would tie future minimum wage increases to inflation.\n\nBut House Speaker Robert DeLeo, a Winthrop Democrat, has balked at that plan, saying any increase in the minimum wage should be offset by other measures that would reduce business costs. Specifically, he has linked a wage increase to overhauling the state\u2019s unemployment insurance system.\n\nUnemployment insurance\n\nOverhauling the state\u2019s unemployment insurance system has long been a priority of Massachusetts business leaders, who say eligibility requirements are too lax, benefits too generous, and costs too high compared to other states. In Massachusetts, for example, unemployed workers can collect benefits for 30 weeks, compared with 26 weeks for most states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeLeo hasn\u2019t released details on how he would overhaul the system, but Governor Deval Patrick and Senate President Therese Murray, both Democrats, have signaled they\u2019re open to changes. Murray, however, has balked at linking unemployment insurance reforms to the minimum wage.\n\nIn Congress, a budget compromise reached at the end of last year didn\u2019t extend jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. As result, nearly 60,000 Massachusetts residents lost benefits Dec. 28, and tens of thousands more will exhaust benefits this year.\n\nLegislation to extend emergency benefits for another three months has stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Such legislation would likely face a harder time in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nHealth care\n\nHealth care costs remain one of the biggest concerns for businesses in Massachusetts and across the country. Here, hospitals and other providers will come under increased pressure to control expenses this year, as mandated by a sweeping cost containment bill enacted in 2012.\n\nLater this year, the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission will, for the first time, report whether providers achieved the goal of keeping price increases within 3.6 percent last year.\n\nMeanwhile, health care overhaul ran into technical difficulties. Both federal and state governments experienced severe \u2014 and highly embarrassing \u2014 computer foul-ups that kept people from signing up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.\n\nThe federal government plans to jettison the Canadian contractor, CGI Federal, that designed the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov.\n\nIn Massachusetts, state officials are struggling to fix their own site, also designed by CGI, by the March 31 deadline for people to select new health plans for 2014. About 124,000 state residents are waiting for those software repairs.\n\nWalsh and the BRA\n\nBoston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, sworn into office Jan. 6, has signaled he plans to be a strong proponent of commercial development.\n\nLANE TURNER/GLOBE STAFF The new mayor has vowed to change how development is done in the city, and big developers are watching City Hall closely.\n\nBut Walsh, who takes office amid a building boom in the city, has also vowed tooverhaul the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the often criticized agency that oversees development in Boston.\n\nSo far, Walsh has been short on details, although he\u2019s made clear that he wants to make the BRA more transparent and accountable. Among other things, he\u2019s called for a new economic development agency to oversee the BRA and for more accountability to the City Council.\n\nCommercial and high-end residential developers, many of whom have multimillion-dollar projects awaiting approval, will watch closely.\n\nThe Fed\n\nReacting to a slowly improving economy, the Federal Reserve recently said it would gradually curtail, and ultimately eliminate, its extraordinary purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities, an effort aimed at lowering long-term interest rates to stimulate the economy.\n\nThe big question is whether the Fed, under its new leader Janet Yellen, will stick to its tapering strategy if the nation\u2019s employment picture doesn\u2019t improve substantially this year, economists say. Businesses, investors, and consumers will closely monitor whether, and by how much, long-term interest rates might rise.\n\nAverage rates for a 30-year-fixed mortgage could hit 5.25 percent by the end of the year, up from the current 4.5 percent, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, a forecasting firm in West Chester, Pa. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very important year for lenders and borrowers,\u201d he said.\n\nImmigration\n\nUS House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, recently surprised many by announcing that reform of the nation\u2019s immigration system would be a priority this year. But Boehner has said he wants piecemeal changes, not the comprehensive package backed by the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nThat step-by-step approach would be good enough for the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, which has helped organize a coalition of local chambers across the nation to push for immigration reform.\n\nAmong other things, the business groups want to double the number of annual H-1B temporary visas for skilled foreign workers and make it easier for foreign science, technology, engineering, and math students to get green cards after they graduate from US colleges.\n\nBusiness leaders hope compromise legislation on immigration can pass before the November elections.\n\nCasino gambling\n\nBy the end of the year, Massachusetts residents and businesses should finally see which companies win coveted gambling licenses.\n\nThis winter, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission is expected to award a slots-only license to one of three applicants: Cordish Cos. at a site in Leominster; Penn National Gaming Inc. at the old Plainridge Racecourse in Plainville; or Raynham Park in Raynham.\n\nBy spring, the commission is also expected to decide whether to award a full gambling resort license to Wynn Resorts of Las Vegas, which wants to build a casino in Everett, or to Mohegan Sun, the Connecticut Indian casino, which hopes to build a casino in Revere, in partnership with Suffolk Downs racetrack.\n\nBoston is demanding that it be designated a \u201csurrounding community,\u201d a status that would make it eligible for money and other benefits designed to mitigate the potential impact on the city from a Revere or Everett casino.\n\nThe race for governor\n\nThought you could get away from campaigns and appeals for political contributions after last year\u2019s mayoral election in Boston and never-ending special elections for the US Senate, Congress, and state Legislature?\n\nForget about it. The contest to replace Patrick, who isn\u2019t running for a third term, is just getting started.\n\nFive Democrats are vying for their party\u2019s nomination in the September primary: Joseph Avellone, an executive at Parexel; Donald Berwick, a former administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Attorney General Martha Coakley; state Treasure Steven Grossman; and Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security and former undersecretary of Homeland Security in Massachusetts.\n\nThe Republican nomination is expected to go to Charlie Baker, who lost to Patrick in the 2010 gubernatorial race. Baker is a former Weld and Cellucci administrator and former chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.1899550760", "eomportal-id": 575436, "description": "National, state, and local lawmakers are back at work, revving up for a busy year of debate over major public policy issues that could have far-reaching effects on the Massachusetts economy and area businesses.
