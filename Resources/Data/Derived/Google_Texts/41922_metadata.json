Photo: Mark Abramson for The Wall Street Journal\n\nWarlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri didn\u2019t so much shake my hand as allow me to handle his.\n\n\u201cThey adjust to it,\u201d explained Fred Myers of our customs. An anthropologist at New York University, Prof. Myers was serving as Mr. Tjapaltjarri\u2019s translator. \u201cThey know that white people do that.\u201d\n\nI was operating in a near total information vacuum when it came to Australia\u2019s aboriginal people. Mr. Tjapaltjarri ranks as one of their most important artists, and a show of his work is on display at Salon 94 in the Bowery through Oct. 24. It\u2019s better, to my unpracticed eye, and certainly more beautiful than 90% of what passes for contemporary art these days.\n\nI had no idea what Mr. Tjapaltjarri\u2019s native language was, but assumed it might be English. He comes from Australia, after all.\n\n\u201cPintupi,\u201d Prof. Myers said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a written language so it\u2019s a little hard to learn. You can\u2019t take lessons.\u201d\n\nMr. Tjapaltjarri, who is believed to be in his early 60s, and his family made headlines in 1984 when they came into contact with outsiders for the first time, part of a \u201clost tribe\u201d of nomadic hunters. \u201cIt was very isolated,\u201d Prof. Myers said of their homeland. \u201cThey were living about 700 kilometers west of Alice Springs.\u201d\n\nI had no idea where Alice Springs was either.\n\n\u201cThe center of Australia,\u201d Prof. Myers added helpfully. \u201cThey were among the last people in Australia to be living as hunters and gatherers. It\u2019s a very harsh desert.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Tjapaltjarri, a celebrated artist, had been on a plane before, this was his first visit to New York, or anywhere outside Australia. My idea was that we take a stroll around the neighborhood, though I\u2019m not sure the Bowery is necessarily indicative of the splendors of our city.\n\nSomeone had said that Mr. Tjapaltjarri enjoyed sweets and suggested we go for ice cream. This information turned out to utterly and completely incorrect.\n\nI always try to find something, anything, the person I\u2019m interviewing and I have in common. I realized it might be more of a challenge in this case. But I thought we might share a passion for Cadbury Daily Milk chocolate bars or Fry\u2019s Turkish Delight, since I understand such products are readily available in Australia.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re big meat eaters,\u201d Prof. Myers said. \u201cIf they have a choice they\u2019d rather have meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cKangaroo,\u201d added Paul Sweeney, who represents Papunya Tula Artists, Mr. Tjapaltjarri\u2019s community arts center, and is himself from Alice Springs. \u201cEmu. They hunt feral cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeral cats?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re quite ferocious.\u201d\n\nIn any case, it quickly became apparent that the artist wasn\u2019t up for a stroll. This seemed the result, in approximately equal parts, of jet lag, culture shock, and genial resignation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trusting,\u201d Prof. Myers said.\n\nThat morning they had visited the Top of the Rock observatory in Rockefeller Center.\n\nWhile not as tall as the Empire State Building or the new observation deck at One World Trade Center\u2014\u201cShorter lines,\u201d Mr. Sweeney pointed out\u2014it was plenty tall enough, given the parched, flat landscape from which Mr. Tjapaltjarri hails. \u201cIt\u2019s sandhill country,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to get high to see a long way.\u201d\n\nENLARGE New York University anthropologist Fred Myers and Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri in front of one of the artist\u2019s works. Photo: Mark Abramson for The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhat did the artist think of the view? \u201cCrazy white folks taking photos,\u201d he said through his interpreters.\n\nI would think Mr. Tjapaltjarri, as an artist, might enjoy a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Museum of Modern Art, but neither was on the agenda.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, things that aren\u2019t incredibly recognizable are a little hard to appreciate,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have exposure to it in their day-to-day lives.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Tjapaltjarri\u2019s paintings, which range in price from $25,000 to $80,000, appear abstract, the subject matter is apparently quite specific\u2014ancestral stories, the swirling sands of Australia\u2019s desert, the dotted body paint people decorate themselves with for sacred ceremonies.\n\n\u201cThe paint reflects off the firelight and the movements get this strobe action, like Studio 54,\u201d Prof. Myers explained to me. \u201cThey identify that as ancestral power being brought into the present.\u201d\n\nDressed in jeans, sneakers, a cowboy hat, and a flowing beard and mustache, Mr. Tjapaltjarri looked not unlike some other sages I\u2019ve seen walking around the Bowery.\n\nThe artist and his posse also hit Central Park. \u201cThey like the squirrels,\u201d Prof. Myers reported, although apparently not as a food source. \u201cThey don\u2019t have them in Australia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep him away from all the scary stuff,\u201d the anthropologist added.\n\nI wondered what that might be.\n\n\u201cEscalators,\u201d Prof. Myers said.\n\nFinally, something we had in common.\n\n\u201cRemember, it\u2019s a moving stair,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said.\n\nI remind myself whenever I board one.\n\n\u2014 ralph.gardner@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2015-09-24T00:34:00.000Z", "article.section": "US", "page.region": "na,us",
