PEORIA - Businesses both locally and nationally can feel the roller coaster ride from our national economy and pawn shops are no different.

One Peoria shop says when the economy is up-customers are shopping for bargains.

When it's down, well, that's a different story.

Customers look to pawn off things like jewelry for quick cash, but lately there's been more people buying than selling.

"Your bigger items are your gold and your electronics and musical instruments. A lot of different things. But mostly where the economy is now there's a lot more buying than there is selling,‚Äù says Gary Davis of A-Z Jewelry and Swap Inc.

Davis says because of the growing number of TV shows on pawn shops, more people are stopping by his store.
