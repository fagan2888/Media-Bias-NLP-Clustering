Sam Brownback has been on the business end of numerous barbs and critiques for taking a stand against Obamacare and Medicaid expansion in the Sunflower State.\n\nThose with unwavering faith in the federal government have characterized the conservative governor as an uncaring obstructionist for his opposition, but in an exclusive interview with the Daily Signal, Brownback laid out the argument against Obamacare in his own words.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u2019s not working, and it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Brownback told the Daily Signal\u2019s Genevieve Wood.\n\n\u201cLook at this honestly, the federal government has what, $12 trillion of actual debt, $70 trillion of unfunded obligations going into the future, and now they\u2019re making this promise on top of a bill that is going to be gargantuan,\u201d Brownback said. \u201cWhen Obamacare is fully implemented, the cost of this to the federal government is going to be enormous. Now, do you think a fiscally solid, prudent state like the state of Kansas is going to end up with a 90/10 ratio on Medicaid, when the federal government is starting at that much cost? They\u2019re going to up our percentage.\u201d\n\nAccording to recent data analysis, Kansas\u2019 stance against Obamacare may have already started to save taxpayer dollars. A breakdown of raw enrollment and spending numbers on the Affordable Care Act last month revealed states that opposed Obamacare had a lower cost-per-enrollee than those who happily dove-in head first.\n\nRelated: Kansas\u2019 Obamacare opposition saves tax dollars\n\nContact Travis Perry at travis@kansaswatchdog.org, or follow him on Twitter at @muckraker62.
