The tribes would also be eligible for federal grants to pay for monitoring efforts.\n\nIn a finding that may have more far reaching implications for law enforcement and other jurisdictions, the federal ruling examines the boundaries of the reservation and concludes that the city of Riverton is within the boundaries of the Wind River Indian Reservation. This determination has been in dispute for years.\n\n\u201cThe Reservation boundary finding which includes the City of Riverton will have a profoundly positive effect on developing a cooperative spirit between the Tribes, City of Riverton, Fremont County and the State of Wyoming,\u201d said Councilman Al Addison in a statement.\n\nThe tribe wrote a letter to the mayor of Riverton expressing hope that the tribes and the city could cooperate in ways that would help both sides benefit from new, shared jurisdictions. Ron Warpness, the mayor, said he had not seen the letter on Monday afternoon. However, he was not receptive to the idea that Riverton is part of the reservation.\n\n\u201cThere have been several Supreme Court decisions that maintained that this is not Indian Country,\u201d Warpness said.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s decision acknowledges that the Wind River tribes meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act, which grants them the status of an \u201caffected state\u201d when CAA permits are proposed within 50 miles of its boundaries. They will be allowed to submit recommendations about any proposed CAA permit in that area. If the agency granting the permit does not follow the recommendations of the tribes, the agency will have to respond in writing about why the recommendations were disregarded.\n\nThe Wind River Environmental Quality Commission, a relatively new body on the reservation, has cooperated with the Department of Energy, among other agencies, and is likely to have boosted the tribes\u2019 case for competency to carry out an environmental monitoring campaign.\n\n\u201cThis grant provides resources for developing air monitoring expertise and a seat at the table to comment on potential air polluting sources on and around the Reservation,\u201d said Northern Arapaho councilman Dean Goggles in the statement. \u201cWho can argue with that? We have a right to protect the resources of the Tribes and that includes the air that we breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis can only be positive for all of our citizens,\u201d said Northern Arapaho councilman Willard Gould.\n\nBy acknowledging that the tribes meet the requirements to be treated as a state under the CAA, the EPA recognizes the governing bodies of the tribe as competent governments with the capacity to exercise the monitoring authority granted by the federal law.\n\nAt this writing, representatives of the Denver EPA are meeting with representatives of the state attorney general\u2019s office and the governor\u2019s office to explain the ruling and hear their reactions.\n\nIn August, Gov. Matt Mead wrote to the EPA in Washington objecting to the Denver EPA office\u2019s suggestion that it might find in favor of the TAS application.\n\n\u201cThe Tribes\u2019 application, if granted, has implications for criminal law, civil law, water law and taxation,\u201d Mead wrote. \u201cIt also takes away the voice of citizens in Kinnear, Riverton, and Pavillion. \u2026 Having just heard of EPA\u2019s proposed action, I want you to know right away that I think the proposal is extremely problematic and I have major concerns about it.\u201d\n\nMead renewed his opposition to the EPA decision as soon as he learned of Monday\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous to me that a regulatory agency has proposed changing jurisdictional boundaries established by history and the Courts,\u201d Mead wrote in an email. \u201cI have asked the Attorney General to challenge this decision and defend the existing boundaries of the reservation.\u201d\n\nMead went on to argue that the new decision remains open to public debate. \u201dThe state received the EPA\u2019s unpublished decision granting the tribes \u2018Treatment As State\u2019 status at a 6 p.m. meeting on December 9, 2013,\u201d Mead wrote. \u201cThe changes put forward by the EPA would not go into effect until this decision is published in the Federal Register and a 60-day public comment period has passed.\u201d\n\nRonald K. Oldman, co-chairman of the business council, noted that the EPA created a 10,000-page administrative record of the tribes\u2019 application process. \u201cThe administrative record is a thorough and complete review of the history of the reservation and the intent of Congress over many years. The conclusions are very difficult to argue with,\u201d said Oldman.\n\nThe next few weeks and months promise occasions for conflict as well as opportunities for cooperation. But in statements and conversations after the decision was announced on Monday, the tribes emphasized the potential for closer ties with non-Native communities on and off the reservation.\n\nThe tribe wants to work with all stakeholders, said Mark Howell, a Northern Arapaho spokesman based in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe tribe hopes to cooperate with all levels of government \u2014 state, federal, county and local \u2014 to work through an actual implementation of the EPA\u2019s decision and come to an agreed-upon decision that everybody can live with.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, tribal leaders who have not always felt they won the battles in Washington and Cheyenne, the news from the EPA was greeted with relief and elation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said Sara Robinson, the Eastern Shoshone tribe\u2019s liaison to the governor\u2019s office. \u201cIt\u2019s just about time. You cannot get a break in any direction and then this happens. It makes you realize that what we are trying to do as tribes and nations is actually worthwhile. You can achieve something.\u201d\n\nRon Feemster covers the Wind River Indian Reservation for WyoFile in addition to his duties as a general reporter.
