But there\u2019s a caveat: Because the vast majority of large companies are already self-funded, new growth has to come further down the size spectrum.\n\n\u201cThere are advantages for employers in self-funding, so we see the [growth] trend continuing, but largely among midsize and smaller employers, in the range of 100 to 1,000 covered lives,\u201d says Brad Nieland, vice president of stop-loss at Sun Life Financial.\n\nSwitching from a fully insured health plan to a self-insured one reduces an employer\u2019s health-care costs because health-insurance pricing builds in a risk premium and the insurer\u2019s profit margin. Benefits consultants say that the savings, absent any other changes, is typically 5% to 8% for large companies, and in many cases even more for others. In return for those savings, of course, self-funded employers assume more financial risk than fully insured ones do.\n\nHistorically, the cost savings haven\u2019t been enough to sway typical small or midsized companies, as their smaller work forces leave them exposed to potentially disastrous health-care costs in a year of excessive catastrophic claims. Although stop-loss insurance may significantly mitigate that risk, it doesn\u2019t eradicate it.\n\nBut some factors are afoot now that may change the economic equation. For one, the Affordable Care Act imposed a new tax on providers of group health insurance starting in 2014 that, depending on the insurer, amounts to about 2% or 3% of plan premiums. Insurers have passed on the cost of that tax, which is scheduled to increase in increments through 2023, to their group customers in the form of higher premiums.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at what insurance would cost on a fully insured basis with those taxes, versus a self-insured plan with stop-loss insurance costs, the line of where you\u2019re big enough to self-insure suddenly got lower,\u201d says Steven Horowitz, CFO of CareCentrix, a home-health-benefits manager that switched to self-funding last year.\n\nCareCentrix is a fast-growing company that could have been expected to switch to self-funding anyway, having reached a head count of about 1,300 at the time it made the move. But even some very small companies are going the self-funded route rather than see their insurance premiums spike.\n\n\u201cStaying with regular insurance was going to mean a 20% to 30% premium increase for us in 2014,\u201d says Luigi Buffone, CFO of specialty-ingredients maker Avatar Corp., a company with just 60 employees that is additionally hampered in the health-insurance arena by its relatively older work force. \u201cSo our broker included a self-insured option. We went with that, and our costs only went up 2%.\u201d\n\nAvatar\u2019s health costs are up significantly more than that this year, by about 15%, because \u201ctwo or three\u201d costly claims last year triggered a steep hike in the company\u2019s stop-loss premiums for 2015. But that increase \u201cis less than it would have been if we\u2019d been in a fully insured product,\u201d says Buffone.\n\nCareCentrix had a similar experience, absorbing a series of high-cost and medium-sized claims \u2014 not catastrophic events or chronic conditions that will keep draining costs for years, but one-offs. \u201cIt was a disappointing result,\u201d says Horowitz, \u201cbut while we would have been way better off in 2014 if we were fully insured, our 2015 premium increase would have been through the roof.\u201d\n\nThis year is looking a lot better on the claims front, Horowitz adds. \u201cEvery few years you might have an anomaly with a lot of claims, but things will even out over time,\u201d he says.\n\nSize Matters Less\n\nFor more fortunate companies with fewer unexpected claims, stop-loss premiums have been edging down recently. Stop-loss providers, also called reinsurers, \u201care getting more comfortable supporting smaller organizations,\u201d says Jason Dinger, CEO of Mission Point Health Partners, an accountable care organization in Tennessee that assists companies with population health management. \u201cThey\u2019re also getting more comfortable reinsuring at smaller amounts,\u201d he adds, referring to claims thresholds at which stop-loss insurance kicks in (see chart).\n\nMost of those clients are midsized companies, all of which self-fund, according to Clay Phillips, director of provider relations and communications with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, which serves as the third-party administrator for employers that contract with Mission Point. State regulations applicable to employer-insurer relationships make the population-management arrangement more difficult for fully insured employers, he says.\n\nNieland of Sun Life confirms the trends Dinger pointed to. \u201cHistorically, there\u2019s been some reluctance from stop-loss carriers to insure the smaller organizations that are moving to self-insured plans, as they typically don\u2019t have sufficient claims data to use for pricing and evaluating risk,\u201d Nieland says. \u201cBut stop-loss carriers now see the growth potential of the smaller-market segment, and in wanting to capitalize on it, many are finding ways to open their programs and offer competitive coverage.\n\n\u201cAdditionally,\u201d he notes, \u201cmedical cost inflation has slowed in recent years, which has had a favorable impact on stop-loss premiums, making it more attractive for companies to consider a move to self-funding.\u201d\n\nWhether the increasingly appealing cost factors will push large numbers of midsized and smaller companies to self-insure remains to be seen. Some companies shy away from self-funding because they dislike the year-to-year cost volatility that it invites. Others demure simply because of inertia: they don\u2019t want to bother doing something different.\n\nStill others don\u2019t want the administrative burden and culture shock of making the change and then being responsible for paying off claims themselves, which demands a more vigilant, proactive approach to keeping costs in check. For them, the growing number of population health managers like Mission Point, which provide a wide range of services designed to both lower cost and improve care outcomes, may offer a good option.\n\nBut while it takes more effort to be self-funded, there are much greater cost-saving opportunities that derive from data analysis. Before switching to self-insurance this year, Interactive Health, a provider of wellness programs with 400 year-round employees and a couple thousand seasonal ones, had relatively little access to its claims history, says CEO Cathy Kenworthy.\n\n\u201cIt was an extremely empowering move for our company,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople talk about consumerism in health care, and this is the corporate version of that. Call it corporate-ism.\u201d As a result of the data access, which showed that Interactive\u2019s employees are on the healthy side (the company enthusiastically promotes its own internal wellness program), it\u2019s covering 10% to 15% more of its total workforce this year \u201cat what we hope will be an equivalent cost to what we spent last year,\u201d Kenworthy says.\n\nTwo Ways to Go\n\nThere are two variations of stop-loss coverage: specific and aggregate. Specific stop-loss pays a benefit when an individual\u2019s annual claims costs exceed an agreed-upon threshold. Aggregate stop-loss benefits kick in when the employer\u2019s total annual claims costs exceed another threshold. Employers can buy either or both types.\n\nCareCentrix opted for just the specific coverage. \u201cWe had heard from external advisers that it\u2019s pretty hard to hit the aggregate threshold without hitting a bunch of individual thresholds,\u201d says Horowitz. So buying both \u201cis like wearing both a belt and suspenders.\u201d\n\nNieland, though, says a large majority of Sun Life\u2019s stop-loss customers, especially those with fewer than 1,000 covered lives, buy both coverages. The odds of having an aggregate claim are less than those of having a specific claim, so aggregate coverage is less expensive. \u201cIt is low-cost relative to the total cost of a benefits program, but it does provide meaningful risk protection,\u201d says Nieland.\n\nFor Dinger\u2019s part, self-insurance is not much different from buying an insurance plan from a carrier. \u201cEverybody has always thought about premiums being the driving factor behind moving to self-funding, but in reality what we\u2019re seeing is that stop-loss coverage does the same thing for you as a fully insured plan does, especially with the costs coming down.\u201d\n\nPutting the same concept in different terms, Horowitz says that CareCentrix is \u201cnot completely self-insuring, since we\u2019re capping our exposure with stop-loss. Self-insurance sounds scarier than it really is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The economic equation and risk profile is shifting for midsize and small employers weighing whether to self-fund their benefits claims.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Are Smaller Companies Poised to Self-fund Health Care?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2015\\/06\\/smaller-companies-poised-self-fund-health-care\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-12 11:33:54\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-12 11:33:54\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":410847,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"Avatar Corp.\",\"Brad Nieland\",\"CareCentric\",\"Cathy Kenworthy\",\"Interactive Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Growth Companies\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"Risk &amp; Compliance\",\"Risk Management\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/06\\/15Jul_StopLoss.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "The economic equation and risk profile is shifting for midsize and small employers weighing whether to self-fund their benefits claims.", "title": "Are Smaller Companies Poised to Self-Fund Health Care?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2015/06/15Jul_StopLoss.jpg", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2015/06/smaller-companies-poised-self-fund-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "The economic equation and risk profile is shifting for midsize and small employers weighing whether to self-fund their benefits claims.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Are Smaller Companies Poised to Self-Fund Health Care?", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Are Smaller Companies Poised to Self-fund Health Care?", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20150612, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Staffing", "tag": "Sun Life Financial", "published_time": "2015-06-12T11:33:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "avatar corp., brad nieland, carecentric, cathy kenworthy, interactive health, jason dinger, kaiser family foundation, luigi buffone, mission point, reinsurance, reinsurers, self funded, self funding, self-insured health plans, steven horowitz, stop loss, stop loss coverage, stop loss insurance, sun life financial"}, "article_summary": "State regulations applicable to employer-insurer relationships make the population-management arrangement more difficult for fully insured employers, he says.\nBut that increase \u201cis less than it would have been if we\u2019d been in a fully insured product,\u201d says Buffone.\nFor one, the Affordable Care Act imposed a new tax on providers of group health insurance starting in 2014 that, depending on the insurer, amounts to about 2% or 3% of plan premiums.\nSize Matters LessFor more fortunate companies with fewer unexpected claims, stop-loss premiums have been edging down recently.\nAlthough stop-loss insurance may significantly mitigate that risk, it doesn\u2019t eradicate it."}
