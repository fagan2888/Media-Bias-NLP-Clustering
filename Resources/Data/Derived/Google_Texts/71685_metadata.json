Karl Rove told us so in April, writing that \u201cObamacare is and will remain a political problem for Democrats.\u201d\n\nSo how\u2019s that Obamacare thing working out for the GOP?\n\nThe most significant bit of election news last week was the decision of Sen. Mark Pryor, the embattled Arkansas Democrat, to run an ad touting his vote for the health care law as a positive for the people of his increasingly Republican state.\n\nPryor\u2019s ad is so soft and personal that it\u2019s almost apolitical. After his dad, the popular former senator David Pryor, tells of his son\u2019s bout with cancer, he notes that \u201cMark\u2019s insurance company didn\u2019t want to pay for the treatment that ultimately saved his life.\u201d The picture has widened to show Mark Pryor sitting next to his father. \u201cNo one should be fighting an insurance company while you\u2019re fighting for your life,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I helped pass a law that prevents insurance companies from canceling your policy if you get sick, or deny coverage for preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nWho knew a law that critics claim is so dreadful could provide such powerful reassurance to Americans who are ill?\n\nDemocrats have never fully recovered from the Obama administration\u2019s lousy sales job for (and botched rollout of) what is, legitimately, its proudest domestic achievement. That\u2019s one reason Pryor doesn\u2019t use the word \u201cObamacare\u201d in describing what he voted for. Another is that, in many of the states with contested Senate races this year, most definitely including Arkansas, President Obama himself is so unpopular that if you attached his name to Social Security, one of the most popular programs in American history would probably drop 20 points in the polls.\n\nSo, as the liberal bloggers Greg Sargent, Brian Beutler and Steve Benen have all noted, Republicans would much prefer to run against the law\u2019s name and brand than the law itself. They also really want to avoid being pressed for specifics as to what \u201crepealing Obamacare\u201d would mean in practice.\n\nAs one Democratic pollster told me, his focus groups showed that when voters outside the Republican base are given details about what the law does and how it works, \u201cpeople come around and say, \u2018That\u2019s not so bad, what\u2019s everybody excited about?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis consultant says of Democrats who voted for the law: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be stuck with all the bad about this but not benefit from any of the good unless you advertise\u201d what the Affordable Care Act does. This is what Pryor has decided to do.\n\nIn fact, according to Gallup, Arkansas is the No. 1 state in the country when it comes to reducing the proportion of its uninsured since the main provisions of the ACA took effect. The drop was from 22.5 percent in 2013 to 12.4 percent in 2014. The No. 2 state is Kentucky, where the uninsured rate fell from 20.4 percent to 11.9 percent. What they have in common are Democratic governors, Mike Beebe in Arkansas and Steve Beshear in Kentucky, committed to using Obamacare \u2014 especially, albeit in different ways, its Medicaid expansion \u2014 to help their citizens who lack coverage. Beshear has been passionate in selling his state\u2019s version of Obamacare, which is called Kynect.\n\nKentucky also happens to be the site of another of this year\u2019s key Senate races. Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes is giving Republican leader Mitch McConnell what looks to be the toughest reelection challenge of his 30-year Senate career.\n\nThe Bluegrass State is particularly instructive on the importance of labeling and branding. A Public Policy Polling survey this month found that the Affordable Care Act had a net negative approval rating, 34 percent to 51 percent. But Kynect was rated positively, 34 percent to 27 percent. Grimes and the Democrats need to confront McConnell forcefully on the issue he has tried to fudge: A flat repeal of Obamacare would mean taking insurance away from the more than 521,000 Kentuckians who, as of last Friday, had secured coverage through Kynect. How would that sit with the state\u2019s voters?\n\nElection results, like scripture, can be interpreted in a variety of ways. You can bet that foes of expanding health insurance coverage will try to interpret every Republican victory as a defeat for Obamacare. But as Mark Pryor knows, the president\u2019s unpopularity in certain parts of the country doesn\u2019t mean that voters want to throw his greatest accomplishment overboard \u2014 even if they\u2019d be happy to rename it.\n\nRead more from E.J.
