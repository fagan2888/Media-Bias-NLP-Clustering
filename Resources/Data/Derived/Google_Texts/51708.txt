Leads for New M&A Rose in February, but the Tally for Closed Deals Kept Falling

Availability of financing dropped to the lowest level since Mergers & Acquisitions began our monthly surveys in the fall of 2013

Leads for new deals rebounded in February, following the middle market’s worst January on record, but deal closings continued to fall, as did availability of financing, according to the Mid-Market M&A Conditions Index (MACI). (See related chart).

While February’s healthy scores for early-stage activities, such as leads and signed letters, may offer hope that dealmaking will pick up later in the year, the tally of completed deals continues to bode ill. The first two months of 2016 delivered just 236 closed middle-market transactions, the worst deal volume for the period since 1991, based on analyzing data from Thomson Reuters. (See the table, below, for a selected list of transactions that were completed in February.)

Also troubling was the score for availability of financing on the MACI (not shown on the chart), which dropped to 35.7, the lowest it’s been since Mergers & Acquisitions began our monthly surveys in the fall of 2013. Derived from monthly surveys of approximately 250 executives, the MACI is a diffusion index. Readings above 50 indicate expansion in M&A activity, and readings below 50 show contraction.

Participants in our survey continued to cite a wide range of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, from upcoming U.S. elections to potential interest rate increases, from the refugee crisis in Europe to the slowdown in China, from volatile oil prices to fears of terrorist attacks.

Editor’s Note: To measure activity in the middle market, Mergers & Acquisitions looks at transactions that fulfill several requirements: Deals must have a value of roughly $1 billion or less; they must be completed (not just announced) within the timeframe designated; and they must include at least one U.S. company in the role of buyer and/or seller. Excluded from our charts are: recapitalizations; self tenders; exchange offers; repurchases; stake purchases; and transactions with undisclosed values, buyers or sellers. Our data provider is Thomson Reuters, which updates its databases continuously. We use the data available at press time.
