Texas\u2019 annualized job growth rose from 2.4 percent in the first quarter to 4.3 percent in the second quarter \u2014 the strongest pace in nearly nine years. And that happened even though employment growth slowed in May and June.\n\nThe state\u2019s job creation is outpacing the nation\u2019s in all major industries except construction, manufacturing and other services in the first half of 2014. The Dallas Fed forecasts 3.5 percent employment growth this year, or 400,000 new jobs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing strength in services and manufacturing [activity] ... and we expect that to continue,\u201d said Jason Saving, senior research economist and adviser. \u201cWe\u2019re especially seeing strength, not surprisingly, in energy and areas of the economy that relate to energy.\u201d\n\nDallas Fed indexes for manufacturing activity, service-sector activity and retail sales rose in June and July. Moreover, their quarterly averages were higher in the second quarter than the first quarter and from a year earlier.\n\nThat growth doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into more manufacturing jobs because of technological advancements. Texas\u2019 manufacturing employment growth has been weak this year, but job creation in chemical manufacturing tied to energy has grown.\n\nThe energy industry remained robust. Texas\u2019 growth in drilling activity is increasingly concentrated in the Permian Basin, with 563 rigs in that area in mid-July, up by about 95 rigs since January. The rig counts in the Barnett Shale and Eagle Ford basins have declined by 10 rigs each.\n\nCommercial real estate activity picked up as the housing market showed mixed results.\n\nTexas\u2019 major metropolitan areas saw strong office and industrial construction in the second quarter. Office leasing was strong, rents rose and office vacancy rates were lower in major metro areas except Fort Worth, according to commercial real estate services firm CBRE Inc.\n\nIn June, existing home sales rose 2.1 percent. However, housing starts fell 5 percent. Six-month averages show that sales are flat to up slightly in most major metros. Companies report tight lot supplies, higher construction costs and labor shortages are hurting them.\n\nAnother area of flat growth is exports, which dipped 0.2 percent in May.\n\n\u201cExports have been flat lately largely because many of our [trade] partners have not been doing that well,\u201d Saving said. \u201cOur biggest trade partners are South America, Central America, the European Union and Asia \u2014 and there are questions as to whether those economies will strengthen or weaken.\u201d\n\nFollow Sheryl Jean on Twitter at @SJeanDallas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas\u2019 annualized job growth rose from 2.4 percent in the first quarter to 4.3 percent in the second quarter.", "og": {"description": "Texas\u2019 annualized job growth rose from 2.4 percent in the first quarter to 4.3 percent in the second quarter.", "title": "Dallas Fed: Texas\u2019 economic growth sped up in second quarter", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-dallas-fed-texas-economic-growth-sped-up-in-second-quarter.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-exchange-oil_industry_deaths_36370623.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/EXCHANGE-OIL_INDUSTRY_DEATHS_36370623.JPG", "height": 403}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-12T16:19:07Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-12T03:04:09Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Dallas Fed: Texas\\u2019 economic growth sped up in second quarter\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-dallas-fed-texas-economic-growth-sped-up-in-second-quarter.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140812-dallas-fed-texas-job-growth-accelerates.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/Dallas+Fed+Texas+job+growth+accelerates.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1853139\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-12T03:04:09Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"SHERYL JEAN\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140812-dallas-fed-texas-job-growth-accelerates.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/Dallas+Fed+Texas+job+growth+accelerates.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-08-12T03:04:09Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac19\"", "article_summary": "Moreover, their quarterly averages were higher in the second quarter than the first quarter and from a year earlier.\nTexas\u2019 annualized job growth rose from 2.4 percent in the first quarter to 4.3 percent in the second quarter \u2014 the strongest pace in nearly nine years.\nTexas\u2019 major metropolitan areas saw strong office and industrial construction in the second quarter.\nTexas\u2019 manufacturing employment growth has been weak this year, but job creation in chemical manufacturing tied to energy has grown.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing strength in services and manufacturing [activity] ... and we expect that to continue,\u201d said Jason Saving, senior research economist and adviser."}
