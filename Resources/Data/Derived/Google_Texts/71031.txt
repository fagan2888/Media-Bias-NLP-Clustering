Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Sunday that shutting down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood is “not how democracy works.”

During an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the former Florida governor said shutting down the women’s health group would be “great,” but Congress cannot just shut it down over partisan squabbles.

Congress ultimately would “continue to fund Planned Parenthood and shut down the government and cost taxpayers more,” he told host Chris Wallace.

Touting his own record of defunding the group when he was governor, Mr. Bush proffered the idea of having a conservative president in the White House, saying that because the president proposes the budget, the issue of Planned Parenthood’s funding would not come up.

Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, agreed with Mr. Bush on his views about a government shutdown. He said that passing a short-term budget that funds the government through December is the best way to go, considering that such a budget does not include Planned Parenthood funding. Planned Parenthood already has received all the money it can this year, he noted.

“There’s none left to do this year, so the idea that we’re fighting over money for Planned Parenthood is … just not true,” Mr. Cole told Mr. Wallace.

Republicans have been fighting to cut Planned Parenthood funding, but despite their being the majority in the Senate, do not have enough votes to slash the budget for the women’s health group.

Some Republicans, most notably presidential candidate Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have been floating the idea of letting the budget lapse on Sept. 30, when the government would have to shut down until a new budget can be approved.
