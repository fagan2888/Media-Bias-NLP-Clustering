An Arvada man is accused of selling investments without a license and lying to investors as part of an $18 million Ponzi scheme that purported to buy up oil and gas royalty interests.

Deven Sellers worked for two Austin, Texas, men, Robert A. Helms and Janniece S. Kaelin, who used only 10 percent of the investments to buy royalties.

The rest financed their lifestyles and went to Ponzi payments to earlier investors, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint unsealed last week in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.

Helms and Kaelin also are accused of misleading investors about their experience in the industry.

“Helms and Kaelin pretended to be in the oil and gas business when they were really in the business of fattening their own wallets,” David R. Woodcock, director of the SEC’s Fort Worth office, said in a statement.

Their company, Vendetta Royalty Partners, attracted at least 80 investors in more than a dozen states, according to the SEC.

Sellers allegedly told potential investors that his commissions and fees were small, even though he received more than $200,000 from one investment alone, investigators allege.
