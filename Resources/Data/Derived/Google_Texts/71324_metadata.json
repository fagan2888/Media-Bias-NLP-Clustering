Tom Bryski said.\n\n\u201cWe want people to know that we are looking into this, we take it seriously, and we\u2019ve already discovered that those photos are not real, they are stock (images),\u201d Cambra said around 7:30 a.m.The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff\u2019s Station received at least 25 calls beginning around 10 p.m. Saturday from concerned citizens who had seen the threats, Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department Lt. Brenda Cambra.\n\nThe minor who was arrested attended a Santa Clarita Valley school and appeared to have made the threats to get a reaction from friends, a Sheriff\u2019s Department news release stated.\n\nNo firearms were found at the 15-year-old\u2019s home, and the minor appeared to have acted alone.\n\nMaking criminal threats was a felony even if the posts were a hoax, according to officials.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming our guns mostly at high school students \u2026 blood will be shed and families will suffer,\u201d a post stated, next to a photo of multiple guns.\n\nThere was no evidence that the person who posted the images had access to the guns pictured because the photos were stock images obtained online, Cambra said.\n\n\u201cValencia High School has been nominated to be shot up first,\u201d one post stated, alongside an image of the campus\u2019s marquee.\n\nThe image was discovered to be of a similarly named school not located in the Santa Clarita Valley, Cambra said.\n\n\u201cSlow and painful deaths will happen on a very dreadful day. I must not tell you which day it will be, you will find out yourself,\u201d another post stated.\n\nThreats were also of a racist and sexist nature, Cambra said.\n\n\u201cDeath makes the world go round,\u201d a third post stated, paired with an image of dozens of people who appeared to have been shot execution style.\n\nThe Instagram account had since been deleted.
