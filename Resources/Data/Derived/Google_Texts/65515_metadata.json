Who doesn't love fairy tales? I've been inspired by Frozen, I have to admit. So I'll begin: Once upon a time, reps (or pharmaceutical representatives/detail \u201cmen\u201d) ruled the roost, so to speak.\n\nFor the pharmaceutical manufacturers, it was the same refrain: \u201csample it and they will come.\u201d It worked\u2014sales forces infiltrated, companies grew, launching more resources to develop more and better products. And so this sales force continued to be the focus of marketing budgets time and again\n\nThen things changed, as they inevitably do: competition increased, regulations became stricter (no more trips to Hawaii!), and every move came under a microscope. Even the pens and notepads were tinged with blight. Doctors shut down and turned away.\n\nDTC, some would argue, even further undermined the rep and doctor relationship (who's the expert now, doc?). A dark spell came over the land\u2026OK, I'm taking it too far with the fairy tale theme, but seriously, our Evil Kingdom might be personified by FDA? Maybe ACA? How about just the Internet and mobile phones? Cue the minor chords and dark storm clouds.\n\nWhat can bring back the pride? Redeem our reputation as scientists and regain the confidence from our customers?\n\nWhen my 84-year-old father graduated from pharmacy school in the late 1950s, being a rep was a badge of honor, a step toward a career in medicine, and only the few (and scientific) were invited in.\n\nPerhaps the decline of the sales force stems from prioritizing relationship skills over science. Perhaps it is driven by compensation models for reps that focus on the wrong goals (hello, customer service\u2014where are you?!).\n\nWhy can't Pharma let go of its idea of a traditional sales force, given how tough it is to break through these days? Can we let go of paying people to fill sample closets and fumbling with \u201cslim jims\"?\n\nHow about reaching the \u201cNo Sees,\u201d the \u201cWhite Spacers,\u201d the \u201cLow Deciles?\u201d I've seen many strategies for each, but as individual tactics, they are to low effect.\n\nThe only thing that seems to make sense is for the sales force to think more like marketers, integrating the personal with the non-personal, creating a multi-channel approach that is truly integrated and uses in-person, traditional digital, mobile, social, direct-mail (still effective) and patient efforts and is tied into marketing efforts. That's as tall an order in today's industry as it would have been in the past.\n\nIn 2010, AstraZeneca jumped into non-personal promotion detailing with both feet, dispatching reps for heartburn drug Nexium and driving physicians to engage in a dialogue and receive samples online.\n\nIn 2011, GSK's US team implemented a program to compensate its reps not on how much they sold, but on how valued they were by physicians. Just last month, GSK brought the Patient First program to a global scale, embracing multi-channel marketing and removing sales targets so that reps \u201cwill be evaluated and rewarded for their technical knowledge, the quality of the service they deliver to support improved patient care and the overall performance of GSK's business.\u201d\n\nI can imagine the kind of organizational readiness it would take to bring this program to fruition at GSK or any other pharma company. For example, one of the ways we'll have to change as an industry to accommodate this kind of sales paradigm shift is to stop calling digital and multi-channel communications \u201cnon-personal\".\n\nThese days, digital is purported to be the most personal thing we have going (aside from\u2014ahem\u2014in-person interactions). People, including HCPs, are getting downright personal every day on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, professional chat rooms, even e-mail. Yes, I have actually received e-mails from my doctor with links to information they thought I would find valuable.\n\nAnother change is to recognize we likely will have some big barriers to the traditional sales model coming down the road with the Affordable Care Act: No longer will products receive preference via their communication tactics. On the contrary, formulary preference is given to those that cost the least and can show the most efficacy.\n\nSo where does that leave our sales force? Here they are speaking to a customer who is losing the power of choice. A doctor can prefer a product, but if the patient cannot afford it, then no one wins.\n\nNo matter how effective your sales rep is, even if a doctor does want to prescribe your product, she may not be able to. Your managed care strategy needs to be that much more effective.\n\nI'm not the enemy of the rep; I am the champion for a more effective rep, with multi-channel arrows in their quiver. A rep who is charged with bringing value to HCPs to earn back our respect as an industry. A rep equipped with the right tools and the right support. Now, that's what I call \u201chappily ever after.\u201d The end.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,eventsforce.net,media.mmm-online.com,mmm-online.com", "description": "For this romance between two unlikely partners to work, Pharma must let go of its idea of a traditional sales force.", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "MM&M", "description": "For this romance between two unlikely partners to work, Pharma must let go of its idea of a traditional sales force.", "title": "When Sales Force Met Marketing", "url": "http://www.mmm-online.com/suppliers/when-sales-force-met-marketing/article/328824/", "image": "http://media.mmm-online.com/images/2013/10/23/dunn,_unmasked_481471_481472.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@MMMnews", "image": {"src": "http://media.mmm-online.com/images/2013/10/23/dunn,_unmasked_481471_481472.jpg"}, "description": "For this romance between two unlikely partners to work, Pharma must let go of its idea of a traditional sales force.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "When Sales Force Met Marketing"}, "fb": {"app_id": 191077067582624}, "google-site-verification": "Dl9DD3nj4BcHgvbuCyxCNqTLogZAIWVDk-mZ8pujUP0", "article": {"section": "Suppliers", "published_time": "2014-01-10T10:45:18", "modified_time": "2014-12-05T16:58:07"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd391c\"", "article_summary": "Zoe DunnWhen Sales Force Met MarketingShare this article:linkedingoogleEmailPrintZoe DunnSigh.\nWhy can't Pharma let go of its idea of a traditional sales force, given how tough it is to break through these days?\nAnd so this sales force continued to be the focus of marketing budgets time and againThen things changed, as they inevitably do: competition increased, regulations became stricter (no more trips to Hawaii!\nPerhaps the decline of the sales force stems from prioritizing relationship skills over science.\nSo where does that leave our sales force?"}
