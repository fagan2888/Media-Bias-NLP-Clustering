I have no regrets, and I don\u2019t intend to have any more procedures.\u201d\n\nXiahn was fascinated by Korean culture, watching plenty of Korean soap operas and listening to K-Pop, too. He had over 10 surgeries on his eyes: \u201cAs you know, there are thousands of Asian eye styles,\u201d he told Metro.co.uk. \u201cI had one major surgery on my eyes and then small procedures to reach the correct appearance.\u201d\n\nXiahn, who asked not to be named due to privacy reasons, was fascinated by Korean culture and wanted to look Asian though he was originally blonde and blue-eyed.

Facebook\n\nSouth Korea, in particular, has the highest worldwide per capita rate of plastic surgery, with one out of five women in Seoul having undergone some form of procedure, according to Jezebel. Many Koreans who are into the plastic surgery trend do so to make their eyes appear larger and more Caucasian; chiseled V-shaped jaws are also quite popular. \u201cBecause I was raised in Korea, unlike the American view, surgery is kind of like makeup,\" a 17-year-old girl named Kim said in a KoreaAm magazine, according to Jezebel. \"Why do we put on makeup? It's to become prettier. Why do we do cosmetic surgery? It's just to become prettier. To condemn someone for doing so is harsh.\" Check out before and after photos for Korean plastic surgery here.\n\nThough he has undergone quite the physical transformation, Xiahn still identifies with being Brazilian. \u201cThere are many mixed Brazilian people,\u201d he told Metro.co.uk. \u201cFor me a Korean person looks Brazilian as much as a German person or any other person that has born here. So even though I\u2019ve changed the shape of my eyes, I am still Brazilian.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "korean plastic surgery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A white man from Brazil has undergone extensive plastic surgery in order to look more Korean.", "title": "White Man Undergoes Plastic Surgery To Look Korean", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/white-man-brazil-gets-multiple-plastic-surgery-procedures-look-korean-286202", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/brazilian-man-who-got-plastic-surgery.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A white man from Brazil has undergone extensive plastic surgery in order to look more Korean.", "title": "White Man Undergoes Plastic Surgery To Look Korean", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/white-man-brazil-gets-multiple-plastic-surgery-procedures-look-korean-286202", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/brazilian-man-who-got-plastic-surgery.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/brazilian-man-who-got-plastic-surgery.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-03T15:09:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T15:09:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A white man from Brazil has undergone extensive plastic surgery in order to look more Korean."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2169\"", "article_summary": "Check out before and after photos for Korean plastic surgery here.\n\u201cFor me a Korean person looks Brazilian as much as a German person or any other person that has born here.\nMany Koreans who are into the plastic surgery trend do so to make their eyes appear larger and more Caucasian; chiseled V-shaped jaws are also quite popular.\nFacebookSouth Korea, in particular, has the highest worldwide per capita rate of plastic surgery, with one out of five women in Seoul having undergone some form of procedure, according to Jezebel.\nAs if the guy who got a bunch of plastic surgery just so that he could resemble Justin Bieber wasn\u2019t enough: A 25-year-old Brazilian man of European heritage, born with fair hair and blue eyes, decided to undergo various plastic surgery procedures to reach his dream appearance of looking Korean."}
