Bush\u2019s two terms. The new score of 63.9 is the lowest of the Obama years.\n\nThe index, published since 1994, found that consumer satisfaction depended on interactions with federal services. Consumers who filed electronically with the Internal Revenue Service rated their experience a 76, while those who filed on paper rated their experience 20 points lower.\n\nSalim Furth, a research fellow in macroeconomics in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for Data Analysis, sees the scores as a longer lasting demonstration of the difference between public and private services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the government is less consumer-friendly than private companies,\u201d Furth said, adding:\n\nIn theory, people might expect the federal government to be more friendly and responsive because it belongs to us, the citizens. But in practice, public administration involves layer upon layer of bureaucracy, which by its nature is formulaic and slow to respond. This isn\u2019t a matter of needing improvements or better bureaucrats or modernization. Public administration will always be more alienating than private enterprise.\n\nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index interviewed 2,079 consumers at random via email Nov. 12 to Dec. 12. The index then used what it calls a cause-and-effect econometric model to estimate consumer satisfaction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Satisfaction with federal services has declined for the third year in a row.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Satisfaction with federal services has declined for the third year in a row.", "title": "Satisfaction With Federal Services Reaches New Low", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160126_SatisfactionIndex_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-26T21:01:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VoPmxs"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Satisfaction with federal services has declined for the third year in a row.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160126_SatisfactionIndex_Mork.jpg"}, "title": "Satisfaction With Federal Services Reaches New Low", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2016-01-26T16:10:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-26T21:01:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ACSI, Consumer satisfaction, federal services, American Customer Satisfaction, Department of the Treasury, Claes Fornell, survey, poll, Department of the Interior"}, "article_summary": "Consumers increasingly are dissatisfied with U.S. government services, according to a report released Tuesday by the American Customer Satisfaction Index.\nThe index, published since 1994, found that consumer satisfaction depended on interactions with federal services.\nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index interviewed 2,079 consumers at random via email Nov. 12 to Dec. 12.\n\u201cDeteriorating customer satisfaction was widespread in 2015, and the slump in citizen satisfaction is similar to what we observe in the private sector among voters in the political arena,\u201d Claes Fornell, chairman and founder of the American Customer Satisfaction Index, said in a formal statement.\nScoring 63.9 on a scale of 0 to 100, satisfaction with federal government services declined for the third year in a row, dropping 0.8 percent from last year\u2019s score of 64.4, the report says."}
