The report was published online Oct. 26 in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nParents also commonly cite a lack of understanding about the vaccine, said report co-author Shannon Stokley, associate director of science at the CDC\u2019s immunization services division.\n\nAbout 19 percent of parents felt the vaccine was not needed, 16 percent said they didn\u2019t know enough about it, and 7 percent had safety concerns, the report says.\n\n\u201cWe need to work with health care providers so they are making strong recommendations and communicating with their patients about the need for this vaccine,\u201d Stokley said.\n\nAll the parents\u2019 reported excuses point to their doctor as the weak link in the chain, said Debbie Saslow, director of breast and gynecologic cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nEach year in the United States, an estimated 26,000 new cancers are attributable to HPV, including about 9,000 in men, researchers said in background material.\n\nHPV causes nearly all cervical and anal cancers. The virus also causes about 70 percent of throat cancers, three-quarters of vaginal cancers and 63 percent of cancers of the penis, according the CDC.\n\nCurrently, about 79 million people are infected with HPV, and 14 million people will be infected each year.\n\nThe first HPV vaccine, licensed in 2006, initially was recommended only for girls, to protect them against cervical cancer. In 2011 the CDC began recommending HPV vaccination for boys as well.\n\nCDC statistics show that nearly 42 percent of boys 13 to 17 had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine in 2014, up from about one-third in 2013.\n\nOnly 21.6 percent of boys that age had received the full three-dose HPV vaccine series in 2014, Stokley said. That is up from less than 14 percent in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe know it can go higher. We just need to work more,\u201d she said.\n\nResearchers found that boys are more likely to have received the HPV vaccine if they are black or Hispanic, or in a single-mother household, or in a poorer family.\n\nThis could be an effect of federal programs that provide scheduled vaccines for free to low-income families, Stokley said. It also could be caused by the Affordable Care Act, which requires that insurers cover the full cost of vaccinations.\n\nSaslow said some doctors may be reluctant to recommend the HPV vaccine, for fear of offending parents.\n\n\u201cProviders have this perception the HPV vaccine is different than other vaccines,\u201d Saslow said. \u201cThey think parents are more concerned about it, and they\u2019re worried parents aren\u2019t going to bring their kids back if they recommend it.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine is recommended for boys and girls 11 or 12 years old, and some parents blanch at the prospect of inoculating their child against a sexually transmitted virus at that age, Saslow said.\n\nUnfortunately, taking the HPV vaccine out of the regular immunization schedule drastically lowers the odds that a child will get the full series of shots, she said. It also increases the odds that they will be exposed to HPV before getting the vaccination.\n\nThe American Cancer Society and other groups offer training for doctors to help them become more comfortable discussing the HPV vaccine, Saslow said.\n\nBoys need to get the vaccine not only to prevent transmission to girls, but also to protect themselves from genital warts and cancers of the throat, penis and anus, she said.\n\n\u201cThis vaccine prevents six or seven kinds of cancer, in boys and girls, men and women,\u201d Saslow said. \u201cThat\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on HPV vaccines, visit the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "article_metadata": {"Content-Source": "healthcom", "description": "Most boys in the United States aren't receiving the cancer-preventing HPV vaccine alongside their other scheduled inoculations, largely because doctors fail to recommend it or adequately explain its benefits to parents, a new U.S. government study says.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Health News / Tips & Trends / Celebrity Health", "description": "Most boys in the United States aren\u2019t receiving the cancer-preventing HPV vaccine alongside their other scheduled inoculations, largely because doctors fail to recommend it or adequately expl\u2026", "title": "Teen Boys Need the HPV Vaccine Too.
