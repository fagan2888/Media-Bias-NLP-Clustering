At one point, he kindly provided me with a lengthy explanation of pottery seriation, the means by which archaeologists track the history of a particular site. Styles of pottery change over time and vary from culture to culture, so if an archaeologist excavating a heap of broken shards encounters a layer of pieces radically different from the one below it, it\u2019s likely a sign that a new population had moved in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the archaeologist laughed when he finished. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty boring.\u201d\n\nTo the contrary. \u201cI get paid to look at people\u2019s trash\u201d said one of the itinerant archaeologists interviewed by Marilyn Johnson for her new book, \u201cLives in Ruins: Archaeologists and the Seductive Lure of Human Rubble,\u201d and she wasn\u2019t wrong. The man who told me about pottery seriation has spent his life studying broken crockery, after all. But the great and undying magic of archaeology is just how much ancient rubbish can tell us. Sherlock Holmes may have used his encyclopedic knowledge of tobacco ash to catch criminals, but archaeologists can use animal teeth and plant seeds to change our understanding of the world.\n\nBiblical archaeology is part of an intellectual project over two centuries old, one that has attempted to establish just how much of the Old Testament is an accurate representation of the history of ancient Israel and Judah. This project was challenging the literalist interpretation of the Bible long before Charles Darwin came along. As Johnson puts it, \u201cto the archaeologist, treasure is something that was buried that has been brought to light, a pebble of information around which the narrative of history now needs to bend.\u201d\n\nThe archaeologists Johnson visited while researching her book worked in Peru, Cyprus, the Caribbean and upstate New York, among other places. Perhaps the most glamorous of the bunch, NYU\u2019s Joan Breton Connelly, has dedicated her life to excavating a tiny island in the Mediterranean topped by a temple to Apollo that Connelly believes was built by Cleopatra. Her less celebrated counterparts include Bill Sandy, a \u201ccontract archaeologist\u201d (brought in to survey a piece of land in advance of development), who was hired to check out the site of a proposed strip mall in Fishkill, New York. Underneath the top layer of soil he found what would turn out to be \u201cthe largest cemetery of Revolutionary War soldiers in the country.\u201d It had been completely forgotten in the historical record.\n\nYet that plot of land in Fishkill, not far from Route 9, near the location of a major supply depot for the Continental Army, remains in a state of limbo. Development can\u2019t proceed, obviously, but no preservationist organization has stepped forward to buy the lot, let alone fund further excavation. On Memorial Day in 2011, Johnson found herself standing in the weeds with Sandy and a few dozen other faithful, honoring the ordinary, unsung men buried there, all of whom died for this country.\n\nThat\u2019s the real flip side of the dashing image of Indiana Jones \u2014 a character archaeologists adore to the degree that they gave Harrison Ford an award \u201cfor Public Service to Archaeology.\u201d It\u2019s not the fact that, rather than battling Nazis, actual archaeologists spend most of their time grubbing around in the dirt. (You \u201chave to be an earth whisperer\u201d Connelly told the author after rhapsodizing about the various colors of soil.) The real difference is that almost nobody wants to pay archaeologists, and half of them are out of work.\n\nStill, we love them. One of the more gainfully employed people Johnson interviewed works for the Department of Defense, designing training programs to help soldiers avoid destroying cultural treasures. (The program was founded after the infamous looting of the National Museum of Iraq in 2003 and, a year later, the inadvertent bulldozing of the site of an ancient temple by U.S. troops setting up a base.) This archaeologist told Johnson that the military officials she works for were thrilled to have her onboard, even when she discovered a \u201csacred Native American site\u201d on their artillery range in Fort Drum and they had to set part of it aside. \u201cMy bosses,\u201d the woman reported, \u201csay \u2018This is so exciting,\u2019 or \u2018My wife is Native American,\u2019 or \u2018We watch the Discovery Channel at home.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The lives of real archaeologists are even stranger than fiction, and a whole lot harder", "author": "Laura Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The lives of real archaeologists are even stranger than fiction, and a whole lot harder", "title": "\u201cIndiana Jones would be considered a looter\u201d: Why we\u2019re obsessed with glamorizing archaeologists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/indiana_jones_would_be_considered_a_looter_why_were_obsessed_with_glamorizing_archaeologists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/indiana_jones.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The lives of real archaeologists are even stranger than fiction, and a whole lot harder", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/indiana_jones.jpg", "title": "\u201cIndiana Jones would be considered a looter\u201d: Why we\u2019re obsessed with glamorizing archaeologists", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cIndiana Jones would be considered a looter\u201d: Why we\u2019re obsessed with glamorizing archaeologists", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ancient Greece, Archaeology, Books, Editor's Picks, History, Indiana Jones, Lives in Ruins, Marilyn Johnson, Nonfiction, Revolutionary War, Science, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf54d\"", "article_summary": "(You \u201chave to be an earth whisperer\u201d Connelly told the author after rhapsodizing about the various colors of soil.)\nAt one point, he kindly provided me with a lengthy explanation of pottery seriation, the means by which archaeologists track the history of a particular site.\nThe real difference is that almost nobody wants to pay archaeologists, and half of them are out of work.\nThe man who told me about pottery seriation has spent his life studying broken crockery, after all.\nBut the great and undying magic of archaeology is just how much ancient rubbish can tell us."}
