The original goal was to have 7 million enrollees in year one, with 2.7 million of them young and healthy people needed to offset the cost of insuring older and less healthy people. That number was later revised down to 6 million by March 31.\n\nAs of this week, 5 million people have selected plans on both state and federal exchanges. Of the previously-reported 4.2 million enrollees released last week, 25% were between the ages of 18 and 34.\n\nSo what\u2019s holding millennials back?\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nReason: My parent\u2019s plan is cheaper\n\nWhile the Obama Administration has enlisted a few angry moms in its latest push to get young people enrolled in coverage, some are already covered thanks to the provision in the law that allows people to stay on their parent\u2019s health insurance until 26.\n\n\u201cI am currently covered under my parent\u2019s plan, so I won\u2019t need to,\u201d says 23-year-old Felecia Rubitone, a medical assistant from Staten Island. She says that once she is 26 and no longer eligible, she may consider the ACA exchanges. \u201cDepending on where I am working at the time.\u201d\n\nHenry Guilbault, 22, and Leah Seitz, 20, both from California, say they are also sticking with mom and dad\u2019s coverage. \u201cI still have it through my dad\u2019s insurance, and it\u2019s cheaper,\u201d Guilbault says.\n\nAnd despite being offered insurance through his employer, Kurt Stielow, a 24-year-old teacher from Wisconsin, says he\u2019s not signing up because he can \u201cstay on his parent\u2019s insurance\u201d and it\u2019s \u201ccheaper.\u201d\n\nScott Fayter, a 27-year-old postal service worker from Philadelphia, says that he has insurance, but wasn\u2019t thrilled about his premium\u2019s potential price spikes under the ACA. \u201cFrom what I was reading, my insurance is going to go up like 30 to 35%,\u201d Fayter says. \u201cThat is kind of unfair to the people who already have insurance.\u201d\n\nReason: I haven\u2019t had the time\n\nTime and money are holding back Ruben Rangel, a 31-year-old truck driver from Texas. He\u2019s aware of the upcoming deadline thanks to email reminders from the White House.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s coming close,\u201d Rangel. \u201cI have been thinking about it, but haven\u2019t had the time to get to it, but I know the time is running out so I will.\u201d\n\nDavid Boski, 30, from New York, had issues enrolling online and says he lost a lot of time. \u201cI sat for two or three hours and the website was down the entire time,\u201d Boski says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a deadline.\u201d\n\nViral Marketing Tactics Clever or Cheesy?\n\nPresident Obama even got in on the push to get millennials to sign up . He appeared on the online parody show \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d alongside with comedian Zach Galifianakis.\n\nThere was also an online \u2018twerking\u2019 video released this week to show millennials that accidents happen, and they should be covered.\n\nBrendan McCann, 21, a student from Long Island, says he won\u2019t be enrolling in insurance right now because he is under his parents\u2019 plan, but he isn\u2019t convinced the viral tactics will work on his peers.\n\n\u201cI think that by appearing in these viral videos and comedy sketches, it takes away the seriousness of the issue,\u201d McCann says. \u201cHealth care is a very important issue, especially for young people in this country.\u201d\n\nThe viral marketing tactics don\u2019t work for Stielow, either. \u201cMaybe they will for someone else though.\u201d\n\nFayter also didn\u2019t find these marketing techniques all that engaging. \u201cI think my generation is a little bit smarter than that,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s a waste of time, in all honesty.\u201d\n\nBut Guilbault says it may just work. \u201cIf it\u2019s funny, we will sign up,\u201d he says.\n\nEven with viral marketing tactics employed, some weren\u2019t aware of why all the \u2018twerking\u2019 and goofing off was taking place.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that\u2019s why he was doing it, but it definitely caught my attention,\u201d Seitz says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty stupid, but it definitely makes us laugh.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 01:14:34 EST", "dcterms.abstract":
