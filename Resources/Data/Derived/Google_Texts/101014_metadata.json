The announcements follow those of CoOportunity Health in Iowa and Nebraska, the Louisiana Health Cooperative and Nevada Health Co-Op.Health Republic Insurance of New York was the largest of the ACA nonprofit cooperatives, and was shut down by regulators after losing roughly $52.7 million in the first six months of the year. That is on top of a $77.5 million loss in 2014, according to regulatory filings.Deep Banerjee, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Service, blamed the shut down on insufficient premiums that did not cover members\u2019 health expenses and its own costs of operations.\u201cThey are paying out in claims and expenses a lot more than they are getting in the door,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal.Kentucky Health Cooperative, meanwhile, was the second-largest co-op in the country and insured 75% of Kentucky residents who enrolled in coverage. The organization had been awarded $146.5 million in taxpayer loans for its launch, including $65 million in solvency funding as recently as November of last year.Premiums had been set to increase more than 20% for the 2016 open enrollment season, and CEO Glenn Jennings had requested $77 million from the risk corridor program in order to maintain solvency after a series of significant losses.However, news arrived Friday that the co-op was to receive just $9.7 million in risk-protection payments and the co-op opted to cut its losses and fold.\u201cToday\u2019s news regarding the wind down of Kentucky Health Cooperative is a direct result of lower-than-promised risk corridor payments that were announced last week,\u201d Kelly Crowe, CEO of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPS, said Friday.Kentucky Senator and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, laid blame to the co-op program as a whole.\u201cBarely a week goes by that we don\u2019t see another harmful consequence of this poorly conceived, badly executed law,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite repeated Obama administration bailout attempts, this is the latest in a string of broken promises with real consequences for the people of Kentucky who may now be losing the health insurance they had and liked twice within the last three years because of Obamacare\u2019s failures.\u201dThe news comes after a federal audit revealed in August that 22 of the 23 insurance cooperatives established under the ACA are losing money and facing difficulty repaying federal loans. Five of the 23 have now closed their doors, and 11 have received warning letters from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services placing them on \u201cenhanced oversight.\u201dIndependent health insurance agents have been wary of health co-ops from the start. One broker in Nevada told Insurance Business America in 2013 that while the state co-op consistently came in with the lowest-priced plan, he believed the rates would inevitably rise as claims were registered, leaving insureds with a plan far more expensive than what they had counted on.\u201cEverything being equal, if it\u2019s too good to be true, it usually is,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might be attractive now, but down the road, they\u2019re going to be very unattractive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/healthcare/two-largest-obamacare-coops-fold-400000-left-without-insurance-25667.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "The failure of the insurance cooperatives created under the Affordable Care Act continues as the two leading companies announce they are going out of business.", "title": "Two largest Obamacare co-ops fold, 400,000 left without insurance"}, "twitter": {"description": "The failure of the insurance cooperatives created under the Affordable Care Act continues as the two leading companies announce they are going out of business.", "title": "Two largest Obamacare co-ops fold, 400,000 left without insurance", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/healthcare/two-largest-obamacare-coops-fold-400000-left-without-insurance-25667.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The failure of the insurance cooperatives created under the Affordable Care Act continues as the two leading companies announce they are going out of business.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "article_summary": "Five of the 23 have now closed their doors, and 11 have received warning letters from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services placing them on \u201cenhanced oversight.\u201dIndependent health insurance agents have been wary of health co-ops from the start.\nMore than 400,000 Americans are now without health coverage as the insurance cooperatives created under the Affordable Care Act continue to fail.Two more co-ops closed their doors this weekend \u2013 the Kentucky Health Cooperative, which served 51,000 members, and Health Republic Insurance of New York, with 215,000.\n\u201cThey might be attractive now, but down the road, they\u2019re going to be very unattractive.\u201d\nThe announcements follow those of CoOportunity Health in Iowa and Nebraska, the Louisiana Health Cooperative and Nevada Health Co-Op.Health Republic Insurance of New York was the largest of the ACA nonprofit cooperatives, and was shut down by regulators after losing roughly $52.7 million in the first six months of the year.\n\u201cDespite repeated Obama administration bailout attempts, this is the latest in a string of broken promises with real consequences for the people of Kentucky who may now be losing the health insurance they had and liked twice within the last three years because of Obamacare\u2019s failures.\u201dThe news comes after a federal audit revealed in August that 22 of the 23 insurance cooperatives established under the ACA are losing money and facing difficulty repaying federal loans."}
