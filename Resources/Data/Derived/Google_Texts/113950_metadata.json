Tim Murphy, R-Pa., thinks he has a solution for much of the surge in mass shootings. Rather than reacting with new gun control measures, Murphy proposes to overhaul the nation\u2019s mental health system to get at what he believes is the root of the violence.\n\nRecent mass murders have given that reform effort traction. And, in an interview, Murphy told The Daily Signal he hopes to refurbish federal laws to better help those who suffer from mental illness before they can harm others.\n\n\u201cThis bill would have some of the most substantive reforms of the last 50 years,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nAlthough his bill would do little to stop an attack like the one Wednesday in San Bernardino, Calif., Murphy said, it could prevent another mass murder like the one in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn most such shootings, Murphy said, law enforcement \u201cusually encounters someone who is untreated or undertreated for serious mental illness.\u201d Early detection of the sickness is essential to prevention, he said.\n\nA clinical psychologist turned congressman, Murphy, 63, sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Health. He began his investigation of federal mental health laws three years ago.\n\nNow the House\u2019s GOP leadership is pointing to Murphy\u2019s bill as a specific solution to an ongoing problem of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cClearly we can do more, and one common denominator in these tragedies is mental illness, and that is why we need to look at fixing our nation\u2019s mental illness health system,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Tuesday, speaking of the Planned Parenthood shooting.\n\nRyan said members of both parties \u201cshould make this a priority to prevent the violence and to protect our citizens.\u201d\n\nStill, getting the bill passed this year, or in early 2016, could prove a long shot.\n\nAlthough Murphy says his bill enjoys \u201cbroad bipartisan support,\u201d the legislation advanced through the House Subcommittee on Health by only a 18-12 vote along party lines. And although 45 of the bill\u2019s 160 cosponsors are Democrats, some critics already call it a one-sided effort.\n\n\u201cThat bill, the Murphy bill, has become unfortunately a partisan bill when it could have been a totally bipartisan bill,\u201d Rep Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., told The New York Times. \u201cAnd that\u2019s unfortunate, because we need to get these done.\u201d\n\nMurphy, in his seventh term, told The Daily Signal that his reform effort transcends party politics. Both opponents and advocates of gun control should be able to support the legislation, he said, because it\u2019s \u201centirely separate from the gun issue.\u201d\n\nAfter the Planned Parenthood shooting Nov. 27 in Colorado, President Obama renewed his call for increased background checks before gun purchases. At a press conference Tuesday, Obama said he would push Congress \u201cto act in order to make sure that we\u2019re preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies from getting weapons that can magnify the damage that they do.\u201d\n\nHis office \u201chas made a number of attempts to get the White House involved\u201d in his reform effort, but \u201cthey have not been responsive,\u201d Murphy told The Daily Signal. \u201cI don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Pennsylvania congressman added that he has been working closely with Ryan on the measure.\n\nMurphy\u2019s legislation, dubbed the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, would repeal a 1960s-era ban on using federal dollars to pay for residential treatment in psychiatric hospitals.\n\nCurrently, states must shoulder the bill for psychiatric care for the poor and homeless. As a result, the number of psychiatric resources is scarce.\n\nThe bill also would amend the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to bring a patient\u2019s family into the loop concerning treatment. Murphy maintains that mental health patients do best when families take an active role in treatment.\n\nOnly information pertinent to care\u2014such as prescriptions and medications\u2014could be shared, not private conversations between psychiatrists and patients.\n\nFinally, the bill would completely overhaul the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In addition, the legislation would create an assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse disorders at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMurphy said he rejects a Congressional Budget Office report that estimates that his bill would cost anywhere between $3 billion and $46 billion over the next decade. He doesn\u2019t know how the CBO arrived at that estimate, he said.\n\n\u201cThat number is not accurate,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI think it will be a small fraction of that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThis bill would have some of the most substantive reforms of the last 50 years,\u201d the Pennsylvania Republican said of his alternative to more gun controls.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThis bill would have some of the most substantive reforms of the last 50 years,\u201d the Pennsylvania Republican said of his alternative to more gun controls.", "title": "This Congressman Has Mental Health Plan to Curb Shootings", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151204_TimMurphy_Wegmann.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-07T10:52:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IJQKUN"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThis bill would have some of the most substantive reforms of the last 50 years,\u201d the Pennsylvania Republican said of his alternative to more gun controls.", "title": "This Congressman Has Mental Health Plan to Curb Shootings", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151204_TimMurphy_Wegmann.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "firearms", "published_time": "2015-12-04T18:46:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T10:52:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mental Health,  Murphy, San Bernardino shooting, Sandy Hook shooting, Tim Murphy, mass shootings, gun violence, Mental Health, gun control, Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd2e\"", "article_summary": "In addition, the legislation would create an assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse disorders at the Department of Health and Human Services.\nHe began his investigation of federal mental health laws three years ago.\nMurphy maintains that mental health patients do best when families take an active role in treatment.\nFinally, the bill would completely overhaul the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nAnd, in an interview, Murphy told The Daily Signal he hopes to refurbish federal laws to better help those who suffer from mental illness before they can harm others."}
