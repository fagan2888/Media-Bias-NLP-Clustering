It\u2019s federal overreach. They\u2019ve caused us major losses. D.C. comes in and it supersedes our decision-making on all that.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Republican state representative previously attended a Trump rally at the home of car-dealer mogul Ernie Boch Jr.\n\nDiehl recently ran for the 2nd Plymouth and Bristol Senate seat, but lost in November to Mike Brady, a Democratic state representative from Brockton.
