Now, he\u2019s reading a list of classic Christmas stories, retold and recast, to center around political issues and figures.\n\nThe Republican Presidential hopeful himself takes a starring role, not only in the commercial, where his wife and young daughters seem thoroughly absorbed in tales of political woe, but in one of the reworked stories itself: The Senator Who Saved Christmas. You guessed it. Ted Cruz is the titular Senator, savior of Christmas.\n\nHis Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, is cast in another classic children\u2019s Christmas tale. Cruz reworks How The Grinch Stole Christmas to direct attention back to the long-running accusations against Clinton regarding her private email server.\n\nIn Cruz\u2019s new ad, Clinton is cast as the Grinch, naturally. The Grinch Who Lost Her Emails.\n\nThe ad doesn\u2019t stop with Hillary. Ted Cruz also takes a few potshots at the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, both when he tells his kids that \u201call of the other reindeer\u201d couldn\u2019t afford Rudolph, and in another refashioned title, How Obamacare Stole Christmas.\n\nPerhaps poor Rudolph\u2019s exorbitant prices explain why he\u2019s also featured as Rudolph The Underemployed Reindeer, perhaps a reference to the decision by some business owners to cut employee hours in order to escape the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirements regarding employee insurance, or to fears that an increased minimum wage would also lead to reduced employee hours.\n\nThe underemployed Rudolph of Cruz\u2019s imagining is depicted warming his hooves over a fire in a barrel, presumably homeless and unable to afford his stable fees on his reduced income.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the reference to claims that the IRS unfairly attacked conservative non-profits. Who would audit Santa Claus? According to Ted Cruz, former IRS director Lois Lerner would, though according to CNN, investigations were completed in October without any charges. Regardless of what Cruz may fear, Lerner isn\u2019t auditing Santa this year, since she\u2019s already resigned her position with the IRS.\n\nOther subjects of Cruz\u2019s political ad are government shutdowns, the Speaker of the House (who melts before Congress), the \u201cWooden Secretary of State,\u201d and of course, terrorism as depicted in the title, Death To Christmas: The Ayatollah\u2019s Big Red Bomb. Viewers are promised, though, that if they act by voting for him they\u2019ll get a president who serves the country\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201c\u2026a leader who does exactly what he says he\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s new ad will air for the first time during tonight\u2019s Saturday Night Live, but he\u2019s already shared it on his YouTube page, so you can see it here, or below.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite clear in the ad how Cruz proposes to save Christmas, unless he proposes to save it from the \u201cbig red bomb\u201d through bans on immigration by refugees, as The Hill reports that he has promised legislation to enact.\n\n(There is a bill in the House right now to \u201cprotect Christmas,\u201d but Cruz isn\u2019t connected to it, and it isn\u2019t expected to even go far as a vote.)\n\nIt is, at least, clear that he has a long list of villains from whom he intends to rescue the holiday, though, encompassing the current President, his political opponents, and perhaps much of the American government.\n\nPerhaps the Texas Senator intends to announce his specific plans for saving Christmas in the upcoming week, during his Christmas Tour. Ted Cruz will be visiting eight states who hold their primaries on March 1, 2016, though perhaps campaign stops aren\u2019t exactly the most traditional way to celebrate the season. The tour ends on December 23.\n\n[Images via Ted Cruz YouTube]", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a new political ad, Ted Cruz promises he can save Christmas -- and calls Hillary Clinton the Grinch.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "In a new political ad, Ted Cruz promises he can save Christmas \u2014 and calls Hillary Clinton the Grinch.", "title": "Ted Cruz Casts Himself As Christmas Savior (And Hillary Clinton As Grinch) In New Political Ad", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2644802/ted-cruz-casts-himself-as-christmas-savior-and-hillary-clinton-as-grinch-in-new-political-ad/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ted-cruz-saves-christmas-900x440.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-19T13:58:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-19T14:17:30+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ted-cruz-saves-christmas-900x440.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-12-19T13:58:13+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,hillary clinton,lois lerner,political ads,ted cruz,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ted-cruz-saves-christmas-900x440.png", "width": 900, "height": 440}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In a new political ad, Ted Cruz promises he can save Christmas \u2014 and calls Hillary Clinton the Grinch."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz is debuting a new political ad, and it plays off his earlier public reading of Green Eggs and Ham.\nAccording to Ted Cruz, former IRS director Lois Lerner would, though according to CNN, investigations were completed in October without any charges.\nTed Cruz is the titular Senator, savior of Christmas.\n[Images via Ted Cruz YouTube]\nTed Cruz will be visiting eight states who hold their primaries on March 1, 2016, though perhaps campaign stops aren\u2019t exactly the most traditional way to celebrate the season."}
