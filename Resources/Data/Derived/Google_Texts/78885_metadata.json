More of a backbencher than a leader, his biggest accomplishments have involved meddling with Metro and working with local officials to expand Interstate 10 - but there were no improvements to mass transit and the traffic still stinks.  [...] we're still confused as to why Culberson insists on public votes for any rail construction, but not for freeway expansion.  Culberson will tell you that he's an important friend to NASA, but NASA Administrator Charles Bolden has expressed frustration at the congressman's meddling - there's that word again - with individual missions.  The wealthy and highly educated 7th District, which stretches from West University through the Galleria to the Energy Corridor then north to Jersey Village, has the potential to elect a Republican who can represent our city's interests on a national scale.  Lloyd, 31, currently works as an energy attorney, but he previously served on the White House national security staff in the George W. Bush administration.  When he interviewed with the Houston Chronicle editorial board, Lloyd forcefully argued for traditional Republican positions on issues like immigration, national security and federal spending, yet never relied on Trump-style xenophobia or Rubioesque repetition of talking points.  U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, is one of the most conservative members of Congress, but the congenial 10-term incumbent is not conservative enough for a tea party triumvirate in the 8th Congressional District that wants to Brat him out - Brat as in Dave Brat, the tea-party unknown in Virginia who blind-sided House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, presumptive Speaker-to-be, in a huge upset two years ago.  Brady's three challengers - Steve Toth, Andre Dean and Craig McMichael - hope to slice deeply enough into the primary vote to force the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee into a runoff, where they expect tea-party zeal to unseat the longtime lawmaker and bring him home to The Woodlands.  All three claim that Brady has lost touch with his district - the fourth most conservative district in the country, Toth claims - and that he's more interested in national issues than in the needs of the 8th, which includes all of Montgomery County, as well as six other counties and parts of two.  U.S. Rep. Randy Weber of Friendswood, a former state representative and before that a Pearland air conditioning contractor, is seeking a third term in Congress.", "vf": {"section": "opinion", "unique_id": "premiumchron-article-6824823"}, "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "[...] Houstonians who take a closer look at their local delegation may be surprised to discover that they're represented by several impressive elected officials.
