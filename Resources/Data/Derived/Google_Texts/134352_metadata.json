They had nukes pointed at us for 20 years.\u201d That pronouncement soon gets lost in more lame jokes about skateboarding kids getting \u201cnuked,\u201d but: point taken. No one has grown up under a Sword of Damocles bigger or sharper than that one. Neither the threat of international terrorism nor the menace of global warming can quite measure up to a nasty little thing we used to call MAD: Mutually Assured Destruction.\n\nIt was a 20th-century madness and malaise, but also the 20th century\u2019s glory, and historian Craig Nelson tells the tale with exceptional panache in \u201cThe Age of Radiance: The Epic Rise and Dramatic Fall of the Atomic Era.\u201d Because Nelson\u2019s purview in this book encompasses both nuclear power and nuclear weapons, the story isn\u2019t really over yet, even if the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown prompted more than 17 nations to begin phasing out their nuclear power plants. Nelson characterizes humanity\u2019s harnessing of the atom as a \u201cblessed curse,\u201d one that has taken many lives and (in the form of medical technologies) has saved others. And he concludes by pointing out that many leading environmentalists have now come to embrace (well-regulated) nuclear power as the only currently viable solution to the modern world\u2019s voracious energy demands.\n\nMostly, though, \u201cThe Age of Radiance\u201d is an example of top-notch storytelling. The earliest chapters are the most focused and effective, as Nelson traces the winding routes of several brilliant scientists from Europe to the isolated community of Los Alamos, N.M., in the early 1940s. This is far from the first time this narrative has been told, but Nelson\u2019s version is one of the best, an ideal balance of detail, character, conflict and information. \u201cThe Age of Radiance\u201d is unlikely to help a complete novice understand the workings of nuclear science, but that\u2019s not the book\u2019s purpose. It will, however, give readers a vivid picture of the apparatus around the science, from the bare-bones suburb erected to house the families of the Manhattan Project\u2019s staff to the winches and trestles and rods and massive graphite bricks used to build the world\u2019s first nuclear reactor in a decommissioned squash court at the University of Chicago in 1942, to the distinctive (and according to Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov, quite pleasant) smell of a nuclear explosion: ozone, \u201cfresh, clean and electric, like the air of great natural hydrodynamics, of Angel, of Niagara, of Victoria.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the characters. There\u2019s the outwardly dour but inwardly passionate Marie Curie, discoverer of radioactivity. There\u2019s the winning Enrico Fermi and his off-and-on partner/nemesis, the iconoclastic Leo Szilard, visionary physicists from Italy and Hungary, respectively, with diametrically opposed styles of pursuing the truth about the essence of matter. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who oversaw the Manhattan Project, is less emphasized here than in some other accounts of the building of the bomb, where he is often cast as a Faustian figure embodying an entire civilization\u2019s torment at what it has wrought. And in counterpoint to all the eggheads, there is Lt. Gen. Leslie Richard Groves, the notoriously choleric wrangler of the project, who told his officers, \u201cAt great expense, we have gathered on this mesa the largest collection of crackpots ever seen.\u201d It took the awe-inspiring spectacle of the test detonation of Trinity, the first atomic bomb, in the New Mexico desert to change his tune: \u201cGroves, grumbling as ever: \u2018Well, there must be something in nucleonics after all.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A page-turning history recounts the triumph and horror of humanity's quest to split the atom", "title": "\u201cThe Age of Radiance\u201d: The epic story of the Atomic Age", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A page-turning history recounts the triumph and horror of humanity's quest to split the atom", "title": "\u201cThe Age of Radiance\u201d: The epic story of the Atomic Age", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/the_age_of_radiance_the_epic_story_of_the_atomic_age/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/age_of_radiance.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A page-turning history recounts the triumph and horror of humanity's quest to split the atom", "title": "\u201cThe Age of Radiance\u201d: The epic story of the Atomic Age", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/age_of_radiance.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Must-Do, Nonfiction, Nuclear Power, Nuclear Weapons, Physics, Science, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Age of Radiance\u201d is unlikely to help a complete novice understand the workings of nuclear science, but that\u2019s not the book\u2019s purpose.\nMostly, though, \u201cThe Age of Radiance\u201d is an example of top-notch storytelling.\nAnd he concludes by pointing out that many leading environmentalists have now come to embrace (well-regulated) nuclear power as the only currently viable solution to the modern world\u2019s voracious energy demands.\nNo one has grown up under a Sword of Damocles bigger or sharper than that one.\nThey had nukes pointed at us for 20 years.\u201d That pronouncement soon gets lost in more lame jokes about skateboarding kids getting \u201cnuked,\u201d but: point taken."}
