Obamacare mandate lawsuit tossed\n\nA federal appeals court has summarily tossed a lawsuit challenging the Obama administration\u2019s delay of Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate \u2014 a case that is similar to the one that House Republicans plan to file against the president.\n\nThis suit was filed by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which argued that the delay could hurt doctors financially. But the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Friday said the plaintiffs don\u2019t have a right to sue.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA unanimous three-judge panel threw out the case only three days after oral argument, a breakneck speed.\n\nThe physicians\u2019 group argued that the Obama administration doesn\u2019t have the right to delay the implementation of the employer mandate, particularly without delaying the individual mandate, too. The doctors said they are harmed because when people pay the penalty, they have less income to buy medical care from them.\n\n\u201cThe [Supreme] Court has rejected efforts by one person to litigate about the amount of someone else\u2019s taxes (or someone else\u2019s subsidies, which are taxes in reverse),\u201d Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the three-judge panel, which also included Judges William Bauer and Richard Posner. All three were nominated to the bench by Republican presidents.\n\nThe House voted in July to sue Obama on the grounds that he exceeded his executive authority when the administration delayed penalizing companies for not following the employer mandate, which was supposed to begin Jan. 1.\n\nThe House has not yet filed the lawsuit. On Friday, the House replaced its lawyers after the previous attorney pulled out, citing pressure from other clients for the political nature of the suit, according to House staffers.\n\nHowever, the judge did hint at how someone could achieve standing to successfully file the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cOnly persons seeking to advance the interests\u201d of the employer mandate would have a \u201cplausible\u201d right to sue, Easterbrook wrote. \u201cSomeone else would be a much more appropriate champion of the contention that the IRS has not done what it should to accomplish the statute\u2019s goal of universal coverage.\u201d\n\nAndrew Schlafly, the attorney who represented AAPS, said the House\u2019s lawyers should heed a lesson in Easterbrook\u2019s opinion.\n\nIf there was \u201ca large company that was not [observing] the employer mandate \u2014 because Obama waived that for 2014 and for a lot of companies for 2015\u2014 one of those employees might have a plausible claim,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the House would add one of those individuals, that would give \u2014 or should give \u2014 the lawsuit standing.\u201d\n\nAAPS officials have not decided yet whether they will appeal, Schlafly said.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "An appeals court tosses a suit filed by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.", "title": "Obamacare mandate lawsuit tossed", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/obamacare-lawsuit-association-american-physicians-surgeons-111208.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/09/22/110922_gavel_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Lawsuits,Courts", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "An appeals court tosses a suit filed by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d31\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare mandate lawsuit tossedA federal appeals court has summarily tossed a lawsuit challenging the Obama administration\u2019s delay of Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate \u2014 a case that is similar to the one that House Republicans plan to file against the president.\n\u201cOnly persons seeking to advance the interests\u201d of the employer mandate would have a \u201cplausible\u201d right to sue, Easterbrook wrote.\nThe physicians\u2019 group argued that the Obama administration doesn\u2019t have the right to delay the implementation of the employer mandate, particularly without delaying the individual mandate, too.\nIf there was \u201ca large company that was not [observing] the employer mandate \u2014 because Obama waived that for 2014 and for a lot of companies for 2015\u2014 one of those employees might have a plausible claim,\u201d he said.\nHowever, the judge did hint at how someone could achieve standing to successfully file the lawsuit."}
