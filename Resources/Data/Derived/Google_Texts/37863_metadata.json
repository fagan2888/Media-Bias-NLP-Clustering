Borja Valero and Joan Verdu secured the points.\n\nAfter its best ever start to a Serie A season, Fiorentina was two points ahead of Inter and three ahead of Lazio, which beat Frosinone 2-0. Roma was a point further back after winning 4-2 at Palermo following a double from Gervinho.\n\n\u201cI like being honest,\u201d Fiorentina coach Paulo Sousa said when asked about his side\u2019s title chances. \u201cI believe there are better teams than us but we\u2019ll try to compete with them too.\u201d\n\nSami Khedira marked his Serie A debut with a goal to help four-time defending champion Juventus to only its second league win of the season as it came from behind to beat bottom side Bologna 3-1, but there was more misery for AC Milan which was thrashed 4-0 at home by Napoli.\n\nIt was Khedira\u2019s second match in a week after helping Juventus to a 2-0 victory over Sevilla in the Champions League on Wednesday. The German World Cup winner, who had been out of action for two months with a thigh injury, brings much-needed experience to the team.\n\n\u201cIt was an important win, I\u2019m happy for my goal but above all for the three points,\u201d Khedira said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only down to me that we\u2019ve won two matches with me on the pitch, but down to the whole team. Juventus needs 11 leaders, not just one.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Sassuolo saw its unbeaten run end with a 1-0 loss at Empoli and Udinese drew 1-1 against Genoa. Udinese striker Antonio Di Natale, who had his head heavily bandaged following an earlier collision, scored his 208th Serie A goal.\n\nAtalanta hadn\u2019t won in Florence since 1993 and any hopes they had of overturning that record disappeared when Paletta was sent off after he and teammate Alejandro Gomez tangled with Jakub Blaszczykowski, and Ilicic sent goalkeeper Marco Sportiello the wrong way.\n\nBorja Valero hit the crossbar before doubling Fiorentina\u2019s lead in the 34th following a swift one-two with Federico Bernardeschi.\n\nVerdu capped a great night for Fiorentina with his debut goal after a delightful flicked assist from Nikola Kalinic - last week\u2019s hat-trick scorer against Inter.\n\nNapoli\u2019s biggest ever victory over Milan was watched by the NBA\u2019s Boston Celtics, who are in town for Tuesday\u2019s match against Olimpia Milano.\n\nLorenzo Insigne scored two goals and set up Allan\u2019s opener before Rodrigo Ely\u2019s own goal completed a bad night for Milan.\n\nJuventus was looking to turn its league campaign around after five points from six rounds, despite a perfect record in the Champions League.\n\nIt was given an early scare when Anthony Mounier\u2019s powerful shot squirmed under Gianluigi Buffon to put Bologna ahead in the fifth minute.\n\nAlvaro Morata leveled in the 33rd when he was left completely unmarked to head home Khedira\u2019s deflected cross.\n\nThe Spaniard was also involved in Juve\u2019s other goals. Morata won the penalty which Paulo Dybala converted - after making the most of a slight tug by Bologna defender Alex Ferrari - and put a diagonal pass into the area for Khedira to nod home.\n\nInter was looking to get back on track after seeing its perfect start to the season shattered last week but it was Sampdoria which had the best of the first-half chances and Joaquin Correa had the worst miss of the season so far in the 38th minute.\n\nCorrea was one-on-one with Samir Handanovic and his effort took a lucky ricochet off the Inter goalkeeper to leave the Argentine midfielder in front of an open goal but he sent his effort wide of the far post from two yards out.\n\nLuis Muriel atoned for his teammate\u2019s error early in the second half, volleying in a cross from 17-year-old Pedro Pereira.\n\nInter leveled 14 minutes from time in somewhat chaotic fashion. Mauro Icardi\u2019s volley took a double ricochet but he was able to prod the rebound into the path of Ivan Perisic, who poked it into the bottom corner for his first Serie A goal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fiorentina eased to a 3-0 win over 10-man Atalanta to move into sole possession of top spot in Serie A after Inter Milan drew 1-1 at Sampdoria earlier Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fiorentina eased to a 3-0 win over 10-man Atalanta to move into sole possession of top spot in Serie A after Inter Milan drew 1-1 at Sampdoria earlier Sunday.", "title": "Fiorentina moves 2 points clear after 3-0 win over Atalanta", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/4/inter-rescues-1-1-draw-at-sampdoria-to-move-top-of/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/04/6a0ba5329721de2c830f6a706700cf89.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/04/6a0ba5329721de2c830f6a706700cf89.jpg", "description": "Fiorentina eased to a 3-0 win over 10-man Atalanta to move into sole possession of top spot in Serie A after Inter Milan drew 1-1 at Sampdoria earlier Sunday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Fiorentina moves 2 points clear after 3-0 win over Atalanta"}, "Author": "DANIELLA MATAR", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc38a\"", "article_summary": "After its best ever start to a Serie A season, Fiorentina was two points ahead of Inter and three ahead of Lazio, which beat Frosinone 2-0.\nMILAN (AP) - Fiorentina eased to a 3-0 win over 10-man Atalanta to move into sole possession of top spot in Serie A after Inter Milan drew 1-1 at Sampdoria earlier Sunday.\n\u201cIt was an important win, I\u2019m happy for my goal but above all for the three points,\u201d Khedira said.\nAtalanta was down to 10 men in the fifth minute when Gabriel Paletta was sent off and Josip Ilicic fired Fiorentina in front from the penalty spot.\nUdinese striker Antonio Di Natale, who had his head heavily bandaged following an earlier collision, scored his 208th Serie A goal."}
