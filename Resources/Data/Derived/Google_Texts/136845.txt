(KTVK-TV) — CHANDLER, Ariz. – A 65-year-old Sun Lakes woman was arrested after Chandler police said she injected fecal matter into her husband’s IV while he was recovering from surgery.

Rosemary Vogel faces felony charges of attempted first-degree murder and vulernable adult abuse.

Police said the 66-year-old man was in recovery following a surgical procedure on his heart at Chandler Regional Medical Center on Thursday and his wife was in the room with him.

Hospital staff went to the room after the warning alarm on the monitoring machines sounded and found Vogel manipulating her husband’s IV, according to Sgt. Joe Favazzo. A nurse found that the IV had a brown substance in the line and immediately removed it from the man’s arm.
