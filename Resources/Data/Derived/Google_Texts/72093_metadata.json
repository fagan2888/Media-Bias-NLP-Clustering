The brand, best known for its rubber wellington boots, is headed by Stella McCartney\u2019s husband Alasdhair Willis.\n\nHunter has only recently branched out into clothing - it was just the label\u2019s second season on the London Fashion Week circuit - but it proved it can put on a fun and slick show to go with its display of sporty casualwear.\n\nSaturday\u2019s showcase, staged at a disused indoor pool, was the buzziest event so far since the five-day style spectacle kicked off Friday. There was no swimming, but a giant video backdrop showing bubbling water, floating submarines and cartoon sharks made up for it.\n\nBoots, of course, featured prominently. Signature wellies, worn by both male and female models, came with buckles and were printed with eye-catching color blocks. There were also flat sandals and army boots, some with chunky platform heels.\n\nModels sported rain jackets, parkas, shorts and culottes - many in low-key military greens and browns, though outfits in bright turquoise, lavender and vibrant graphic stripes provided a burst of color and style.\n\nPaul McCartney arrived at the last minute, wearing a pink button-down shirt and a dark sports jacket. The former Beatle appeared cheerful, posing with his daughter and smiling mischievously for the cameras.\n\nDid he like the show? \u201cTerrific,\u201d he said with a grin, before being whisked away by his security guards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not every day that you see not just one, but two McCartneys on the front row.", "Author": "SYLVIA HUI", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It\u2019s not every day that you see not just one, but two McCartneys on the front row.", "title": "Paul, Stella McCartney front row at Hunter\u2019s show", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/13/paul-stella-mccartney-front-row-at-hunters-show/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/13/242e77ca100e98245f0f6a70670024f1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/13/242e77ca100e98245f0f6a70670024f1.jpg", "title": "Paul, Stella McCartney front row at Hunter\u2019s show", "description": "It's not every day that you see not just one, but two McCartneys on the front row.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbc4\"", "article_summary": "The brand, best known for its rubber wellington boots, is headed by Stella McCartney\u2019s husband Alasdhair Willis.\nPaul McCartney and his fashion designer daughter Stella caused a stir as they sat down to watch the catwalk show staged Saturday by Hunter Original, squeezing in next to pop star Rita Ora and Vogue editor Anna Wintour.\nPaul McCartney arrived at the last minute, wearing a pink button-down shirt and a dark sports jacket.\nLONDON (AP) - It\u2019s not every day that you see not just one, but two McCartneys on the front row.\nSignature wellies, worn by both male and female models, came with buckles and were printed with eye-catching color blocks."}
