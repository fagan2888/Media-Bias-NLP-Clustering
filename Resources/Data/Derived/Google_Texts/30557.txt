SUMMIT COUNTY, Colo. -- The Colorado Department of Transportation announced it would test its Bus to Shoulder pilot program along the Interstate 70 mountain corridor Sunday.

CDOT said the test would begin around 1 p.m. Sunday and conclude around 6 p.m.

There will be no passengers on the two buses used in the test, said CDOT, as it is simply another test of a system intended to help ease traffic congestion along I-70 during peak hours.
