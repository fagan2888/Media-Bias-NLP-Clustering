Council member Muriel E. Bowser huddled with supporters Thursday evening, thanking them for delivering a straw-poll victory in Anacostia, some in the crowd awash in her campaign\u2019s trademark green had just packed away signs of another color.\n\nRed-white-and-blue placards, fliers and T-shirts paid for by a mystery group appeared in some of the District\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River on Thursday \u2014 areas that Bowser (D-Ward 4) is counting on in her bid to win the mayoral election Nov. 4.\n\nThe signs blared messages denouncing the candidate whom polls identify as Bowser\u2019s chief opponent, council member David A. Catania (I-At Large), and his \u201cwar against the poor.\u201d The main message \u2014 \u201cDC CITIZENS AGAINST CATANIA\u201d \u2014 was not accompanied by a line indicating who paid for the signs, as required under city election laws.\n\nJoaquin McPeek, a spokesman for Bowser, said Saturday that the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign has nothing to do with the signs. A dozen people who wore the T-shirts and held the signs outside the final mayoral debate at Anacostia High School on Thursday evening would not say who provided them.\n\nAt least three people who held the signs are active in the District in promoting rights of ex-offenders, or \u201creturning citizens,\u201d as advocates and city officials prefer to call them.\n\nThe groups have coalesced behind Bowser in recent weeks, several said, after a teleconference with the candidate that several participated in about a month ago. Several said that Bowser had also promised to take seriously the challenges that returning citizens face, such as high unemployment and affordable housing.\n\nEddie Moton, an organizer for ex-offenders, pulled a blue anti-Catania\u00ad T-shirt over his head as voters began to arrive at the debate and chanted, \u201cCitizens against Catania.\u201d Two others wore the shirts over green Bowser tops that they already were wearing.\n\nBy the end of the evening, Moton stood beside Yango Sawyer, a well-known advocate for several returning-citizen groups, including Families of Returned and Returning Citizens. Both Sawyer and Moton stood in Bowser\u2019s circle of supporters after the straw-poll results were announced, cheering and wearing green.\n\n\u201cA lot of individuals here tonight are individuals who came out as a result of mobilizing, organizing,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cWe got people throughout the city, man, energized in our population so we can make a difference in this election year. We feel as if our voice has to be heard and Bowser is the best candidate for our issues.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he or his groups were paying for the anti-Catania\u00ad messages, Sawyer said only that those holding the signs represented \u201cmore than just returning citizens.\u201d\n\nAs the straw poll was underway, Debra Rowe, the longtime director of Returning Citizens United, passed out a mock ballot with pictures of a man and women, one wearing a shirt that read \u201cEX-FELON,\u201d and the other wearing one that read \u201cdo u count?\u201d The ballot, which listed Rowe and Sawyer as contacts, urged returning citizens to vote for Bowser because, among other reasons, she would \u201cincrease funding for the Office of Returning Citizen Affairs.\u201d\n\nRowe, who backed Andy Shallal during the Democratic primary, said she was won over by Bowser in the spring after conversations with the candidate about the need to focus more on the plight of returning citizens.\n\n\u201cAfter a conversation with her, she said, \u2018I\u2019ve had to step back and take a look at myself, especially with all the criticism,\u2019 and she\u2019s going to do better,\u201d Rowe said.\n\nRowe and Catania have a bitter history. Ben Young, Catania\u2019s campaign manager, called the illegal attack ads \u201cmore of the same underhanded stuff we have seen for years. . . . And why voters are going to stop voting business as usual.\u201d\n\nTwo other advocates for returning citizens pointed to Sawyer as the lead organizer, including Ronald L. Moten, co-founder of the anti-violence youth group Peaceoholics, which a judge recently ruled had misused city grant funding.\n\nMoten said he knew of some returning-citizen advocates who were swayed by Bowser after their teleconference with her a little over a month ago.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s agreed to sit down and talk with the population after the election, including on one thing that I want to see which is entrepreneurship, where we will be empowered, not just through the office of returning citizens, but through the city\u2019s\u201d employment office \u201cto connect returning citizens with jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nBowser campaign officials said last week that there was no campaign event with returning citizen groups, but McPeek said Saturday that there was a call between Bowser and the groups in late August.\n\n\u201cMuriel Bowser has brought many groups together to discuss their issues. This is nothing different,\u201d McPeek said.\n\nBowser and Catania have promised in their campaign platforms to expand jobs programs for returning citizens. Bowser on Friday also spent several minutes discussing returning citizens in a teleconference at a town hall for women\u2019s issues. \u201cThis is an issue for men and women,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cThere are women taking care of men\u201d returning to our communities.\n\nReturning-citizens groups have scheduled a news conference Monday outside the D.C. elections office, in part to demand same-day registration this fall in the D.C. jail.\n\nUnder some of the country\u2019s most liberal voting rights laws, more types of convicted criminals are eligible to vote in the District than nearly anywhere else: felons, parolees, probationers and even those in jail awaiting sentencing or serving out misdemeanor sentences.\n\nA widely cited study from 2011 put the number of D.C. residents with a criminal record at 1 in 10. It remains unclear how many vote. One returning-citizen group says it has registered 2,600 voters this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Organizations that advocate for the rights of \u201creturning citizens\u201d back Muriel E.
