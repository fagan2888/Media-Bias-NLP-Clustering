(NYSE:AET), the third-biggest US health insurer, is currently in the process to acquire Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), as the industry rapidly consolidates. On Wednesday, the company released better-than-expected financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, making it more plausible for the deal to come through.\n\nAetna awaits antitrust regulatory approval for the $37 billion cash-and-stock deal, along with rival insurer Anthem Inc. (NYSE:ANTM), which seeks a similar merger with Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI). The Affordable Care Act has increased the number of Americans with health insurance, causing big insurers in the country to consolidate in an effort to reduce medical and underwritten costs. As a result of the mergers, the nation\u2019s health insurance industry would shrink into four or five large players, driving up insurance premiums. With the controversies surrounding Obamacare already, there is high likelihood that the Obama administration will approve only one of the proposed deals.\n\nAetna\u2019s latest-quarter results, however, indicate that the insurer is well-positioned to handle additional customers that will result from a merger. The company said that higher premiums and lower costs in its Medicare and Medicaid businesses help to counter the impact of risk adjustment payments arising from Obamacare, as enrollment of sicker consumers increases.\n\nAetna announced in its earnings call that its overall medical membership grew 2.5% year-over-year (YoY) to 23.7 million in the second quarter. Out of this, Medicaid membership went up 4% to 2.14 million, while Medicare Advantage membership rose 11% to 1.23 million. At the same time, the company\u2019s overall medical loss ratio (amount of revenue used to pay medical claims) went down from 83.1% in the same quarter last year, to 81.1% in the latest quarter.\n\nThe medical loss ratio for Aetna\u2019s government business went down from 86.5% to 80.3%, while that for commercial business rose from 80.6% to 81.8%. Overall, the company reported per-share adjusted earnings of $2.05, up 21% YoY and surpassing Street\u2019s expectation of $1.82. Second-quarter revenue grew 4.4% YoY to $15.13 billion, narrowly missing the consensus estimate of $15.4 billion.\n\nThe full-year 2015 earnings guidance was raised from the range of $7.2 to $7.4 per share, to at least $7.4 per share. Meanwhile, the Street expects Aetna\u2019s profit per share to climb 10.2% to $8.18 in 2016, with sales predicted to rise 7.4% to $66.12 billion.\n\nLast week, Humana reported a 25% increase in its second-quarter profit. Its revenue, however, missed expectations as its Medicare Advantage business struggled. It is expected that Aetna\u2019s booming government business will help Humana on that front, if the acquisition comes through.\n\nAetna shares went up 1.08% in yesterday\u2019s trade to close at $115.02. Meanwhile, Humana stock closed 0.4% lower at $182.33. It must be remembered that Humana still trades at a significant discount of 17.6% to the current value of Aetna\u2019s cash-and-stock offer ($125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each Humana share). This represents a big gap compared to other takeover arbitrage spreads, and indicates market skepticism toward a deal approval.", "article_metadata": {"DESCRIPTION": "Aetna Inc (NYSE:AET) reports better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, as the health insurer benefits from Affordable Care Act.", "COPYRIGHT": "2016 Bidness Etc", "AUTHOR": "Hannah Ishmael", "og": {"url": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/49408-what-aetna-inc-aet-earnings-beat-means-for-humana-inc-deal/", "image": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/what-aetna-inc-aet-earnings-beat-means-for-humana-inc-deal.jpg", "type": "Business_news", "description": "Aetna Inc (NYSE:AET) reports better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, as the health insurer benefits from Affordable Care Act.", "title": "What Aetna Inc (AET) Earnings Beat Means For Humana Inc Deal"}, "IMAGE": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/what-aetna-inc-aet-earnings-beat-means-for-humana-inc-deal.jpg", "syndication-source": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/49408-what-aetna-inc-aet-earnings-beat-means-for-humana-inc-deal/", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"description": "Aetna Inc (NYSE:AET) reports better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, as the health insurer benefits from Affordable Care Act.", "title": "What Aetna Inc (AET) Earnings Beat Means For Humana Inc Deal", "url": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/49408-what-aetna-inc-aet-earnings-beat-means-for-humana-inc-deal/", "image": {"width": "1280px", "identifier": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/what-aetna-inc-aet-earnings-beat-means-for-humana-inc-deal.jpg", "height": "720px"}, "site": "@Bidnessetc", "player": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/video/embed/bank-america-merrill-lynch-others-slow-start/", "height": 270}, "card": "photo"}, "language": "english", "fb": {"admins": "bidnessetc", "app_id": 441098346005934}, "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "KEYWORDS": "Aetna Inc (NYSE:AET), Humana Inc (NYSE:HUM), Anthem Inc (ANTM)", "article": {"section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-08-05"}, "news_keywords": "Aetna Inc (NYSE:AET), Humana Inc (NYSE:HUM), Anthem Inc (ANTM)", "THUMBNAIL": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/310-what-aetna-inc-aet-earnings-beat-means-for-humana-inc-deal.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "SUBJECT": "Driving The Financial Data Revolution Bidnessetc.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaab9\"", "article_summary": "Aetna announced in its earnings call that its overall medical membership grew 2.5% year-over-year (YoY) to 23.7 million in the second quarter.\nIt must be remembered that Humana still trades at a significant discount of 17.6% to the current value of Aetna\u2019s cash-and-stock offer ($125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each Humana share).\nThe medical loss ratio for Aetna\u2019s government business went down from 86.5% to 80.3%, while that for commercial business rose from 80.6% to 81.8%.\nAetna Inc.
