For that reason, Reid has been more than willing to shield his vulnerable Democrats from casting votes on politically charged amendments even if he takes sustained fire from the GOP for running a dysfunctional Senate.\n\nWhile Republicans say Democrats are still saddled with backing much of Obama\u2019s agenda and helping enact controversial laws over health care and financial services, some Republicans wish they could make Reid\u2019s handling of the Senate an even bigger focus this midterm season.\n\n( Full 2014 election results)\n\n\u201cIt should be a bigger issue,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, a top official at the Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm. \u201cI wish it were something that more people are interested in, it\u2019s partly our fault in not having a way to describe it in a way that makes sense to people and how it affects their lives.\u201d\n\nThe Senate plans to adjourn Thursday until after the elections, avoiding many hot-button votes over changing Obamacare, illegal immigration and taxes. It caps a yearlong effort by Senate Democratic leaders who have the singular focus aimed at bolstering the reelection chances of senators from battleground states \u2014 namely Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alaska, New Hampshire and Colorado.\n\nWith the race for the Senate still very competitive, the pressure has grown on Reid\u2019s inner circle to amp up fundraising.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the No. 3 Senate leader, quietly transferred $1 million out of his campaign account this week to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, according to a source familiar with the matter. (He had $13.3 million in cash through the end of June.)\n\n( See more from POLITICO's Polling Center)\n\nAnd in addition to headlining a slew of fundraising events for the DSCC and Senate candidates, Reid has attended a staggering 81 meetings in 13 cities with big-dollar donors for the high-spending Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC spending more than any other Democratic outside group to save its party\u2019s majority, a source said. Reid will attend even more in the final stretch of the season.\n\nRepublicans need to win a net of six seats to take back the majority and already essentially have three in the bag: Montana, West Virginia and South Dakota. But holding all the GOP seats and picking off three of those six Democratic seats in battleground states \u2014 as well as Iowa \u2014 is anything but a sure bet.\n\nWith less ammunition to use against their incumbents, Democrats hope that enough of their members will survive.\n\n\u201cThe two overriding issues that the public cares about are obstruction and bipartisanship but I don\u2019t think the specifics of what happens in the Senate affects them as much as those two,\u201d said Schumer, blaming the GOP for obstructing hot-button economic issues.\n\nFor that reason, Reid has scheduled votes on a politically populist agenda devised by Schumer aimed at forcing Republicans to block bills aimed at wooing students, women, seniors and the middle class. Democrats have repeatedly put forth bills that have little chance of passing \u2014 like on increasing the minimum wage, gender pay equity, contraception access and student loan assistance. And even when there are efforts they actually support \u2014 such as Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration \u2014 Democratic leaders have lobbied the White House to punt on the issue to avoid hurting their vulnerable incumbents and candidates in red states.\n\nBehind the scenes, the fundraising game has stepped up.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The pressure grows on the Senate majority leader's inner circle to amp up fundraising.", "title": "Reid's plot to keep the Senate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/harry-reid-senate-elections-2014-111115.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/09/16/140916_harry_reid_js_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Senate,2014 Elections,Harry Reid", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The pressure grows on the Senate majority leader's inner circle to amp up fundraising.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd647e\"", "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO Reid's plot to keep the SenateSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid believes Republicans have walked into his trap.\nRob Portman of Ohio, a top official at the Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm.\nWith the race for the Senate still very competitive, the pressure has grown on Reid\u2019s inner circle to amp up fundraising.\nStory Continued BelowBut in Reid\u2019s mind, Republicans are training all their fire on a guy most voters barely even know.\nIt caps a yearlong effort by Senate Democratic leaders who have the singular focus aimed at bolstering the reelection chances of senators from battleground states \u2014 namely Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alaska, New Hampshire and Colorado."}
