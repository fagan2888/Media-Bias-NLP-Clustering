In addition to allowing citizens to grow, buy and sell weed, the government will also set forth on its mission to grow its own fields of marijuana, which will then be harvested, taxed and sold in neighborhood pharmacies.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the theory.\n\nBut growing weed takes a while. Cultivating fields of it, figuring out how to keep the fields safe from poachers, harvesting vast amounts of cannabis, packaging it, taxing it, distributing it and selling it take even longer.\n\nLong story short: Uruguay\u2019s government is not going to be producing much of its own cannabis any time soon. So, where is the official stash going to come from in the meantime?\n\nMaybe Canada.\n\nAccording to senior-ranking officials in the ruling Broad Front Party, including Sen. Lucia Topolansky, who\u2019s also Uruguay\u2019s first lady, Canadian medical marijuana producers could provide this tiny Latin American nation with a stopgap until it figures out how to grow and harvest its own crop.\n\n\u201cTo start with, we will have to buy cannabis,\u201d Topolansky said in an interview last week. \u201cI think that we\u2019re going to buy it from Canada, because that\u2019s where the best quality is.\u201d\n\nTo be clear: This is still just an idea. Neither country has announced a deal to ship pot from Vancouver to Montevideo. A spokeswoman for Health Canada wrote by email, \u201cThere are currently no plans to encourage the export of cannabis to Uruguay or any other country.\u201d\n\nBut could it happen?\n\nWell, it\u2019s complicated. Let\u2019s take a look at four key questions.\n\n1. Does Canada have weed to sell?\n\nIn short: Yes, but not a whole lot \u2014 yet.\n\nUnder Canada\u2019s latest medical marijuana laws, there are about 10 companies currently licensed to grow pot. Marc Wayne, president of Toronto-based Bedrocan Canada Inc., one of the biggest suppliers, said the companies are struggling to meet demand inside Canada.\n\nThe Canadian law governing medical marijuana has a provision that allows the government to issue export licenses to growers. However, the authorities will not start issuing export licenses until they\u2019re satisfied Canadians have access to all the pot they need.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any export to Uruguay, or anyone else, any time soon,\u201d Wayne said.\n\n2. Is marijuana import and export economically feasible?\n\nIn short: Probably not, at least not from Canada to Uruguay.\n\nThe Uruguayan government has announced a lofty goal to sell cannabis at $1 a gram. That\u2019s the price point at which it will be competitive against the black market, national drug czar Julio Calzada has said.\n\nOn the streets of Montevideo, poor quality pot, most of it from Paraguay or Brazil, currently sells at about $100 for 25 grams, or about $4 a gram, according to research by Insight Crime.\n\nIn Canada, weed is much more expensive than that. Currently, a gram of medical pot sells for a minimum of about 7.60 Canadian dollars a gram (about $6.80), said Steve Thomas, general manager of the Whistler Medical Marijuana Co. His company\u2019s cannabis, which is grown organically, sells for about CA$10 a gram (about $8.95).\n\nOnce the cost of shipping and jumping through regulatory hurdles is taken into account, it probably wouldn\u2019t make sense to export to a country like Uruguay, where disposable income is low compared with more developed countries, Thomas said.\n\nHe said his company is certainly eyeing the export market, but he\u2019s looking at countries with higher incomes, such as the Czech Republic or Israel, as possible targets for growth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The South American country hopes to kick-start its newly legalized pot industry -- but is such a move feasible?", "title": "Uruguay may import weed from Canada", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The South American country hopes to kick-start its newly legalized pot industry -- but is such a move feasible?", "title": "Uruguay may import weed from Canada", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/22/should_uruguay_get_its_weed_from_canada_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The South American country hopes to kick-start its newly legalized pot industry -- but is such a move feasible?", "title": "Uruguay may import weed from Canada", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/marijuana.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Will Carless", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Canada, GlobalPost, marijuana, Uruguay, weed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefe1\"", "article_summary": "In Canada, weed is much more expensive than that.\nTopics: Canada, GlobalPost, marijuana, Uruguay, weed, Sustainability News, Working Ahead News, Business News, Life News, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostIn about a month, Uruguay\u2019s revolutionary new cannabis law will go into effect.\nUnder Canada\u2019s latest medical marijuana laws, there are about 10 companies currently licensed to grow pot.\nMarc Wayne, president of Toronto-based Bedrocan Canada Inc., one of the biggest suppliers, said the companies are struggling to meet demand inside Canada.\nIn short: Probably not, at least not from Canada to Uruguay."}
