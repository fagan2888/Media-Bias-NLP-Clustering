That\u2019s always been the way in the United States. You don\u2019t necessarily want to be a recipient state because that means you have characteristics that require you to have more money than you\u2019re able to raise in terms of taxes.\n\nIs this a problem for Nevada that we\u2019re last?\n\nIt is striking how Nevada does seem (to be) at the bottom of the list no matter how you cut it in terms of federal grants per capita or absolute amounts and various metrics. When you dig a little bit deeper, then you see that some of this is explained by demographics. But I think the bigger issue is \u2026 on the discretionary (spending) side, that\u2019s really where maybe the state could do more. You don\u2019t want to leave money lying on the table, basically. The (recent federal grants for) job training, that was a case where there was something like $2 billion available and the state just sort of didn\u2019t go for it.\n\nWhose responsibility is this?\n\nIt requires a state\u2019s (congressional) delegation to work effectively together. Having a more senior person, if you look at these general studies, having more senior members of Congress acting on your behalf certainly helps. But you certainly want a state delegation to work together, and from a state\u2019s perspective, you have to go after the money when it\u2019s there. So I think it\u2019s a combination of those two things.\n\nThe title of your upcoming lecture poses a question: by choice or by chance? Which is it?\n\nIt\u2019s both. The important thing people need to understand about any federal system is the virtue of any federal system is diversity. States end up in different places oftentimes because of where they start. A lot of differences between Nevada and other places is baked into the cake. So that\u2019s the \"by chance.\" You have a certain endowment of resources, and that can include things like natural resources and energy as well as the populations you\u2019re serving.\n\nThe \"by choice\" part is the sort of policy choices you make.\n\nHow does Nevada\u2019s decision to opt in to the Medicaid expansion under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act come into play here? Isn\u2019t that a lot of new federal money?\n\nI think the ACA expansion just illustrates this general tension between the federal government and the states, the uncertainty at the state level when it comes to putting together a budget, especially now with the federal government in such seeming disarray when it comes to the budget process. The larger issue is uncertainty about how federal policy decisions will affect not just state and local governments but state and local economies and the recovery that is underway. It\u2019s very hard to even put together a budget when you don\u2019t know what grants from the federal government are going to look like. We saw this last year with the fiscal cliff.\n\nDoes that mean that Nevada is having this discussion too late, that we\u2019ve missed the boat on a lot of this money?\n\nNo. The federal government faces serious long-term budget challenges, and for that reason we could see some changes to major programs affecting state and local governments.\n\nThe federal government faces this long-term position of an aging population and rising healthcare costs, so as a result they\u2019re looking at things that cost a lot like tax expenditures and major programs, so that\u2019s a bigger source of uncertainty for state and local governments.\n\nThe sequester decreased money to all state and local governments.\n\nThe federal government continues to play a big part in state and local finances, but the terms of that arrangement are anything but clear in terms of the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal prognosis.\n\nHow do you link all of this state, local, federal spending all together?\n\nI think that everyone has an interest in understanding where their government gets money and where it spends it, and a significant amount of money comes from the federal government. So we\u2019re all in this together. It sounds sometimes like a very elegant waltz, but it\u2019s really like two kids in a cotillion class and they\u2019re kind of stepping on each other and kind of annoying each other but they\u2019re still kind of locked in this embrace together. I don\u2019t see the terms of the relationships changing that much, but certainly I think we\u2019re in for a couple of rocky years ahead in terms of things the federal government would like to do with the ACA, problems the state governments are dealing with and problems the federal government is dealing with.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nevada ranks dead last in per capita federal funding for health, education, housing, science and transportation, according to the Brookings Institution.
