Remember Beth? Last we saw of her, she was riding off in a car with a white cross painted on the rear windshield. Daryl tried to follow, couldn\u2019t keep up, and then everybody sort of forgot about her for a while, because that was narratively convenient. (In the show and characters\u2019 defense, there\u2019s also a certain ruthless pragmatism to this that makes sense coming from a group of survivors: you learn not to ask too many questions when someone you love is missing, because the answers will always be bad.) But now we\u2019re a bit into the new season, the main crisis for the rest of the group has passed, so it\u2019s time to figure out what the hell happened to everyone\u2019s favorite pleasant-blonde-teenager-who-likes-to-sing-and-it\u2019s-ironically-pretty. (Also-she-does-that-wide-eyed-thing-so-damn-often-she\u2019s-like-an-anime-character.)\n\nTurns out, nothing good has been happening to Beth, which should surprise no one. Good things rarely happen on The Walking Dead, and they happen even more rarely to people who were taken against their will to a secret location and told they\u2019d have to work off their \u201cdebt\u201d before they\u2019d be allowed to leave. Beth wakes up in a hospital room. She was \u201crescued\u201d by a small group of rigidly controlled survivors. The group is divided into specific roles\u2014there are \u201cofficers,\u201d men and women in police uniforms who run the place and go outside looking for new \u201crecruits.\u201d And then there\u2019s the medical staff: Dr. Steven Edwards leads a handful of men and women dressed in hospital scrubs, working to keep the strays the officers bring in alive.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a sort of logic to all this, but one of the episode\u2019s big problems is that the logic is never quite as coherent or effective as it ought to be. Beth wakes up, realizes soon enough she\u2019s in a bad spot, and that\u2019s no surprise; pretty much any community our heroes have come across over the run of the show has had some dark secret holding it together. This makes narrative sense. If Rick and the others stumbled over a group of survivors who were happy and healthy and getting by, and they didn\u2019t turn out to be secret fascists or cannibals or whatever, there\u2019d be no real reason to keep hunting for some new place of safety. Until very recently, the only real goal for the show\u2019s main characters was \u201cfind somewhere we can survive.\u201d Now there\u2019s Eugene and his magical plan to stop the zombies, but even taking that into account, the odds of Beth being dragged to a place where everything was basically a-okay were pretty much nil.\n\n\n\nTo its credit, \u201cSlabtown\u201d doesn\u2019t spend any real time pretending things in the hospital aren\u2019t horribly wrong. The challenge is in making this particular outpost of assholes distinct enough to be interesting. And that\u2019s a challenge the script never quite overcomes. Part of it is the logic issue mentioned above. The system Beth finds herself trapped in becomes clear over the course of the hour, but there\u2019s no real sharpness to that clarity. It\u2019s not a tricky concept, admittedly: Beth \u201cowes\u201d for her room and board\u2014a debt that requires her to keep working, and provides an illusion of authenticity to her confinement. Officer Dawn can claim that Beth isn\u2019t being held against her will, and this is all part of a totally above-board arrangement. Maybe a bit harsh, but that\u2019s the world they\u2019re living in.\n\n\n\nSo Officer Dawn is yet another in the show\u2019s long run of obsessive, controlling nitwits who tell themselves they\u2019re making all these sacrifices (and demanding all these sacrifices of others) for the common good. (Rick is this type too, he\u2019s just slightly more decent about it.) What keeps this from really clicking is that none of it is as specific as it needs to be. The \u201canother day older and deeper in debt\u201d system never seems all that pressing or important, since it\u2019s obvious that Beth is being held against her will almost from the moment she wakes up. Few of the people she meets stand out as anything more than the most basic of stock types. Oh look, there\u2019s a dude who is creepy and ends up trying to rape Beth. That\u2019s new. I have no doubt the world after the fall of civilization would be full of incredibly vile assholes like Officer Gorman, but that doesn\u2019t make him particularly interesting to watch.\n\n\n\nThat, really, is the issue. We know Beth is stuck here for a bit, we know she\u2019s going to learn things are not safe or fun in this new place, and we know that, eventually, Daryl and Carol are going to arrive to break her out. (The best moment of the entire hour comes at the end, when the cops wheel in Carol on a gurney. The sudden \u201cOh, this shit just got real\u201d feeling is marvellous.) Which means this hour is in the poor position of killing time until the actual important events pick up again. To make that work, there needs to be some reason to watch this beyond simple narrative hole filling, and I don\u2019t think \u201cSlabtown\u201d really achieves that. Say what you will about the Governor\u2019s sojourns last season, at least there was something queasily uncertain about everything. Here, it\u2019s all exactly as you\u2019d expect. Even the discovery that the officers under Dawn are threatening to mutiny leaves little impression. We barely know any of them. Who the hell cares what they do?\n\n\n\nApart from Beth, the only two characters to register at all are Dr. Edwards and Noah, another \u201crecruit\u201d like Beth who\u2019s planning an escape. Noah is mostly interesting because he actually survives the escape attempt, even as Beth (who joins him) is recaptured; it\u2019s a relief to see the show briefly allowing some possibility for hope, even if Noah is almost certainly doomed later on. (Maybe he ran into Carol and Daryl and gave them the lowdown on Beth\u2019s situation.) Dr. Edwards is interesting because he seems like a smart, decent man, right up until he uses Beth to solidify his position in the camp. It\u2019s a betrayal that registers far more painfully than any of Officer Dawn\u2019s idiotic, straining lectures. Edwards is kind and thoughtful, and provides most of the background info we get in the episode. He legitimately seems to care about Beth; in fact, I\u2019d say there isn\u2019t really a \u201cseems\u201d about it. And yet when Dawn and the others bring in an injured man with a hospital ID card, Edwards manipulates Beth into giving him the wrong dosage of meds and killing him. That\u2019s the end of the world for you: kindness is still possible, but practicality (Edwards needs to make sure he\u2019s the only doctor available, because if there\u2019s another one, he\u2019ll lose his position and maybe wind up dead.) trumps all.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a lesson we\u2019ve learned several times before, though. The real reason Edwards\u2019 betrayal has some bite to it is that Edwards himself was convincingly friendly; even more interesting is that his character remains consistent even after Beth realizes the truth. He\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s just compromised and weak, in ways that dilute (but don\u2019t completely destroy) the kindness he showed earlier. That\u2019s decent writing, and it\u2019s the sort of complex thinking the episode could\u2019ve used more of. As is, it\u2019s a detour that never entirely justifies its existence. Thankfully, next week should have some more spark.\n\n\n\nStray observations:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/walking-dead-slabtown-211307", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5259/68/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hey, it\u2019s Beth!
