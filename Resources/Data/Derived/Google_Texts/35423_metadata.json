Diane Black along with Congressman Jeff Fortenberry and Congressman John Fleming announced the reintroduction of H.R. 940, the Health Care Conscience Rights Act. The bill would protect Americans\u2019 freedom of conscience and stop the Obama Administration\u2019s attack on religious liberty.\n\nH.R. 940 offers full exemption from Obamacare\u2019s Health and Human Services (HHS) mandate and ensures protections for individuals and healthcare entities that refuse to provide, pay for, or refer patients to abortion providers because of their deeply held beliefs.\n\nThe legislation would also specifically address the unlawful violation of religious freedom in California, where the state Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) issued a directive requiring that all insurance plans offered on the state exchange include coverage for abortions, including plans provided by churches, religious entities, and others with conscionable objections to such procedures. The Health Care Conscience Rights Act has the bipartisan support of 110 cosponsors.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom is a bedrock value of our society but, on President Obama\u2019s watch, this time-honored principle is under assault,\u201d said Congressman Diane Black. \u201cFrom Obamacare\u2019s coercive HHS mandate to the unlawful, pro-abortion directive by the state boards in California, it is clear that Congress must act where the White House will not and reverse this infringement of our First Amendment rights. That is why our bill offers full exemption from the HHS mandate and provides needed legal protections for healthcare entities who refuse to partake in the barbaric practice of abortion. As a nurse for more than 40 years, I am proud to introduce this legislation that will safeguard the conscience rights of every American and ensure that more unborn lives can be saved in the process.\u201d\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\n\u201cThe rights of conscience and religious freedom preexist the government. They are rights grounded by the demands of human dignity and are enshrined in our Constitution. It is a true poverty\u2014that in the name of health care\u2014this most cherished American principle is under assault, violating longstanding legislative agreement and precedent. The Health Care Conscience Rights Act restores this principle for all Americans,\u201d said Congressman Jeff Fortenberry.\n\n\u201cThe Administration\u2019s actions are a direct assault on Americans\u2019 religious liberties, forcing people of faith to violate their deeply held religious beliefs,\u201d said Congressman John Fleming. \u201cH.R. 940 will get at the heart of the issue: providing protections against coercive government practices; codifying the Weldon amendment to allow physicians and health care entities to provide quality care without being forced to participate in an abortion; and providing a private right of action so that victims of government discrimination can seek justice.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate in favor of family businesses in last year\u2019s Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stories, Inc. verdict, however Congressional action is still needed to bring clarity to this debate.\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s ruling, HHS devised an \u201caccommodation\u201d that still requires closely held, faith-based businesses to contract out with insurance companies that will provide coverage for the morally objectionable drugs and devices. The Obama Administration\u2019s workaround does nothing to allow small business owners the freedom to provide health care plans that match their values, it simply removes the employers\u2019 \u201cfingerprints\u201d from the transaction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Bill Would Stop Obama's HHS Mandate From Forcing Groups to Pay for Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "A new Congressional bill with 110 co-sponsors would stop the Obama administration's HHS mandate, which requires religious businesses, colleges and organizations", "title": "New Bill Would Stop Obama\u2019s HHS Mandate From Forcing Groups to Pay for Abortions", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/02/27/new-bill-would-stop-obamas-hhs-mandate-from-forcing-groups-to-pay-for-abortions/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/religiousfreedom2.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "new bill would stop obama\\'s hhs mandate from forcing groups to pay for abortions", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfed\"", "article_summary": "940, the Health Care Conscience Rights Act.\nThe Health Care Conscience Rights Act has the bipartisan support of 110 cosponsors.\nThat is why our bill offers full exemption from the HHS mandate and provides needed legal protections for healthcare entities who refuse to partake in the barbaric practice of abortion.\nA new Congressional bill with 110 co-sponsors would stop the Obama administration\u2019s HHS mandate, which requires religious businesses, colleges and organizations to pay for abortion-causing drugs in their employee health insurance plans.\nThe Health Care Conscience Rights Act restores this principle for all Americans,\u201d said Congressman Jeff Fortenberry."}
