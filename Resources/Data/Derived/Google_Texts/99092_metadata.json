Why would people toy around with a \u201cSlime Bomb\u201d in front of the whole world?\n\nOh right. They can win half-a-million dollars.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s a fake Wile E. Coyote bomb, they have a chance to win real money,\u201d Papa said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something really intense about it. This money could change people\u2019s lives. And they\u2019re cutting this wire. It\u2019s very real.\u201d\n\nWhat a funny career Papa has. He hosted \u201cThe Marriage Ref\u201d on NBC. He was in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s/Matt Damon\u2019s films \u201cThe Informant!\u201d and \u201cBehind the Candelabra.\u201d Papa has a podcast/radio show, \u201cCome To Papa.\u201d And he will be in more upcoming episodes of Soderbergh\u2019s TV show \u201cThe Knick.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, show business is so unpredictable, Papa said his legacy could end up being that he slimes people on Fox.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent all this time doing stand up and writing scripts, but I know this will be the thing that runs for 10 years,\u201d Papa joked/hoped.\n\nBy the way, his radio show/podcast is great. Sometimes, he interviews a friend like Jerry Seinfeld. But for other episodes, he stages huge productions akin to public radio\u2019s \u201cA Prairie Home Companion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was always a fan of Garrison Keillor (of \u2018A Prarie Home Companion\u2019). I was, like, \u2018What would that show be like in the hands of comedians?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Papa still regards stand-up as the best thing he does.\n\n\u201cEven when I go see my (comedian) friends, no other form of entertainment will have you laughing every 30 seconds for over an hour,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Doug Elfman at delfman@reviewjournal.com.
