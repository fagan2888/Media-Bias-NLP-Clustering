Bush has applied an under-the-radar approach to his post-presidency. But on Wednesday, he popped back onto the political scene, appearing with second lady Jill Biden at his Bush Institute in Dallas to talk vets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of people ask me, you know, do I miss much about being president?\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd the answer is really no.\u201d Bush said he missed the people that he served with and another big perk. \u201cI miss Air Force One,\u201d he said. \u201cIn eight years they never lost my baggage.\u201d [READ: Michelle Obama Edges Out Hillary Clinton in First Ladies Poll]\n\n\n\n\n\nMore seriously though, the former commander-in-chief talked about his big mission these days: supporting the veterans that fought in post 9/11 wars. Since Bush left office, he\u2019s been holding various military-themed sporting events. There\u2019s the 36-hole golf tournament, the Warrior Open, held in Dallas each fall.

Sleazier Than Hollywood] \u201cThat\u2019s not surprising -- I mean you don\u2019t see many job postings that say, \u2018Wanted: experience hunting insurgents and terrorists, willing to risk life for coworkers,\u2019\u201d the former president said. \u201cWhat\u2019s a veteran supposed to put down? My last office was a Humvee?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those vets that need to update their skills, part of the George W. Bush Institute\u2019s Military Service Initiative aims at making the academic experience at American colleges and universities more accommodating to veterans who often voice they have problems fitting in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt the Bush Center we believe it\u2019s never too late to learn a new skill,\u201d Bush said. \u201cJust ask Laura \u2026 a few years ago she didn\u2019t think she was marrying an oil painter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "George W.
