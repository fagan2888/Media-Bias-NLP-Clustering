Susana Martinez\u2019 15-point reelection victory in November.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBeing secretary of the Human Services Department has been the job of my dreams\u2014the hardest job of my dreams, but the happiest time in my career,\u201d she wrote in a letter, resigning from the post where taxpayers paid her $131,029 annually to oversee services that provide child-assistance, healthcare and medical coverage to low-income New Mexicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy resign from the job of your dreams?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMainly the reason is because this is a very blue state, and mainly I\u2019m a red girl,\u201d she tells SFR in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people are bad here or anything. But it\u2019s very difficult to get things done here. And I\u2019m just a very red girl in a blue state. I loved this job. I had a blast.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSquier adds she \u201cmade the decision myself\u201d and \u201ctold the governor several weeks before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelmingly blue state\u2014with the exception of the governor, of course,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd she gave me all the help she could. But it\u2019s just too much. It\u2019s too blue for this red girl. I swear that\u2019s the beginning and the end of the story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA California native, Squier built a career in government overseeing federally subsidized programs for the needy in both Washington DC under President George W Bush as well as in states like Florida and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe safety net\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail messages obtained by SFR through a request to HSD under the Inspection of Public Records Act illustrate her political frustrations during her tenure in New Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an April 2012 email, Matt Kennicott, spokesman for the department, wrote to Squier that Gov. Susana Martinez was \u201ctoo afraid\u201d to speak out against the federal expansion of Medicaid through President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Medicaid subsidizes medical insurance with federal taxpayer money for individuals living up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that\u2019s almost $16,000 in annual salary for a single person).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy Matt?\u201d replied Squier. \u201cWhy is the [governor\u2019s office] so weak on this issue?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt all boils down to polling and not saying something that will upset the approval numbers,\u201d Kennicott wrote back.\n\n\n\n\n\nBucking calls from the right of the Republican Party to fight the implementation of Obamacare, Gov. Martinez decided to expand Medicaid rolls to cover an additional tens of thousands of New Mexicans through the new healthcare law. The federal government is covering costs of the expansion through 2016 and 90 percent of the costs afterward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartinez spokesman Enrique Knell dismisses the messages as \u201ctwo-year-old e-mails that show agency staffers speculating about a decision made by the Governor, not them.\u201d\n\nThe governor's decision, he writes, \u201chas proven to be correct, as an analysis byshows New Mexico as one of the states that has benefited most from Medicaid expansion,\u201d adding that 183,000 New Mexicans have signed up for Medicaid as the rate of uninsured New Mexicans fell by 5 percent from 2013 to mid-2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNew Mexico healthcare providers are reporting significant increases in Medicaid patients, and major drops in the number of uninsured patients,\u201d writes Knell. \u201cOur Medicaid program is now more patient-centered, thanks to the reforms implemented under Centennial Care, (reforms that other states are now trying to emulate), and we\u2019ve dramatically expanded access to health care services for New Mexicans in need.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My conclusions were nothing more than conjecture,\" Kennicott writes in an emailed statement. \"Expanding Medicaid was the right decision to make for New Mexicans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the messages\u2014which Kennicott calls \u201cmy personal opinion, where I was blowing off steam\u201d\u2014shows the cabinet secretary and spokesman of the state agency opposed to expanding some of the very public-assistance programs the agency administers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat so sucks,\u201d Squier replied to Kennicott\u2019s email about polling. \u201cThis state and the people who think it\u2019s OK to live off of other people is going to drive me crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitics and policy\n\nSquier faced scrutiny before for similarly candid remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013 email first reported by KOAT Action 7 News, she wrote, despite demonstrable evidence to the contrary, \u201cThere has never been and is not now any significant evidence of hunger in New Mexico.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA campaign representative for Martinez in her first gubernatorial bid, Kennicott found himself in a similar position when, in a conversation caught on audio leaked to Mother Jones, he told Martinez that \u201csomebody told me\u201d former Democratic House Speaker Ben Luj\u00e1n is \u201cabsolutely eloquent in Spanish, but his English\u2014he sounds like a retard.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKennicott remains HSD spokesman. He\u2019s paid an annual salary of $84,905 in taxpayer money, according to the state\u2019s Sunshine Portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Kennicott replied, continuing the April 2012 chain. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. Maybe we can begin softening them a bit over the next few months. We\u2019re going to have to be prepared with reaction when SCOTUS [The US Supreme Court] comes out with their opinion\u2014hopefully the right way\u2014and it\u2019s going to have to be strongly worded.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSquier now says the governor was \"never for Obamacare\u2014never. She was always opposed to it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe governor\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to Kennicott\u2019s contention in his 2012 email that Martinez didn\u2019t speak out against Obamacare because of polling numbers. SCOTUS upheld the law's legitimacy. Martinez helped implement it in New Mexico, even admitting in her 2013 State of the State address that \u201cI didn\u2019t support Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s the law of the land,\u201d she added. \u201cThe election is over and the Supreme Court has ruled. My job is not to play party politics, but to implement this law in a way that best serves New Mexico.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another 2012 email exchange obtained by SFR, Kennicott emailed Squier about a memorandum of understanding between HSD and the state\u2019s Taxation and Revenue Department that allows information about SNAP, the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program commonly known as food stamps, to be sent to New Mexicans receiving a tax refund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo we really have to do this?\u201d Squier asked. Acting Director of HSD\u2019s Income Support Division Ted Roth suggested that HSD attempt to delete by \u201caccident\u201d the statutory language that creates that \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d\u2014which didn\u2019t result in \u201cany surge in SNAP applications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYet Knell says Martinez \"believes in the safety net\" and has \"continually strengthened it throughout her time in office, from expanding childcare assistance and school lunches, to expanding Medicaid and protecting food benefits for New Mexicans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was under Governor Martinez\u2019s leadership that this administration restored state supplemental funding for the SNAP program after the Legislature slashed it in 2011,\u201d writes Knell. \u201cWe invested $150,000 of discretionary federal stimulus money to maintain benefits for New Mexicans on the SNAP program, and then ran a bill in the special session that year to fully restore the funding.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt state agencies, politics clash with policy. And it\u2019s difficult to get around the law if you can\u2019t change it. The day after the election, on Nov. 5, HSD officials confirmed with KOB-TV that it would not fight a restraining order signed by First Judicial District Court Judge Sarah Singleton. The restraining order halted new work requirements HSD imposed on SNAP recipients\u2014about one-fifth of the state\u2019s population. The New Mexico Center for Law and Poverty and Southwest Organizing Projects alleged in the lawsuit that HSD violated the law in implementing the rules because it didn't give adequate public notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nSquier\u2019s resignation became public the same day, and went into effect Dec. 1. Her replacement, Brent Earnest, has said that HSD will again try to implement rules, suspended during the recession, that would require certain New Mexicans to prove to the state they're looking for work in order to receive SNAP benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nSquier says her husband, Steve Arthur, vice-president of an Arlington, Va.-based government relations firm, \u201chas got his heart set on perhaps me not working\u201d but that she\u2019s \u201clooking around\u201d for work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquier says she's moving out of the state, but she's not sure where yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWherever that might be, she won't be mired in the politics of New Mexico's state bureaucracies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGuess we have to do it,\u201d Squier replied to Kennicott\u2019s February 17, 2012 email about the program that allowed SNAP benefits to be sent with tax returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOk. Darn,\u201d wrote Kennicott. \u201cI like Ted\u2019s idea of deleting it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Squier responded.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Teds Report by justinhorwath", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sidonie Squier says in an interview that she left the job she \u201cloved\u201d as the head of the state\u2019s Human Services Department because New Mexico\u2019s politics are \u201ctoo blue for this red girl.\u201d", "title": "Squier on Departure: 'I'm a red girl in a blue state'", "og": {"description": "Sidonie Squier says in an interview that she left the job she \u201cloved\u201d as the head of the state\u2019s Human Services Department because New Mexico\u2019s politics are \u201ctoo blue for this red girl.\u201d", "title": "Squier on Departure: 'I'm a red girl in a blue state'", "url": "http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-9773-squier-on-departure-im-a-red-girl-in-a-blue-state.html", "image": "http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/imgs/media.images/15037/Sidonie-Squier.widea.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@santafereporter", "image": {"src": "http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/imgs/media.images/15037/Sidonie-Squier.widea.jpg"}, "description": "Sidonie Squier says in an interview that she left the job she \u201cloved\u201d as the head of the state\u2019s Human Services Department because New Mexico\u2019s politics are \u201ctoo blue for this red girl.\u201d", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Squier on Departure: 'I'm a red girl in a blue state'"}, "revisit-after": "30 days", "p": {"domain_verify": "51bded99d6557f8f30245e0de5de827d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113396122025698}, "keywords": "Local News, sidonie squier, new mexico, human services department, hsd", "msvalidate.01": "F1EFD0AC3641A48B692131870526DE91", "article": {"section": "Local News", "author": "http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/by-author-443-1.html"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMainly the reason is because this is a very blue state, and mainly I\u2019m a red girl,\u201d she tells SFR in an interview this week.\nAnd I\u2019m just a very red girl in a blue state.\nIt\u2019s too blue for this red girl.\nMartinez helped implement it in New Mexico, even admitting in her 2013 State of the State address that \u201cI didn\u2019t support Obamacare.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s the law of the land,\u201d she added.\nWherever that might be, she won't be mired in the politics of New Mexico's state bureaucracies."}
