Her website offers proposals for incremental leftward progress on 30 separate issues. Implicit in her issues-oriented, grind-it-out campaign is the message that while Clinton might not be the most exciting candidate, she\u2019s the best-prepared.\n\nBernie Sanders, 74: It\u2019s too soon to know whether Sanders will get his revolution, but it\u2019s clear he is reshaping Democratic politics, pushing Clinton to her left while energizing young people to believe in the political process again. The revolution he promises \u2013 a world of free college and single-payer health care and broken-up banks and a campaign finance system not driven by big money \u2013 amounts to the most ambitious agenda of any candidate.\n\nThe Republicans\n\nDonald Trump: 69: Much attention has been paid to Trump\u2019s bombast, but more attention should be paid to how he would reshape the GOP. Republicans have been the free-trade party for decades, but Trump, who\u2019s partial to tearing up the nation\u2019s trade deals, would reverse that. Similarly, he would abandon 70 years of GOP foreign policy by forcing allies to pay more for their own defense and even encouraging allies like Japan to get nuclear weapons.\n\nTed Cruz, 45: This tough-talking U.S. senator would remold the GOP in his own hard-line image. Like Trump, he wants to build a wall at the Mexican border and get tough on illegal immigration, but Cruz\u2019s most noteworthy proposal is his flat tax plan \u2013 which includes a 19 percent \u201cbusiness flat tax\u201d that would work, in essence, like a national sales tax. Beyond that, Cruz is a rock-ribbed conservative Christian candidate in the mold of the 2010 tea partiers.\n\nJohn Kasich, 63: This onetime congressional budget hawk and two-term Ohio governor looks like the GOP nominee from central casting \u2013 circa 1988. There\u2019s no doubt about it: Kasich is a conservative who\u2019s made cutting government spending the theme of his career. But he\u2019s also an old-fashioned deal maker with a heart, one who\u2019s willing to take tough stands \u2013 like expanding Medicaid in Ohio under Obamacare \u2013 even if they hurt him politically.\n\nemail: jzremski@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "Politics Now", "description": "NEW YORK \u2013 The silliest clich\u00e9 in all of American politics tells us there\u2019s no difference between the two main political parties.
