Among other areas, lawmakers suggested focusing on exceedingly lengthy mandatory minimum sentences and restoring voting rights for convicted felons.\n\nThe move comes amid increasing focus on criminal justice issues, and after months of scrutiny on relations between police officers and African-Americans across the country.\n\nThe issue has united figures as diverse as President Obama, conservative activist Grover Norquist and presidential candidates from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, to Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nThat political cohesion has given rise to speculation that the time might be right for Congress to structurally reform the system for arresting, prosecuting and jailing criminals, in a major break from years of \u201ctough on crime\u201d rhetoric.\n\nReleasing bipartisan legislation this autumn would put the issue in the congressional spotlight just as the presidential race enters an important stage, building up to the early primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire at the beginning of 2016.\n\nLast year, the Judiciary Committee held multiple hearings on criminal justice issues, but failed to produce any major legislation.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bipartisan heads of the House Judiciary Committee are aiming for a sweeping overhaul.", "description": "The bipartisan heads of the House Judiciary Committee are aiming for a sweeping overhaul.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bipartisan heads of the House Judiciary Committee are aiming for a sweeping overhaul.", "title": "Lawmakers to unveil criminal justice reform bill in September", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/250112-lawmakers-prep-criminal-justice-overhaul-in-autumn", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/prisonerhandcuffs_021915getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-03T14:55:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-03T14:55-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/250112-lawmakers-prep-criminal-justice-overhaul-in-autumn", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-03T14:37-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Criminal justice reform,John Conyers, Bob Goodlatte,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-03T14:37:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T14:55:36-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/250112-lawmakers-prep-criminal-justice-overhaul-in-autumn", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bipartisan heads of the House Judiciary Committee are aiming for a sweeping overhaul.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers to unveil criminal justice reform bill in September"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmakers to unveil criminal justice reform bill in September"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe plan to introduce bipartisan legislation this September so that our criminal justice system better achieves justice and reflects core American values.\u201dIn June, the House Judiciary Committee began a review of the current criminal justice system, in order to pinpoint areas of possible collaboration for reform.\nLast year, the Judiciary Committee held multiple hearings on criminal justice issues, but failed to produce any major legislation.\nThe move comes amid increasing focus on criminal justice issues, and after months of scrutiny on relations between police officers and African-Americans across the country.\nBipartisan lawmakers in the House are planning to write legislation this summer to overhaul the nation\u2019s criminal justice system and introduce it in September, they said on Monday.\nThe top Republican and Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee indicated that their effort will take a sweeping view of the current system and propose multiple changes."}
