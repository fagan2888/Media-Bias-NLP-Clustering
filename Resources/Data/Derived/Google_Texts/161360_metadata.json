Mitchell on 20 October 2013 20:49\n\nObamacare was put together by people who don\u2019t understand economics.\n\nThis is probably the understatement of the year since I could be referring to many features of the bad law: The higher tax burden on saving and investment, making an anti-growth tax system even worse; the exacerbation of the third-party payer problem, which is the nation\u2019s biggest healthcare problem; the increased burden of government spending, worsening America\u2019s entitlement crisis.\n\nThose are all significant problems, but today I want to focus on how Obamacare encourages people to be less productive. And I\u2019m going to use a rather unexpected source.\n\nThe left-leaning San Francisco Chronicle has a financial advice column that inadvertently shows how Obamacare discourages people from earning income. The article nonchalantly explains that people may want to reduce their income so they can get more goodies from the government.\n\nPeople whose 2014 income will be a little too high to get subsidized health insurance from Covered California next year should start thinking now about ways to lower it to increase their odds of getting the valuable tax subsidy. \u201cIf they can adjust (their income), they should,\u201d says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow with the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s not cheating, it\u2019s allowed.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, if your 2014 income is between 138 and 400 percent of poverty level for your household size, you can purchase health insurance on a state-run exchange (such as Covered California) and receive a federal tax subsidy to offset all or part of your premium. \u2026getting below the 400 percent poverty limit could save many thousands of dollars per year.\n\nYou may be thinking that this is just a theoretical problem, but the article cites a very real example.\n\nTo get a subsidy, the couple\u2019s modified adjusted gross income for 2014 income would need to fall below $62,040, which is 400 percent of poverty for a family of two. \u2026Proctor estimates that her 2014 household income will be $64,000, about $2,000 over the limit. If she and her husband could reduce their income to $62,000, they could get a tax subsidy of $1,207 per month to offset the purchase of health care on Covered California. That would reduce the price of a Kaiser Permanente bronze-level plan, similar to the replacement policy she was quoted, to $94 per month from $1,302 per month. Instead of paying more than $15,000 per year, the couple would pay about $1,100.\n\nTo put it in even simpler terms, this couple has figured out that they can get almost $14,000 of other people\u2019s money by reducing how much they earn by just $2,000.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the perfect illustration of the welfare state. It tells people that they can get more by producing less. And the system is based on the theory that there will always be some suckers who work hard to provide the subsidies.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen in Greece, Italy, Spain, and elsewhere, this system eventually breaks down as more and more people learn that it\u2019s easier to ride in the wagon than it is to pull.\n\nAnd remember that the United States isn\u2019t too far behind Europe\u2019s welfare states.\n\nThanks to the plethora of welfare programmes and income-redistribution schemes that already exist, millions of Americans have an incentive to earn less money and get trapped in government dependency.\n\nThis graph, for instance, shows that various handouts mean that a single mom with $29,000 of income can be better off than a self-reliant person with $69,000 of income.\n\nAnd a local CBS station discovered that a low-income household could be eligible for more than $80,000 of goodies from the government. Earning more money, though, would mean fewer handouts.\n\nRemember Julia, the mythical moocher created by the Obama campaign to show the joys of government dependency? As illustrated by this Ramirez cartoon, Julia symbolizes the entitlement mentality. But the cartoon doesn\u2019t go far enough. It should show how Julia decides to lead a less productive and less fulfilling life because she gets hooked on the heroin of handouts.\n\nDaniel J.
