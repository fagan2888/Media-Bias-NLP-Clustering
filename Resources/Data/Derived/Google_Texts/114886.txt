Friends and admirers of Laura Gibson are raising money for the folk singer-songwriter after she lost her home in a building explosion in New York City’s East Village yesterday. While Gibson got out of her apartment safely, she lost everything inside the building, including her musical equipment. She’s currently in the middle of making a new record and attending grad school at Hunter College, and while her family and friends have offered clothes, toothbrushes, and couches to crash on, Gibson’s still going to need a good chunk of change to re-start her life. Fundraisers are using Go Fund Me to hopefully raise about $10,000 for Gibson, though more would surely be appreciated. As of press time about two hours into the campaign, donors have drummed up about $3,000, which is a pretty substantial amount for such a short period of time.
