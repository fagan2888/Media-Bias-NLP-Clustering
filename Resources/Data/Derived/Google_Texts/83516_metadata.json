Bill Haslam continues to face pushback, from fellow Republicans and Democrats, on his legislative agenda. (Photo: File/George Walker IV / THE TENNESSEAN)Buy Photo\n\nLately, Gov. Bill Haslam just can\u2019t catch a legislative break. On those hard-to-push, can\u2019t-please-everyone type of bills, anyway.\n\nThe governor took a hit after his push to provide federally funded health care benefits fell flat \u2014 thanks to his fellow Republicans \u2014 at the General Assembly. The legislative agenda he unveiled several days later contained nothing nearly as contentious as Insure Tennessee.\n\nAnd yet, on his plan to cut a pay perk currently available for many of the state\u2019s roughly 43,000 employees, he\u2019s facing still more opposition from the legislative leaders and other members of his own party.\n\n\u201cWhile (Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey) supports Governor Haslam\u2019s overall goal of moving the State of Tennessee toward a more merit-based compensation system, he believes that changing longevity pay for existing employees will be a tough sell in the legislature,\u201d said Ramsey spokesman Adam Kleinheider.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, put it less diplomatically.\n\n\u201cLongevity pay has a long way to go,\u201d Norris said on its chances of gaining support in the General Assembly.\n\nRight now, state employees are eligible to receive a \u201clongevity pay\u201d benefit after they\u2019ve worked for the state for at least three years. After that point, the employee receives an annual lump payment of $100 for every year they\u2019ve worked for the state. So a state employee with 10 years service would receive $1,000. Beyond 30 years the payment remains at $3,000.\n\nHaslam wants to end the program, in accordance with his merit-based pay plan.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s goal is to shift away from an emphasis on compensating employees based on seniority to merit and performance,\u201d said Haslam spokesman David Smith.\n\nOriginally, Haslam proposed offering employees 50 percent of their longevity pay check, with the other 50 percent going toward paying the merit-based pay system. In that case, that 10-year employee would receive $500 extra in his base pay, but no more lump sum bonuses.\n\nThe Tennessee State Employees Association, the union for state employees, hates the plan \u2014 although Haslam thanked them for their help in crafting the TEAM Act legislation that created his merit-pay structure in 2012. Even after the state proposed amending the bill to give employees 100 percent of their current longevity pay as a base salary raise \u2014 think a $1,000 base-pay raise for that 10-year employee \u2014 association Executive Director John Summers asked lawmakers to reject the amendment and the bill.\n\nNot surprisingly, Democrats in the House and Senate oppose the plan. But conservative lawmakers traditionally don\u2019t balk at things like merit-based pay, a concept Haslam touts as something that works in the private sector.\n\n\u201cSome of the newer members seem to be more about ideology than governing, and it\u2019s not always easy to track the logic or consistency of their ideology,\u201d said Tom Ingram, a well-known Republican political consultant.\n\nIngram, who has helped on Haslam campaigns, said he doesn\u2019t think the governor will shy away from contentious issues in his second term. He argued Haslam had several key victories in his first term, but noted those victories came with the support of the GOP legislative supermajority.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to figure out how to deal with supermajorities that are more concerned with their primaries than their general elections,\u201d Ingram said.\n\n\u201c(Haslam\u2019s) still extremely popular, and that matters to the public in general. But it doesn\u2019t matter as much always to legislators who are more concerned about being primaried themselves than they are the governor\u2019s popularity.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s repeatedly postulated a fear of any tie between Insure Tennessee and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 helped doom his health plan. That fear is obvious, if not also purely politically guided, for a Republican lawmaker afraid of an attack from the right.\n\nBut the fact Haslam can\u2019t get enough Republicans behind a far less controversial plan predicated on clear conservative ideology might not bode well for other battles Haslam might try to gear up for in future years.\n\nThe governor\u2019s proposed changes to longevity pay aren\u2019t due up in committee again until March 18. Smith said it\u2019s too early to say if the administration will offer other changes to the bill, but they\u2019re planning more conversations on the topic with lawmakers.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1BSNE0E", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Backlash against Gov.
