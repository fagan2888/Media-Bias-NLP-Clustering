John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion hit 367,395 in August, passing the Republican governor\u2019s projection for July 2015.\n\nKasich told taxpayers and the Ohio General Assembly that an estimated 366,000 Ohioans would be enrolled in Medicaid under Obamacare at the start of the state\u2019s 2016 fiscal year. This projection is reflected in a Governor\u2019s Office of Health Transformation chart released in February 2013.\n\nKasich unilaterally enacted the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in late 2013, circumventing state legislators who disputed his assurances the new federal entitlement would use \u201cOhio\u2019s tax dollars\u201d to provide Christian charity to the poor.\n\nKasich has since made it clear that renewing the Obamacare expansion \u2014 which he claims is unrelated to Obamacare \u2014 will be a priority for his second term.\n\nThe left-leaning Urban Institute has projected that almost 90 percent of uninsured Ohioans eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare are able-bodied, childless adults of working age. The Ohio Department of Medicaid has estimated \u201cabout half\u201d have jobs.\n\n\u201cOhio is just the latest example in a long string of states that have exceeded enrollment and cost projections for their ObamaCare expansions,\u201d Foundation for Government Accountability Director of Research Jonathan Ingram told Watchdog.org via email. \u201cWhen states start picking up a larger share of the costs, these overruns will cause serious problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly, past Medicaid expansions have shown exactly what happens when these kinds of projections are off,\u201d Ingram added. \u201cPoliticians start prioritizing coverage for able-bodied adults over care needed by truly needy patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Arizona, that meant cutting life-saving organ transplants to protect benefits for able-bodied adults. In Oregon, it meant cutting care for patients with late stage cancers. When costs run over budget, it\u2019s the most vulnerable who get put on the chopping block.\u201d\n\nAt a glance, the Ohio Department of Medicaid caseload report for August shows Obamacare expansion enrollment growing modestly. However, month-to-month growth is masked by backdated eligibility inflating enrollment for preceding months.\n\nJuly enrollment in Group VIII, the Obamacare expansion group, was reported as 338,707 in the July caseload report, but was revised to 358,929 in the August report. June enrollment, first reported as 285,553, jumped to 328,069 in the next caseload report and increased again to 342,056 in the report released Tuesday.\n\nIn each ODM caseload report since Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion took effect in January, enrollment has gone up every month even as backdated enrollment has increased every previous month\u2019s figures.\n\nJanuary enrollment, initially reported as 23,156, was reported as 132,768 on Tuesday. February enrollment was initially reported as 54,031, but on Tuesday was reported as 180,973.\n\nWhen retroactive eligibility is accounted for in the September caseload report released next month, July 2014 enrollment will likely surpass Kasich\u2019s July 2015 projection.\n\nOhio Medicaid enrollment under the Obamacare expansion as reported Tuesday by the Ohio Department of Medicaid is shown below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Medicaid enrollment under Gov.
