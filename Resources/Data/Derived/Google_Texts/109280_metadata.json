John Kasich\u2019s push to expand Medicaid to childless, able-bodied, working-age adults warned the policy would be a disincentive to work.\n\nA little over two years later, how many enrollees in Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion under the 2010 federal health law are unemployed? No one \u2014 not even the Ohio Department of Medicaid \u2014 knows.\n\nDuring budget negotiations last spring, ODM told Ohio Senate members that 43 percent of the enrollees in the Obamacare expansion referred to internally as \u201cGroup VIII\u201d were employed.\n\nMary Gerlach, a member of ODM\u2019s legal staff, provided more current enrollment information to Watchdog.org \u2014 but she could not say how many of the state\u2019s 673,000 Obamacare expansion enrollees have jobs.\n\n\u201cODM does not track how many Group VIII enrollees are unemployed,\u201d Gerlach said. She shared an August presentation from ODM director John McCarthy indicating that 55 percent of Obamacare expansion enrollees were working or were married to a working spouse.\n\nObamacare expansion enrollees\u2019 employment status is not the only pertinent data the most expensive arm of the state government doesn\u2019t track.\n\n\u201cODM does not maintain records detailing how many Group VIII enrollees had private or employer-sponsored health insurance prior to enrolling in Medicaid, and how many enrollees are incarcerated,\u201d Gerlach told Watchdog.org.\n\nBefore Obamacare, Medicaid was restricted to the disabled, the elderly, children, pregnant women and impoverished families. Obamacare expansion makes anyone with income at or below 138 percent of poverty eligible for the welfare program.\n\nJonathan Ingram, vice president of research at the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, said Medicaid expansion is \u201ca massive new welfare cliff\u201d that will discourage enrollees from seeking employment.\n\n\u201cObamaCare supporters promised that Medicaid expansion would serve the \u2018working poor,\u2019 but the Ohio Department of Medicaid reported last year that nearly 60 percent of expansion enrollees don\u2019t work at all,\u201d Ingram told Watchdog.org. \u201cNow, the administration says they don\u2019t even know how many able-bodied adults receiving this Medicaid welfare are working.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen evidence from several states that expanded Medicaid to able-bodied adults in the past that those expansions caused more able-bodied adults to work fewer hours or drop out of the labor force altogether,\u201d Ingram added.\n\nMedicaid coverage comes with no work requirements, and the Obama administration has rejected other states\u2019 requests to impose work requirements on Obamacare expansion enrollees.\n\nIn 2013, before Kasich vetoed an Ohio General Assembly ban on Obamacare expansion and expanded Medicaid unilaterally, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a working paper suggesting Medicaid expansion would shrink the labor force.\n\nThe NBER paper\u2019s authors found \u201can immediate increase in job search behavior and a steady rise in both employment and health insurance coverage\u201d in Tennessee when the state removed working-age, able-bodied adults from its Medicaid rolls.\n\nIngram noted the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has pointed to the NBER paper as evidence the nation\u2019s labor force is likely to shrink with each state that implements the Obamacare expansion.\n\nSince Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion took effect in January 2014, a net of more than 20,000 Ohioans have left the labor force. Kasich projected 447,000 would enroll in the expansion by 2020 \u2014 that estimate was eclipsed by the end of 2015.\n\nRELATED: Ohio Medicaid expansion sign-ups keep crushing projections\n\nRoughly a third of the Ohioans receiving welfare benefits under Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion are men between the ages of 19 and 44. Fewer than 100,000 have dependent children.\n\nKasich portrays Obamacare expansion as a program for drug addicts, the mentally ill and the working poor. As of October, 398,561 expansion enrollees had received some form of mental health or drug addiction treatment.\n\nODM spokesman Sam Rossi failed to respond to a series of Watchdog.org requests for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics of Ohio Gov.
