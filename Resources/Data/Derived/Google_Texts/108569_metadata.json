For this study, my colleagues and I talked to children, their parents, their teachers, and even their school nurses, once at the beginning and once at the end of a school year. e asked parents whether they set limits on the amount of screen time their children were allowed to have each day, and also on the content of media their children were allowed access to. As one might expect, setting limits on the amount and content of children\u2019s media is generally effective at reducing time on TV and video games and at reducing violent media exposure.\n\nHowever, seven months later we got a huge surprise. Children whose parents set more limits on the amount and content of media were now getting more sleep, had gained less weight (lowering their risk of obesity), were getting better grades in school, exhibited more helpful and cooperative social behaviors in school, and were less aggressive with their peers (as seen by the classroom teachers).\n\nReducing total screen time increases children\u2019s amount of sleep, which in turn lowered their weight gain. Reducing total screen time also led to higher school performance, more prosocial behavior, and lower aggressive behavior (standardized regression weights between .08 and .22). Reducing media violence exposure had additional (and larger) benefits for increasing prosocial behavior and lowering aggressive behavior. These effect sizes are generally considered to be in the small to medium range (See Figure 2 from the article).\n\nParents often say that they feel out of control\u2014technology is constantly changing and children \u201cget\u201d it easier than their parents. This makes the parents feel like they\u2019re not really having any impact. This study demonstrates that, on the contrary, parents are having much farther reaching effects than they know.\n\nNo parent will be able to see that their child gained less weight, got better grades, or was less aggressive than he otherwise would have been. You can\u2019t see what didn\u2019t happen. Also, because it is a slow accumulation across time, you won\u2019t see any immediate benefits. When you tell your child that they can\u2019t have a particular video game because of its content or that they have reached their limit of screen time for today, you won\u2019t see their grades improve tomorrow. You won\u2019t see them behave better tomorrow. (Actually, you might see a lot of complaining instead). Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that setting and enforcing limits on both time and content has powerful benefits for children\u2019s school performance, physical health, and social outcomes. This is particularly surprising because these are all very different types of outcomes, but being involved in children\u2019s media habits has a measureable impact on all of them out into the future!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research suggests parental monitoring of media consumption can have a lasting effect on a child's development", "title": "Study: Kids on screen-time diet lost weight, performed better in school", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Research suggests parental monitoring of media consumption can have a lasting effect on a child's development", "title": "Study: Kids on screen-time diet lost weight, performed better in school", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/study_kids_on_screen_time_diet_lost_weight_performed_better_in_school_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_195101249.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research suggests parental monitoring of media consumption can have a lasting effect on a child's development", "title": "Study: Kids on screen-time diet lost weight, performed better in school", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_195101249.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Douglas Gentile", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Computers, Facebook, Scientific American, Social Media, Television, Video Games", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb72a\"", "article_summary": "Reducing media violence exposure had additional (and larger) benefits for increasing prosocial behavior and lowering aggressive behavior.\nNonetheless, this study demonstrates that setting and enforcing limits on both time and content has powerful benefits for children\u2019s school performance, physical health, and social outcomes.\nThis is particularly surprising because these are all very different types of outcomes, but being involved in children\u2019s media habits has a measureable impact on all of them out into the future!\nReducing total screen time increases children\u2019s amount of sleep, which in turn lowered their weight gain.\nFor this study, my colleagues and I talked to children, their parents, their teachers, and even their school nurses, once at the beginning and once at the end of a school year."}
