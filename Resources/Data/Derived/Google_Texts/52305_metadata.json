Law enforcement said Monday they believe Sandlin might be connected with two vehicles that were reported stolen since his escape, one of which was found off Interstate 70 in the high country.\n\nOfficials believe Sandlin could be fleeing in a blue Honda Pilot with a license plate number 251ZCD.\n\nThe escape happened between 9 and 10 p.m. Sunday during an authorized outdoor recreation time after Sandlin apparently pushed through a metal mesh fence.\n\nOfficials believe about 30 minutes passed before they realized Sandlin had escaped.\n\nJacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said there were no updates on the search for Sandlin as of Tuesday morning.\n\nSandlin has a long criminal record dating back to 2000, including a 2003 conviction that left him a registered sex offender.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office asks anyone with tips about Sandlin\u2019s escape to call 303-271-5612. Anyone who sees Sandlin should call 911.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jeffco jail escapee Travis Sandlin still at large", "title": "Jeffco jail escapee Travis Sandlin still at large", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/07/jeffco-jail-escapee-travis-sandlin-still-at-large/", "image": {"width": 447, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005_114805_Travis-Sandlin.jpg", "height": 368}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005_114805_Travis-Sandlin.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-07T10:24:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T13:39:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8e6\"", "article_summary": "Authorities say an inmate who escaped from the Jefferson County jail on Sunday night is still at-large after a roughly two-day search.\nTravis Sandlin, 32, the first person ever to escape from the county jail, is considered dangerous.\nOfficials believe Sandlin could be fleeing in a blue Honda Pilot with a license plate number 251ZCD.\nJacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said there were no updates on the search for Sandlin as of Tuesday morning.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office asks anyone with tips about Sandlin\u2019s escape to call 303-271-5612."}
