Gov. Anthony G. Brown in his run for governor is his role as the head of Maryland's effort to implement the Affordable Care Act. He has had months to develop an answer for the failed launch of the state's health insurance exchange website and the troubles that persisted so pervasively that the entire site was scrapped. Maryland Public Television host Jeff Salkin asked him to explain his role during Monday's gubernatorial debate. Here is his answer verbatim. You be the judge.\n\n\"Let me describe my role. Implementing the Affordable Care Act, the big component, of course, was the health benefits exchange. But there's also the Medicaid expansion. There are issues that deal with the workforce and making sure that we have a health provider workforce to do the work. Also there are questions that we looked at in a work group we put together dealing with the safety net, so as more and more Marylanders get health insurance, there's still going to be some that don't.\n\n\"So, I was the chair of the health reform coordinating council that looked at every one of these aspects, and one of the first things that we did three years ago, we sent to the legislature the blueprint for establishing the health benefits exchange, and we established that as an independent government agency. In retrospect, like in Connecticut, I'd say go back and appoint me as a member of the health benefits exchange, maybe even the chairman of the exchange, but that's not the role that I served. But that doesn't mean that I didn't have a responsibility.
