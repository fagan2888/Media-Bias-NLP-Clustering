Luke Jr., who\u2019s been the CEO of the packaging giant for more than two decades, will take the title of nonexecutive chairman once the proposed marriage with the larger Rock-Tenn Co. is finalized, probably later this year. His counterpart at Rock-Tenn, Steve Voorhees, will be moving into the corner office.\n\n\u201cThe combination makes tremendous sense for a variety of compelling reasons,\u201d Luke said during a conference call Monday. \u201cMost important, we are leveraging the strengths of both companies into a larger, more diverse, more balanced and more global business.\u201d\n\nHowever it shakes out, the sale marks the end of one era \u2014 a long one, at that \u2014 and the start of another.\n\nThe Luke family\u2019s ties to the company date back to the beginning, in the late 1880s, when William Luke started Piedmont Pulp & Paper Co. The business was incorporated in 1899 as West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., which became Westvaco Corp. in 1969 and MeadWestvaco in 2002, following its Mead Corp. buyout\n\n\u201cMWV\u201d has been a mover-and-shaker in the Lowcountry since 1937, when it opened its hulking paper mill along the North Charleston waterfront. John A. Luke Sr., a future CEO, cut his teeth at the Cooper River site from 1949-55. His namesake and successor was about a year old when the family moved to a home on Johnson Road in the Crescent neighborhood off Folly Road.\n\nThe younger Luke, an Air Force officer during Vietnam, joined the business in 1979 and took the reins from his father in 1992. The New York Times took note of the promotion: \u201cLuke Family\u2019s Reign Is Extended at Westvaco,\u201d the headline read.\n\nThe commodity papermaker bounced along until about a decade ago, when it began what Robert W. Baird senior research analyst Ghansham Panjabi called an \u201cambitious transformation\u201d that would turn MeadWestvaco \u201cinto a leading consumer packaging franchise, with an especially attractive position across the emerging markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been the single biggest success I think he\u2019s had,\u201d Panjabi said of Luke.\n\nThe company started pruning businesses as it expanded globally and focused on high-end consumer packaging materials, specialty chemicals and real estate development.\n\nUnder Luke, MeadWestvaco jettisoned an envelope and office products unit. It shed its landmark Cooper River mill in 2008. A year ago, the company unloaded most of its timberlands. In its latest move, MeadWestvaco just announced it will spin off its fast-growing North Charleston-based chemicals division as a stand-alone company.\n\n\u201cWhat they ended up keeping were the high-margin pieces of the portfolio,\u201d Panjabi said.\n\nThe Luke family\u2019s hold on the corner office was shaken last year when activist investor Jeffrey Smith disclosed that his Starboard Value LP had amassed a 5.6 percent stake in MeadWestvaco, an amount it later raised to 6.1 percent. Among other changes, the fund urged the company to slim down and simplify. Also, in a June 2 letter, Smith demanded \u201cabsolute objectivity\u201d from the board in evaluating \u201cinternal and external candidates\u201d to succeed Luke, and \u201cto choose a leader who has the requisite skill sets needed to execute on the substantial opportunities at MeadWestvaco.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it all kind of lined up, that there was this outside pressure to monetize shareholder value and divest assets,\u201d Panjabi said.\n\nAlso, at 67, Luke is probably thinking about retirement. That, too, contributed to the Rock-Tenn sale \u201cto some extent,\u201d Panjabi said.\n\nWhile Luke\u2019s C-suite swan song came as a surprise to some, it was inevitable MeadWestvaco would have to pursue a merger, acquisition or other transaction. In hindsight, he\u2019d been preparing for the day when the sun would set on the family dynasty.\n\n\u201cHe basically made the company more attractive from a buyout standpoint,\u201d Panjabi said Thursday. \u201cThis week\u2019s events confirm that.\u201d\n\nContact John McDermott at 937-5572,", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Merger marks end of dynasty at MeadWestvaco, a big Chaleston employer since the \u201930s, John McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermottFP LatestNews, \r\nBusiness-Local, \r\nBusiness-Local, John A.
