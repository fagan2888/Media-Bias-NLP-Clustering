Less than three months after a red tide rolled over the country, the Senate Republican Rollover Caucus is back to its default position in Washington, D.C.:\n\nHands up, bow down.\n\nLast week, senior GOP supplicant Senator Orrin Hatch announced that he will support the confirmation of President Obama\u2019s attorney general nominee, Loretta Lynch. He praised her \u201cqualifications\u201d and decried the Justice Department\u2019s previous leaders who \u201chave facilitated executive abuses by this president rather than upholding the rule of law.\u201d\n\nGuffaw.\n\nA Utah Republican, Hatch was one of the biggest, fattest facilitators of that lawlessness from the first days of the reign of Obama. Beltway amnesia among entrenched incumbents is a chronic disorder.\n\n\u201cI like Barack Obama and want to help him if I can,\u201d Hatch declared in January 2009, just weeks before the Senate voted on President Obama\u2019s attorney general nominee, career corruptocrat Eric Holder. In the interest of \u201ccomity,\u201d Hatch and 16 other Senate Republicans backed Holder, despite his long, sordid history of questionable ethics and national-security-undermining politicking in the Clinton administration \u2014 from the Marc Rich pardon scheme with former White House counsel Jack Quinn to the clemency deal for 16 members of the violent terrorist groups Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (FALN) and Los Macheteros, which the FBI had linked to more than 130 bombings and six murders.\n\nWith the blessing of Senate Republican enablers, Holder went on to preside over the bloody malfeasance of the Fast and Furious scandal; the Gitmo jihad evacuations and recidivist release program; installment of far-left lawyers who had represented our worst enemies; and the establishment of a \u201cculture of hostility\u201d toward Justice Department employees committed to election integrity, immigration enforcement, and equal treatment under the law.\n\nNow, Holder\u2019s Senate GOP handmaidens are shocked and dismayed at the cesspool Holder is leaving behind. Their solution? Replace him with a woman who explicitly championed and defended Obama\u2019s executive-power grabs on illegal immigration, crusaded for the manufactured \u201cright\u201d of illegal aliens to work in the U.S., and refused to answer GOP senator Ted Cruz\u2019s questions last week about whether any limits exist at all on a president\u2019s executive discretion to choose or ignore laws (Tax law? Labor law? Environmental law?).\n\nBeltway Republican poseurs claimed a victory for the Right after the 2014 midterms. But conservatives knew the crusty barnacles who habitually use and abuse grassroots voters would immediately revert to form. Or rather: formlessness.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Seven-term incumbent Hatch embodies everything that\u2019s wrong with the GOP brand. He\u2019s a mascot for the Big Government Republican parade and masquerade of career politicians who stand for nothing and roll over for everything.\n\nIn addition to supporting Holder and now Lynch, Hatch embraced tax-cheat Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and the TARP bailout, lavished praise on Joe Biden\u2019s manhood, and spoke kindly of Obamacare implementer Kathleen Sebelius upon her departure.\n\nIn case you\u2019d forgotten, Hatch co-sponsored the $6 billion national service boondoggle and dedicated it to his good friend Teddy Kennedy, with whom he also joined hands to create the ever-expanding SCHIP entitlement. That program is now an $8-billion-a-year entitlement and growing.\n\nAt a time when Obama\u2019s executive-amnesty measures are wreaking havoc on the border, public schools, public safety, and the American workforce, don\u2019t forget: Hatch was an original sponsor of the open-borders DREAM Act illegal-alien student bailout and voted to fully fund the Obama amnesty during the lame-duck session.\n\nHatch was joined by GOP senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in announcing support for Lynch last week. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that he will let her nomination come to a vote out of \u201ccourtesy\u201d rather than block it in protest of Obama\u2019s continued lawlessness on deportations and mass issuance of work permits to countless foreign criminals.\n\nCruz, who called on McConnell to put the screws on Obama over the Lynch nomination, diagnosed the bipartisan Beltway corruptocracy perfectly: \u201cFar too many Americans are losing faith in our elected officials,\u201d he told Politico this week. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen too many times politicians who say one thing and do another.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to play hardball with deflated ones.\n\n\u2014 Michelle Malkin is the author of Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks & Cronies.
