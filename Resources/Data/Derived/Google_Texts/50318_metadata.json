House Republicans and 39 Democrats pushed back on his proposal the next day, passing a bill that allow insurers to offer the bare-bones plans to existing and new enrollees in the coming year.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, millions of people right now have a canceled policy,\u201d Rep. Ron Barber, Arizona Democrat, said before voting Friday for the Keep Your Health Plan Act filed by Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama blunders into his own \u2018Katrina\u2019\n\nThe debate \u2014 fallout from Mr. Obama\u2019s oft-repeated, yet mistaken, vow that Americans could keep their health plans if they liked them under his health care law \u2014 roiled Washington throughout the week. Yet as lawmakers decamped from Capitol Hill, state insurance commissions faced tough decisions.\n\nInsurance chiefs from at least three jurisdictions \u2014 Washington state, Louisiana and the District of Columbia \u2014 quickly spoke out against Mr. Obama\u2019s renewal plan, saying it could keep healthier people from enrolling in the state-based health exchanges set up under Obamacare.\n\nThe exchanges are a key pillar of Mr. Obama\u2019s law. But they could fail and send premiums soaring if younger, healthier people do not sign up and balance out older, sicker consumers who enroll because insurers can no longer deny people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care Reform\n\nThe flawed rollout of Mr. Obama\u2019s reforms \u2014 notably, website glitches that prevent people from viewing new coverage options \u2014 has intensified partisan wrangling over Obamacare. Even so, attempts to patch the overhaul have spawned a patchwork of positions among Democrats who are trying to reconcile their support for the law with the political fallout of its wobbly implementation.\n\nIn turn, their political concerns do not always mesh with state-level attempts to stabilize the insurance market.\n\nWashington State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s plan mere hours after the president\u2019s announcement.\n\nRep. Jim McDermott, Washington Democrat, commended his insurance commissioner\u2019s decision from the House floor on Friday, noting his state has worked hard to implement Mr. Obama\u2019s reforms with a robust health exchange. But he lambasted the Republican-led House bill for allowing plans with limited protections to be extended and take on new enrollees in the coming year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to create endless confusion in this country in the insurance market,\u201d Mr. McDermott said.\n\nSen. Mary L. Landrieu, Louisiana Democrat up for re-election next year, is pushing a bill that would let existing customers hold onto their health plans indefinitely.\n\nYet Rep. Ami Bera, California Democrat and a physician, said Friday the Republican-led bill from his chamber was better than proposals in the Democrat-run Senate and provided his constituents some flexibility while they browse plans on the state\u2019s health exchange, which is functioning relatively well.\n\nThe House passed its bill 261-157 despite a veto threat from Mr. Obama and objections from Democrats who said the legislation was an insidious attempt to rot the law from the inside out by letting new enrollees gain substandard plans.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. James E. Clyburn, a member of the House Democratic leadership, on Sunday dismissed talk of a \u201crevolt,\u201d saying most Democrats who backed the Upton bill were \u201cinsulating themselves against sound bites.\u201d\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema, Arizona Democrat, voted for the bill, yet urged her state\u2019s insurance chief to implement Mr. Obama\u2019s fix.\n\nReps. Lois Capps and Zoe Lofgren, California Democrats who voted against the House bill, made a similar plea to California Health and Human Services Secretary Diana Dooley.\n\n(Corrected paragraph:) Early on, Sen. Bill Nelson, Florida Democrat, urged his state officials to implement Mr. Obama\u2019s fix.\n\nFour Republicans bucked their party and voted against the House bill, perhaps because it could be viewed as an attempt to smooth over Mr. Obama\u2019s controversial reforms.\n\nMeanwhile, the insurance industry is left to sort it all out.\n\n\u201cThe question is what happens. Who will join the markets?\u201d Karen Ignagni, CEO of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said on Fox. \u201cWill it be the young and the healthy balancing out the old and the sick?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The tumultuous Beltway fight over Americans who lost their health plans because of Obamacare is shifting to the states, where regulators will decide whether to heed President Obama's proposal to let Americans renew their plans &mdash; or rebuff him to preserve the core mission of his signature law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The tumultuous Beltway fight over Americans who lost their health plans because of Obamacare is shifting to the states, where regulators will decide whether to heed President Obama\u2019s proposal to let Americans renew their plans \u2014 or rebuff him to preserve the core mission of his signature law.", "title": "States take up the fight against Obama\u2019s changes to health care law", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/17/states-take-up-the-fight-against-obamas-changes-to/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/17/11172013_ap13051705228201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/17/11172013_ap13051705228201.jpg", "description": "The tumultuous Beltway fight over Americans who lost their health plans because of Obamacare is shifting to the states, where regulators will decide whether to heed President Obama's proposal to let A", "card": "summary", "title": "States take up the fight against Obama\u2019s changes to health care"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Democrats"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd609\"", "article_summary": "Who will join the markets?\u201d Karen Ignagni, CEO of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said on Fox.\nSEE ALSO: Obama blunders into his own \u2018Katrina\u2019The debate \u2014 fallout from Mr. Obama\u2019s oft-repeated, yet mistaken, vow that Americans could keep their health plans if they liked them under his health care law \u2014 roiled Washington throughout the week.\nThe exchanges are a key pillar of Mr. Obama\u2019s law.\nWashington State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s plan mere hours after the president\u2019s announcement.\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care ReformThe flawed rollout of Mr. Obama\u2019s reforms \u2014 notably, website glitches that prevent people from viewing new coverage options \u2014 has intensified partisan wrangling over Obamacare."}
