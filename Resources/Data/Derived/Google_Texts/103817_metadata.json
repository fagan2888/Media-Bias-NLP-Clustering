General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists\u2019 families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they\u2019ve been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders. So what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders? TRUMP: They won\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not going to refuse me. Believe me. BAIER: But they\u2019re illegal.\n\nWhen Baier pressed Trump about the targeting of terrorists\u2019 families, Trump reiterated, \u201cI\u2019m a leader. I\u2019m a leader. I\u2019ve always been a leader. I\u2019ve never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s what leadership is all about.\u201d\n\nLater in the evening, Trump reiterated his position during an exchange with Marco Rubio stating, \u201cAnd, frankly, when I say they\u2019ll do as I tell them, they\u2019ll do as I tell them.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s review.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not going to refuse me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s what leadership is all about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, frankly, when I say they\u2019ll do as I tell them, they\u2019ll do as I tell them.\u201d\n\nThese are the words of a man who is unaccustomed to hearing the word no.\n\nThese are the words of a man who is unaccustomed to being told, \u201cNo sir, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThese are the words of a man who is unaccustomed to having either his views or his ways challenged.\n\nWhen I heard Trump\u2019s words I thought of Richard Nixon\u2019s infamous comment to David Frost immediately came to mind. \u201cWell, when the President does it, that means that it\u2019s not illegal.\u201d\n\nTrump supporters will invariably point out that he did an about-face the day after the debate when he told the Wall Street Journal, \u201cI will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.\u201d\n\nBut we must remember this is the same man who during the debate he was \u201cchanging\u201d with regard to H1B Visas only to change back to his original position scarcely an hour later. It wasn\u2019t flip-flop; it was a flip-flop-flip.\n\nBy Saturday night, following caucus and primary wins in Kentucky and Louisiana, Trump had done a flip-flop-flip on torture. Trump told John Dickerson on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation in an interview that aired Sunday morning that he would \u201cbroaden\u201d the rules on torture, stating, \u201cWe have to play the game the way they\u2019re playing the game. You\u2019re not going to win if we\u2019re soft and they\u2019re, they have no rules.\u201d\n\nMost politicians flip-flop out of convenience, expedience or after they put their finger in the air to test the winds of public opinion. When tyrants flip-flop they do so not in response to public opinion. Tyrants do not heed public opinion. Rather they flip-flop for the most arbitrary of reasons \u2014 they found themselves on the short end of an argument with their wives, their cereal was too soggy, or it was raining outside. The turn of a thumb upwards or downwards can make all the difference in the world between life and death. In Trump\u2019s case, it would be the extension of a stubby, middle finger.\n\nI actually believe Trump when he says he\u2019s never had any problem leading people because with him it\u2019s \u201cmy way or the highway.\u201d The \u201cterrific people\u201d he speaks of surrounding himself with are more apprentice than adviser. It is their job to tell him how wonderful his business ideas are. Candor is not part of the job description. Tell the emperor that his apparel is falling and you can expect to be told the magic words: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d Now Trump can run his company as he sees fit (unless, of course, he\u2019s breaking the law by running a scam \u00e0 la Trump University). But the President of the United States cannot run the country as he sees fit. At least not without Congress and (if necessary) the Courts having their say too.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true President Obama ran roughshod over Congress and the Courts. But that cannot excuse the conduct of a potential successor. Saying \u201cWell, President Obama did it\u201d just doesn\u2019t cut it. Either we are a nation of laws or we are not. Either we are a republic or we are a dictatorship. Our system isn\u2019t always fair and it isn\u2019t always right, but it is a system that works better than anything else the world has to offer. While it\u2019s true that Obama unilaterally changed Obamacare from the podium of the White House press room and got the Supreme Court to back him on Obamacare twice, he has been held in check where it concerned recess appointments and executive orders issuing work permits to illegal immigrants and, most recently, concerning his climate change initiative against coal-fired power plants.\n\nAs contemptuous as Obama is towards Congress and the Courts, Trump shows every indication he will treat these institutions with even less respect. How would Trump react if Congress were to override a veto? How would Trump react if the Supreme Court overturned one of his executive orders? Can anyone discount the possibility he would be prepared to make them \u201cpay a big price,\u201d as he recently threatened to do with House Speaker Paul Ryan if he failed to get along with him? If Trump is prepared to compel the military to commit illegal acts on the battlefield, who is to say he wouldn\u2019t be prepared to compel the military to abolish Congress and the Courts to consolidate his power? Trump may have been joking he could shoot people on Fifth Avenue and his polls would go up. But can we discount the possibility that Trump wouldn\u2019t order the military to shoot American citizens who dare to disagree with him and his policies?\n\nAt the very minimum, we ought to be suspicious of a man who has more affinity for Mussolini than he does for Madison. After all, it was Trump who recently retweeted a quote from Il Duce, \u201cIt is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.\u201d When Chuck Todd questioned Trump about it on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, the GOP front-runner was his usual shameless self. \u201cI know who said it,\u201d Trump said defiantly. \u201cBut what difference does it make whether it\u2019s Mussolini or somebody else? It\u2019s certainly a very interesting quote.\u201d\n\nI think James Madison offers a far more interesting quote. \u201cWhere an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties, or his possessions.\u201d Somehow I don\u2019t think Donald Trump will be retweeting this quote to his followers anytime soon.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d61\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019re not going to refuse me.\u201d\u201cIf I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it.\nBut can we discount the possibility that Trump wouldn\u2019t order the military to shoot American citizens who dare to disagree with him and his policies?\nIf I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it.\nThey\u2019re not going to refuse me.\nWhen Baier pressed Trump about the targeting of terrorists\u2019 families, Trump reiterated, \u201cI\u2019m a leader."}
