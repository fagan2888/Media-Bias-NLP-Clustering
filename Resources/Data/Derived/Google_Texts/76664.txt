Ethan Couch, the teen who received probation for a deadly drunk driving crash in 2013, was apprehended in Mexico after going missing.

Authorities have detained Ethan Couch — the "affluenza" teen — and his mother in the Mexican beach resort town of Puerto Vallarta, according to CNN.

Couch made national headlines in 2013 when he avoided jail time after drunkenly crashing his car into a vehicle on the side of the road, killing four people.

A psychologist testified the teen had "affluenza," or that he was too rich and coddled by his parents to understand the consequences of his actions. He received probation. (Video via WFAA)

But a video surfaced online that appeared to show Couch drinking, a violation of his probation. Shortly thereafter, a warrant for his arrest was issued after his probation officer reported him missing along with his mother.

The 18-year-old will likely be turned over to U.S. marshals. Prosecutors said during his trial that he could face 10 years in prison for violating his probation.
