As of Oct. 1, Cover Oregon, a health insurance exchange, has been offering healthcare insurance to more than half a million currently uninsured Oregonians.

Under the program, which was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, residents can submit a single application and receive a variety of options for purchasing health and dental insurance as well as potential subsidies for those who cannot afford to enroll outright.

“The exchange is a tool, it’s about health and the health of Oregonians,” said Rocky King, executive director of Cover Oregon. “We’re trying get people coverage that will enhance their lives from a health standpoint.”

For the first two weeks of open enrollment, prospective clients of Cover Oregon are encouraged to consult with a local agent (see sidebar, Page 6, for a listing of Keizer agents), who will help guide them through the application process and determine which options are available to them. On Oct. 15, Oregonians will be able to apply directly through the Cover Oregon website, www.coveroregon.com. The website has translations for Spanish, Russian, Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese language speakers and includes a calculator to determine eligibility for tax credits.
