Total spending includes funding for coverage from employers as well as employee contributions and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe 1.8% growth rate is very close to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which was 1.5% in 2013, and is much lower than both historical and projected market averages for health benefit cost increases. Achieving growth levels at or near the CPI is necessary if employers are to avoid the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s excise tax on high-value health plans, known as the \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d which goes into effect in 2018.\n\nFor comparison purposes, midsize to large employers not using a private exchange expect a 4% increase in 2015 health care costs for active employees after some plan design changes. If no plan changes are made, employers project a 5.2% growth rate.1 Aon Hewitt recently announced a projected cost increase for employers using its private exchange of 5.3% for 2015.2\n\n\u201cThese results validate OneExchange as a new opportunity for employers to aggressively manage medical spending without sacrificing important programs that contribute to a healthier workforce, such as wellness and intensive chronic disease management,\u201d said Dave Osterndorf, a managing director with Towers Watson\u2019s Exchange Solutions. \u201cThe plans and programs built into OneExchange are based on best practices proven to bend the cost curve in a dramatic way. The financial and administrative efficiencies of OneExchange offer all employers a ready-made solution that achieves results that mirror those of the country\u2019s leading self-insured employers.\u201d\n\nHealth Care Spending Cost Increases Compared to CPI\n\nIncrease Time Period CPI 1.5% 2013 (most recent) OneExchange for active employees\u2020 1.8% 2015 over 2014 Midsize/large employers, with plan changes\u2021 4.0% 2015 over 2014 Midsize/large employers, with no plan changes\u2021 5.2% 2015 over 2014 Aon Hewitt Active Health Exchange\u2021 5.3% 2015 over 2014\n\n\u2020 Based on three 2014 employers\n\n\u2021 Based on projections for 2014 and 2015 spending\n\nSource data: Cost-related data gathered by consultants on behalf of 492 Towers Watson clients.\n\n2014 Savings Will Exceed Initial Projections\n\nIn addition to projections of low cost increases for 2015, employers using OneExchange are on track to exceed initial estimates of cost savings for 2014. Compared to what employers would have experienced outside OneExchange, average cost savings were expected to exceed $900 per employee. Based on 2014 year-to-date savings, the average is now expected to exceed $1,400 per employee.\n\n\u201cWith OneExchange, employees and their families are spending less when they need health care, and are needing less care as they take more control of their health and health care decisions,\u201d said Jean Moore, a managing director with Towers Watson\u2019s Exchange Solutions. \u201cEqually important, the cost savings employers are achieving with OneExchange are not coming from a cost shift to employees or from employees \u2018buying down\u2019 by choosing less valuable plans and running the risk of underinsuring. Instead, they are coming from implementing a comprehensive health coverage strategy with highly effective plans and programs.\u201d\n\nSavings Shared by Employees\n\nWhile OneExchange cost savings improve employers\u2019 bottom lines, they also increase employees\u2019 pay packages. On average, employers expect about $500 of the $1,400 per-employee savings in 2014 to pass through to employees. The cost savings come to employees in the form of reduced payroll contributions toward health care coverage and/or lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAdded Moore, \u201cIt\u2019s not often you can give your employees a raise and save money for your company at the same time. OneExchange does that.\u201d\n\nAbout Towers Watson\n\nTowers Watson (NYSE, NASDAQ: TW) is a leading global professional services company that helps organizations improve performance through effective people, risk and financial management.
