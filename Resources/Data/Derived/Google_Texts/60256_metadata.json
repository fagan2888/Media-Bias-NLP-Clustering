But don\u2019t neglect your personal finances as you clean the house. A careful review of your spending can result in some serious savings.\n\nImagine what you can do with your found money.\n\n\u201cYou can accelerate debt payments, increase retirement savings to your 401(k), invest in a Roth IRA or 529 (college savings plan),\u201d says Marguerita Cheng, CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Potomac, Maryland. \u201cAdditional monthly savings and investments of $50 [to] $300 can make a huge difference over 20, 30 or even 40 years. It's important to be mindful with your money.\u201d\n\nHere are seven places to look as you spruce up your finances this spring.\n\n1. Reduce recurring bills.\n\nLook over your cellphone, cable, satellite and Internet bills and see if you\u2019re paying more than you need to. Ask for promo rates or cut back on your plan if you don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles. Cheng had one client who reduced his cell phone bill by $25 a month \u2014 that\u2019s $300 a year.\n\nRelated: How to Become an Everyday Millionaire \u2026 From Those Who\u2019ve Done It\n\n2. Eliminate unused services.\n\nGet rid of services that you don\u2019t use. Cheng\u2019s client cut out his XM Satellite radio service, saving $30 a month (or $360 for the year). Reconsider Netflix or Hulu if you have overlapping services like premium cable or Amazon prime (or vice versa), saving anywhere from $8 to $12 a month. Last, cut out your gym membership if you rarely use it, says Ryan Fuchs, a financial planner at Ifrah Financial Services in Frisco, Texas.\n\n3. Find car insurance savings.\n\nShop around for the lowest car insurer and, when you find it, pay for your policy on a semi-annual or annual basis instead of monthly. Most insurers will offer discounts on the bulk payments, which adds up to between $10 and $20 a month. (Fewer payments lower the company\u2019s administrative costs.) While comparing insurance policies, don\u2019t forget to check with your homeowners insurance to see if there\u2019s a multi-line policy, which can knock off around 15 percent off the total costs.\n\n4. Wipe out bank fees.\n\nIf you\u2019re paying for a checking account, stop. Ask your bank if there is a way to avoid the fee, such as keeping a minimum in the account. Cheng\u2019s client was able to get free checking with direct deposit, saving him $12 a month. To avoid overdraft fees, link your checking account to your savings account or a line of credit.\n\nRelated: 9 Savvy Ways to Build Wealth\n\n5. Cash in your credit card points.\n\nCheck your points or miles balance on your credit card and cash them in. Make sure to get the most bang for your buck, though. For example, some rewards are worth more when used toward travel reservations through the credit card than a statement credit. Other cards may offer gift cards at a higher value. Check your credit card\u2019s rewards website for the details.\n\n6. Go green.\n\nSwitch out your incandescent lights for CFL or LED ones, says Fuchs. They may cost more upfront but the savings will add up. A $6, energy-efficient 60-watt bulb will pay for itself in a year, according to Energy Star. Each bulb can save between $30 and $80 in electricity costs over the bulb\u2019s lifetime. For the average house with 50 light bulbs, that\u2019s $1,500 to $2,400.\n\n7. Maximize your paystub.\n\nAre you getting the full 401(k) match from your employer? If not, increase your contributions and boost your retirement savings. Otherwise, you\u2019re not taking free money. Take advantage of any parking and transit benefits your employer offers by dumping pretax dollars into those accounts, instead of paying those expenses out-of-pocket. And if you had a large tax refund this year, adjust your W-4 to reduce the taxes withheld from each paycheck, says Theresa Rosen, a wealth manager at Prudence Financial in Sudbury, Massachusetts. \u201cIt gives extra money each pay check, ideally for saving or debt pay-down,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Spring is the time to purge your closets, dust the window shades and power-wash the de", "title": "7 Ways to Spring Clean Your Finances for Savings", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/28/7-Ways-Spring-Clean-Your-Finances-Savings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03282016_Sweep_Money_Dollars.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/28/7-Ways-Spring-Clean-Your-Finances-Savings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03282016_Sweep_Money_Dollars.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Spring is the time to purge your closets, dust the window shades and power-wash the de", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dba\"", "article_summary": "Look over your cellphone, cable, satellite and Internet bills and see if you\u2019re paying more than you need to.\nTo avoid overdraft fees, link your checking account to your savings account or a line of credit.\nIt's important to be mindful with your money.\u201dHere are seven places to look as you spruce up your finances this spring.\n\u201cAdditional monthly savings and investments of $50 [to] $300 can make a huge difference over 20, 30 or even 40 years.\nBut don\u2019t neglect your personal finances as you clean the house."}
