It ignores our growing national debt and punishes hard-working taxpayers.\n\nHouse Republicans have proposed a budget that cuts spending, reduces the deficit, balances the budget, and supports the men and women in uniform who are defending our nation. The budget repeals ObamaCare, ends the failed health law\u2019s $700 billion raid on Medicare, and keeps Medicare solvent.\n\nUnder President Obama\u2019s failed policies, both the debt and deficit have doubled. No family, no community, no country can continue that kind of excessive spending. It is the road to bankruptcy.\n\nA fundamental responsibility of the government is to set budgets and stick to them. This is necessary not only to keep the country running, but also to prevent it from running into the ground. It is time for the President to stop spending money the government doesn\u2019t have and start working with Republicans to save America\u2019s future.\n\nThe FY16 Budget Resolution, A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America, would:\n\nBalance in less than ten years \u2013 in contrast to the President whose budget never balances\n\nCut $5.5 Trillion in spending \u2013 higher than any previous House Budget proposal\n\nSupport a healthier economy today and greater economic opportunity for tomorrow\n\nRepeal Obamacare and start over\n\nBoost defense spending above the president\u2019s levels throughout\n\nEliminate \u201cdouble dipping\u201d of Disability Insurance and Unemployment Insurance and establish a plan to strengthen the regular Social Security Trust Fund\n\nSave and strengthen Medicare, ending the $700 billion Obamacare raid on Medicare\n\nI also voted for the Republican Study Budget, which would have cut spending by $7.1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIn contrast, the President\u2019s FY16 Budget proposal would:\n\nIncrease Taxes\n\nDespite $2.1 trillion in new tax increases, President Obama\u2019s budget never balances\u2014ever.\n\nMajor proposed tax increases include higher levies on savings and investment, small businesses, and increases in the costs of hiring workers.\n\nThese tax hikes would stunt the economic growth needed to get Americans back to work, and come on top of $1.7 trillion in tax hikes already imposed by this Administration.\n\nIncrease Spending\n\nThe President\u2019s budget increases annually-appropriated spending for next year by $74 billion relative to current law. In over 5 years, he would increase such spending by $322 billion.\n\nNext year alone, the President\u2019s budget would grow total federal spending by $259 billion, or 7 percent.\n\nTotal spending will increase by 65 percent ($2.4 trillion) in 10 years under the President\u2019s plan.\n\nCause Interest Costs to Skyrocket\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s plan more than triples interest costs, which remain the fastest growing item in the budget.\n\nInterest on the debt this year would be $229 billion, but would rise to $785 billion in 2025 under his plan.\n\nAt the end of President\u2019s plan, annual interest costs would be larger than his proposed spending for national defense, Medicaid or the combined total of all non-defense agency spending.\n\nIncrease the Debt", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TexasGOPVote", "description": "For the sixth year in a row, President Obama has handed Congress a tax-and-spend, big-government budget that never balances.
