He delighted the crowds and confused the politicians. He raised hope for some and dashed it for others. He sounded more like a Democrat than a Republican, except on women\u2019s issues. Even so, he was complimentary to the ladies (he needs us) and supportive to the Little Sisters of the Poor (who don\u2019t support ObamaCare).\n\nJust as Francis was flying out, I was flying in. I was in France the whole time \u2013 in Provence to be exact.\n\nIt was a long-planned vacation to a country house rented with friends. We also vacationed together in Italy in 2005, the beginning of what I sometimes call my \u201creligious unawakening.\u201d\n\nTen years later, I\u2019m hosting a blog about non-believing clergy on the Patheos Atheist Channel and I\u2019m sorry I missed the Pope. How can this be?\n\nTruth is, I come out for just about any big public occasion in Washington, including every inauguration, no matter who wins. Luckily, the day of the Pope\u2019s visit to the US Capitol, I received a NY Times update on my iPhone that allowed me to watch it live. Also, like a lot of atheists, I\u2019m partial to this pope (as popes go). I\u2019m not worried that he\u2019ll turn around the flight from the church and I like that he cares about planet and that he\u2019s not an old stick-in-the-mud like his predecessor and so many parish priests I\u2019ve dealt with over the years.\n\nHaving been conditioned to expect harshness and condescension from Catholic clerics, I admit I was charmed when, during his remarks on the West Front of the Capitol\n\nhe said:\n\n\u201cIf there are any of you that do not believe or cannot pray, I want you to send good wishes my way.\u201d\n\nWishes are as ineffective as prayers, of course, but this seemed like the Pope\u2019s way of saying:\n\n\u201cI know you atheists are out there and I don\u2019t see you as the enemy.\u201d\n\nWhat a stark contrast to many other religious believers who think anyone who doesn\u2019t share their beliefs is sinner in need of conversion or a foe who must be vanquished.\n\nI also like the fact that Francis seems humble \u2013 so humble that he\u2019s not living in the lavish Vatican Papal Apartments.\n\nBut it makes me wonder about something I haven\u2019t seen addressed anywhere:\n\nIf the Pope isn\u2019t living in his assigned palatial space, what is it being used for? Is it sitting empty?\n\nAnd I have two follow-up questions for readers:\n\nHow about renting the Pope\u2019s living quarters out to rich people and giving the proceeds to poor people? What else could the empty papal apartments be used for?\n\n**Update** I heard privately from two Catholic Patheos colleagues, Kathy Schiffer and Joanne McPortland. They provided some useful information about my questions, which I verified here and here.\n\nIt turns out that while the Pope\u2019s private quarters have not been rented during Francis\u2019 tenure, the Sistine Chapel has \u2013 in 2014 by Porsche, for a private meeting and a concert. It doesn\u2019t seem to have become a trend, however. A Google search only shows this one instance.\n\nAlso, while the Pope doesn\u2019t live in his palace, he still uses it for official meetings. Thanks to Kathy and Joanne for the inside info on the Pope.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Rational Doubt", "description": "With voices from the clergy project", "title": "Good Bye, Papa \u2013 Sorry I missed you in DC", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rationaldoubt/2015/09/good-bye-papa-sorry-i-missed-you-in-dc/", "image": "http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/rationaldoubt/files/2015/09/Pope_Francis_and_President_Obama-212x300.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rational-Doubt/563465993771587"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "Also, while the Pope doesn\u2019t live in his palace, he still uses it for official meetings.\nAnd I have two follow-up questions for readers:How about renting the Pope\u2019s living quarters out to rich people and giving the proceeds to poor people?\nAlso, like a lot of atheists, I\u2019m partial to this pope (as popes go).\nI also like the fact that Francis seems humble \u2013 so humble that he\u2019s not living in the lavish Vatican Papal Apartments.\nEven so, he was complimentary to the ladies (he needs us) and supportive to the Little Sisters of the Poor (who don\u2019t support ObamaCare)."}
