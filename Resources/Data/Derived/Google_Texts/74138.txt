Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will attend a Rob Maness event Saturday south of Marrero in Crown Point.

The Maness campaign sent an invitation to its #OneOfUs endorsers, key volunteers and some political figures. The campaign is asking those who attend to bring one truly undecided voter. There's no cost to attend.

Palin has endorsed Maness in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu this fall. He's hoping Palin's support will help attract other conservatives to his side over the other Republican in the race, Rep. Bill Cassidy.

"While the two Washington politicians are downing out one another in negative, misleading ads, Rob is surging in the polls just by traveling over 80,000 miles in his Ford F-150 to all 64 parishes holding over 43 town halls and listening to every Louisianan he can," the invitation read. "Rob's candidacy is confounding the 'experts' and is going to shock the establishment on Election Day."

The event will be held at Restaurant des Familles where guests will eat alligator, a throwback to one of Maness' ads released earlier this year where he fights an alligator.
