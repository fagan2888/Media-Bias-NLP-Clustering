AtlantiCare Chief Executive David Tilton on Thursday announced a program to help individuals who’ve lost jobs at Atlantic City casino to get health insurance coverage.

The AtlantiCare Community Healthcare Access Program — or AtlantiCare CHAP — is funded by the AtlantiCare Foundation and was created to help displaced casino workers living in Atlantic, Cape May and southern Ocean counties.

Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian and Stefanie Mozgai of the state Department of Health and Senior Services joined Tilton at a press conference to announce the program at AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center’s Atlantic City Campus.

“AtlantiCare has served our community since 1898,” Tilton said. “Sometimes it takes more than medicine to help us reach our vision of building healthy communities. True to our mission of delivering health and healing for all people, we evaluated how best to help our friends, family members and neighbors who have been impacted by the recent casino closures. That is why we have initiated AtlantiCare CHAP.”

The program will assist individuals laid off within 60 days of the closing of The Atlantic Club Casino Hotel, Revel Casino Hotel, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, or Showboat Atlantic City, who meets financial need criteria (household income below 400 percent of the federal poverty level) and do not have health insurance coverage.

“AtlantiCare’s Community Healthcare Access Program will serve as a vital lifeline to thousands of workers and their families,” said New Jersey Health Commissioner Mary O'Dowd.

“I applaud AtlantiCare for caring about those individuals who lost their jobs due to the recent closings of casinos,” said Atlantic City Mayor Guardian.

The AtlantiCare Access Center will schedule individual, private appointments with AtlantiCare certified financial counselors, who will provide education about health insurance coverage options and assist residents to enroll in NJ FamilyCare, or to purchase health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace, where individuals buy federally subsidized health care under the Affordable Care Act.

AtlantiCare will cover up to 75 percent of the federally unsubsidized premium — up to $1,200 per individual covered — for up to 12 months of coverage on the Health Insurance Marketplace for eligible participants.

The program also includes education, counseling and assistance around health insurance coverage and options, health insurance premium subsidy support and a resolution for outstanding medical bills for services received from AtlantiCare before Sept. 30 of this year.

“AtlantiCare contributes nearly $400,000 to charitable organizations that share its vision of building healthy communities,” said Tilton. “This year, through the AtlantiCare CHAP program, the AtlantiCare will make a special corporate donation of an additional $500,000 to local charities that are likely to see increased demand for service as a result of these economic challenges our region is facing in light of the casino closures.”

The charities and amounts they will receive from AtlantiCare are:

Those seeking AtlantiCare CHAP assistance should call the AtlantiCare Access Center at 1-888-569-1000 to schedule a private appointment with an AtlantiCare CHAP certified financial counselor.
