While 17.6 million Americans have signed up for coverage in the 5 years since the Affordable Care Act passed, there are still hundreds of thousands of people who remain uninsured. In Atlanta alone some 400,000 people have no health insurance.\n\nThis year the Obama Administration is pulling out all of the stops to get the word out that everyone should be covered. V-103\u2019s Ryan Cameron, host of the Ryan Cameron Morning Show with Wanda Smith joined hosts of 4 other radio stations in a special invitation to interview President Barack Obama and other senior administration officials about the importance of people being covered by healthcare. Cameron and radio hosts from Seattle, Kansas City, Dallas, and Tampa sat down with Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and Cecilia Munoz Director of the Domestic Policy Council in one on one interviews.\n\nJarrett had a special message for women telling Cameron there are things that are covered without a co-pay like domestic violence counseling, screenings for mammograms and pap smears and all other things that women need to do on a regular basis so there are no more excuses for not taking care of themselves.\n\nIn addition to urging Americans to sign up for healthcare during the open enrollment period, President Obama issued a challenge to 20 cities, including Atlanta to sign up the most people by December 15 and win a special visit from the President.
