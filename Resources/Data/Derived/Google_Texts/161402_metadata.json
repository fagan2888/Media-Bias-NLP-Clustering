It\u2019s illegal to sleep here, a form of trespassing.\n\nA police officer walks by on his daily beat. He\u2019s with a social worker who approaches her. The social worker\u2019s name is Jackie St. Louis, and he offers dry socks and snacks.\n\n\u201cTell me Tanya, what can we help you with?\u201d St. Louis asks. She says that she was \u201cout here trying to support a habit.\u201d\n\nSeattle continues to struggle with homelessness. At the end of 10-year plan to end homelessness, there were more homeless on the streets. That has led social workers to try something new: They\u2019re teaming up with cops. The program expanded this year with social workers employed by nonprofits.\n\nAfter some questions, St. Louis discovers why she hasn\u2019t moved into a shelter. It comes down to bags she doesn\u2019t want to leave unattended.\n\nSt. Louis offers to find storage for her stuff. He tells her that he or another social worker on his team will check in on Warner every day until Warner gets into a shelter.\n\nThat kind of work requires training police don\u2019t get at the police academy. St. Louis is a licensed mental health professional with a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master\u2019s degree in counseling; previously he worked in prisons.\n\nThat kind of social work used to be considered government work. Today, Seattle hires the work out to nonprofits. St. Louis, for example, works for the Downtown Seattle Association. The partnership works because the police know the beat, and the social workers have tools the cops don\u2019t have.\n\nSeattle has experimented with diverting people to social services rather than arresting them. But this daily outreach \u2014 where social workers walk the police beat every day \u2014 takes intervention to a new level. The program began downtown and expanded recently to Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cSeattle is really paving the way and a lot of cities are looking to us as a model,\" says Scott Lindsay, who works in the mayor\u2019s office as special assistant on police reform and public safety.\n\nLindsay says Seattle is changing how it considers low-level crimes that drag homeless people into a cycle of being arrested and released.\n\n\u201cThe reason they\u2019re committing shoplifting and disorder on the streets is because of an addiction issue,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to get help \u2013 and we can connect them with those services. That\u2019s a fantastic resolution.\u201d\n\nEspecially, Lindsay says, since the Affordable Care Act pays for many of those services.\n\nThe cop-social worker program has its fans. But it also has critics.\n\nRachel Fyall teaches public policy and governance at the Evans School at the University of Washington. She says this partnership between the Downtown Seattle Association and the police may help people, but it fits into a riskier, larger trend that started in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cWe call it a lot of things: 'The contracting regime,' or 'the shadow of bureaucracy.' 'The hollowing out of government,'\u201d Fyall says.\n\nThe problem is that a government that doesn\u2019t do social work forgets how to do it. And by farming out social work to contractors, we create an industry devoted to social work \u2013 an industry that\u2019s less transparent and less accountable than public employees would be.\n\nFyall says the key is to pay close attention to results of programs like this \u2013 and to hold non-profits accountable.\n\nAs for Tonja Warner, the homeless woman on Capitol Hill, the program seems to be working.\n\n\u201cThey come out here and find you and really take your information and make sure and come back and find you. And they\u2019re really tenacious about helping you,\" she says. \"I\u2019m really appreciative of them. They\u2019re really cool.\u201d\n\nNot only is she appreciative, she sleeps better now, too. That repeated contact from Downtown Seattle Association\u2019s social workers helped get Warner and her partner into a shelter.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "It\u2019s early in the morning, and Capitol Hill\u2019s homeless men and women are just waking up.
