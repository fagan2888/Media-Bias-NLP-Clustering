When Bourdain spoke to our own Andrew Kirell earlier this year, he said it \u201cirritates\u201d him to \u201csee people shrieking at each other at high volume\u201d on cable news. During an hour-plus long conversation with Chris Hardwick on The Nerdist podcast released Monday, he expanded on those comments, singling out MSNBC in particular as \u201cshrieking\u201d to the choir.\n\n\n\n\n\nBourdain said that on his show, as well as in his life, he applies the same principle whether he\u2019s talking to a rice farmer in Cambodia or right-wing rocker Ted Nugent. \u201cI disagree with Ted Nugent as violently and as much as anyone could disagree on just about everything,\u201d he said. But given the fact that they like barbecue, Bourdain said Nugent is \u201cfun to hang out with in spite of the fact that he says appalling shit that offends the hell out of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with you to enjoy your food, or like you, or even respect you,\u201d he added.\n\nHardwick said that what he sees in general is people being \u201cdismissive\u201d of those with whom they disagree, an attitude Bourdain said he found \u201cintolerable and unforgivable.\u201d As a \u201cNew York liberal,\u201d he may be conditioned to not like \u201cred state America\u201d where everyone has Sarah Palin stickers on their cars, he said he actually has a great time in those places and finds a way to get along with the people who live there.\n\nBourdain contrasted that attitude with the one he sees on networks like MSNBC. \u201cI hate preaching to the converted,\u201d he said. \u201cA nightmare would be for me to sit in a room where everybody totally agrees with everything I say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, MSNBC, it\u2019s like every show they\u2019re saying \u2018look at what these stupid Republican morons did today,'\u201d Bourdain continued. \u201cI\u2019m guessing there aren\u2019t a lot of Republicans watching that channel. You\u2019re not changing hearts and minds that way, it just seems kind of pointless to me, to shriek at each other that way, especially on issues like guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some common ground to be had and I just don\u2019t think that kind of shrieking is helpful,\u201d he said. And if talking through the issues doesn\u2019t work, he said he wished people who disagree would at least \u201chave a beer together, eat some fucking barbecue, listen to some Lynyrd Skynyrd, and fucking relax dude, you know?\u201d\n\nListen to audio below, via Nerdist:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to listen.\n\nYou can hear the full conversation with Bourdain at nerdist.com.\n\n[Photo via CNN]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Anthony Bourdain spoke to us earlier this year, he said it \"irritates\" him to \"see people shrieking at each other at high volume\" on cable news.
