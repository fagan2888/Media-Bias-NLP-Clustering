Health insurer Humana has announced signup events and assistance locations for anyone who still needs to sign up for 2016 Affordable Care Act coverage by the Jan. 31 deadline.

In Palm Beach County, Humana agents will be available from noon to 7 p.m. Jan. 29-30 near the Macy's store at the Boynton Beach Mall, 801 N. Congress Ave., to help residents understand Humana health plan options and sign up for plans offered on and off the ACA marketplace exchange.

Assistance is also available in Broward County, at the Humana Guidance Center inside Kings Point Plaza, 7666 Nob Hill Road, Tamarac. The center also offers assistance with Humana's Medicare plans and is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

In Miami-Dade County, Humana reps will provide signup assistance at four CVS pharmacies from 4 to 7 p.m. on Jan. 28. The stores are at 12650 SW 88th St., Miami; 650 NW 27th Ave., Miami; 101 Hialeah Drive, Hialeah; and 600 NE 128th St., North Miami. Assistance is available at other CVS pharmacies in South Florida. To find one, customers can go to humanahelps.com and enter their ZIP code.

Failure to sign up for health insurance by the Jan. 31 deadline could subject residents to tax penalties, depending on family income. For 2016, penalties could be as high as 2.5 percent of income or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child.

Humana agents in the three counties are able to help people understand their coverage options, as well as share information on availability of government assistance to help reduce the cost of premiums.

Enrollees are urged to make the process easier by bringing documents with their full names, birth dates, Social Security or immigration numbers, income documentation including pay stubs, W-2 forms or income tax returns, and policy numbers of any current health insurance plans of enrollees or their family members.
