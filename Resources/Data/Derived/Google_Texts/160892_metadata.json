But tax experts warn that the rules could also punish companies that have already completed those kinds of so-called inversion deals.\n\nA corporate inversion typically involves a U.S. company \u201cmerging\u201d with a smaller foreign firm in a country with a low corporate tax rate, and nominally moving its headquarters there. That way, profits that would be subject to the 35 percent U.S. corporate rate are instead taxable in the other country.\n\nRelated: Will Clinton Follow Obama\u2019s Legacy in Taking on Big Business?\n\nThe inversions carry other tax-avoidance benefits, too \u2014 most notably once called \u201cearnings stripping.\u201d Once the merger is complete, the U.S.-based element of the company takes a nominal interest-only \u201cloan\u201d from the parent company now headquartered overseas. It then uses U.S.-derived profits to make interest payments, shielding those profits from U.S. taxes.\n\nThe rules issued Monday will make it much more difficult for companies to structure such loans from now on, which could contribute to companies deciding that an inversion simply isn\u2019t worth it. According to Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the change could also hit companies that have already completed their inversions.\n\n\u201cTreasury will apply the new earnings-stripping rules to instruments issued after April 4 (i.e., effective for new instruments immediately),\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThat means the outstanding instruments (i.e., notes) issued by a U.S. company are not affected. But often a company will add additional debt as it grows.\n\n\u201cFor example, a U.S. company might have inverted and distributed a note to its foreign parent already (and the note would be unaffected by the new rule). However, if the U.S. company grows, the company might have planned to distribute another note (to soak up more of its income in the U.S.). But that note would be treated as stock, and payments on that note would not be deductible.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Inversion Curbs Kill Pfizer\u2019s $160 Billion Allergan Deal\n\nThat means that any U.S. firm that used the prospect of future earnings-stripping deals as justifying inversion deals to their shareholders could be facing some pointed questions at the next shareholder meeting.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The most immediate impact coming out of the Treasury Department\u2019s decision to aggressi", "title": "It's Not Just Pfizer: New Tax Rules Will Affect Past Deals Too", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/07/Its-Not-Just-Pfizer-New-Tax-Rules-Will-Affect-Past-Deals-Too", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pfizer-tax_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/07/Its-Not-Just-Pfizer-New-Tax-Rules-Will-Affect-Past-Deals-Too", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pfizer-tax_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The most immediate impact coming out of the Treasury Department\u2019s decision to aggressi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But tax experts warn that the rules could also punish companies that have already completed those kinds of so-called inversion deals.\n\u201cTreasury will apply the new earnings-stripping rules to instruments issued after April 4 (i.e., effective for new instruments immediately),\u201d he wrote in an email.\nA corporate inversion typically involves a U.S. company \u201cmerging\u201d with a smaller foreign firm in a country with a low corporate tax rate, and nominally moving its headquarters there.\nThe rules issued Monday will make it much more difficult for companies to structure such loans from now on, which could contribute to companies deciding that an inversion simply isn\u2019t worth it.\nThat way, profits that would be subject to the 35 percent U.S. corporate rate are instead taxable in the other country."}
