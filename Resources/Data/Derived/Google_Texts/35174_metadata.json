To test your partner\u2019s fidelity.\u201d\n\nChanging the tone of his voice into the high-pitched, plain speaking character of \u201cLa Chokolata,\u201d Diaz fields calls from lovesick listeners wondering if wives left behind in Mexico, deported husbands and love interests sparked on Facebook remain faithful despite months and sometimes years apart. Then he calls their unsuspecting partners pretending to be from a new company offering to send a free heart-shaped box of chocolates to \u201csomeone special\u201d on their behalf.\n\nDo they send it to their significant other or someone else?\n\n\u201cI want to see whether she still loves me,\u201d said one caller, identified only as Felipe, who had not seen his wife in five years. \u201cTo see if she still thinks of me.\u201d\n\nDiaz\u2019s show is broadcast by Entravision and reaches over 2 million people nationwide. \u201cEl Show de Erazno y la Chokolata\u201d features many of the staples of a \u201cSabado Gigante\u201d type variety show: A recent episode featured funny headlines from Mexico (\u201cGoat Attacks Do\u00f1a Maura; Today They\u2019ll Barbecue Him\u201d); an interview with \u201cMadonna Boy,\u201d a man who has undergone more than a dozen surgeries to look like the pop star; and advice from resident sexologist Elvia Contreras.\n\nBut it is Diaz\u2019s segment on love called \u201cEl Chokolatazo\u201d or \u201cThe Big Chocolate\u201d that strikes the strongest chord: In more than 10 years of doing the show, Diaz has witnessed marriage proposals, heartwarming reconciliations and a fair share of scornful breakups.\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel bad,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the power to make people say things that are not really what they mean.\u201d\n\nThey are stories Diaz knows well.\n\nGrowing up in the western Mexico state of Michoacan, Diaz watched his own father leave each year to spend long months working in the U.S. Diaz immigrated to California as a teen and held jobs planting broccoli and landscaping before his knack for imitating voices landed him a job on the radio.\n\n\u201cPeople say they haven\u2019t seen their husband or wife for two or three years and you start to think,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cThe work week feels normal because everyone is busy. But then the weekend comes and you realize there are women with their husbands. And my mom was alone.\u201d\n\nDiaz got the idea for the \u201cChokolatazo\u201d after hearing Ryan Seacrest stage something similar on his radio show involving sending a bouquet of roses. Diaz thought the concept would work well with the real-life dramas of the immigrants listening to his show.\n\nThe vast majority of callers into the show are men with a significant other in Mexico \u2014 a reflection of long-standing patterns of staggered migration in which the family breadwinner immigrates first. Increasingly though, Diaz notes, he receives calls from men who are meeting girlfriends from their hometowns online. When there is a spike in deportations from one month to the next, he\u2019ll get more calls from women inquiring about their husbands.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On LA radio show, a peek into the love lives of immigrants", "title": "On LA radio show, a peek into the love lives of immigrants", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "On LA radio show, a peek into the love lives of immigrants", "title": "On LA radio show, a peek into the love lives of immigrants", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/26/on_la_radio_show_a_peek_into_the_love_lives_of_immigrants/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/immigrant-love-lives.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On LA radio show, a peek into the love lives of immigrants", "title": "On LA radio show, a peek into the love lives of immigrants", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/immigrant-love-lives.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Christine Armario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf8d\"", "article_summary": "Diaz thought the concept would work well with the real-life dramas of the immigrants listening to his show.\nWhen there is a spike in deportations from one month to the next, he\u2019ll get more calls from women inquiring about their husbands.\nIncreasingly though, Diaz notes, he receives calls from men who are meeting girlfriends from their hometowns online.\n\u201cPeople say they haven\u2019t seen their husband or wife for two or three years and you start to think,\u201d Diaz said.\n\u201cTo see if she still thinks of me.\u201dDiaz\u2019s show is broadcast by Entravision and reaches over 2 million people nationwide."}
