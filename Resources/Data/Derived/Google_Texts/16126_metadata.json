This means the new models will emphasize collaboration, strategic management and payer-provider alignment, according to the report.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- download the report (.pdf, signup required)\n\n- here's the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nReport: How insurers can prepare for the a wave of consumerism\n\nPayer-provider collaboration essential for improving population health\n\n5 lessons from healthcare partnership success stories\n\nBetter population health requires hospital-community partnership\n\nCEOs weigh in on emerging healthcare trends for 2015", "article_metadata": {"description": "Improved care quality, lower costs and preparation for the healthcare industry's transition to a value-based model will top healthcare CEOs' agendas this year, according to the\u00a0Huron Consulting Group's annual Healthcare CEO Forum\u00a0Report.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Improved care quality, lower costs and preparation for the healthcare industry's transition to a value-based model will top healthcare CEOs' agendas this year, according to the\u00a0Huron Consulting Group's annual Healthcare CEO Forum\u00a0Report.", "title": "Healthcare CEOs predict increased focus on consumers, population health for 2015", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/healthcare-ceos-predict-increased-focus-consumers-population-health-2015/2015-01-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,consumerism,healthcare CEOs,HR & Workforce Management,Huron Consulting Group,Operations & Business Management,Population Health Management,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd132f\"", "article_summary": "\"How an organization ranks across those three business dimensions can have a predictive value on how aggressively that institution might pursue population health opportunities.\"\nMore than 30 senior executives in the healthcare sector working in various settings, including academic medical centers, community hospitals and large hospital networks, took part in the Huron Consulting Group's annual Healthcare CEO Forum Report, which surveys healthcare chief executives' strategies for 2015.\nTo learn more:- download the report (.pdf, signup required)- here's the statementRelated Articles:Report: How insurers can prepare for the a wave of consumerismPayer-provider collaboration essential for improving population health5 lessons from healthcare partnership success storiesBetter population health requires hospital-community partnershipCEOs weigh in on emerging healthcare trends for 2015\n\"CEOs and senior hospital executives must embrace this change while implementing new strategies in order to chart a successful path forward.\"\nImproved care quality, lower costs and preparation for the healthcare industry's transition to a value-based model will top healthcare CEOs' agendas this year, according to a new report."}
