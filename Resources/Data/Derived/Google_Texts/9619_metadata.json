Four years later, work began on an independent movie entitled Nailed, freely adapted from the book, with Gore herself co-writing the script and David O Russell directing: a bizarre Obamacare parable with a huge high concept.\n\nAlice (Jessica Biel) plays a smalltown waitress who gets a nail stuck in her head through a freak accident; she doesn\u2019t have the insurance to get it removed, but this injury has apparently pierced the lobe that causes inhibitions, so with unnatural verve and confidence she comes to Washington with a bunch of other embarrassingly afflicted pilgrims on a mission to change the law \u2013 and has an affair with dopey congressman Howard Birdwell, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nThe chaotically underfunded production had eventually to be abandoned, and the salvaged footage (disowned by Russell) has now been released with a new, blander title and a fictional director\u2019s name on it: Stephen Greene. It\u2019s a real mess: a sort of Mr Smith Goes to Washington meets The Wizard of Oz. It\u2019s that black-comic brain injury that must have interested Russell in the first place: the part of the film that vaguely resembles his Silver Linings Playbook. And that goes for nothing at all. If there are David O Russell completists out there, this is something for them.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "description": "The salvaged footage of David O Russell\u2019s adaptation of Kristin Gore\u2019s novel about an idealistic aide working on healthcare reform is a real mess", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The salvaged footage of David O Russell\u2019s adaptation of Kristin Gore\u2019s novel about an idealistic aide working on healthcare reform is a real mess", "title": "Accidental Love review \u2013 abandoned political comedy pointlessly revived", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/18/accidental-love-review-abandoned-political-comedy-pointlessly-revived", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434538779629/5600f694-f2e0-4068-9966-655b5161353d-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=143c2868135e3ba434e36597337b8387", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@guardian", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2015/jun/18/accidental-love-review-abandoned-political-comedy-pointlessly-revived?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/18/accidental-love-review-abandoned-political-comedy-pointlessly-revived", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2015/jun/18/accidental-love-review-abandoned-political-comedy-pointlessly-revived?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434538779629/5600f694-f2e0-4068-9966-655b5161353d-2060x1236.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PeterBradshaw1"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2015/jun/18/accidental-love-review-abandoned-political-comedy-pointlessly-revived?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Comedy,Film,Culture,Jake Gyllenhaal,David O Russell,Comedy,US politics,US news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-06-18T21:30:07.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbradshaw", "section": "Film", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T21:33:23.000Z", "tag": "Comedy,Film,Culture,Jake Gyllenhaal,David O Russell,Comedy,US politics,US news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434538779629/5600f694-f2e0-4068-9966-655b5161353d-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=e499de1df2b737d5875cd367da98bc19", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Comedy,Film,Culture,Jake Gyllenhaal,David O Russell,Comedy,US politics,US news"}, "article_summary": "Kristin Gore, daughter of Al, published a novel in 2004 entitled Sammy\u2019s Hill: a Washington DC comedy about an idealistic young political aide working on healthcare reform.\nIt\u2019s a real mess: a sort of Mr Smith Goes to Washington meets The Wizard of Oz.\nIf there are David O Russell completists out there, this is something for them.\nIt\u2019s that black-comic brain injury that must have interested Russell in the first place: the part of the film that vaguely resembles his Silver Linings Playbook.\nThe chaotically underfunded production had eventually to be abandoned, and the salvaged footage (disowned by Russell) has now been released with a new, blander title and a fictional director\u2019s name on it: Stephen Greene."}
