Ted Cruz on Monday, with the release of an analysis of the platforms of the top 12 candidates for the Republican nomination.\n\nCruz has been consistently in the middle of the pack in early polling, typically gathering only a fraction of the support currently being lavished on frontrunners Donald Trump and Ben Carson. However, with backing from well-funded Super PACs, the Texas senator has the ability to assert himself in the race in the event that one or both of the frontrunners flame out before primary voters go to the polls.\n\nRelated: As Carson Stumbles, Trump Slowly Turns the Knife\n\nThe Heritage Action analysis renders judgment on candidates\u2019 positions across six different areas: growth, opportunity, civil society, limited government, favoritism, and national security. It contains significant criticism of every one of the 12 candidates it considered, except for Cruz.\n\n(While some of the criteria seem self-explanatory, others may not. The civil society assessment, for example, is dependent on whether a candidate is in line with Heritage on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage, among other things. Favoritism encompasses subjects as wide as reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and immigration policy.)\n\nThis is very good news for the Cruz campaign. Heritage Action is the political arm of the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. It wields considerable power and influence in Congress, keeping a scorecard of votes meant to embarrass conservatives who stray from what the organization considers the ideal. But Heritage Action\u2019s reach extends beyond Washington, feeding into the grassroots conservative support system that any eventual GOP will need to rely on in 2016.\n\nHeritage Action was careful not to give the impression of delivering an explicit endorsement in its 50-page analysis of the individual candidates\u2019 positions. In a report that virtually cries out for an overarching graphic presentation of its findings or at least an executive summary, there is nothing beyond a table of contents directing readers to each candidate\u2019s results. The candidate sections are equally businesslike, offering no introduction or conclusion, just an assessment of the candidate on the six listed criteria.\n\nRelated: Carly Fiorina \u2013 I Don\u2019t Do Policy Details\n\nHowever, the results are plain: Ted Cruz is clearly the favorite, earning positive assessments in all categories. \u201cCruz places a high priority on fighting the expansion of government,\u201d the study finds, and \u201cCruz has been willing to pay a political price for taking on government favoritism.\u201d\n\nOther candidates, particularly the current frontrunners, don\u2019t fare nearly so well.\n\nThe authors of the report were plainly unimpressed by Ben Carson, noting that in several categories like growth and national security he has offered little or nothing in the way of actual proposals.\n\nOn other issues, like limited government and favoritism, Carson comes in for criticism. \u201cCarson undermines his limited government rhetoric with his reluctance to tackle entitlement reform,\u201d it reads, and adds, \u201cCarson has the advantage of being a Washington outsider but has provided no evidence he will tackle corporate welfare and has expressed openness to amnesty.\u201d\n\nRelated: Chris Christie Should Be Glad He Was Dropped to the Undercard Debate\n\nIf the authors have doubts about Carson, they seem practically contemptuous of the race\u2019s other frontrunner, Donald Trump.\n\nOn the question of growth, they argue that the \u201cmassive tariffs\u201d he would impose would damage the economy. On the question of civil society, they write, \u201cDespite his rhetoric, Trump\u2019s history suggests a reluctance to engage in debates over protecting civil society from the imposition of left-wing values.\u201d\n\nOn national defense, they write, \u201cTrump has suggested that he would project American strength abroad, but his unconventional foreign policy prescriptions raise more questions of significant consequence than they answer.\u201d\n\nIn a press release accompanying the study, Heritage Action CEO Michael A. Needham said, \u201cAmericans are looking for a president who can speak to the real anxieties they\u2019re facing, not simply manage the status quo in Washington. They want someone that will fight the well-connected special interests and advance policies that work for everyone. Fortunately, conservatives have a deep and visionary field to choose from in this Opportunity for All, Favoritism to None primary.\u201d\n\nReading the report, though, it\u2019s clear that Heritage sees an obvious choice within that \u201cdeep and visionary field.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "An influential political action group in Washington, Heritage Action for America, all but endorsed the presidential candidacy of Texas Sen.
