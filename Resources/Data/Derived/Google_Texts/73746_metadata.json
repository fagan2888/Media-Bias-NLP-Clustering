That tally represents more than 1 out of 4 of all the Obamacare customers who were eligible for such aid.\n\nThe findings by Avalere Health raise concerns that a number of those lower-income people could get stuck with health bills that they could have avoided if only they had selected a plan that might have had higher monthly premiums\u2014but which gave them access to the federal subsidies.\n\n\"Consumers are picking plans on [Obamacare] exchanges based on premiums, rather than out-of-pocket costs,\" said Avalere CEO Dan Mendelson. \"As a result, some patients may be paying more than they need for care.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is about a lot of low-income people leaving significant amounts of money on the table,\" Mendelson said. \"We know, statistically, that most of those people are going to be worse off.\"\n\nAnd more could be worse off in coming years. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that during future enrollments, 3 million eligible Obamacare customers will forgo available assistance to reduce their out-of-pocket costs.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Lower-income Obamacare customers can get help with out-of-pocket health expenses, but many people select plans that aren't eligible for the aid.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Lower-income Obamacare customers can get help with out-of-pocket health expenses, but many people don't select eligible health plans", "title": "'Unaffordably cheap' Obamacare plans snare 2.2M", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/21/22m-obamacare-customers-hurt-by-this-penny-wise-pound-foolish-choice.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/07/29/101876374-450630139.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lower-income Obamacare customers can get help with out-of-pocket health expenses, but many people don't select eligible health plans", "title": "2.2M Obamacare customers hurt by this penny-wise, pound foolish choice", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/21/22m-obamacare-customers-hurt-by-this-penny-wise-pound-foolish-choice.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/07/29/101876374-450630139.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, US: News, Politics, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-08-21T10:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-08-21T10:04:23-0400", "tag": "Politics"}, "pageNodeId": 102935659, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, HealthCare.gov, deductibles, unaffordably"}, "article_summary": "The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that during future enrollments, 3 million eligible Obamacare customers will forgo available assistance to reduce their out-of-pocket costs.\nThat tally represents more than 1 out of 4 of all the Obamacare customers who were eligible for such aid.\n\"Consumers are picking plans on [Obamacare] exchanges based on premiums, rather than out-of-pocket costs,\" said Avalere CEO Dan Mendelson.\nMany lower-income Obamacare customers may have bought some \"unaffordably cheap\" health insurance plans\u2014and are leaving significant amounts of money on the table as a result.\n\"This is about a lot of low-income people leaving significant amounts of money on the table,\" Mendelson said."}
