You may have been looking at one of the members of the Washington Nationals\u2018 2016 starting rotation.\n\nAnd he may not be the only new face in that rotation. He could be joined by either one of the two Nationals young phenoms currently at Single-A Potomac \u2014 Lucas Giolito or Reynaldo Lopez.\n\nIn fact, you will likely be seeing a much different Nationals roster next season, with maybe four or five new faces, as the organizations appears willing to say goodbye to four key players at the end of the year \u2014 a remarkable exodus of talent.\n\nJordan Zimmermann, Ian Desmond, Doug Fister and Denard Span will all have the opportunity to be free agents at the end of the season, and, unless something changes, the Nationals appear willing to let all of them walk \u2014 two-fifths of their highly-touted starting rotation and two starting position players, their leadoff hitter and their shortstop.\n\nIf it does play out that way, it will put general manager Mike Rizzo under the gun from Nationals fans, many of whom will be angry about the exodus and wonder how the Nationals will fill so many key positions all at once.\n\nWell, you got a look at one of the answers Saturday in Ross, the San Diego Padres\u2019 2011 first-round pick, who after being called up from Double-A Harrisburg for the start, pitched well, allowing three runs on six hits and striking out four batters in five innings.\n\nHe didn\u2019t allow a hit until the fourth inning, when the Cubs clearly adjusted to him the second time around. But he appeared poised and confident, which is what manager Matt Williams was looking for.\n\n\u201cAll in all, I think he threw the ball well,\u201d Williams told reporters. \u201cHe was unfazed by the magnitude of it.\u201d\n\nRoss had posted a 2.81 ERA with a 2-2 record in nine starts in Harrisburg, and will likely have a chance to compete next spring for one and possibly two spots in Washington\u2019s 2016 starting rotation. He may be joined in that competition by Giolito, the Nationals\u2018 2012 first-round pick, and Lopez, the free agent Dominican youngster who has impressed Nationals officials and has been named one of the organization\u2019s top five prospects by Baseball America.\n\nThe 2016 Nationals rotation could shape up like this: Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Gio Gonzalez, Tanner Roark and the last spot up for grabs. Or, if there is some other sort of personnel movement \u2014 a trade, or perhaps Roark remains in the bullpen, it could be two places up for competition in the rotation.\n\nIt is going to be a very interesting spring training next year in Viera.\n\nBehind those starters, there will likely be two new young faces on the field in key positions for Washington \u2014 at shortstop and center field, if Desmond and Span depart as free agents \u2014 and one of them isn\u2019t even here yet.\n\nShortstop sensation Trea Turner \u2014 a 2014 first-round draft choice \u2014 was the key part of the trade with San Diego this winter that brought Ross to Washington in the unusual deal that, because of baseball\u2019s rules, kept Turner in the Padres organization because technically, players can\u2019t be traded with a year of being drafted \u2014 but he remains Nationals\u2018 property.\n\nHe has been tearing it up for the Padres\u2019 Double-A San Antonio squad, with a .325 average, five home runs and 30 RBI in 52 games, and soon, when he can officially be moved to the Nationals organization, he will be playing at Harrisburg, but may have a chance to compete for the starting shortstop job next spring.\n\nThe final piece of the new puzzle is center field, where Span has been excellent and also the engine that has driven the Nationals offense at leadoff. He will be a tough piece of the puzzle to replace. But you have been watching his replacement already \u2014 Michael Taylor \u2014 on this year\u2019s team, and although he has struggled offensively in 41 games for Washington, filling in for Span first and now Jayson Werth, we\u2019ve all seen enough moments offensively and defensively to believe that hype that we have heard about this five-tool prospect.\n\nIt\u2019s all a gamble, but it\u2019s also a testament to the player development system that Rizzo and has scouts have built, and it\u2019s also the way good franchises with sustained success do business in 2015. It\u2019s all about payroll flexibility, and the willingness to say goodbye to good, soon-to-be-very highly paid players and have a pipeline ready to replace them.\n\nAnd how do you keep that pipeline filled? With the four \u2014 count \u2018em, four \u2014 compensatory top draft picks the Nationals will receive in the 2016 Major League Baseball draft if Desmond, Span, Zimmermann and Fister, all likely Type A free agents, opt for free agency.\n\nThat\u2019s how you avoid becoming the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did you like what you saw Saturday on the mound from 22-year-old Ross at Nationals Park?
