He was 88.\n\nGhiggia\u2019s son, Arcadio, said his father died of a heart attack.\n\nGhiggia scored the deciding goal 10 minutes from time with the game tied 1-1. It gave Uruguay its second World Cup title in a match Brazilians fully expected to win before about 200,000 fans at Rio\u2019s Maracana stadium. Even a draw would have given Brazil the title. The loss is still known in Brazil as the \u201cMaracanazo.\u201d\n\nGhiggia also set up the tying goal by Juan Schiaffino earlier in the second half.\n\n\u201cOnly three people have silenced the Maracana,\u201d Ghiggia once said of the goal. \u201cThe Pope, Frank Sinatra and me.\u201d\n\nHe was the last surviving Uruguayan player from the match and, poignantly, he died on Thursday, the 65th anniversary of the game.\n\nWhen he turned 80 he was honored by the Uruguayan congress, still a national hero a half decade later.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful what happened\u201d Ghiggia said. \u201cIt filled me with pride and was unforgettable. The biggest moment of my life was at the Maracana.\u201d\n\nPresident Tabare Vazquez mourned the soccer star\u2019s passing in comments to local television station Canal 12, and offered his condolences to Ghiggia\u2019s family and to \u201call of Uruguay\u2019s people.\u201d\n\nOscar Tabarez, the manager of Uruguay\u2019s national team, said Ghiggia \u201cmeant a lot to Uruguayans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is impressive what that man did. What he did in his life, his leadership and his personality,\u201d he said.\n\nThough he was viewed as the nation\u2019s top soccer idol, Ghiggia played only 12 times for the national team and scored only four goals - all in the 1950 World Cup.\n\nGhiggia was born Dec. 22, 1926, and quickly emerged as a right winger with pace who could out run defenses. He started his professional career with the famous Uruguayan club Penarol. He later played in Italy with Roma and AC Milan. Because of his Italian roots, he also played several matches with the Italian national team.\n\nGhiggia was visibly overwhelmed when he was honored in 2009 at the Maracana, placing his footprints in a plastic mold along with other greats of the game like Pele, Eusebio and Franz Beckenbauer.\n\nHe was outspoken to the end. In the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, he criticized Uruguay forward Luis Suarez for biting a player during a World Cup match.\n\nSuarez \u201cplays well but he has done things that are not normal for a player, nor for a soccer game,\u201d Ghiggia told The AP. \u201cI think FIFA can sanction him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Pablo Fernandez in Montevideo contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alcides Edgardo Ghiggia, who scored the winning goal in the final game of the 1950 World Cup to give Uruguay a stunning 2-1 victory over Brazil - still recalled as Brazil's greatest defeat - died on Thursday.
