John Boehner may hurt millions of Americans over the holidays with a new government shutdown because he is still angry over President Obama’s action on immigration.

The Hill report that the House could act on immigration next week included and interesting tidbit,

Boehner has not ruled out the possibility of a government shutdown though he wants to avoid taking the political hit his party suffered in 2013 after a 16-day shutdown provoked by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. He said earlier this month that “our goal here is to stop the president from violating his oath of office and violating the Constitution.”

The media keep saying that Boehner won’t shutdown the government again, but if the Speaker is considering another shutdown, then it is possible. Boehner’s options are extremely limited. The Speaker can’t defund the executive orders. He could file another lawsuit and be laughed out of court. He could pass a meaningless resolution criticizing the executive orders, but his fellow Republicans want action, so it seems that his only real option is to shut down the government.

Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans don’t want another government shutdown, so the nation could be facing a situation where the Senate gets bypassed as Obama and House Republicans square off before Christmas. The odds are that House Republicans will pass a bill that involves some sort of defunding gimmick. The president will veto the bill, and the American people will be held hostage until House Republicans blink and give Obama what he wants.

House Republicans learned nothing from last year because they are considering shutting down the government again. If Republicans thought that the negative publicity from the last government shutdown was bad, wait until the impact millions of people right before Christmas.

Obama has Boehner pinned down, and the fact that he is considering an act of political suicide reveals the depths of his desperation.
