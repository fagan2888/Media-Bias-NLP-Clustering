We made it through Thanksgiving, but now the winter holidays are right around the corner, and Schooners didn't waste any time spreading holiday cheer.

It's the most wonderful time of the year.

"Well with the climate, with this temperature it's just great," said Panama City Beach resident, John Uskert. "It puts us in a festive attitude and it's just really fun."

Friday was the first night of Schooners' holiday party and toy drive.

"It's actually pretty cool," said Tonia Kane. "This is exactly what I told my husband we needed to do moving back was to take advantage of the fact that we live on the world's most beautiful beaches."

Guests enjoyed live music by a bonfire on the beach and kids got free hot chocolate and s'mores, and Santa Claus himself even made an appearance.

"It's family friendly we've got the big three. Food, drinks and music the weathers awesome hey why not," said Schooners General Manager, Michael Whitmer.

The party is for a good cause. The toy drive benefits the local chapter of the Children's Home Society. Everyone who attends is encouraged to bring a new, unwrapped toy for a child in need.

"Last year we got a big box out front where the toys get dropped and last year we filled that up a couple of times and I anticipate we will again this year and it ends up being quite a haul and it's pretty cool when you think that those toys are gonna go to somebody that might not have got anything for Christmas," said Whitmer.

"I really like that they incorporated because instead of just coming out and hanging out with each other you can do something and give back to all the kids who won't get any presents this year for Christmas so I think it's awesome," said Olivia Quave.

Schooners will continue the party Saturday night. Live music and entertainment will start at 10:30.
