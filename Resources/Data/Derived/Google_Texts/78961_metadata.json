The following is a look at where the Republican and Democratic candidates stand on key issues:\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\nDonald Trump\n\nEconomy: Trump, a real estate mogul turned reality television star, has campaigned on his business experience, vowing to bring more jobs to the United States. He said he would impose hefty tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and China and other countries, to encourage American companies to keep jobs in the United States instead of overseas. Trump proposes a \u201csimplified tax code\u201d composed of four tax brackets, instead of the current seven. Under his plan, individuals earning $25,000 or less a year will not be taxed, those earning between $25,001 and $50,000 will have a 10 percent tax rate; those earning between $50,001 and $150,000 will face a 20 percent tax rate and those making more than $150,000 will have a 25 percent rate.\n\nNational Security: Trump has said he would combat the Islamic State terrorist group by bombing the group\u2019s oil fields in Iraq and Syria. Trump has said he is open to using nuclear weapons to fight the Islamic State, and supports the use of waterboarding and other interrogation torture methods. Trump has said he is open to the idea of establishing a database to track Muslims living in the United States in response to ISIS\u2019 recruitment of Muslims.\n\nImmigration: Trump has said he would build a wall along the U.S. and Mexico border to prevent immigrants without legal documents from crossing into the country. He said he would \u201ccompel\u201d the Mexican government to pay for it \u2014 a proposal that Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has said the country will not agree to. Trump said he would eliminate birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to foreign parents, and called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States amid concerns of terrorist threats perpetrated by the Islamic State militant group.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nHealth care: Trump has said he would repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and \u201creplace it with something terrific.\u201d He proposes tax exemptions for consumers who buy individual health care plans, similar to tax write-offs for corporations that pay for employee insurance plans. Trump supports giving U.S. patients the option of purchasing pharmaceutical drugs from overseas. Trump believes states should have greater control over the federally administered Medicaid program, which provides health insurance to low-income Americans.\n\nEducation: Trump has championed charter schools, saying competition would foster improvement. \u201cLet schools compete for kids,\u201d Trump said in November. He opposes the federal Common Core educational standards, believing local governments should set the curriculum. He has said he would consider eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, or cut its spending.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nEconomy: Cruz has focused his economic agenda on implementing a \u201csimple flat tax\u201d across all U.S. income groups. The tax plan calls for consolidating the current seven personal income tax rates into a uniform rate of 10 percent. Cruz contends a simplified tax system will \u201cjump-start\u201d economic growth and jobs. He supports amending the U.S. Constitution to require a federal balanced budget each year. Cruz said in March: \u201cI will pull back the federal regulators, the Environmental Protection Agency and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.\u201d\n\nNational Security: Cruz has said as president he would \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d the Islamic State terrorist group\u2019s strongholds in Iraq and Syria. He has called for the use of \u201coverwhelming air power\u201d to combat the group, but has said it\u2019s \u201cnot necessary\u201d for U.S. troops to be deployed for ground combat. Cruz argues Kurdish fighters \u201care our boots on the ground,\u201d and has called on the United States to arm the local force. Cruz has called for securing the U.S. border with Mexico by erecting 700 miles of fencing and tripling the amount of U.S. Border Patrol agents.\n\nImmigration: Cruz has called for overhauling the nation\u2019s guest worker visa program, by limiting H-1B visas to immigrants with advanced degrees. Cruz said he would end birthright citizenship to prevent foreigners from coming to the United States to give birth. He also proposes criminally charging those who overstay their visas with a federal misdemeanor on their first offense, and a felony for subsequent offenses. Cruz supports granting states and local law enforcement agencies the discretion to enforce federal immigration laws.\n\nHealth care: Cruz has said as president he would \u201crepeal every word of\u201d the Affordable Care Act set forth by President Barack Obama. Cruz has said Americans should be allowed to purchase private health insurance across state lines to create competition in the marketplace, which he contends will drive down costs. He has not addressed whether providers would have to guarantee coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, but has called for expanding the amount people can contribute to tax-exempt health savings accounts.\n\nEducation: Cruz has said he would dismantle or drastically cut back funding to the U.S. Department of Education, believing local governments should be in charge of setting their educational agenda and curriculum. He has said he would repeal the Common Core educational standards, and is a supporter of charter schools as an alternative to public schools.\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nEconomy: Kasich often touts federal statistics that show Ohio generated 400,000 new jobs during his past five years as governor to make the case that his job-generating initiatives could work on the federal level. Kasich has said he would create jobs by supporting small-business growth with his proposals to reduce tax rates and offer incentives to businesses that add new jobs to the U.S. workforce. He also proposes lowering personal income tax rates. Kasich supports amending the U.S. constitution to mandate a federal balanced budget. He served as the chairman of the House Budget Committee in the early 1990s, and often touts his role in drafting 1997\u2019s federal balanced budget.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nNational Security: Kasich wants to increase federal military spending by $102 billion over the next eight years. He believes the United States should work with its allies to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group. Kasich has said the allied nations should support Kurdish fighters as they battle against the terrorists. \u201cAs president, I would immediately summon an emergency meeting at the highest level to begin working with our European, Turkish and Sunni Arab allies to contain and ultimately defeat ISIS in its homeland,\u201d Kasich said after terrorist strikes in Paris.\n\nImmigration: Kasich has said that in his first 100 days in office he would submit an immigration reform proposal focusing on securing the U.S. border with Mexico and creating a new guest-worker visa program. Kasich has said he would seal the border \u201cwith fencing and you do it with technology, drones and sensors.\u201d Kasich in GOP debates has said he would not support the mass deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States; instead, he would \u201cmake them pay a fine and back taxes, and give them a path to legalization, never to citizenship.\u201d\n\nHealth care: Kasich has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act but does support a component of the act that calls on states to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income residents. \u201cMedicaid expansion doesn\u2019t have to be part of Obamacare,\u201d Kasich said in July. He would like to replace Obama\u2019s program with a \u201cmarket-driven\u201d system that relies on \u201cinsurance companies and hospitals working together to share profits, to share the gains they make by keeping people healthy rather than treating them on the basis of how they\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\nEducation: Kasich has said he would \u201creduce the power of the U.S. Department of Education,\u201d saying state and local governments should set their educational agendas. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the federal government driving K-12 education,\u201d Kasich said in July. He supports charter schools but believes states should have more regulatory control of the schools.\n\nDEMOCRATS\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nEconomy: Clinton has said \u201ccreating good-paying jobs and raising incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time.\u201d She proposes increasing jobs by investing in infrastructure and scientific research, and by providing tax relief to small businesses. Clinton has said she would provide a 15 percent tax credit to companies that share profits with their employees, and would place an exit tax on corporations that move their headquarters overseas. She initially supported raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, but has since called for an increase to $15 to mirror increases that were recently signed into law in California and New York.\n\nNational Security: Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, often campaigns on her foreign affairs experience, citing her diplomatic relationship with numerous world leaders. Clinton has said the United States, working in conjunction with its international allies, should play a strong role in combating the Islamic State terrorist group, by using targeted airstrikes and training local Iraqi forces. She opposes deploying U.S. ground troops. Clinton has said she would also work to ensure local U.S. military \u201cis on the cutting edge.\u201d\n\nHealth care: Clinton has said she would \u201cdefend\u201d President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and would look to \u201cbuild\u201d on the health care program. Her plan calls for providing a $5,000 tax credit per family to \u201coffset a portion of excessive out-of-pocket and premium costs\u201d above 5 percent of their income. Clinton proposes capping out-of-pocket charges for drugs at $250. She would like for all states to expand Medicaid health care coverage for low-income Americans, saying she would continue the Obama administration\u2019s policy of providing states 100 percent matching federal funding for the first three years they expand the program.\n\nEnvironment: Clinton has called for installing 500 million solar panels throughout the United States by 2020, and said she would set \u201cnational goals\u201d to reduce American oil consumption by a third. Clinton has said she would aim to have renewable energy sources constitute 33 percent of all the energy produced in the United States by 2027. Clinton has said she\u2019s generally \u201cagainst\u201d fracking for natural gas under certain conditions, including \u201cwhen any locality or any state is against it,\u201d or \u201cwhen the release of methane or contamination of water is present.\u201d\n\nCriminal Justice: In the first major policy speech of her campaign, Clinton vowed to end the \u201cera of mass incarceration.\u201d Clinton said she would support legislation banning the use of racial profiling among law enforcement officers, and would create \u201cnational guidelines for the use of force\u201d against civilians. She supports ending the use of for-profit private prisons and said she would push for federal matching funds to equip local police officers with body cameras.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nEconomy: Sanders has made income inequality and reforming Wall Street the cornerstone of his campaign \u2014 calling for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2020, and pledging to break up financial institutions deemed \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Sanders has said the nation\u2019s big banks \u201care too powerful economically\u201d and politically. He proposes taxing speculative trading, using the revenue generated to fund free tuition at public colleges and universities.\n\nNational Security: Sanders, who voted against approving the Iraq War in 2002, has said the United States should \u201cmove away from a policy of unilateral military action\u201d and focus on diplomacy to \u201censure the decision to go to war is a last resort.\u201d To combat the Islamic State terrorist group, Sanders has said the United States should work in coalition with international allies to defeat the group in its home base of Syria and Iraq, but believes military efforts should be \u201cled and sustained by the nations in the region,\u201d not the United States.\n\nHealth care: Sanders proposes replacing the current Affordable Care Act with a single-payer \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d system that would expand the federal safety net program to all Americans, not just those over the age of 65. Sanders has said by having a federally administered health care program, the U.S. government will gain the leverage to \u201cstand up to drug companies and negotiate fair prices for the American people collectively.\u201d\n\nEnvironment: Sanders has said \u201cclimate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet.\u201d He has called for states to ban fracking for natural gas. He proposes eliminating tax breaks for fossil-fuel companies, and increasing investment in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Sanders has said he would aim to cut U.S. carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050.\n\nCriminal Justice: Amid growing public scrutiny of high-profile police brutality cases, Sanders has said he would create a federal police training program, to teach local officers how to de-escalate confrontations. Sanders said he would require law enforcement officers to wear body cameras and would push for departments \u201cthat reflect the diversity of our communities.\u201d He would ban for-profit prisons, saying they \u201cresult in an over-incentive\u201d to arrest and jail people.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Sun, 17 Apr 2016 17:47:03 -0400", "sailthru.author": "Laura Figueroa", "description": "New York will hold its presidential primaries Tuesday.
