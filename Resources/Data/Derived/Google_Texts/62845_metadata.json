Alexander\u2019s remarks on Thursday evening, which echoed comments he made earlier this week, were made in an interview conducted by Tom Brokaw at a New York dinner hosted by the Business Executives for National Security.\n\nThe conversation focused on the series of revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about NSA programs, including bulk collection of telephone calling information. Gen. Alexander said the programs were necessary to stop terrorist attacks against the United States.\n\nTerrorists \u201clisten, they see what has come out in the press and they adjust,\u201d Gen. Alexander said. He said the damage from the leaks is irreversible. \u201cI believe people will die because we won\u2019t be able to stop some of those threats.\u201d\n\nGen. Alexander also downplayed the reports that NSA had tested using American cell-phone location information, saying that the pilot program was very small. \u201cWe only tested it with less than 50 files and then decided we don\u2019t need it at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real truth: we have never used cell site information to track information in the United States.\u201d\n\nMr. Brokaw probed Gen. Alexander about NSA\u2019s secrecy, asking why the agency could not reveal even the number of its employees. \u201cIsn\u2019t there more that we could know about the NSA?\u201d he asked.\n\nGen. Alexander said he wished he could reveal more information but that the secrecy was necessary to fight terrorism. \u201cIf there was a way to provide the information and terrorists didn\u2019t get it, but the moment you put it in the Washington Post or the New York Times, the terrorist get it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was a way to tell the American people without telling the terrorists, we would do it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "General Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, escalated his critiques of the media coverage of the NSA leaks, saying they would cause people to die, and downplayed NSA\u2019s pilot project on tracking cellphone locations.Terrorists \u201clisten, they see what has come out in the press and they adjust,\u201d Gen.
