As TheBlaze reported on Tuesday, Democrats needs just 17 GOP lawmakers to defect from the majority of Republicans in the House to pass a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution that fully funds both Obamacare and the federal government.\n\n\u201cIf all 200 Democrats stick together and team up with those Republicans, they have the votes to pass a clean funding bill,\u201d the Huffington Post reports.\n\nHowever, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would still have to bring the bill to the floor in order for a vote to take place. In other words, he\u2019s the only person standing in the way of Democrats getting exactly what they have wanted all along.\n\nIt was recently revealed that Boehner\u2019s chief of staff Mike Sommers may have worked with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to exempt Congress from Obamacare, further diminishing the Ohio Republican\u2019s support among conservatives.\n\nThe Huffington Post has updated its list of House Republicans who are ready to give in to the Democrats\u2019 demands:\n\nRep. Pat Meehan (R-Pa.): \u201cAt this point, I believe it\u2019s time for the House to vote for a clean, short-term funding bill to bring the Senate to the table and negotiate a responsible compromise.\u201d [Press Release, 10/1/13] Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.): \u201cTime for a clean [continuing resolution].\u201d [Official Twitter, 10/1/13] Rep. Jon Runyan (R-N.J.): \u201cEnough is enough. Put a clean [continuing resolution] on the floor and let\u2019s get on with the business we were sent to do.\u201d [Burlington County Times, 10/1/13] Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.): A Fitzpatrick aide tells the Philadelphia Inquirer the congressman would support a clean funding bill if it came up for a vote. [Philadelphia Inquirer, 10/1/13] Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.): Barletta said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d vote for a clean bill in order to avert a shut down of the government. [Bethlehem Morning Call, 10/1/13] Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.): King thinks House Republicans would prefer to avoid a shutdown and said he will only vote for a clean continuing resolution to fund the government, according to the National Review Online. [NRO, 9/30/13] Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.): The California Republican told The Huffington Post he would ultimately support a clean continuing resolution. [Tweet by The Huffington Post's Sabrina Siddiqui, 9/30/13] Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.): \u201cI\u2019m prepared to vote for a clean [continuing resolution].\u201d [The Huffington Post, 9/29/13] Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.): A Wolf aide told The Hill that he agrees with fellow Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell (R) that it\u2019s time for a clean continuing resolution. [The Hill, 10/1/13] Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.): A Grimm aide told The Huffington Post that the congressman supports a clean continuing resolution. [10/1/13]. Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.): A local news anchor in Minnesota tweeted that Paulsen told him he would vote for a clean resolution if given the chance. [Blake McCoy Tweet, 10/1/13] Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.): A constituent of Wittman\u2019s sent The Huffington Post an email she got from the congressman indicating he would vote for a clean funding bill but hasn\u2019t had \u201can opportunity to do so at this point.\u201d [10/1/13] Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.): LoBiondo told The Press of Atlantic City he\u2019ll support \u201cwhatever gets a successful conclusion\u201d to the shutdown and a clean funding bill \u201cis one of those options.\u201d [The Press of Atlantic City, 10/1/13] Rep. Randy Forbes (R-Va.): Forbes told The Virginian-Pilot that he supports the six-week clean funding bill that passed in the Senate. [The Virginian-Pilot, 10/2/13] [Editor's note: Congressman Forbes' office contacted TheBlaze and argued the Virginia-Pilot's report on the Republican's CR position is \"misleading at best\" and provided a statement, which they say better articulates his stance: \u201cI hate Obamacare and I hate what the shutdown is doing to families across Virginia. Here\u2019s my plan to address both: I am calling on the House to pass a funding measure to reopen all areas of the government except for the Internal Revenue Service. Not one penny for the IRS,\u201d said Forbes. \u201cThe Internal Revenue Service is the teeth of Obamacare. Under the health care law, the IRS is undergoing massive expansions to hire new agents and enforce 47 new tax provisions. If we defund the IRS, we defund Obamacare.\"] Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-Pa.): The congressman issued a statement saying he would \u201cvote in favor of a so-called clean budget bill.\u201d [Office of Rep. Jim Gerlach, 10/2/13]. Rep.

Mike Simpson (R-Idaho): Simpson told a Roll Call reporter Tuesday night, \u201cI\u2019d vote for a clean CR because I don\u2019t think this is a strategy that works.\u201d [Daniel Newhauser Tweet, 10/1/13] Rep. Bill Young (R-Fla.): Young told Tampa Bay Times reporter Alex Leary that he\u2019s ready to vote for a clean funding bill. \u201cThe politics should be over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to legislate.\u201d [Alex Leary Tweet, 10/2/13] Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.): The congressman told Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo that he would vote for a clean funding bill, provided it has the same funding levels contained in the Senate-passed bill. [The Miami Herald, 10/2/13] Rep. Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.): \u201cI would take a clean (continuing resolution).\u201d [Observer-Dispatch, 10/2/13]\n\nHouse Speaker Boehner\u2019s office cast a Wednesday White House invitation as a sign President Barack Obama might be backing down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased the president finally recognizes that his refusal to negotiate is indefensible,\u201d Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear why we\u2019d be having this meeting if it\u2019s not meant to be a start to serious talks between the two parties.\u201d\n\nReid, for his part, offered a new round of budget talks to House Republicans if they allow the government to reopen.\n\nHe proposed that the talks occur on a nonbinding measure known as a budget resolution that can serve as a template for follow-up legislation on the budget. Democrats have been pressing for official negotiations on the budget resolution for some time, but Republicans have resisted, saying they won\u2019t give any ground on taxes.\n\nBoehner rejected Reid\u2019s offer, said spokesman Michael Steel.\n\nDo you think Boehner will stand firm against Democrats?\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
