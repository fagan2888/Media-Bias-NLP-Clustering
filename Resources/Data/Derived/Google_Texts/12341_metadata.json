This week, it\u2019s not amusing to the First Family, nor should it be to anyone else \u2013 but it follows a pattern that runs through Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a lunatic jumped over the White House fence and ran across the lawn. While not a regular occurrence, the Secret Service protection detail at the White House (separate from the details for the President and his family) has to deal with the occasional fence jumper. This time, though, the jumper had a knife and ran all the way to the front door \u2013 which, for some reason, had been left unlocked \u2013 and into the building.\n\nRelated: Relentless Incompetence\u2014Americans Are Giving Up on Obama\n\nAs bad as it was that the intruder carried a knife, it could have been much worse. The Department of Defense and Department of Justice have repeatedly warned of the danger from a handful of Americans who have traveled to Syria, Iraq, and Somalia to take part in Islamist terror groups, and who might return in order to conduct attacks in the US. Had it been a gun or a bomb, or had the intruder known enough to make a sharp left to get to the stairs to the residence, we may have been faced with an unthinkable outcome.\n\nCongress was shocked, mainly because the Secret Service kept many of those details from Capitol Hill. They only came out because whistleblowers tipped off Rep. Jason Chaffetz, among others, who then revealed just how far the intruder got and why the door alarm never went off. Chaffetz told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that the situation should have been handled with lethal force.\n\nOn the heels of these revelations, The Washington Post published an explosive expose\u2019 of a 2011 attack on the White House. A sniper shot nine rounds at the second-level residence, hitting the fa\u00e7ade and windows at least seven times. Despite the initial reports of gunfire, the Secret Service\u2019s supervisor concluded that no gunfire had come toward the White House itself. Days later, a housekeeper discovered the damage, forcing the Secret Service to open an investigation into the shooting and their own handling of the incident.\n\nRelated: FBI\u2019s Failed $550M IT Project Cripples Investigations\n\nOn Tuesday, Secret Service Director Julia Pierson testified in a House Oversight Committee hearing that the violation was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and that she took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the incident. Needless to say, that hardly impressed the panel members, starting with chair, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA). After Pierson tried laying the blame on budget woes, Issa asked, \u201cHow much would it take to lock the front door of the White House?\u201d\n\nNot long after Pierson\u2019s testimony ended, Congress got another unpleasant surprise from a story published in the Washington Examiner. Two other whistleblowers revealed that the Secret Service had allowed an armed felon on an elevator with President Obama just three days prior to the fence-jumping incident.\n\nA security guard at the CDC in Atlanta who should have been vetted by the Secret Service began behaving oddly, prompting an immediate interview. His supervisor demanded the weapon from the guard, which stunned the Secret Service, who was unaware that the man had been armed at all. Later, a records check showed that the guard had a criminal record.\n\nRelated: Secret Service Head Resigns After Multiple Lapses in Security\n\nEven before that story came out, though, members of Congress from both parties wondered whether Pierson could handle the job. Both Issa and ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) agreed that the Secret Service\u2019s internal investigation had little credibility and planned to make a formal request for an independent probe of the agency\u2019s failure in protecting the White House.\n\nCummings told the media \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d on whether Pierson could continue effectively as Director, and Issa drily quipped, \u201cThis hearing did not add to my confidence.\u201d Another Democrat, Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, was more direct during the hearing. \u201cI wish to God,\u201d Lynch rebuked Pierson, \u201cyou had protected the White House like you are protecting your reputation.\u201d\n\nThe combined failures at the CDC and the White House proved too much for Pierson. Under fire for the next twenty-four hours after her testimony, she tendered her resignation, and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson accepted it. Ironically, Pierson owed her job to another Secret Service scandal, one of the few times Obama held a senior administration official accountable for failure. Her predecessor Mark Sullivan resigned in 2012, forced out by the Cartagena sex scandal and an abuse of resources for the benefit of a Sullivan aide in a neighborhood dispute. Pierson was picked to solve the problems within the culture of the Secret Service \u2013 and has clearly failed.\n\nRelated: Incompetence and Abuse Call for a Clean Sweep of the IRS\n\nOtherwise, this President does not hold many people accountable for their failures, real or imagined. Obama didn\u2019t fire Eric Holder after the ATF\u2019s Operation Fast and Furious trafficked thousands of semiautomatic weapons to drug cartels in Mexico, resulting in the deaths of hundreds, including Border Patrol agent Brian Terry.\n\nNeither did Obama demand the job of Kathleen Sebelius after she botched the rollout of Obamacare and the federal exchange, despite spending nearly a half-billion dollars and having three and a half years to accomplish the task. Obama forced Eric Shinseki to resign only after his incompetence at the VA threatened to expose Obama\u2019s complete lack of interest in it during his presidency. The President kept James Clapper on the job as Director of National Intelligence even after deliberately misleading Congress on the scope of the NSA\u2019s surveillance capabilities.\n\nIn fact, Obama still hasn\u2019t fired Clapper even after blaming the intelligence community for the unpleasant surprise of ISIS\u2019 sweep in Iraq and Syria, either. Speaking to 60 Minutes on Sunday, Obama told Steve Kroft that the intelligence community failed to foresee ISIS\u2019 rise. \u201cThey underestimated\u201d the threat, Obama said, referring back to a statement made by Clapper earlier in the week. However, that isn\u2019t what Clapper said, nor did the intelligence community underestimate the threat.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Command Economy\u2014Incompetent at Every Level\n\nAs early as January of this year \u2013 when Obama called ISIS the \u201cjayvees\u201d of the terrorist world despite seizing Fallujah \u2013 the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency warned Congress that ISIS was poised to seize large swaths of territory in 2014. Former Vice Admiral and Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak put the blame squarely on the White House for not paying attention. \u201cI think it was slow on the part of the entire administration,\u201d Sestak told a visibly stunned Jose\u2019 Diaz-Balart on MSNBC, \u201cto assess that they \u2014 what they had to do in order address the threat.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s say, though, that Obama was justified in blaming the intelligence community for the failure. Why are the same people still in charge? Why would the incompetence and failure, which was repeated with Clapper, not prompt the boss to put someone in charge who can handle the job better? Why did Holder, Sebelius, Clapper, and other incompetents or scapegoats within the administration continue in those positions after demonstrable failure?\n\nThe answer is that the incompetence starts at the top. Pierson\u2019s fall from grace may or may not solve the problem at the Secret Service, but the rest of the bureaucracy has already learned that there is usually no price to pay for incompetence in an organization run by Barack Obama.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The cavalcade of incompetence from the Obama administration would be amusing, if the s", "title": "Secret Service Incompetence: One of Many Under Obama", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/10/02/Secret-Service-Incompetence-One-Many-Under-Obama", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05122014_Secret_Service_Agent.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/10/02/Secret-Service-Incompetence-One-Many-Under-Obama", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05122014_Secret_Service_Agent.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The cavalcade of incompetence from the Obama administration would be amusing, if the s", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Congress was shocked, mainly because the Secret Service kept many of those details from Capitol Hill.\nA security guard at the CDC in Atlanta who should have been vetted by the Secret Service began behaving oddly, prompting an immediate interview.\nHis supervisor demanded the weapon from the guard, which stunned the Secret Service, who was unaware that the man had been armed at all.\nDays later, a housekeeper discovered the damage, forcing the Secret Service to open an investigation into the shooting and their own handling of the incident.\nTwo other whistleblowers revealed that the Secret Service had allowed an armed felon on an elevator with President Obama just three days prior to the fence-jumping incident."}
