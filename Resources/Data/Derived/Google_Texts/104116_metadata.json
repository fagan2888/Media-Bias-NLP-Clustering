Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL) lashed out at Republicans and claimed that her opponent doesn\u2019t understand how the health care system works.\n\nThe two traded barbs on-air, repeatedly speaking over one another and clashing on a variety of subjects.\n\nThe debate heated up after host Newt Gingrich said that Obamacare is \u201da war on people with critical diseases.\u201d Priebus followed up these comments by warning about what might happen if businesses decide to drop coverage.\n\n\u201cJust wait until the employers start having the option of dropping the insurance coverage,\u201d Priebus said, going on to decry the fact that \u201dmillions of people are (already) getting their insurance dropped.\u201d\n\nWasserman-Schultz shot back, though, defending Obamacare and noting that she hasn\u2019t heard any viable reform ideas coming from the GOP.\n\n\u201cI have yet to hear, nor has anyone in the Republican Party said, what is the solution to ensuring that everyone in America has access to affordable health care?\u201d she responded.\n\nFrom there, the debate intensified, with the two political leaders lambasting one another\u2019s knowledge about America\u2019s health care complex.\n\n\u201cYou obviously do not understand how the health insurance system works,\u201d Wasserman-Schultz charged.\n\nBut Priebus responded by claiming that it is Wasserman-Schultz who is confused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one that promised that people would keep their health insurance and you promised that people would keep their doctor, but it turns out that it\u2019s not true \u2014 so maybe you are the one that needs to learn what the effects are of Obamacare and this health care system,\u201d Priebus said.\n\nWatch the clash below:\n\nThe two also debated electoral politics, with Wasserman-Schultz claiming that the GOP is out of touch with mainstream Americans. Priebus, of course, disagreed.\n\n\u201cYou keep it up running on Obamacare, we\u2019re going to do just fine,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch that dialogue below:\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Sparks flew on Tuesday night when the heads of the Democratic and Republican parties met face-to-face\u00a0on CNN's \"Crossfire\" for their first joint appearance in over a year.
