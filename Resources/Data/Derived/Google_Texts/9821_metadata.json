As such, when payers are attempting to position new payment models and innovative solutions through their health insurance plans, bringing employers to the table could be beneficial for all.\n\nEarlier this month, at the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) National Payment Innovation Summit, Dr. Robert Galvin, MBA, MD, CEO at Equity Healthcare, discussed the importance of involving the employer perspective when creating health insurance plans and other payment reforms throughout the health payer industry.\n\n\u201cI want to talk about why the folks involved in payment reform should care what employers think. Benefit design is moving in a direction that isn\u2019t compatible with payment reform. Commercial payers are important [when it comes to benefit design],\u201d Galvin began.\n\n\u201cWhy should any provider care about the employers since they never see employers and never hear about employers? \u2018Why should I care?\u2019 payers and providers consider,\u201d continued Galvin.\n\n\u201cI think the reason is that we are the voice behind the insurers. It\u2019s really not their money that they\u2019re using. It\u2019s the employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 money that payers are using.\u201d\n\n\u201cPayers could innovate with GE or other major employers. [Medicare and federal agencies] have a theory of what they want to do and if it\u2019s not where you want to go, you can work with employers,\u201d explained Galvin.\n\n\u201cThrough employers is how the workers get all their benefits. It is how employees and their kids get benefits.\u201d\n\nCompetitive health coverage important to employees\n\nIt\u2019s important for payers to remember that health insurance plans and benefits are also very important to employees. A survey from Harris Poll initiated by the software business Collective Health illustrated that more than three-quarters of respondents believe that healthcare coverage options are the main stimulus for their workplace decisions.\n\nThe survey polled more than 2,000 employees about health insurance plans and employer-sponsored healthcare benefits. Out of all respondents who have employer-sponsored coverage, 86 percent felt that competitive benefits would be a real benefit to choosing a certain job.\n\nThe results also show that 57 percent would not accept a job offer without competitive healthcare benefits and 78 percent said they\u2019d put healthcare benefits under sincere consideration when choosing a job.\n\nThe company Benefitfocus released a report that details some of the changes taking place in employer-sponsored health insurance plans due to the reforms created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nHow high-deductible health plans are affecting the workplace\n\nThe researchers from Benefitfocus looked at enrollment data from 500 large companies to determine how employers are incentivizing employee retention through healthcare coverage. The report shows that 52 percent of employers offer a minimum of one high-deductible health insurance plan.\n\nEven though HMOs and PPOs remain the dominant types of health coverage plans, more employers are now offering low-cost options like high-deductible plans. Additionally, 41 percent of employees are choosing these high-deductible plans instead of more typical health insurance plans like HMOs and PPOs, the report found.\n\nOut of the employees who are choosing these high deductible health insurance plans, the majority are younger with millennials taking up the highest portion of the workers.\n\n\u201cHDHP [high-deductible health plan] adoption rates were highest for millennials, at approximately 44 percent, and decreased with each older generation, bottoming out at 22 percent for traditionalists. This could simply be the result of familiarity \u2013 HDHPs are less of a novelty for millennials, while traditionalists might be more reluctant to change \u2013 or of income \u2013 millennials presumably earn less than older generations and therefore choose to spend less on premiums,\u201d the report stated. \u201cOr it could be that these millennials recognized their relatively low risk of needing extensive health care and understood the HDHP \u2014 essentially catastrophic health insurance \u2014 to be their most cost-effective option. Meanwhile, with health risk typically increasing with age, the older generations would be more inclined to see copay-based traditional plans as the most cost-effective route.\u201d\n\nThe report also uncovered that the biggest companies have the right monetary numbers needed to avoid the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Cadillac Tax, which goes into effect in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis report marks a new era in employee benefits. With sophisticated enterprise benefits management systems like the Benefitfocus Platform, we can now draw meaningful insights from actual employee behavior,\u201d Shawn Jenkins, Benefitfocus CEO, said in a public statement. \u201cThis is a quantum leap forward for CHROs, CFOs, administrators and all of us working to turn benefits into a strategic asset. This report provides a road map for policymakers looking to expand health care coverage while controlling costs.\u201d\n\nVoluntary benefits are being offered in low numbers with a mere 36 percent of employers providing accident, critical illness, or hospital indemnity insurance in 2016 while only 14 percent of workers enrolling in these particular coverage plans.\n\nThe results show that while 52 percent of employers offer traditional health plans and high-deductible plans, 42 percent offer only HMOs and PPOs and 6 percent of employers have just the high-deductible coverage offerings.\n\nThe report also mentions that, as more employees seek cost-cutting strategies and methods to lower premium prices, the popularity of high-deductible plans may go up. As the popularity of these health insurance plans increases, \u201cfull replacement offerings\u201d among employers is expected to rise.\n\nIn order to boost the utilization of these high-deductible health insurance plans, employers are providing more support to workers to educate them on all of their health coverage options. Tools are being used to better guide employees to the appropriate choice for their wellness and bottom dollar. Companies using these new tools have seen a rise in worker selection of the high-deductible plans.\n\nHealth payers interested in new payment models such as bundled payments, value-based care reimbursement, or the development of accountable care organizations are urged to work with employers to develop innovative solutions today\u2019s workforce is searching for.\n\nImage Credits: Benefitfocus", "article_metadata": {"description": "When payers are attempting to position innovative solutions through their health insurance plans, bringing employers to the table could be beneficial for all.", "author": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/52-of-employers-offer-high-deductible-health-insurance-plans", "site_name": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "image": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/business-man.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "52% of Employers Offer High-Deductible Health Insurance Plans"}, "twitter": {"description": "When payers are attempting to position innovative solutions through their health insurance plans, bringing employers to the table could be beneficial for all.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/business-man.jpg"}, "title": "52% of Employers Offer High-Deductible Health Insurance Plans", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The results show that while 52 percent of employers offer traditional health plans and high-deductible plans, 42 percent offer only HMOs and PPOs and 6 percent of employers have just the high-deductible coverage offerings.\nIn order to boost the utilization of these high-deductible health insurance plans, employers are providing more support to workers to educate them on all of their health coverage options.\nEven though HMOs and PPOs remain the dominant types of health coverage plans, more employers are now offering low-cost options like high-deductible plans.\nThe report shows that 52 percent of employers offer a minimum of one high-deductible health insurance plan.\nAdditionally, 41 percent of employees are choosing these high-deductible plans instead of more typical health insurance plans like HMOs and PPOs, the report found."}
