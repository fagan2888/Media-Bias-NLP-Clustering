Survey: Detroit hospital profits, patient volume down; elsewhere in state, hospital income up

Hospitals in metro Detroit suffered declining income and patients in 2013, while HMO enrollment surged and profits dipped during the first half of 2014, according to the 2014 Michigan Health Market Review.

On the other hand, hospitals outside of Southeast Michigan posted stronger profit numbers, said Minneapolis-based consultant Allan Baumgarten in his annual report.

“Detroit-area hospitals are combining to compete for shares of a shrinking pie as their key metrics fell in 2013,” said Baumgarten in his Michigan Market Report. “However, hospitals in other parts of the state improved their profitability and their inpatient volume in 2013. And health insurers saw an influx of new Medicaid and individual insurance enrollees in the first half of 2014.”

Here are the key findings in the report:

• Hospitals in the Detroit area had net income of $286.1 million in 2013, or 2.7 percent of net patient revenue of $10.6 billion. That is down from 2012 net income of $367.9 million, which was 3.4 percent of net patient revenue.

Baumgarten said lower income totals are primarily due to fewer inpatient admissions, partially related to declining population, but also on efforts by the Affordable Care Act policies to save money on unnecessary readmissions.

Detroit Medical Center, owned by for-profit Tenet Healthcare Corp., broke even in 2013, after reporting steadily increasing from 2009 to 2012, the report said.

However, St. John Providence Health System, which operates five hospitals in Southeast Michigan, had the biggest improvement in financial results and posted an average margin of 6 percent, the report said.

• Some 41 hospitals in other parts of the state improved their combined net income from $554.7 million in 2012 to $847.1 million. Collectively, the hospitals lost $800 million on operations, but generated $1.63 billion in other revenues.

However, eight those hospitals recorded margins of 10 percent or more, including Borgess Health in Kalamazoo, McLaren Health Care hospitals in Bay City, Flint and Petoskey, Spectrum Health Butterworth and Trinity Health St. Mary’s, both in Grand Rapids.

On the HMO side, enrollment increased by 16 percent in the first half of 2014, driven mostly by 265,000 new Medicaid recipients added by Healthy Michigan Medicaid program, an Obamacare-related project.

However, profit margins for Michigan HMOs dropped again in the first half of 2014. HMOs recorded net income of $80.8 million with margins that averaged only 1.2 percent, down from 1.8 percent the previous year.

Priority Health recorded a 4 percent total margin; Humana Medical Plan had 10.4 percent; and Blue Care Network recorded a 0.7 percent margin.
