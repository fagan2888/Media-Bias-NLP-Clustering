But she might also set a good example for healthcare-payer companies, panelists said at the MidAmerica Healthcare Venture Forum on Tuesday at the Fairmont Chicago.\n\nAsked how such companies might strengthen consumer engagement at a time when people are likely more interested in Kardashian than insurance, Cigna\u2019s Michael Sturmer said there\u2019s opportunity to improve communication beyond 300-page enrollment booklets that don\u2019t tell consumers what they really need to know.\n\n\u201cWe have to become storytellers,\u201d Sturmer said. \u201cDon\u2019t run from the Kim Kardashian analogy \u2014 I think we actually embrace that. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t be more media savvy in healthcare. Make it fun. Make it engaging.\n\n\u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to be a game, but everything can be interesting.\u201d\n\nSturmer, Independence Blue Cross\u2019 Tom Olenzak and Sandbox Industries\u2019 Anna Haghgooie discussed changes in the industry as a result of the Affordable Care Act, among other topics, including insurance companies\u2019 investment trends. Kathleen Tune, a partner at healthcare venture firm Thomas, McNerney & Partners, moderated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really being asked to do things we\u2019ve never done before,\u201d said Olenzak, managing director for Independence Blue Cross\u2019 innovation portfolio and the director for corporate development.\n\n\u201cWe traditionally used to sell to big companies, and the members kind of came along as part of the package. Now, we\u2019re selling on the exchanges to individual members. We\u2019re having to build brand recognition; we\u2019re having to worry about consumer experience.\u201d\n\nMidAmerica Healthcare Venture Forum Panelists at the the MidAmerica Healthcare Venture Forum discuss changes in the industry as a result of the Affordable Care Act among other topics.

It\u2019s thousand-dollar decisions, thousands of dollar decisions.\u201d\n\nOlenzak said Independence Blue Cross has begun using a mobile enrollment center, The Independence Express, to hit up parades, schools and block parties in southeastern Pennsylvania. The vehicle is designed to teach consumers about the changes introduced by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHaghgooie, managing director at Sandbox, which has a partnership with BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners, said health insurers and health systems need to invest in being more helpful for consumers as they\u2019re making daily healthcare-related financial decisions.\n\n\u201cThink about banking online: If your bank didn\u2019t have a great mobile app that let you pay your checks digitally, you might think about switching banks, or you certainly wouldn\u2019t look at them to finance your house,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "What Kim Kardashian can teach healthcare payers about consumers", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Blue Sky", "author": "Blue Sky", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Kim Kardashian is a foremost expert in selfies and reality TV.
