Those statements were part of the usual data collection for FDA approval of the device.\n\n\u201cI realized something could go wrong in a clinical trial, but I thought they would take care of me, and that if something wasn\u2019t right, they\u2019d fix it,\u201d said Hudak, who eventually had a hysterectomy to remove the implants in 2013 and has filed a claim against Essure\u2019s manufacturer for compensation for her injuries.\n\nHudak is one of several clinical trial participants who say that when they experienced complications with the implant, doctors and nurses ignored or belittled their symptoms, insisted they could not possibly have been caused by Essure, and referred them elsewhere for treatment.\n\nOn Thursday, a FDA advisory committee will hold a public hearing in Silver Spring, Md., to address questions about the safety and effectiveness of Essure, which was approved in 2002.\n\nSome women\u2019s health care advocates want the device pulled off the market, and a citizen petition filed with the FDA by a Florida law firm says that the approval process and clinical trials were \u201creplete with fraud.\u201d\n\nUsers have filed 5,093 complaints with the FDA citing chronic pelvic pain, debilitating periods, pregnancies that occurred with Essure including five that ended in fetal death, hysterectomies to remove devices that moved to other organs or broke apart, and four patient deaths, including one by suicide.\n\nOfficials with Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, which purchased Essure in 2013 for $1.1 billion from the company that developed it, Conceptus Inc., said they have full confidence in the device and are not concerned about alterations in medical records.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the proper clinical practice procedures were followed,\u201d said Dr. Edio Zampaglione, Bayer\u2019s vice president for United States medical affairs and women\u2019s affairs who has not seen all the clinical trial records. \u201cIf a mistake was identified, it was crossed out, initialed and dated. \u2026 There was full transparency.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the Cleveland Clinic echoed that statement. The investigator, Dr. Linda Bradley, refused requests for an interview, but a clinic spokeswoman said that \u201cit is common practice\u201d to update documentation over the course of a clinical trial \u201cto reflect all possibilities related to medical events.\u201d\n\nThe FDA noted in its briefing materials for Thursday\u2019s hearing it was aware of the allegations from women that records had been altered but said its monitoring of the study showed no evidence of that.\n\nBut a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday offered harsh criticism of the clinical trials on the implant.\n\n\u201cThough Essure offers possible advantages to women seeking sterilization, the evidence suggests that it is neither as effective nor as safe as the pre-marketing approval evaluation indicated,\u201d Drs. Sanket S. Dhruva, Joseph S. Ross and Aileen M. Gariepy wrote.\n\nThe physicians criticized the lack of a comparison group and the rush to approve the permanent implant after only a year of followup for most clinical trial participants.\n\nThey also noted concerns \u201cabout incomplete followup and biased results\u201d in longer-term studies, and they suggested the fact that nearly one-third of the trial participants did not complete the trial meant that \u201cadverse events including unintended pregnancies were probably missed.\u201d\n\nChanges In The Charts\n\nThe Essure implants consist of small coils, made of a nickel alloy and a polyester-like fiber that are placed in the Fallopian tubes, where they trigger inflammation that causes scar tissue to form, blocking the tubes and preventing conception.\n\nBayer refuses to say how many devices have been used in the United States, but says over one million units have been sold worldwide and 750,000 women use them.\n\nHudak, the mother of one son, joined an early Essure trial. She said that researchers did not think the symptoms she developed were related to the device.\n\nShe said she was surprised, however, to find in her records that the answers she gave in response to questions about pain, adverse health effects and even whether her period was late had been altered, with no changed to yes and vice versa.\n\nSome answers had been crossed out completely. All of the changes were initialed and dated, according to the copies she provided to a reporter.\n\nIn those records, Bradley wrote on her chart on Jan. 28, 2002, that the cause of the back pain, which was worse before her menstrual period, was unknown but \u201cdoes not appear to be gynecologic.\u201d\n\nLater that year, on Nov. 14, Hudak called to report she had been bleeding after intercourse for the past two months, and the clinic note says Bradley referred Hudak to \u201cher regular gyn.\u201d\n\nHudak said that over the years, she started to suffer from migraines, rashes, joint pain and fatigue. But she said that after she got the implants removed, \u201cthat pain I had in my back all those years, every single day, went away.\u201d\n\nKimberly Lira Huddleston says she found her records also did not reflect her answers to researchers at Women\u2019s Health Research in Phoenix. After getting the implants in 2000, she says she was in constant pain.\n\nShe complained to the clinical investigators for three years, she said, finally showing up at the research center and demanding they remove the implants. The researchers ordered her to leave the premises, she recalled.\n\n\u201cThey had no concern for me,\u201d said Huddleston, now 39, who still has chronic pelvic pain. \u201cOnce I wanted the implants out, I was of no use to them.\u201d\n\nWhen Huddleston, who has not filed a lawsuit or statements with the FDA, obtained her records from the study recently, she said she found a document signed by the principal investigator stating that she had no problems with Essure but had withdrawn from the trial and couldn\u2019t be found, despite numerous attempts to reach her.\n\nThe clinical trial record she provided to a reporter shows the word \u201csevere\u201d crossed out from her report of \u201csevere menstrual cramping.\u201d The word \u201congoing\u201d was crossed out from a response about abdominal cramping. The changes were initialed and dated by researchers.\n\nOfficials at the Phoenix center did not respond to repeated phone calls. The founder of the center, the late Dr. Jay M. Cooper, is one of the chief authors of research papers on Essure. He noted in those publications that he owned equity stock in the company.\n\nPatricia Reese Rhodes was also a participant in the trial at the Phoenix center. Born in 1976, she discovered that her medical record listed her birth year as 1956, as she points out in an affidavit to the FDA, making it appear she was in her mid-40s rather than in her mid-20s when she was sterilized.\n\nWhile clinical trials generally prefer young healthy participants who are less likely to develop complications, the FDA required that women as old as 44 be represented in the Essure trial.\n\nSide Effects Dismissed\n\nSeveral other clinical trial participants who developed serious health complications said they were also told the problems were not related to the device.\n\nBut that raises concerns among some experts such as Dr. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit consumer think tank and research group based in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe whole point of a trial is to capture things you wouldn\u2019t know would happen. It doesn\u2019t matter if you think the symptoms are related or not. They should be counted,\u201d she said.\n\nA clinical trial participant at the Greenville, S.C., trial site said she was dropped from the study after complaining of acute pain.\n\nCrystal Johnson Brown, now 39, said investigators told her the pain came from pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the female reproductive organs, and since it was a sexually transmitted disease, she should seek treatment elsewhere.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they never called me no more,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cI never heard from them again.\u201d\n\nBrown said she still has severe debilitating lower back and pelvic pain and often seeks help at emergency rooms because she has no insurance. But Zuckerman says that her infection, like all health problems, should have been recorded in the trial data.\n\nGabriella Avina, a study participant at a San Ramon, Calif., trial site, was so enthusiastic about Essure that she became a paid spokeswoman for Conceptus for several years, answering questions women wrote in to \u201cAsk Gaby.\u201d\n\nAvina was in her mid-30s when she had Essure implanted in 2000. Just a few months after getting the implant, Avina developed a thyroid disease, which is not uncommon among women.\n\nThen, in 2002, she started bruising and was diagnosed with the blood platelet disorder thrombocytopenia, and in 2004, she was diagnosed with celiac disease. In 2009, she started falling and was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, and in 2011, she was diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome, which causes dry eyes and dry mouth.\n\nAll five of the diseases are auto-immune diseases. Avina, a nurse who will be testifying at the FDA hearing, said that even though there is no evidence the conditions were triggered by an immune response to the implant, they should have been recorded in the clinical data.\n\nShe said researchers were unable to locate her records when she sought to get them, but she does not believe they noted the other problems she was encountering. She has always been unable to wear cheap jewelry that contains nickel, and thinks her problems may have been related to a possible response to the nickel in the device.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing is that because I worked in the clinical research center, they knew I was sick,\u201d said Avina, who had a hysterectomy to remove the implants last year. Her health conditions have not resolved.\n\nNo Comparison Group\n\nOne of the problems with clinical trials of medical devices is that there is rarely a control group of similar women for comparison, which is standard in clinical trials of drugs, where a comparison group receives a placebo, said Dr. William Maisel, the chief scientist and deputy center director for science at the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.\n\n\u201cThese studies did not have a comparison group of women who did not get the Essure device, so the ability to conclude the relative rates of symptoms in Essure patients compared to other patients can\u2019t be correctly done through these studies,\u201d Maisel said.\n\nMaisel said the FDA believes the benefits of Essure still outweigh the risks, and that all birth control choices have risks as well as benefits.\n\nBut to Zuckerman, telling a patient that the pain in the pelvis is definitely not related to the device is not defensible. \u201cIf you put something in the pelvic area, it\u2019s ridiculous to assume that pelvic pain has nothing to do with it,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Kim Hudak was a young mother who was done having children when she volunteered for a clinical trial to an experimental birth control implant designed to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/contraceptive-implant-under-microscope", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201509/Essure.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Kim Hudak was a young mother who was done having children when she volunteered for a clinical trial to an experimental birth control implant designed to", "title": "Contraceptive Implant Under Microscope"}, "wordCount": 2017, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Roni Caryn Rabin of Kaiser Health News", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Contraceptive Implant Under Microscope"}, "nid": 12080, "datePublished": "2015-09-24", "story_id": 443072260, "keywords": "contraceptive implant, clinical trial, Essure, birth control, birth control implant", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The physicians criticized the lack of a comparison group and the rush to approve the permanent implant after only a year of followup for most clinical trial participants.\nKim Hudak was a young mother who was done having children when she volunteered for a clinical trial to an experimental birth control implant designed to make her sterile without tube tying surgery.\nShe complained to researchers at the Cleveland Clinic and was told her problems were not related to the implant.\nHudak, the mother of one son, joined an early Essure trial.\nA clinical trial participant at the Greenville, S.C., trial site said she was dropped from the study after complaining of acute pain."}
