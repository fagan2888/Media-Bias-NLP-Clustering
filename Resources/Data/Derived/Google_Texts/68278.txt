A Georgia woman calls a precious moment with her mother "God’s gift.” Kelly Gunderson’s 87-year-old mother has Alzheimer's and couldn't remember who her daughter was, but miraculously, her memory was restored for a few minutes. She called her daughter by name and told her she loved her. It was all caught on camera.

“My 87-year-old mother with Alzheimer's knew who I was, even if it was for just a moment," Gunderson wrote in the YouTube video description. In the heart-warming video, Gunderson is lying beside her white-haired mother and tries to help her recognize her. “Do you know you’re my momma?” she asks.

“Uh-huh,” the elderly woman replies. Gunderson, shocked, asks again, “You do? A while ago you said you didn’t know you were my momma." For a little while, Gunderson’s mom sounds confused. She tells her daughter that she acted like her mother, not appearing to comprehend that she was actually Gunderson’s mother.

Gunderson goes on to explain that she was her momma and told her she would only lie down beside someone that she loved. Her mother seems to have understood her daughter, but her language is still a little unclear. Then, suddenly, the unexpected occurs: Gunderson’s mother tells her daughter she loves her.

Gunderson was shocked and began to stutter and ask her mother, “But do you know who I am, though?” And her mother responds, "Uh-huh. Well, I love Kelly, and didn't I name you Kelly? Well, I love you, Kelly." Gunderson is an identical twin, so for her mother to remember her was very special, she wrote on YouTube.

Gunderson said she shared her video to encourage others who have loved ones battling Alzheimer's. It’s the most common form of dementia and affects five million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
