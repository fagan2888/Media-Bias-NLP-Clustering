Local tax experts seeing more people having to file a second time

JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. -

The end of tax season is less than a month away.

Judy Herron, a tax expert at H&R block in Johnson City said they had their big rush at the beginning of the tax season, back in early February. And since then, it's been steady.

Herron said the biggest difference she's seeing this year is more people coming in with health care forms.

That's because in the last year, millions of people bought health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. So they may have gotten a form labeled 1095 A. Herron said if you have that form, you'll need it to file your taxes.

We also asked what is one of the biggest problems you're seeing this year. Herron said they've noticed that a lot of people are having to file a second time.

"They might bring in that additional form after they filed," Herron said. "It could be a retirement account that they forgot they cashed in. It could be a 1095-A through healthcare.gov. That they weren't aware they had an additional form."

Herron said just bring in all the paperwork you think you might need just to be safe.

We also looked at last year's audit numbers. In 2015, 1.2 million people were audited less than 1% of those who filed. That's the lowest percentage since 2004.

The last day to file your taxes in April 18th.
