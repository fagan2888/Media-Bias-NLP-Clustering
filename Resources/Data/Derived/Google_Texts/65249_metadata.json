But despite having to stay off the field, the 22-year-old striker with the dyed-blonde fauxhawk is still expecting Brazil to win its sixth World Cup title.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be able to fulfill the dream of playing in a World Cup final,\u201d Neymar said, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure they will win this one, they will become champions, and I will be there with them, and all of Brazil will be celebrating together.\u201d\n\nAlong with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar was among the biggest stars at the World Cup. And in Brazil, the man in the yellow No. 10 jersey is something of a megastar, with his face plastered on billboards around the country and constantly shown in TV.\n\nHis play on the field lived up to the hype, with four goals in the group stage. He continued to make an impact, albeit without any more goals, in the knockout games until he took a knee in the back late in the match against Colombia.\n\nThe question for Brazil now, however, is who will step up to replace Neymar as the focal point of the attack? The much-maligned Fred has been largely ineffective so far, while Hulk has also failed to score for the hosts.\n\nAnd making things tougher on Brazil is the suspension of captain Thiago Silva. The Paris Saint-Germain defender scored the first goal in the quarterfinal victory, but later picked up a yellow card for foolishly impeding the Colombia goalkeeper. Because it was his second yellow of the tournament, he must sit out the match against Germany.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Without Neymar, Brazil plays on against Germany", "title": "Without Neymar, Brazil plays on against Germany", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Without Neymar, Brazil plays on against Germany", "title": "Without Neymar, Brazil plays on against Germany", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/without_neymar_brazil_plays_on_against_germany/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/brazil-soccer-wcup-brazil-colombia.jpeg27-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Without Neymar, Brazil plays on against Germany", "title": "Without Neymar, Brazil plays on against Germany", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/brazil-soccer-wcup-brazil-colombia.jpeg27-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Lehourites", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The World Cup hosts, now forced to play without their injured superstar, will face Germany on Tuesday for a spot in next weekend\u2019s final.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsBELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Even without Neymar, Brazil\u2019s show must go on.\nNeymar fractured a vertebra in his lower back in Brazil\u2019s quarterfinal win over Colombia, ruling him out for the rest of the tournament.\nThe question for Brazil now, however, is who will step up to replace Neymar as the focal point of the attack?\nBut despite having to stay off the field, the 22-year-old striker with the dyed-blonde fauxhawk is still expecting Brazil to win its sixth World Cup title."}
