Most file 1099s rather than W2s, for tax purposes.\n\nOn demand and on call -- in the \"share\" economy, the \"gig\" economy or, more prosaically, the \"irregular\" economy -- the result is the same: no predictable earnings or hours.\n\nIt's the biggest change in the American workforce in over a century, and it's happening at lightning speed. It's estimated that in five years over 40 percent of the American labor force will have uncertain work; in a decade, most of us.\n\nIncreasingly, businesses need only a relatively small pool of \"talent\" anchored in the enterprise -- innovators and strategists responsible for the firm's unique competitive strength. Everyone else is becoming fungible, sought only for their reliability and low cost.\n\nComplex algorithms can now determine who's needed to do what and when, and then measure the quality of what's produced. Reliability can be measured in experience ratings. Software can seamlessly handle all transactions -- contracts, billing, payments, taxes.\n\nAll this allows businesses to be highly nimble -- immediately responsive to changes in consumer preferences, overall demand and technologies -- while shifting all the risks of such changes to workers.\n\nWhether we're software programmers, journalists, Uber drivers, stenographers, child care workers, TaskRabbits, beauticians, plumbers, Airbnb'rs, adjunct professors or contract nurses -- increasingly, we're on our own.\n\nAnd what we're paid, here and now, depends on what we're worth here and now -- in a spot-auction market that's rapidly substituting for the old labor market, where people held jobs that paid regular salaries and wages.\n\nEven giant corporations are devolving into spot-auction networks. Amazon's algorithms evaluate and pay workers for exactly what they contribute.\n\nApple directly employs fewer than 10 percent of the 1 million workers who design, make and sell products such as iPads and iPhones.\n\nThis giant risk-shift doesn't necessarily mean lower pay. Contract workers typically make around $18 an hour, comparable to what they earned as \"employees.\"\n\nUber and other ride-share drivers earn around $25 per hour, more than double what the typical taxi driver takes home.\n\nThe problem is that workers don't know when they'll earn it. A downturn in demand, or sudden change in consumer needs, or a personal injury or sickness, can make it impossible to pay the bills.\n\nSo they have to take whatever they can get, now: ride-shares in mornings and evenings, temp jobs on weekdays, freelance projects on weekends, Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit tasks in between.\n\nWhich partly explains why Americans are putting in such long work hours -- longer than in any other advanced economy.\n\nAnd why we're so stressed. According to polls, almost a quarter of American workers worry they won't be earning enough in the future. That's up from 15 percent a decade ago.\n\nIrregular hours can also take a mental toll. A recent study concluded that people who do irregular work for a decade suffer an average cognitive decline of 6.5 years relative to people with regular hours.\n\nSuch uncertainty can be hard on families, too. Children of parents working unpredictable schedules or outside standard daytime working hours are likely to have lower cognitive skills and more behavioral problems, according to new research.\n\nFor all these reasons, the upsurge in uncertain work makes the old economic measures -- unemployment and income -- look far better than Americans actually feel.\n\nIt also renders irrelevant many labor protections such as the minimum wage, worker safety, family and medical leave, and overtime -- because there's no clear \"employer.\" And for the same reason it eliminates employer-financed insurance -- Social Security, workers compensation, unemployment benefits and employer-provided health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat to do? Courts are overflowing with lawsuits over whether companies have misclassified \"employees\" as \"independent contractors,\" resulting in a profusion of criteria and definitions.\n\nWe should aim instead for simplicity: Whatever party -- contractor, client, customer, agent or intermediary -- pays more than half of someone's income or provides more than half their working hours should be responsible for all the labor protections and insurance an employee is entitled to.\n\nPresumably that party will share those costs and risks with its own clients, customers, owners and investors. Which is the real point: to take these risks off the backs of individuals and spread them as widely as possible.\n\nIn addition, to restore some certainty to peoples' lives, we'll need to move away from unemployment insurance and toward income insurance.\n\nSay, for example, your monthly income dips more than 50 percent below the average monthly income you've received from all the jobs you've taken over the preceding five years. Under one form of income insurance, you'd automatically receive half the difference for up to a year.\n\nBut that's not all. Ultimately, we'll need a guaranteed minimum basic income. But I'll save this for another column.\n\nRobert Reich, former U.S. Secretary of Labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of \"Beyond Outrage,\" now available in paperback.
