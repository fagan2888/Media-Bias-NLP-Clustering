“ERISA expressly pre-empts ‘any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan,’” stated the opinion , authored by Chief Justice John Roberts.

In a 6-2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Vermont law that would've required health insurers to provide a variety of information about claims to the state. The majority ruled that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) prohibited the state’s action.

Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, which has a self-insured health plan that includes only 137 Vermont residents, brought the lawsuit against the state. However, it was a part of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, which included several thousand Vermont residents in its network. After the state informed Blue Cross that it had to report all claims on its Vermont members to a state agency or face a $2,000 a day penalty, Liberty Mutual sued in federal court.

The ruling, one of a series of decisions released on Tuesday, was supported by the court’s three remaining conservatives –– Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas –– as well as two of its liberals, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, and Anthony Kennedy, who is often viewed as a swing vote. Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, part of the liberal wing, were the two dissenting votes.
