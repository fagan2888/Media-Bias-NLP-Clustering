“The View” host Rosie O’Donnell grilled President Barack Obama about mental illness at an intimate fund-raiser in New York.

O’Donnell, who has previously revealed she is one of the “haunted,” referring to her lengthy battle with depression, talked to Obama about the importance of helping children with mental health issues under ObamaCare. We’re told Obama agreed with Rosie that “we need to do much more,” and gave her the contact details of one of his senior aides to discuss this further.

Obama visited the 460 W. 22nd St. mansion of Bill White and Bryan Eure on Tuesday afternoon, where he was met by guests who paid $25,000 each, including Mark Wahlberg, who came straight from the set of “Ted 2,” and Harvey Weinstein.

While Obama didn’t eat, guests dined on food prepared by Cipriani, and we’re told the president went into the kitchen and took photos with all the chefs and servers. Obama also attended another DNC fund-raiser at Tribeca restaurant White Street, hosted by prominent Democratic donors Victor and Sarah Kovner and Betsy and Ed Zimmerman.

We’re told the president talked about raising the minimum wage, and said he wants to work harder for the middle class.

He also revealed First Lady Michelle is looking forward to the day he leaves office, saying, “My wife is looking forward to a rest.”
