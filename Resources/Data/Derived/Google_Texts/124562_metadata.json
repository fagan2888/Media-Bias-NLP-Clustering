Geneva Robinson, 49, is in jail for the allegations. This all came to light when she took a severely abused child to the hospital, and what that little girl told the workers lead to the discovery.\n\nPretty flowers sway in the wind outside an Oklahoma City home, but police said inside was an ugly nightmare. According to detectives, there were four children living inside the home, ranging in age from five to eight years old. Robinson took one of the children to the hospital \"to be admitted,\" because \"she could not control her anymore.\"\n\nPolice said the child was \"malnourished and very thin,\u201d her \"armpits were bruised with small cut\u201d and \" \"her face had scratches and whelps on it.\u201d They also said \"the back of her neck had scarring\" and \"along her jaw line she had whelps and bruising.\"\n\nReports state the child's skin was coming off her infected ankles. Hospital workers called DHS, and the little girl told them Robinson \"would dress up as a witch, wearing a green mask, and would take her out to the garage, bind her up at night and make her sleep on a pair of jeans, because she was in trouble.\"\n\nThe child told them \"the witches name was Nelda,\" and that \"she got the marks under her arms because Nelda would take a pink dog leash and hang her in the middle of the garage underneath her arms.\u201d The girl also said Nelda told her \"the creatures in the attic were going to come and get her at tonight,\u201d and that she was \"hit with an orange and black whip.\u201d The girl \"talked about fire and being burned\" and said \"Nelda would use a wand knife and put it to her neck.\"\n\nPolice showed up to Robinson's house, and they said as soon as they walked into the garage, they saw \"a pink dog leash hanging with a black dog leash connected and attached to the garage door railings on the ceiling.\"\n\nThey also found a \"horse whip\" and \"dagger\" along with a witch hat, black wig and \"hooded cloak with red eyes costume.\" They said the items are evidence that backs up the child's story.\n\nAll four children were taken into protective custody.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A shocking confession from a little girl as she exposes an Oklahoma City woman's alleged child abuse scheme, which includes dressing as a witch.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26683352/child-says-okc-woman-dressed-up-as-witch-abused-her", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4955715_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A shocking confession from a little girl as she exposes an Oklahoma City woman's alleged child abuse scheme, which includes dressing as a witch.", "title": "Child Says OKC Woman Dressed Up As Witch, Abused Her"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4955715_G.jpg", "description": "A shocking confession from a little girl as she exposes an Oklahoma City woman's alleged child abuse scheme, which includes dressing as a witch.", "card": "summary", "title": "Child Says OKC Woman Dressed Up As Witch, Abused Her"}, "wnreadableurl": "child-says-okc-woman-dressed-up-as-witch-abused-her", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/10/01", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,crime, child, abuse, witch, costume,Geneva Robinson, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS30", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,crime, child, abuse, witch, costume,Geneva Robinson, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd411c\"", "article_summary": "A shocking confession from a little girl as she exposes an Oklahoma City woman's alleged child abuse scheme, which includes dressing as a witch.\nThis all came to light when she took a severely abused child to the hospital, and what that little girl told the workers lead to the discovery.\nPretty flowers sway in the wind outside an Oklahoma City home, but police said inside was an ugly nightmare.\nRobinson took one of the children to the hospital \"to be admitted,\" because \"she could not control her anymore.\"\nThey also found a \"horse whip\" and \"dagger\" along with a witch hat, black wig and \"hooded cloak with red eyes costume.\""}
