One trip to the pool turned into a scary situation Saturday when a 3-year-old boy fell into a pool's skimming system in Rancho Santa Margarita, California.

The boy got his lower torso wedged in the system, and his family used dish soap to try to help him slide out.

But that didn't work, so the family called firefighters. The rescue team ended up drilling away the concrete around the child, and after 45 minutes, he was free.

"He was absolutely elated when he finally got out," one firefighter said.

People get stuck in pool filters more often than you'd think.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says 33 people got stuck in pool filtration systems from 2009 to 2013.
