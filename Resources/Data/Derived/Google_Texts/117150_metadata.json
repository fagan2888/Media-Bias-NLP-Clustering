Twenty-four years later, as his wife prepares to begin her second run for the White House, she is preparing to announce her candidacy next month \u2013 and if you ask some people immersed in the world of politics, she should have done it much earlier.\n\nOn the Republican side there are already more than a dozen potential candidates jockeying for position. So 10 months before a single voter will cast a ballot \u2013 and 20 months before the 2016 presidential election \u2013 the race to succeed Barack Obama has begun.\n\nAt the outset of the race the position of the two parties couldn\u2019t be more divergent \u2013 Republicans have no clear frontrunner, no candidate of presidential stature and continued intra-party pressure to move even further and further to the far right. Democrats, on the other hand, are united in a way they have rarely been in the past. Clinton is the direct beneficiary of this harmony.\n\nWhile it is entirely possible that another Democratic aspirant will enter the race between now and the first presidential caucus next January, it is difficult to imagine any scenario in which he or she would supplant her as the party nominee.\n\nClinton enjoys the support of 50-60% of Democrats, 40-plus points higher than the vice-president, Joe Biden. Liberal darling Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who has said repeatedly that she will not run, is a touch lower in the polls, and the long-shot candidates, former Virginia senator Jim Webb, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley are all mired in the single digits.\n\nClinton\u2019s strong numbers are, in part, a function of her name recognition, but make no mistake it\u2019s also a product of her popularity within the Democratic party.\n\nWhile liberal activists pine for the populist Warren and Democratic elites are no doubt suffering from Clinton exhaustion, among the party\u2019s grassroots Hillary remains a rock star. She enjoys the strong support of African-American voters, who are the Democrats\u2019 most reliable constituency, and women, who may be the party\u2019s most important constituency. She even does well with the opposition \u2013 according to one recent poll, as many as one in five Republicans support her candidacy.\n\nIn head-to-head match-ups with potential GOP candidates she leads every one by double digits. Though Democrats hold an advantage in presidential campaigns, having won the popular vote in five of the last six elections, Clinton\u2019s popularity, organising ability and fundraising prowess make her, by far, the most formidable Democratic candidate.\n\nShe is also the one Democrat most likely to have strong political coat-tails that might give the party a chance of winning back the Senate and House of Representatives in 2016.\n\nThese advantages have presented Clinton with an interesting dilemma \u2013 does she run on the issues that motivate her increasingly liberal coalition of supporters, such as income inequality, social justice, immigration and a foreign policy of restraint, or does she tack to the centre, confident that her liberal backers will turn out in huge numbers no matter what she does.\n\nWhile it is far too soon to tell, Clinton seems poised to take the so-called triangulation route favoured by her husband. In a recent interview at an event in California\u2019s Silicon Valley (the perfect business locale for a Democratic centrist), she said that one of her goals, if she ran for president, would be to \u201cbring people from right, left, red, blue, [and] get them into a nice, warm, purple space where everybody is talking and where we\u2019re actually trying to solve problems\u201d.\n\nTalking about bipartisanship is as American as apple pie and love of country, but it\u2019s also a position that feels oddly out of tune with modern American politics, which has rarely, if ever, been as polarised as it is today. It\u2019s hard to imagine that many Americans \u2013 after six years of constant GOP obstructionism of Barack Obama and eight years of uncompromising conservatism from George W Bush \u2013 believe that solving problems is within Washington\u2019s current skill set. Among Clinton\u2019s liberal coalition it\u2019s even harder to imagine that they are looking for a politician who is trying to dull rather than sharpen the differences between the two parties.\n\nIndeed over the past few months, as Obama has increasingly thrown political caution to the wind and taken aggressive positions on everything from immigration and the environment to opening up relations with Cuba and net neutrality, he\u2019s rallied his supporters and seemingly paid little political price. Clinton may be constitutionally incapable of playing the role of harsh partisan \u2013 and her advisers may fear that as a female candidate, such a stance would spark a backlash \u2013 but traversing the middle of the road runs the very real risk of depressing her supporters. Still, it\u2019s unlikely to cost her the nomination. At worst, it may lead to a primary challenge, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the worst thing for a candidate who hasn\u2019t run for office in seven years and may find herself rusty in the art of politics.\n\nTo be sure, moving to the political middle is not a problem that Republicans will soon be having. In the wake of Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012, the Republican National Committee produced a frank assessment of the party\u2019s political shortcomings. They concluded that the GOP\u2019s \u201cfederal wing is increasingly marginalising itself, and unless changes are made, it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future\u201d.\n\nThe postmortem recommended that the party \u201cembrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform\u201d in order to appeal to Hispanic voters; take a softer line on gay marriage; reach out to minorities; and get out of the bubble that has made Republicans \u201cexpert\u201d in \u201cprovid[ing] ideological reinforcement\u201d to conservatives, but offering very little to non-believers.\n\nNational Republicans have taken none of this advice. Congressional Republicans are continuing to block immigration reform.\n\nA presidential wannabe, Ben Carson, a former neurosurgeon, said last week that prisons made people gay. Efforts to disfranchise African-American voters and ramp up abortion restrictions are continuing; and the party\u2019s epistemological closure seems more pronounced than ever.\n\nEyebrows were raised in London last month when Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, refused to answer a question about whether he believed in evolution. Back in the US, the only surprise would have been if Walker had said he did believe in it. Even more shocking would have been an affirmative response to whether climate change was real and caused by man \u2013 a view that is held by no Republican running for president.\n\nSince 2012, Republicans, in order to appeal to the party\u2019s increasingly extremist and radical base of supporters, have continued to stake out territory on the furthest rightward end of the American political spectrum.\n\nThe dozen potential GOP presidential candidates are practically competing among themselves to see who can move further to the right. Rather than produce an embarrassment of riches, the assemblage of GOP candidates is more of an embarrassment.\n\nThe only one among them with anything resembling presidential stature is Jeb Bush, who has perhaps the worst last name in American politics and has not run for elected office in 13 years.\n\nBeing a good politician is difficult; being a politician good enough to win the presidency is really hard; capturing the White House after spending more than a decade doing little more than getting rich and living comfortably is unheard of.\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s impossible, but the challenges facing Bush should not be underestimated. Apart from his rustiness, Bush has a bigger problem with the right. As governor of Florida he cut taxes, restricted abortion rights and most infamously intervened in preventing a feeding tube from being removed from Terri Schiavo, a woman in a vegetative state. Yet none of this has stopped conservatives from criticising Bush for his apparent apostasy on education and immigration.\n\nThat\u2019s less of a dilemma for others in the GOP field, such as Scott Walker, who took on public-sector unions in Wisconsin and boasts hardline positions on social issues. Walker\u2019s problem is that what works in the 20th biggest US state, by population, doesn\u2019t necessarily work on a national level. Walker\u2019s embarrassing non-answer on evolution was recently matched by his punt on the question of whether he agreed with the comment by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, that Obama did not love America and isn\u2019t a good Christian. In an effort to bolster his foreign policy bona fides, Walker even said that he would stand up to Islamic State the way that he had stood up to unions in Wisconsin.\n\nThe US media have begun to anoint Walker as frontrunner for the GOP nomination, but he has offered little indication that he is ready for the intense scrutiny of a presidential campaign.\n\nThe rest of the GOP field doesn\u2019t offer much hope for Republicans. The former Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee, won the Iowa caucus in 2008 and is probably the most accessible politician in the party. The problem is that beneath his \u201caw shucks\u201d demeanour lurks a far-right and occasionally mean-spirited social conservative who will hold little appeal for the majority of Americans. There\u2019s Carson, who has never run for office, and, as his recent \u201cgoing to prison makes you gay\u201d comments suggest, is not the most grounded political figure. Nevertheless, he is polling around double digits among Republican voters. This places him ahead of more accomplished politicians (ie ones who\u2019ve actually won an election) like the quickly deflating New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and the former Texas governor, Rick Perry, who is now donning spectacles in an effort to prove that he\u2019s not quite as \u201climited\u201d as he seemed during his first presidential run in 2012.\n\nThe two wild cards are Rand Paul, who is running on a strong libertarian platform that includes taking more moderate positions on crime, surveillance and, most prominently, foreign policy, and the enfant terrible of the Tea Party set, Ted Cruz. Paul has been a persistent critic of US military interventions and has called for the US to adopt a more modest approach to national security.\n\nAfter the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, one might imagine that such views would hold great appeal among Americans. Paul\u2019s problem is that Republican rank-and-file voters haven\u2019t learnt many lessons from the disastrous US war on terror \u2013 and remain as hawkish as ever. A case in point is that after Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress outlining the ideological conservatism of the mullahs in Iran, the conservative pundit Jennifer Rubin criticised him for failing to applaud the Israeli prime minister with appropriate enthusiasm.\n\nCruz is a potential dark horse, if only because he is the id of the Tea Party movement and an uncompromising political extremist in every sense. In 2013 he engineered the shutdown of the federal government by House Republicans (he\u2019s a senator by the way) in a futile effort to repeal Obamacare.\n\nAfter Netanyahu\u2019s speech, he compared, with a straight face, the current Iranian regime to Nazi Germany and Obama to Neville Chamberlain. He is the ultimate conservative bomb-thrower, which has earned him unending enmity from the Republicans establishment, but may give him the right profile to appeal to Republican extremists.\n\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to who will emerge from this field, a situation that could create serious headaches for Republicans. The longer the race goes on, the more the political incentives that have driven Republicans further right will intensify. How else can a Walker or Bush or perhaps Florida senator Marco Rubio or Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal or Ohio governor John Kasich differentiate themselves from the pack? Certainly not by moving to the middle.\n\nMoreover, with the US economy showing dramatic improvement, the longest sustained period of job growth since the 1960s and unemployment down to 5.5%, Republicans will have an even harder time coming up with a rationale for voters to change course.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s never easy for one party in America to win three straight presidential elections \u2013 and this will be a challenge for Clinton. But there\u2019s little question that it\u2019s her race to lose.\n\nFor the rest of us, the challenge will be having to put up with 20 more months of this.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Clinton is poised to declare her candidacy and the Republicans are failing to appeal to the political centre", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Michael Cohen", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Clinton is poised to declare her candidacy and the Republicans are failing to appeal to the political centre", "title": "Hillary Clinton in pole position for US presidency as Republicans veer off course", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/08/republicans-veer-off-course-hillary-clinton-in-pole-position-obama-us-presidential-elections", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/7/1425741788206/Hillary-Clinton-election--009.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=8d93a2ddf6805e02249cf6d38908759b", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/mar/08/republicans-veer-off-course-hillary-clinton-in-pole-position-obama-us-presidential-elections?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/08/republicans-veer-off-course-hillary-clinton-in-pole-position-obama-us-presidential-elections", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/mar/08/republicans-veer-off-course-hillary-clinton-in-pole-position-obama-us-presidential-elections?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/7/1425741788206/Hillary-Clinton-election--009.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/mar/08/republicans-veer-off-course-hillary-clinton-in-pole-position-obama-us-presidential-elections?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US elections 2016,Democrats,Republicans,Hillary Clinton,Jeb Bush,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-03-08T00:05:04.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-cohen", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T14:22:36.000Z", "tag": "US elections 2016,Democrats,Republicans,Hillary Clinton,Jeb Bush,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/7/1425741788206/Hillary-Clinton-election--009.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=57163b8b596b7e87c81ee37a7e292d6a", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US elections 2016,Democrats,Republicans,Hillary Clinton,Jeb Bush,World news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34a1\"", "article_summary": "The dozen potential GOP presidential candidates are practically competing among themselves to see who can move further to the right.\nThe longer the race goes on, the more the political incentives that have driven Republicans further right will intensify.\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to who will emerge from this field, a situation that could create serious headaches for Republicans.\nShe even does well with the opposition \u2013 according to one recent poll, as many as one in five Republicans support her candidacy.\nGranted, it\u2019s never easy for one party in America to win three straight presidential elections \u2013 and this will be a challenge for Clinton."}
