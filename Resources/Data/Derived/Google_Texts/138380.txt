A southeast Kansas man has been sentenced to almost 10 years in prison in the shooting death of a 20-year-old man.

The Joplin Globe reports that 20-year-old Skyler Gurnee, of Columbus, heard from the family of William "Joey" Stephens before he was sentenced Friday for second-degree murder.

Stephens' mother, Johna Pillars, said her son had "so much to live for" and asked Gurnee why he was killed.

When Gurnee had a chance to speak, he said he realized there was nothing he could tell Stephens' family that would ever be adequate as an explanation or apology. But he tried anyway, saying, "I'm sorry." Authorities have said the men had a dispute before the shooting.

Gurnee was suffering from serious injuries when he was found several blocks away.
