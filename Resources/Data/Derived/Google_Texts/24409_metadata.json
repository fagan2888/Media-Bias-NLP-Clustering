Everything has been changing continuously, profoundly \u2014 from the role of women to the nature of agriculture. For the past couple of hundred years, change has been accelerating in both magnificent and nightmarish ways.\n\nYet when we argue for change, notably changing our ways in response to climate change, we\u2019re arguing against people who claim we\u2019re disrupting a stable system. They insist that we\u2019re rocking the boat unnecessarily.\n\nI say: rock that boat. It\u2019s a lifeboat; maybe the people in it will wake up and start rowing. Those who think they\u2019re hanging onto a stable order are actually clinging to the wreckage of the old order, a ship already sinking, that we need to leave behind.\n\nAs you probably know, the actual oceans are rising \u2014 almost eight inches since 1880, and that\u2019s only going to accelerate. They\u2019re also acidifying, because they\u2019re absorbing significant amounts of the carbon we continue to pump into the atmosphere at record levels. The ice that covers the polar seas is shrinking, while the ice shields that cover Antarctica and Greenland are melting. The water locked up in all the polar ice, as it\u2019s unlocked by heat, is going to raise sea levels staggeringly, possibly by as much as 200 feet at some point in the future, how distant we do not know. In the temperate latitudes, warming seas breed fiercer hurricanes.\n\nThe oceans are changing fast, and for the worse. Fish stocks are dying off, as are shellfish. In many acidified oceanic regions, their shells are actually dissolving or failing to form, which is one of the scariest, most nightmarish things I\u2019ve ever heard. So don\u2019t tell me that we\u2019re rocking a stable boat on calm seas. The glorious 10,000-year period of stable climate in which humanity flourished and then exploded to overrun the Earth and all its ecosystems is over.\n\nBut responding to these current cataclysmic changes means taking on people who believe, or at least assert, that those of us who want to react and act are gratuitously disrupting a stable system that\u2019s working fine. It isn\u2019t stable. It isworking fine \u2014 in the short term and the most limited sense \u2014 for oil companies and the people who profit from them and for some of us in the particularly cushy parts of the world who haven\u2019t been impacted yet by weather events like, say, the recent torrential floods in Japan or southern Nevada and Arizona, or the monsoon versions of the same that have devastated parts of India and Pakistan, or the drought that has mummified my beloved California, or the wildfires of Australia.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that the people who most benefit from the current arrangements have effectively purchased a lot of politicians, and that a great many of the rest of them are either hopelessly dim or amazingly timid. Most of the Democrats recognize the reality of climate change but not the urgency of doing something about it. Many of the Republicans used to \u2014 John McCain has done an amazing about-face from being a sane voice on climate to a shrill denier \u2014 and they present a horrific obstacle to any international treaties.\n\nPut it this way: in one country, one party holding 45 out of 100 seats in one legislative house, while serving a minority of the very rich, can basically block what quite a lot of the other seven billion people on Earth want and need, because a two-thirds majority in the Senate must consent to any international treaty the U.S. signs. Which is not to say much for the president, whose drill-baby-drill administration only looks good compared to the petroleum servants he faces, when he bothers to face them and isn\u2019t just one of them. History will despise them all and much of the world does now, but as my mother would have said, they know which side their bread is buttered on.\n\nAs it happens, the butter is melting and the bread is getting more expensive. Global grain production is already down several percent thanks to climate change, says a terrifying new United Nations report. Declining crops cause food shortages and rising food prices, creating hunger and even famine for the poorest on Earth, and also sometimes cause massive unrest. Rising bread prices were one factor that helped spark the Arab Spring in 2011. Anyone who argues that doing something about global warming will be too expensive is dodging just how expensive unmitigated climate change is already proving to be.\n\nIt\u2019s only a question of whether the very wealthy or the very poor will pay. Putting it that way, however, devalues all the nonmonetary things at stake, from the survival of myriad species to our confidence in the future. And yeah, climate change is here, now. We\u2019ve already lost a lot and we\u2019re going to lose more, but there\u2019s a difference between terrible and apocalyptic. We still have some control over how extreme it gets. That\u2019s not a great choice, but it\u2019s the choice we have. There\u2019s still a window open for action, but it\u2019s closing. As the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Society, Michel Jarraud, bluntly put it recently, \u201cWe are running out of time.\u201d\n\nNew and Renewable Energies\n\nThe future is not yet written. Look at the world we\u2019re in at this very moment. The Keystone XL tar sands pipeline was supposed to be built years ago, butactivists catalyzed by the rural and indigenous communities across whose land it would go have stopped it so far, and made what was supposed to be a done deal a contentious issue. Activists changed the outcome.\n\nFracking has been challenged on the state level, and banned in townships and counties from upstate New York to central California. (It has also been banned in two Canadian provinces, France, and Bulgaria.) The fossil-fuel divestment movement has achieved a number of remarkable victories in its few bare years of existence and more are on the way. The actual divestments and commitments to divest fossil fuel stocks by various institutions ranging from the city of Seattle to the British Medical Association are striking. But the real power of the movement lies in the way it has called into question the wisdom of investing in fossil fuel corporations. Even mainstream voices like the British Parliament\u2019s Environmental Audit Committee and publications like Forbes are now beginning to question whether they are safe places to put money. That\u2019s a sea change.\n\nRenewable energy has become more efficient, technologically sophisticated, and cheaper \u2014 the price of solar power in relation to the energy it generates has plummeted astonishingly over the past three decades and wind technology keeps getting better. While Americans overall are not yet curtailing their fossil-fuel habits, many individuals and communities are choosing other options, and those options are becoming increasingly viable. A Stanford University scientist has proposed a plan to allow each of the 50 states to run on 100% renewable energy by 2050.\n\nSince, according to the latest report of the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, fossil fuel reserves still in the ground are \u201cat least four times larger than could safely be burned if global warming is to be kept to a tolerable level,\u201d it couldn\u2019t be more important to reach global agreements to do things differently on a planetary scale. Notably, most of those carbon reserves must be left untapped and the modest steps already taken locally andad hoc show that such changes are indeed possible and that an encouraging number of us want to pursue them.\n\nWe can do it. And we is the key word here. The world is not going to be saved by individual acts of virtue; it\u2019s going to be saved, if it is to be saved, by collective acts of social and political change. That\u2019s why I\u2019m marching this Sunday with tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of others in New York City \u2014 to pressure the United Nations as it meets to address climate change. That\u2019s why people who care about the future state of our planet will also be marching and demonstrating in New Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Paris, Berlin, Melbourne, Kathmandu, Dublin, Manila, Seoul, Mumbai, Istanbul, and so many smaller places.\n\nMass movements work. Unarmed citizens have changed the course of history countless times in the modern era. When we come together as civil society, we have the capacity to transform policies, change old ways of doing things, and sometimes even topple regimes. And it is about governments. Like it or not, the global treaties, compacts, and agreements we need can only be made by governments, and governments will make those agreements when the pressure to do so is greater than the pressure not to. We can and must be that pressure.\n\nThe Long View from One Window\n\nI lived in the same apartment for 25 years, moving into a poor but thriving black community in 1981 and out of the far more affluent, paler, and less neighborly place it had become in 2006. A lot of people moved in and out in that period, many of them staying only a year or two. Those transients always seemed to believe that the neighborhood they were passing through was a stable one. You had to be slower than change and stick around to see it. I saw it and it helped me learn how to take a historical view of things.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy that anyone speaks as if our world is not undergoing rapid change, when the view from the window called history shows nothing but transformation, both incremental and dramatic. Exactly 25 years ago this month, Eastern Europe was astir. Remember that back then there was still a Soviet bloc, and a Soviet Union, and an Iron Curtain, and a Berlin Wall, and a Cold War. Most people thought those were permanent fixtures, but in the summer of 1989, Hungary decided to let East Germans (who were permitted to travel freely to that communist country) stream over to the West.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Men Explain Things to Me\" author explains why we can't afford to indulge climate change denialism any longer", "title": "Rebecca Solnit: The politics of pretending are killing us", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Men Explain Things to Me\" author explains why we can't afford to indulge climate change denialism any longer", "title": "Rebecca Solnit: The politics of pretending are killing us", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/21/the_politics_of_pretending_are_killing_us_why_we_cant_ignore_the_truth_any_longer_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/palin_limbaugh.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Men Explain Things to Me\" author explains why we can't afford to indulge climate change denialism any longer", "title": "Rebecca Solnit: The politics of pretending are killing us", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/palin_limbaugh.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rebecca Solnit", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, Global Warming, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf87\"", "article_summary": "Most of the Democrats recognize the reality of climate change but not the urgency of doing something about it.\nTopics: Climate Change, Global Warming, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, TomDispatch.comTD usually runs Sunday evenings, Tuesday mornings and Thursday mornings; Tom will email you when a piece goes up.\nThe glorious 10,000-year period of stable climate in which humanity flourished and then exploded to overrun the Earth and all its ecosystems is over.\nGlobal grain production is already down several percent thanks to climate change, says a terrifying new United Nations report.\nAnyone who argues that doing something about global warming will be too expensive is dodging just how expensive unmitigated climate change is already proving to be."}
