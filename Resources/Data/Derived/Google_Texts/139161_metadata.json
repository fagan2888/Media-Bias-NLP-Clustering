When the MRAP became available through the Pentagon\u2019s 1033 program, the school district snatched it up.\n\n\u201cWhen we have an emergency at a school, we\u2019ve got to get in and save kids,\u201d Local police captain, Joe Florentino told San Diego\u2019s KPBS. \u201cOur idea is: How can we get in and pull out a classroom at a time of kids if there\u2019s an active shooter? If there\u2019s a fire [or] if there\u2019s an earthquake, can we rip down a wall? Stuff like that,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, KHOU\u2014a local station in Houston, Texas, reported that 10 different school districts in the area had received military equipment through the program\u2014including guns and armor in order for the schools\u2019 police officers to respond to emergencies in the wake of school shootings like Sandy Hook.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Equipped Ferguson\u2019s Police Department\n\nThese revelations have sparked concern from civil rights groups. According to Talking Points Memo, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Texas Appleseed, a legal advocacy group, sent a letter this week to the Defense Department questioning the program, which has transferred military equipment to school districts in at least eight states including Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada and Utah\u2014all at taxpayer expense.\n\n\u201cTaxpayer dollars should be steered away from investments in increased law enforcement and militarization of schools and towards supporting solutions that address the root causes of school safety concerns and provide students with the services and supports they need to succeed,\" TPM reported the letter said.\n\nA Defense Logistics Agency official would not comment on which school districts have received equipment, but did not deny that school districts are recipients of the Pentagon\u2019s program.\n\nThe now-controversial 1033 program was highlighted after the militarized response of police in Ferguson, Missouri, to protests about the killing of Michael Brown, a black teenager shot by a white police officer. Images of armored vehicles in the St. Louis suburb prompted questions about police departments having access to battlefield equipment.\n\nRelated: 10 Weapons You Won\u2019t Believe the Police Have Access to\n\nNow lawmakers and policy experts are taking a closer look. Last week, a Senate committee grilled DOD officials about 1033 and the accountability over the military\u2019s surplus equipment. Lawmakers are also concerned about whether local law enforcement are properly trained to use this equipment.\n\nA spokesperson for the San Diego school district could not be reached for comment regarding the school officers\u2019 training and experience with MRAPS, but Florentino, the police captain, told KPBS he understands people are concerned about police militarization.\n\n\u201cI can totally see people thinking, \u2018Oh, my God. Are they going to be rolling armored vehicles into our schools, and what the hell\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Florentino said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll never have to use it for the real deal.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last week, Congress was up in arms over a Pentagon program that distributes surplus mi", "title": "The Pentagon Is Also Arming School Districts", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/16/Pentagon-Also-Arming-School-Districts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Police-Weapons-MRAP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/16/Pentagon-Also-Arming-School-Districts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Police-Weapons-MRAP.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Last week, Congress was up in arms over a Pentagon program that distributes surplus mi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd278a\"", "article_summary": "Now reports are surfacing that there is an even more surprising recipient of the Pentagon\u2019s leftovers--- local school districts.\nA Defense Logistics Agency official would not comment on which school districts have received equipment, but did not deny that school districts are recipients of the Pentagon\u2019s program.\nWhen the MRAP became available through the Pentagon\u2019s 1033 program, the school district snatched it up.\nA spokesperson for the San Diego school district could not be reached for comment regarding the school officers\u2019 training and experience with MRAPS, but Florentino, the police captain, told KPBS he understands people are concerned about police militarization.\nMeanwhile, KHOU\u2014a local station in Houston, Texas, reported that 10 different school districts in the area had received military equipment through the program\u2014including guns and armor in order for the schools\u2019 police officers to respond to emergencies in the wake of school shootings like Sandy Hook."}
