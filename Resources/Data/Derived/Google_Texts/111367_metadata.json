Would you consider taking it? A few men said they had never heard of it. Others simply said it wasn\u2019t for them.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t really hit the Latino community yet,\u201d Jesse Hinostroza, an HIV prevention specialist with AltaMed health clinics, said while sitting at a table with a bowl of condoms and a stack of bilingual pamphlets about the pill. \u201cThey aren\u2019t educated about it.\u201d\n\nHeidi de Marco/Kaiser Health News\n\nIn California, New York, Texas, and elsewhere, health workers are trying to get more high-risk Latino men to use the drug, Truvada. The medication, which is used for \u201cPre-Exposure Prophylaxis\u201d or PrEP, was approved by the FDA in 2012 for HIV prevention and has been shown to be more than 90 percent effective when used correctly. But health workers are encountering barriers among many Latinos.\n\nAmong them is a lack of knowledge about the drug and the stigma attached to sleeping with men or perceived promiscuity. Many Latinos also have concerns about costs and side effects.\n\n\u201cEven for people who have heard about it, that makes them reluctant to use or hesitant to even inquire about it,\u201d said Phillip Schnarrs, assistant professor of health promotion at the University of Texas at San Antonio and research director for the Austin PrEP Access Project.\n\nSchnarrs, who is conducting a study with gay and bisexual Latino men in Texas, said 58 percent of those surveyed see themselves as good candidates for PrEP, compared to 82 percent of non-Hispanic whites, according to preliminary data.\n\nIn an ongoing study of 20 Latino gay couples in New York City, 37 of the 40 people had never heard about PrEP when interviewed last year, said Omar Martinez, assistant professor of social work at the Temple University College of Public Health.\n\nMartinez said doctors and health workers need to focus on reaching young minority men at highest risk of getting HIV and transmitting it to others, including those who don\u2019t regularly use condoms. \u201cWe need to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd PrEP may be the solution.\u201d\n\nLatinos are disproportionately affected by HIV. They make up about 21 percent of new infections nationally, although they represented about 17 percent of the population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Latinos are also more likely than non-Hispanic whites and blacks to get diagnosed later in the course of their illness, raising the risks to their health and the likelihood of transmission to others.\n\nAt the same time, Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to be insured or have a regular doctor, although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has helped reduce that gap.\n\nTruvada can cost up to $1,300 a month. Most insurance companies and Medicaid programs are covering at least part of that, and many local governments are also covering the pill for uninsured residents. But the high sticker price can dampen interest among patients.\n\nTruvada, which blocks the virus from spreading in the body, is helping to significantly reduce new infections, said Robert Grant, a professor at UC San Francisco School of Medicine who leads research on PrEP\u2019s effectiveness. But the pill does not protect against other sexually transmitted diseases, requires daily use and can cause side effects in some patients, including kidney problems.\n\n\u201cIt is a very valuable option, but it is only one option,\u201d Grant said. \u201cCondoms are still a very important part of a sexual health strategy.\u201d\n\nAs customers at the New Jalisco Bar danced to traditional Mexican music beneath a disco ball and rainbow lights, Jaime Cardenas conducted HIV tests in a mobile unit parked in front. Anyone who tested on the spot received a free drink coupon, courtesy of AltaMed and the bar.\n\nOne of the first to agree was Erik Quezada, a counselor at a Los Angeles high school.\n\nCardenas drew a few drops of blood from Quezada\u2019s finger for the rapid test. Within minutes, Cardenas gave him the good news: He didn\u2019t have HIV. Cardenas quickly followed up with information about the HIV prevention pill.\n\nHeidi de Marco/Kaiser Health News\n\n\u201cOne way you can prevent yourself from acquiring HIV is by taking PrEP,\u201d Cardenas said, offering to take down Quezada\u2019s number so the clinic could call him later.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

He agreed to be contacted but quickly added, \u201cI don\u2019t know I would ever sign up for it.\u201d\n\nOthers were even less interested. Jose Arriola, 25, a self-described \u201cdiva,\u201d said he didn\u2019t want to take any medication. \u201cIt\u2019s better to use condoms,\u201d he said, sitting by his boyfriend at the bar.\n\nA short video produced by AltaMed played between acts. The video featured different Latino men getting dressed: a cowboy for a night out, a day laborer for work, a buff young man for the gym. Each took the HIV-prevention pill as part of their routine. At the end of each segment, one word popped up on the screen: listo, or ready.\n\n\u201cWe are really trying to project the message that taking PrEP can be a normal part of your everyday life,\u201d said Dr. Scott Kim, medical director of HIV Services for AltaMed, which runs more than 40 health clinics in Southern California.\n\nThat, he hopes, will reduce stigma. Kim said health workers need to be more creative in places like East Los Angeles, where many gay and bisexual Latinos are still in the closet and aren\u2019t getting information through traditional health care sources. Talking about PrEP at a doctor\u2019s office may not be as effective as doing so on social media, by text message, or in a bar, he said. \u201cThere are a lot of social obstacles and challenges we have to negotiate here because it\u2019s harder to be out,\u201d Kim said.\n\nAltaMed\u2019s efforts are being paid for by Gilead, the pharmaceutical company that makes Truvada. The goal of its $80,000 grant is to help 100 high-risk gay Latino men throughout Los Angeles County get prescriptions for PrEP. The grant pays for the outreach but does not cover the cost of the medication.\n\nSince the project began late last month, about half a dozen patients have received prescriptions. Hinostroza of AltaMed said there is more interest and more knowledge in gay-friendly Hollywood and West Hollywood. \u201cBut for East Los Angeles, where we are, it\u2019s a struggle,\u201d she said.\n\nHeidi de Marco/Kaiser Health News\n\nLouis Arevalo, 27, is a college student and an AltaMed patient who lives in Los Angeles. He said he decided to go on the medication last month after getting scared when a condom broke. He said he uses condoms regularly and gets HIV-tested every three months, but the medication is \u201can extra layer of protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as anxious anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Arevalo said he understands the stigma that might prevent others from taking the drug. For years, he said, he has hidden his boyfriends from his mother, an immigrant from El Salvador. Arevalo said her church pastor repeatedly has said that homosexuality is a sin. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the culture, and it\u2019s the religion,\u201d he said.\n\nAltaMed\u2019s efforts are just one part of a larger effort to get the word out about Truvada. The nonprofit Latino Commission on AIDS, based in New York, also recently started a campaign in five cities: Long Beach, New York City, Chicago, Miami, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nGustavo Morales, the commission\u2019s director of access to care services, said now is the time to educate people about PrEP\u2014lest too many people form negative opinions about it and health workers become \u201clike salmon swimming against the current.\u201d\n\nMorales said patients aren\u2019t the only ones who need more information. When he decided to go on PrEP late last year, he went to two different doctors who didn\u2019t know about Truvada. A third asked him why he wanted to poison himself. Finally, he got a prescription from an HIV specialist.\n\n\u201cI was definitely disappointed,\u201d said Morales. \u201cThere is a lot of work that still has to be done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "LGBT Issues, Tech &amp; Health, HIV, LGBT", "publicationDate": 201507280500, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "Health workers are running into challenges educating the Latino gay community about Truvada, a pill that prevents HIV.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Why Arent Latinos Taking This Anti-HIV Pill?", "tags": "obsessional:lgbt-issues,topic:sci-tech/science,entity:medicalcondition/hiv,education:LGBT", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why Aren\u2019t Latinos Taking This Anti-HIV Pill?\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/28/why-aren-t-latinos-taking-this-anti-hiv-pill.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/28/why-aren-t-latinos-taking-this-anti-hiv-pill/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47935332.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/28/why-aren-t-latinos-taking-this-anti-hiv-pill\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-28T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Tech + Health\",\"author\":\"Anna Gorman|Kaiser Health News\",\"tags\":[\"lgbt-issues\",\"science\",\"hiv\",\"LGBT\"]}", "news_keywords": "LGBT Issues, Tech Health, HIV, LGBT", "sectionTaxanomies": "tech-and-health", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Anna Gorman,Kaiser Health News", "article": {"section": "science", "published_time": "2015-07-28T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/kaiser-health-newshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/28/why-aren-t-latinos-taking-this-anti-hiv-pill", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Health workers are running into challenges educating the Latino gay community about Truvada, a pill that prevents HIV.", "title": "Why Aren\u2019t Latinos Taking This Anti-HIV Pill?", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/28/why-aren-t-latinos-taking-this-anti-hiv-pill.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/28/why-aren-t-latinos-taking-this-anti-hiv-pill/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1438059975459.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/a/anna-gorman|/etc/authors/k/kaiser-health-news", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1457\"", "article_summary": "But health workers are encountering barriers among many Latinos.\nEDUCATION IS POWERHealth workers are running into challenges educating the Latino gay community about Truvada, a pill that prevents HIV.\nInside the bar and out, three health workers chatted with customers, casually asking questions: Do you know about the HIV prevention pill?\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t educated about it.\u201dHeidi de Marco/Kaiser Health NewsIn California, New York, Texas, and elsewhere, health workers are trying to get more high-risk Latino men to use the drug, Truvada.\nThe goal of its $80,000 grant is to help 100 high-risk gay Latino men throughout Los Angeles County get prescriptions for PrEP."}
