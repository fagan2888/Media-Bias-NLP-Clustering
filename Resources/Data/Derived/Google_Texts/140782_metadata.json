She currently finds herself separated from her younger brother due to a custody dispute as a result of the abuse.\n\nShe may not be close to getting her brother back in her life, but as any expert will say, even the smallest effort to reach out and be a part of the world again may make a world of difference to a child who was abused or neglected.\n\nPsychology of abuse\n\nDr. Guy W. Jordan is a psychologist based in Gainesville who has worked with abused or neglected children on and off throughout his decades-long career. In 2013, he published a book called \u201cSimplify Your Emotions: Steps to Happiness\u201d to help kids and adults simplify and manage their emotions in the wake of traumas such as loss or abuse.\n\nThe biggest problem with helping children who have been victims of abuse, according to Jordan, is that they have been conditioned not to address the real problem.\n\n\u201cThe big problem with abuse is people tell kids \u2018don\u2019t tell or I\u2019ll be in trouble; I\u2019ll have to go to jail,\u2019 so kids are coached to not talk about the abuse,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with abused children for over 30 years, and the thing that I\u2019ve learned with them is if I can tell them \u2018Let\u2019s talk about the abuse to understand what it was so you understand it wasn\u2019t your fault,\u2019 and \u2018Let\u2019s talk about ways it should\u2019ve been different and how you\u2019re going to be, act different from it.\u2019 You can use it as a steppingstone to learn from, not as a damaged goods image for your life.\u201d\n\nJordan recommends parents or guardians not keep bringing up the abuse, and especially not to talk about it in emotional tones.\n\n\u201cIf the child brings it up, they need to deal with it in a neutral tone of voice rather than an emotionally intense voice,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nJordan also recommends highly encouraging any attempts the child makes to have normal hobbies or social connections.\n\n\u201cAny positive activity or involvement the child can have with other kids or with an adult \u2014 that\u2019s why mentors in school are great,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why sometimes having a relative do things with a child, have the child spend time with another child who has a healthy environment for them to interact and be part of is great.\u201d\n\nAdults should be careful not to overindulge children who have been abused, because it was a lack of boundaries that led to their abuse in the first place. But positive steps should be encouraged at all times.\n\n\u201cYou have to be firm with your limits and set boundaries that are reasonable, but involve them in activities that are healthy, that make them feel good about themselves,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nIn 2014, the Hall-Dawson Court Appointed Special Advocates program advocated for the welfare of 511 abused or neglected children in court.\n\nOf those children, 240, almost half, were younger than 5.\n\nSome 95 percent of the children were victims of neglect, whether it be educational, medical or the lack of basic needs and supervision.\n\nOf the 511 children that received help from a CASA advocate in 2014, only 168 found a stable home through reunion with relatives or adoption that year.\n\nEven if someone isn\u2019t a social worker or therapist, there are still a variety of steps anyone can take to help combat child abuse in their area.\n\n\u201cThere are children in Northeast Georgia that are being neglected and abused, and they need someone to speak up for them because they need a safe, loving home,\u201d said Connie Stephens, executive director of Hall-Dawson CASA. \u201cWe have a serious need for volunteers and foster homes for these children.\u201d\n\nPotential CASA volunteers must be 21 years of age and consent to a criminal background check, as well as attend 40 hours of courtroom procedures and policies.\n\nThere is also a pressing need for more foster homes in Hall and Dawson counties.\n\nGiven the rate of re-victimization, children who suffer from abuse or neglect need as much help as they can get.\n\n\u201cWhen a child has been previously victimized, that child is three times more likely to be mistreated than other children,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cShockingly, the group with the highest victimization rate \u2014 16 victims per 1,000 children \u2014 is among children from birth to age 3.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/108300/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When an 8-year-old girl blew out the candles on her birthday cake in January, she made three wishes instead of one.", "title": "Experts address learning to live after child abuse"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Experts address learning to live after child abuse"}, "article_summary": "Even if someone isn\u2019t a social worker or therapist, there are still a variety of steps anyone can take to help combat child abuse in their area.\n\u201cWhen a child has been previously victimized, that child is three times more likely to be mistreated than other children,\u201d Stephens said.\nGiven the rate of re-victimization, children who suffer from abuse or neglect need as much help as they can get.\nBy the numbersIn 2014, the Hall-Dawson Court Appointed Special Advocates program advocated for the welfare of 511 abused or neglected children in court.\nGuy W.
