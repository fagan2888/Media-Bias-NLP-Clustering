A 46-year-old man is in jail on kidnapping and battery charges after police say he held his girlfriend in their west Wichita home for several hours and beat her.

It happened late Saturday night in the 500 block of North Florence Street, near Central and West Street. Sgt. Bart Brunscheen said the 38-year-old victim flagged down officers shortly after 2 a.m., saying her live-in boyfriend had become upset with her and held her for three hours in the home.

The victim also told officers her boyfriend had put a knife to her throat, punched her repeatedly and choked her to the point of unconsciousness. She was able to get out of the home and ran two blocks north to Central, where she flagged down police, Brunscheen said. Officers said she had a cut above her left eye and bruising on her face.

Police later located the suspect near the home. He was taken into custody and transported to Via Christi St. Joseph Hospital for treatment of self-inflicted cuts on his wrists. He faces charges of aggravated battery, domestic violence and aggravated kidnapping.
