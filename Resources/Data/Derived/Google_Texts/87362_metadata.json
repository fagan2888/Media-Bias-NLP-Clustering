That\u2019s been the one constant for the Awajah family for as long as I\u2019ve known them.\n\nFour months ago, their home was demolished by the Israeli military \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t the first time that Kamal, Wafaa, and their children had been through this. For the last six years, the family has found itself trapped in a cycle of destruction and reconstruction; their home either a tangle of shattered concrete and twisted rebar or about to become one.\n\nI first met the Awajah family in August 2009, in the tent where they were living. I filmed them as they told me what had happened to them eight months earlier during the military invasion that Israel called Operation Cast Lead and said was a response to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.\n\nI had no intention of making a film when I went to Gaza, but after hearing the family\u2019s story, I knew I had to. I returned again in 2012 and have continued to stay in touch in the years since, realizing that the plight of the Awajahs opened a window onto what an entire society was facing, onto what it\u2019s like to live with an interminable war and constant fear. The Awajahs\u2019 story shines a spotlight on what Palestinians in Gaza have endured for years on end.\n\nWhat stuck with me most, however, was the demand of the Awajah children regarding the reconstruction of their new home in 2012: they insisted that the house have two doors.\n\nWhat The Awajahs Saw\n\nIn separate interviews in 2009, Wafaa and Kamal Awajah told me the same story, each breaking down in tears as they offered me their memories of the traumatic events that had taken place eight months earlier \u2014 a night when they lost far more than a home. The next day, a still grief-stricken Wafaa walked me through her recollections of that night, pointing out the spot where each incident had taken place.\n\nOn January 4th, as Operation Cast Lead\u2019s ground campaign began, the Awajah family was at home. Wafaa\u2019s eldest daughter, 12-year-old Omsiyat, woke her up at around 2 am. \u201cMom,\u201d said Omsiyat, \u201csoldiers are at the door.\u201d Wafaa jumped out of bed to look. \u201cThere are no soldiers at the door, honey,\u201d she reassured her daughter. When Omsiyat insisted, Wafaa looked again, and this time she spotted the soldiers and tanks. She lit candles in the window so that the Israeli troops would know that a family was inside.\n\nSuddenly, the ceiling began to crumble. Wafaa, Kamal, and their six children fled, as an Israeli military bulldozer razed their home. No sooner had they made it outside than the roof collapsed. As tank after tank rolled by, the family huddled under an olive tree next to the house. When dawn finally broke, they could examine the ruins of their house.\n\nJust as the Awajahs were trying to absorb their loss, Wafaa heard nine-year-old Ibrahim scream. He had been shot in the side. As more gunfire rang out, Kamal scooped up the injured boy and ran for cover with the rest of the family. Wafaa was hit in both hips, but she and five of the children managed to take shelter behind a mud-brick wall. From there, she saw Kamal, also wounded, lying in the middle of the road, Ibrahim still in his arms.\n\nIsraeli soldiers approached her husband and son on foot, while Wafaa watched, and \u2014 according to what she and Kamal both told me \u2014 without warning, one of them shot Ibrahim at close range, killing him. He may have assumed that Kamal was already dead. Despite Wafaa and Kamal\u2019s wounds, the family managed to get back to their wrecked home, where they hid under the collapsed roof for four days with no food or clean water, until a passing family with a donkey cart took them and Ibrahim\u2019s body to a hospital in Gaza city.\n\nAs far as I know, the Israeli military never investigated the incident. In fact, only a handful of possible war crimes during Operation Cast Lead were ever investigated by Israel. Instead of an official inquiry, the Awajahs were left with a dead son, grievous physical wounds that eventually healed, psychological ones that never will, and a home reduced to pile of rubble.\n\nOne Family in Gaza, Jen Marlowe\u2019s award-winning short documentary film featuring the Awajah family\n\n(You may also click here to view the video on Vimeo if your browser is having trouble loading the video on this page.)\n\nLife Goes On\n\nWhen I met them eight months later, the Awajahs were struggling to rebuild their lives. \u201cWhat\u2019s hardest is how to offer safety and security for my children,\u201d Kamal told me. \u201cTheir behaviors are not the same as before.\u201d\n\nWafaa pointed to three-year-old Diyaa. \u201cThis boy is traumatized since the war,\u201d she said. \u201cHe sleeps with a loaf of bread in his arms. If you try to take it from him, he wakes up, hugs it, and says, \u2018It\u2019s mine.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you can\u2019t remove or change is the fear in the children\u2019s eyes,\u201d Kamal continued. \u201cIf Diyaa sees a bulldozer, he thinks it\u2019s coming to destroy a house. If he sees a soldier, whether an Israeli or Arab soldier, he thinks the soldier wants to kill him. I try to keep them away from violence, but what he experienced forces him to release his fear with violence. When he kisses you, you can feel violence in his kiss. He kisses you and then pushes you away. He might punch or slap you. I am against violence and war in any form. I support peaceful ways. That\u2019s how I live and raise my children. Of course, I try to keep my children from violence, and help them forget what happened to them, but I can\u2019t erase it from their memory. The memories of fear are engraved in their blood.\u201d\n\nI thought about Kamal\u2019s words as I filmed Diyaa and his five-year-old sister Hala scrambling onto the rubble of their destroyed home \u2014 their only playground \u2014 squealing with glee as they rolled bullet casings and shrapnel down the collapsed roof.\n\nWhat moved me deeply was the determination of Kamal and Wafaa to create a future for their surviving children. \u201cYes, my home was destroyed, my life was destroyed, but this didn\u2019t destroy what\u2019s inside me,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t kill me as Kamal. It didn\u2019t kill us as a family. We\u2019re living. After all, we must continue living. It\u2019s not the life we wanted, or had, but I try to provide for my children what I can.\u201d\n\nThe Fragility of Hope\n\nIn 2012, I returned to Gaza and to the tent in which the Awajah family was still living. It was evident that the trauma of their experience in 2009 \u2014 along with the daily deprivation and lack of security and freedom that characterize Gaza under siege \u2014 had taken a toll. \u201cI had thought that those were the most difficult days of my life,\u201d Kamal said, \u201cbut I discovered afterwards that the days which followed were even more difficult.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Kamal told me that the war hadn\u2019t fundamentally changed him. Now, he simply said, \u201cI lost myself. The Kamal before the war does not exist today.\u201d He spoke of the screams of his children, waking regularly from nightmares. \u201cThe war is still chasing them in their dreams.\u201d\n\nMost painful for Kamal was his inability to help his children heal. His despair and feelings of helplessness had grown to the point where he had become paralyzed with severe depression. \u201cI tried and I still try to get us out of the situation we are in \u2014 the social situation, the educational situation for the children, and the mental situation for me and my family.\u201d But their situation, he added, kept getting worse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Months after Israel's latest invasion, the Awajahs are searching for a home -- and a recognition of their humanity VIDEO", "author": "Jen Marlowe", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Months after Israel's latest invasion, the Awajahs are searching for a home -- and a recognition of their humanity VIDEO", "title": "\u201cThe memories of fear are engraved in their blood\u201d: A family\u2019s life in the rubble of Gaza", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/03/the_memories_of_fear_are_engraved_in_their_blood_a_familys_life_in_the_rubble_of_gaza_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/gaza_clash.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Months after Israel's latest invasion, the Awajahs are searching for a home -- and a recognition of their humanity VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/gaza_clash.jpg", "title": "\u201cThe memories of fear are engraved in their blood\u201d: A family\u2019s life in the rubble of Gaza", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cThe memories of fear are engraved in their blood\u201d: A family\u2019s life in the rubble of Gaza", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gaza, gaza strip, Israel, Middle East, Operation Cast Lead, TomDispatch.com, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04f1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Gaza, gaza strip, Israel, Middle East, Operation Cast Lead, TomDispatch.com, Video, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on TomDispatchRubble.\nOn January 4th, as Operation Cast Lead\u2019s ground campaign began, the Awajah family was at home.\nThat\u2019s been the one constant for the Awajah family for as long as I\u2019ve known them.\nI first met the Awajah family in August 2009, in the tent where they were living.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s hardest is how to offer safety and security for my children,\u201d Kamal told me."}
