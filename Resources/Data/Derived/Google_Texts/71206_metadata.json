It\u2019s a cheer. It\u2019s an action plan.\n\nAnd starting this week, \u201cGo Knoxville\u201d will be the News Sentinel\u2019s new guide to things to do in the greater metropolitan area.\n\n\u201cGo Knoxville\u201d \u2014 or \u201cGo,\u201d for short \u2014 will appear in the paper Friday in place of the \u201cKnoxville.com\u201d section.\n\nIn addition, \u201cGo\u201d will be available for free in special racks in busy parts of the city starting on Thursday afternoons.\n\nThe new section retains our popular features: authoritative coverage of the local music scene by Wayne Bledsoe and Jer Cole; stories by Amy McRary on the arts and on family happenings; dining reviews by our mysterious Grub Scout; Kevin Saylor\u2019s wacky Notsville parody column; Matt Ward\u2019s pub crawls; Chuck Campbell\u2019s music reviews; coverage of all the new movies; and listings of everything from concerts to corn mazes.\n\n\u201cGo\u201d also will have several new features:\n\nn A calendar of outdoors activities provided by the Outdoor Knoxville initiative of the Legacy Parks Foundation.\n\nn A profile of an outdoor excursion, sometimes written by freelancer/adventurer Ben Pounds, other times by the News Sentinel\u2019s own nature expert, Morgan Simmons.\n\nn Once a month, Simmons will guide readers on a special Hike of the Month illustrated with the spectacular photography of Adam Lau.\n\nn News of the Weird, a popular feature in Metro Pulse when it was publishing. Here Chuck Shepherd gathers bizarre and absurd items from across the globe in a column that has been delighting readers for more than two decades.\n\nn Comics. Yes, a new pair of cartoon panels will add to the grins in \u201cGo.\u201d\n\nAs time goes on, we\u2019ll be looking for additional content to ensure that \u201cGo\u201d is as comprehensive and entertaining a guide to our fair burg as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, Knoxville.com will live on as a Web address, though not as a print section. Here is where all the \u201cGo Knoxville\u201d content \u2014 and much more \u2014 can be found digitally. Our team updates the site several times a day with the latest entertainment news.\n\nWith the emphasis on outdoors moving to \u201cGo,\u201d the Friday features section will adjust its theme. \u201cGet Active\u201d will become \u201cHome & Garden.\u201d We\u2019ll still offer our \u201cGreen Thumb\u201d and other gardening content, but we\u2019ll also present ideas on making the most of the great indoors.\n\nWhile I\u2019m discussing new features, I should also mention the latest upgrades to our apps, as well. The News Sentinel iPhone and iPad apps have been merged, so the app on your phone will configure beautifully on your tablet. The new apps have a slicker look and feel, with edge-to-edge images, cleaner fonts and new animation. Video plays with a single touch on an article, and alerts include links that let readers go straight to hot news stories.\n\nThe new versions are compatible with the latest Apple operating system, so they\u2019ll run great on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. To get these latest versions, just update your iPhone app or go to the App Store to load the new version onto your iPad. An Android version is coming.\n\nAs always, we welcome feedback on all of these changes.\n\nJack McElroy is editor of the News Sentinel.
