Rates for next year are expected to keep pace with past years or, in some cases, decline. Credit: Mike De Sisti\n\nBy of the\n\nDespite the dire predictions, the cost of health plans sold on the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act are increasing next year at roughly the same rate as past years in Wisconsin \u2014 and several insurers are even lowering prices.\n\nWisconsin is not among the states that have released information on what the plans will cost. That is scheduled to happen on Nov. 5, the deadline for the federal government to approve its contracts with insurers who want to sell health plans on the federal marketplaces.\n\nBut information on the average price changes for insurers was posted briefly on the state Office of the Commissioner of Insurance website recently and reported by WKOW in Madison and Wisconsin Health News, an industry newsletter.\n\nThe filings showed a wide range of price changes, from Dean Health Plan raising rates on average by 13.1% to Medica Health Plans dropping its rates on average by 17%.\n\nRates, of course, will vary by health plan and throughout the state when the plans go on sale Nov. 15. But at least for now, the marketplace may be working as hoped, with competition among health insurers helping to keep premiums in check.\n\nThat could change in future years.\n\n\"The market is going to take a number of years to settle out,\" said John Trochlell, vice president of actuarial and underwriting at WPS Health Insurance, which sells health plans on the marketplace through its Arise Health Plan subsidiary.\n\nThe changes in rates for next year also follow a year when the cost of health plans sold to individuals and families rose sharply. Those increases stemmed from the new regulations imposed by the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, particularly the requirement that barred health insurers from not covering people with health problems.\n\nThe average rate increases and decreases are only for health plans that comply with the new regulations. They don't apply to health plans bought by employers and employees. They also don't apply to plans that were renewed in 2013 and are exempt from new regulations.\n\nAs of July, 130,000 people in Wisconsin were covered by health plans sold on the marketplace, and about 90% of them received federal subsidies to help offset the cost.\n\nThat's a small fraction of the number of people who get coverage through an employer in Wisconsin. But more people are expected to buy health plans on the marketplace this year.\n\nFor one thing, the penalty for not having health insurance increases next year to whichever is greater of two measures. One is 2% of household income above the income tax filing threshold, or roughly $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a family. The other is $325 for an adult and up to $975 for a family.\n\nIn other words, someone with an income of $45,000 a year could face a penalty of $700 next year if he or she doesn't have coverage.\n\nThe potential of the marketplace is attracting new competitors.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, one of the state's largest health insurers, plans to begin selling health plans on the marketplace for 2015, after watching from the sidelines this year.\n\n\"I would expect them to be very competitive,\" said Todd Catlin, owner of Transition Health Benefits in Brookfield.\n\nMHS Health Wisconsin, formerly Managed Health Services, also is entering the market.\n\nA bumpy start\n\nHealth insurers were forced to set rates for 2014 with almost no sense of how the changes imposed by the Affordable Care Act would affect the market. No one knew what it would cost to insure people with pre-existing health problems, for instance, or how many people who were young and healthy would buy coverage.\n\nThen came the disastrous rollout of the federal marketplaces, which at first were afflicted by severe technical problems. And that was followed by the federal government's decision to allow people to keep their existing health plans, increasing the chances that the health plans sold on the federal marketplaces would draw a disproportionate number of people with health problems.\n\n\"It's been a rough ride over the last year or so,\" said Trochlell of WPS. \"We are optimistic this open-enrollment season will go better.\"\n\nYet the relatively modest increases \u2014 and, in some cases, decreases \u2014 in rates for next year suggest that most insurers, maybe to their surprise, did reasonably well in setting rates for 2014.\n\n\"We were pretty close to what you expected,\" said Rob Plesha, vice president of actuarial services for health plans sold to small employers and individuals for Unity Health Plans Insurance Corp., an affiliate of UW Health.\n\nProvisions in the law to protect health insurers from large losses in the initial years \u2014 what are known as the \"3 R's,\" for reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors \u2014 helped.\n\n\"The three R's help us sleep at night,\" Plesha said.\n\nThe companies overall also may have been cautious, with some setting their initial rates higher than turned out to be necessary.\n\nMolina Healthcare, one of the companies selling health plans on the marketplace in southeastern Wisconsin, plans to drop its rates by an average of 11.3% next year.\n\nThe company expected a disproportionate number of people with health problems to buy health plans on the marketplace in the first year, said Lisa Rubino, a senior vice president of the company. It expects more healthy people to buy plans in this enrollment period, in part because of the higher penalty for not having insurance.\n\nThe lower rates should help the company sell more health plans \u2014 Rubino said the number of plans sold in Wisconsin last year was on the low side of its projections.\n\nRushed enrollment expected\n\nHealth insurers had only limited information again when setting rates for 2015.\n\nThey had to file their rates before June, and given the lag time in processing medical claims, they had little or no information on the cost of covering people who signed up for plans near the end of the March 31 deadline.\n\nThe open-enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15, is almost certain be less chaotic than last year's rollout. But this doesn't mean there won't be glitches.\n\n\"This year is going to be a very tight time frame,\" said Marty Anderson, marketing director of Security Health Plan in Marshfield.\n\nWith the deadline for the federal government to approve rates set at Nov. 5 \u2014 one day, some have noted, after the midterm elections \u2014 insurers will have only 10 days to notify their customers of rate increases and decreases. And people with coverage must renew their existing plan or pick a new one by Dec. 15 for coverage to begin on Jan. 1.\n\n\"These timelines are crazy,\" said Fred Wilmsen III, a general partner of Atrius Partners LLC in Appleton.\n\nWilmsen, who specializes in selling health insurance to individuals and small employers, also expects more people to buy plans on the marketplace.\n\n\"This will be a far bigger year than last year,\" he said.\n\nInsurance agents and brokers will be hard-pressed to help everyone shopping for coverage that begins Jan. 1, given the one-month enrollment period.\n\n\"It really is going to cause a lot of problems,\" said Catlin of Transition Health Benefits.\n\nCatlin expects most people to renew their existing plans unless they get sharp increases.\n\nIt also is too early to declare that rates won't soar in future years.\n\n\"No one is really going to know anything until the end of next year,\" Catlin said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Obamacare plan rates in Wisconsin to keep pace or decline next year", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/obamacare-plan-rates-in-wisconsin-to-keep-pace-or-decline-next-year-b99372824z1-279740262.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99372824z.1_20141020003359_000_g3m8b6tg.1-1.jpg", "height": 1280}, "type": "article", "description": "The cost of the health plans is expected to increase next year at roughly the same rate as past years in Wisconsin \u2014 and several insurers are even lowering prices.", "title": "Obamacare plan rates in Wisconsin to keep pace or decline"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99372824z.1_20141020003359_000_g3m8b6tg.1-1.jpg", "description": "The cost of the health plans is expected to increase next year at roughly the same rate as past years in Wisconsin \u2014 and several insurers are even lowering prices.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare plan rates in Wisconsin to keep pace or decline next year"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The filings showed a wide range of price changes, from Dean Health Plan raising rates on average by 13.1% to Medica Health Plans dropping its rates on average by 17%.\nRates, of course, will vary by health plan and throughout the state when the plans go on sale Nov. 15.\n\"This year is going to be a very tight time frame,\" said Marty Anderson, marketing director of Security Health Plan in Marshfield.\nMHS Health Wisconsin, formerly Managed Health Services, also is entering the market.\nUnitedHealthcare, one of the state's largest health insurers, plans to begin selling health plans on the marketplace for 2015, after watching from the sidelines this year."}
