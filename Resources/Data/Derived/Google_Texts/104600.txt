Joni Ernst talks what comes next, negative campaign ads

Iowa's two new members of Congress will be sworn in Tuesday and Republicans will officially take control of both the House and Senate.

David Young will become Iowa's congressman in the third district.

Joni Ernst will replace Tom Harkin in the Senate.

It's possible they could tackle a controversial issue right away. The Keystone XL Pipeline bill could hit the Senate floor as early as Thursday.
