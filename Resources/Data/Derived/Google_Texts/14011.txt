West Virginia coach Bob Huggins is still trying to figure out how to prevent his team from playing such sloppy basketball.

The No. 10 Mountaineers shot poorly, were manhandled inside and committed a dozen turnovers Saturday in a 76-62 loss to No. 3 Oklahoma at WVU Coliseum in Morgantown, W.Va.

“We’ve got to stop turning the ball over, and I know that’s not going to happen,” Huggins said. “We haven’t stopped turning it over in practice, so the reality is we probably aren’t going to stop turning it over in the game. Some of them, though, we throw the ball where there’s nobody even around to throw it to.”

West Virginia (20-7, 9-5) shot 33 percent (21 of 63) from the floor, and a team that usually dominates the boards was outrebounded, 48-37.

“We generally hold our own on the glass,” Huggins said. “It’s not like we didn’t focus on it or prepare. We just didn’t do it.”

Buddy Hield scored 29 points to lead the Sooners (21-5, 9-5), who stayed close in the Big 12 Conference race, tying the Mountaineers and Baylor for second place behind Kansas. The Sooners were coming off losses to Kansas and Texas Tech, and three losses in four games after spending three weeks at No. 1.

In a second half of several scoring swings, Hield helped put Oklahoma in control. He capped a 9-0 run with a 3-pointer to put the Sooners ahead, 61-52, with 5:22 left, silencing the home crowd.

“They made more shots than we made,” Huggins said. “They’ve got Buddy Hield and we don’t.”
