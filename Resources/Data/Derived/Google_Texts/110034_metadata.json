Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have all made trips there, and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence announced this week he\u2019s heading to Israel on a nine-day trip later this month.\n\nWith former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton leading the field of potential 2016 Democratic candidates, the trips offer potential GOP candidates the chance to contrast themselves with Mrs. Clinton, said GOP strategist Keith Appell.\n\n\u201cThese trips give Republican candidates an opportunity to not only raise their stature level to be even with Hillary Clinton, but also contrast their vision with her spectacular failures on the international stage,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nSEE ALSO: The unfairness of Obamacare\n\nMr. Carson acknowledged that some would see his visit as a precursor to an official 2016 run for the White House.\n\n\u201cWell, certainly if I\u2019m considering that, Israel would be an excellent place to go to and get the kind of perspective that I was just talking about,\u201d said Mr. Carson.\n\nMr. Carson, who is planning to make a decision on whether or not to run by May, formed a federal political action committee earlier in the year called USA First PAC and supported Republican candidates in the midterms such as Sens.-elect Joni Ernst of Iowa and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.\n\nMr. Carson, who writes a column for The Washington Times, also made the move last month to officially change his party registration from independent to Republican, calling it a \u201cpragmatic move\u201d since running as an independent candidate risks splitting the electorate.\n\nHis itinerary in Israel includes meetings with local religious leaders and tours, including a visit to Hadassah Hospital Ein Kerem and a meeting with the head of neurosurgery there.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to start in North America, there\u2019s no better place to start\u201d than Israel, said Republican strategist Ford O\u2019Connell. \u201cWe need someone who can have that statesmanlike stature when pitted against Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton is well traveled owing to her position as first lady and later as State Department secretary.\n\nA poll from the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling released Wednesday showed Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Carson leading their respective parties\u2019 nominating contests in North Carolina, though Mrs. Clinton had a much more sizable advantage.\n\nMr. Carson got 19 percent of the vote, followed by 15 percent for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 14 percent apiece for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nMrs. Clinton was at 52 percent among Democrats, with Vice President Joseph R. Biden second at 18 percent and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts next at 7 percent.\n\nMrs. Clinton and Mr. Carson were tied at 44 percent apiece in a head-to-head matchup.\n\nMr. Biden, who traveled to Israel earlier this year, also has years of foreign policy experience accumulated during his time as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nAnd Ms. Warren made a trek to Israel last month but has thus far resisted pleas from liberal groups to enter the 2016 field.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who polls near the top of the potential 2016 GOP presidential field, will take a trip to Israel next week, checking off one of several must-do boxes for Republicans pondering a run at the White House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who polls near the top of the potential 2016 GOP presidential field, will take a trip to Israel next week, checking off one of several must-do boxes for Republicans pondering a run at the White House.", "title": "Ben Carson to visit Israel in possible precursor to 2016 White House bid", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/11/ben-carson-to-visit-israel-in-possible-precursor-t/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/11/carson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/11/carson.jpg", "description": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who polls near the top of the potential 2016 GOP presidential field, will take a trip to Israel next week, checking off one of several must-do boxes for Republicans po", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ben Carson to visit Israel in possible precursor to 2016 White House b"}, "Author": "David Sherfinski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Israel, Ben Carson, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2866\"", "article_summary": "Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Carson were tied at 44 percent apiece in a head-to-head matchup.\nSEE ALSO: The unfairness of ObamacareMr. Carson acknowledged that some would see his visit as a precursor to an official 2016 run for the White House.\nMr. Carson got 19 percent of the vote, followed by 15 percent for former Florida Gov.\n\u201cWell, certainly if I\u2019m considering that, Israel would be an excellent place to go to and get the kind of perspective that I was just talking about,\u201d said Mr. Carson.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to start in North America, there\u2019s no better place to start\u201d than Israel, said Republican strategist Ford O\u2019Connell."}
