FSRN\u2019s Nell Abram has more.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nA holiday party for San Bernardino County Department of Public Health staff was the scene of the most recent mass shooting in the U.S. Wednesday. The California attack came just days after a shooter killed three people and wounded 9 others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs.\n\n\u201cThese killers used military style weapons,\u201d pointed out California Senator Barbara Boxer. \u201cFourteen people died, 17 people \u2013 at least \u2013 were wounded in just a few short minutes. And yes, the scene looked like a war zone and there\u2019s a reason. The weapons were weapons of war that were used.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s shootings, many lawmakers expressed condolences on social media \u2013 including many congressional representatives who receive sizable campaign contributions from the gun lobby.\n\nJust days away from the anniversary of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School school massacre \u2013 in which 28 people died including the shooter and his mother \u2013 Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said people with the power to create gun safety laws must do more than send sympathy messages to victims of mass shootings: \u201cWhat will it take for real safety and security in America \u2013 not just for us, but for our children, for innocent people in churches and schools and clinics \u2013 around America? All I\u2019ve heard today in this building so far is pretty much business as usual, we\u2019re going to take another vote on the Affordable Care Act. Congress is complicit in these mass murders when it fails to act; inaction makes Congress complicit.\u201d\n\nTo that end, this afternoon Senate Democrats announced plans to take legislative action on the issue of gun safety, starting with the budget reconciliation bill before the Senate today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be filing several amendments to the pending reconciliation bill that would strip out this political charade of a bill and replace it with meaningful gun safety legislation that the president would actually sign,\u201d explained New York Senator Chuck Schumer explained at a mid-day press conference ahead of the vote. \u201cWe will have votes later today on these amendments and the entire country will know where every member of the Senate stands on tightening background checks, on keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists and on strengthening and improving mental health in this country.\u201d\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein proposed an amendment that would empower the U.S. Attorney General to block all gun and explosives sales to a known or suspected terrorist or if there\u2019s a reasonable belief that the buyer would use the items in a terrorist act. The motion failed.\n\nSchumer and the other Senate Democrats promised that if gun safety legislation didn\u2019t pass today, they\u2019d stay with it until meaningful and effective laws are passed to prevent mass shootings from becoming a normal aspect of life in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "*Editors Note: this story was shortened and updated in the Weekly Edition \u2013 December 4, 2015On the heels of two mass shootings which captured nationwide attention, Senate Democrats today pledged to take action on gun safety legislation.\nSchumer and the other Senate Democrats promised that if gun safety legislation didn\u2019t pass today, they\u2019d stay with it until meaningful and effective laws are passed to prevent mass shootings from becoming a normal aspect of life in the United States.\nCongress is complicit in these mass murders when it fails to act; inaction makes Congress complicit.\u201dTo that end, this afternoon Senate Democrats announced plans to take legislative action on the issue of gun safety, starting with the budget reconciliation bill before the Senate today.\nDownload AudioA holiday party for San Bernardino County Department of Public Health staff was the scene of the most recent mass shooting in the U.S. Wednesday.\nThe California attack came just days after a shooter killed three people and wounded 9 others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs."}
