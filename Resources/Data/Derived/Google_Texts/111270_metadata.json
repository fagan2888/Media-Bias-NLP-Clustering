All candidates in this race have been invited to interview. Some responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 James McClure Jr. describes himself as a Jeffersonian Anti-Federalist Democrat. McClure, who is running for the 9th Congressional District on the Democratic ticket, opposes a strong federal government and supports a strict interpretation of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nCurrent hometown: Clarksville\n\nAge: 50\n\nOccupation: IT analyst\n\nFun fact: I am a computer nerd from way back when. I attend game conventions and stuff like that. I go to big gaming conventions like Gen Con or Origins.\n\nWhat\u2019s one of your main goals if you\u2019re elected?\n\nTo restore our government to its Article I, Section 8 boundaries. The government is excessively large. It\u2019s exceeding its constitutional authority and it\u2019s borrowing and spending money and placing that debt on other people of [the younger] generation that\u2019s criminally and morally irresponsible.\n\nWhat gives you a different perspective than the other candidates?\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m the only United States military veteran for one. I have never held public office. My opponent in the race, Shelli Yoder, is a politician basically. I\u2019m just a citizen, like yourself. I\u2019m concerned about the United States and I believe, at least I was raised to believe, that it is our responsibility as citizens of the United States to leave a better country than the one we inherited. And I feel that my generation is falling down on that promise.\n\nWhere do you stand on:\n\nObamacare\n\nI am opposed to the Affordable Care Act, because it violates the federal Constitution, in that it violates Article I, Section 7. It\u2019s a revenue bill, which originated in the Senate. I believe that there is no writ in the Constitution for the federal government to be making health care policy\u2026. You have this sort of one size fits all government mandate coming out of Washington, trying to force the states to all be equal, when they are not. Indiana is a different state than Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky. Then you get these unintended consequences, where things don\u2019t work the way that the geniuses in the Capitol building think they ought to work. They should be one to trust the states and the citizens themselves to make these kinds of decisions.\n\nRaising the federal minimum wage\n\nThis is not a federal issue. There is no writ in the Constitution for the federal government to set wages. It\u2019s a state issue or local community issue. What\u2019s an appropriate minimum wage in the state of Indiana is definitely not the appropriate minimum wage for New York City or Los Angeles\u2026. Other states will wait to see what the affects will be, before they make that decision themselves.\n\nThis is part of the beauty the framers designed in the Constitution. That the individual states can make these decisions. If there are a lot of negative consequences to raising the minimum wage to $15, and I think there will be, that you are going to see a lot of entry-level jobs eliminated because small companies won\u2019t be able to afford to pay that sort of wage\u2014then there will be disincentive to do it. If it\u2019s a successful minimum wage, other states will adopt it.\n\nResettling Syrian refugees\n\nAs far as immigration is concerned in general, I have called for a 10-year moratorium on all immigration to the United States. This involves all forms of immigration, whether it be regular, legal immigration and H-1B or other types of visas. Whether it be refugees or political asylums. Nothing. We have an issue in this country as far as having people inside the country that don\u2019t belong here and people who have overstayed their visa\u2026.\n\nWe have financial issues inside this country. We have problems delivering necessary governmental services just to Indiana and United States citizens. We shouldn\u2019t be having parts of those resources drained off by people who don\u2019t belong in those countries because they have either crossed our border illegally or overstayed their visas.\n\nIf you stayed here too long here and you want to be a citizen, you can go back to your home country and start following the whole immigration process and legally immigrate when we straightened out the situation in the country. If you are not here to become an American citizen and build a better America, like we were all raised to believe in, then you should just go home. You don\u2019t belong here.\n\nRaising the retirement age for Social Security\n\nI believe that\u2019s something we need to look into. Current retirees should have their benefits protected. They have paid into the system. It is not their fault that there are people in Washington who dipped into what should have been a secured fund and spent that money on projects or programs that are already gone. That money is gone\u2026.\n\nFor future retirees like myself, we are going to start to have to look at means testing and because this is a fact\u2014that we are now living longer than when the program was first created. We have to reevaluate at what point someone is allowed to retire\u2026. It\u2019s not going to solve the entire problem with Social Security. We need to look at allowing younger people to enter into a private programs if they choose. But in those cases, if you choose a private program, you are not going to be allowed to come back.\n\nWhether the Senate votes on President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee\n\nI have talked to Republican colleagues of mine and I have told them that I believe that they should perform their advising consent requirements that are in the Constitution. If they are convinced that they have sufficient votes to defeat Judge Garland as a nominee, then they should bring his nomination to the floor and vote on it\u2026.\n\nI can understand the Republicans wanting to use this as a political football. They are trying to manage it to get more voters to come out in November, so they can say we are going to need a Republican president so that we can have a conservative nominee.\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership\n\nI am strongly opposed to TPP, TPA and other things like that for two major reasons. One TPP invests in the executive powers. It does not possess by abrogating the Senate\u2019s advising consent authority as far as treaties are concerned. They are trying to say that the president negotiates this treaty and the Senate can only vote up or down\u2014it cannot make any adjustments or modifications to the treaty. That\u2019s not the way we have been doing it for over 200 years in this country. It\u2019s not the way the framers intended it to be done.\n\nSecondly the TPP and other supposedly free trade deals like this have harmed the small businesses in Indiana. TPP specifically is basically giving advantage to Pacific businesses, Pacific border state businesses. Oregon, Washington, California. This does not help Indiana. I am strongly opposed as a Jeffersonian of the government giving advantage to one group over the other. All should be treated equally in front of the law. This includes businesses. A small business and large businesses\u2026 should be allowed to compete openly and evenly in the marketplace. When the government is picking winners and losers, which it\u2019s doing in this case by giving special advantage to certain business, then it is skewing the market and it\u2019s preventing the natural drives of capitalism from working, which inhibits competition, prevents prices from going down, prevents goods and services from being improved and generally harms the consumer.\n\nWhy should you be elected?\n\nI\u2019m just a citizen. I am not a politician. I am a statesman. I\u2019m doing this because a vocation. The country needs somebody to step forward. I ran for Congress last election cycle against Todd Young because he has not represented the 9th Congressional District. He is bought and paid for by the Republican establishment and big money and special interest in Washington. He basically sold your vote and your voice out of a seat on Ways and Means. Shelli Yoder was unsuccessful in unseating him four years ago. Two years ago, I wasn\u2019t seeing any prominently named Democrats step forward. It was one of those situations of, if not now, when? If not me, whom? There is no reason for the citizens of Indiana to lose their voice in the Congress. Someone needed to step forward and challenge Todd\u2026\n\nIt is a difficult office to be pursuing. It is a Republican majority district, but I believe that my Jeffersonian, Anti-Federalist message of limited government, state sovereignty, personal responsibility and individual liberty resonates strongly with disillusioned independents and conservative Republicans who have voted for Todd Young in the past.\n\nMax Bomber is a reporter for TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a92\"", "article_summary": "To the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m the only United States military veteran for one.\nRaising the federal minimum wageThis is not a federal issue.\nMcClure, who is running for the 9th Congressional District on the Democratic ticket, opposes a strong federal government and supports a strict interpretation of the Constitution.\nResettling Syrian refugeesAs far as immigration is concerned in general, I have called for a 10-year moratorium on all immigration to the United States.\nWe have problems delivering necessary governmental services just to Indiana and United States citizens."}
