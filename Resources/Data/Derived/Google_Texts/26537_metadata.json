His many accomplishments would exist whether I validated them or not. As he so eloquently dictated last year to Skip Bayless on Bayless\u2019 own show, ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take,\u201d he is \u201cbetter at life than you.\u201d I believe him.\n\nBy now, the infamous Erin Andrews interview has been talked about at length, much more than Sherman\u2019s dazzling game-saving defensive play against the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 Michael Crabtree to punch his team\u2019s ticket to the Super Bowl. I\u2019m not really interested in rehashing what has been said about the video other than to say the Twitter backlash \u2014 the bantering and bullying \u2014 seemed on par with just about every swell of trending Internet fodder that rises and crests on an almost daily basis. If you are looking for some good stuff that has been written already, you can check it out here, here and here. Also, if you are interested in reading Sherman\u2019s own thoughts on what transpired, go here. He also held a press conference on Wednesday that\u2019s worth watching. There is a method to his madness (though I would hardly call him \u201cmad\u201d or any derivative thereof). I can\u2019t say the same for his legion of trolls.\n\nI watched the game at a bar in New York where nearly everyone was from the Bay Area (California). It felt like home: belligerent fans belched obscenities toward the television screen, patrons flaunted their red and gold around the bar and high-fived following every 49er first down. After each 49er score the bar erupted with joy; every Seahawks conversion deflated the high in the room. I cheered only enough to remain unnoticed and blend in with the crowd. I drank my beer. Then I drank more and more, like any good American football fan. I was consumed by the game. Even more so when you consider I was watching with more than those inside the bar.\n\nSince I grew up in Northern California, in and around the Bay Area, you might guess whose side I leaned toward. You might also imagine the barrage of posts I encountered before, during and after the NFC Championship on my social feeds. Though I tend to refrain from scrolling endlessly through my timeline \u2014 and, in many instances, I go so far as to unsubscribe to posts that congest my feed \u2014 Sunday\u2019s game was impossible to escape.\n\nFollowing the epic Sherman interview, many at the bar became infuriated: I watched a fan rip the red cap from his head, walk outside, and hurl it into the intersection, only to follow up that emotional release by sparring with the side of a brick wall; his friends let it ride. The rest of the dejected and downtrodden took to social media. I simply watched the carnage, the same way I watched NaVorro Bowman\u2019s knee disassemble moments earlier (ad nauseam).\n\nAn incoming text message shed more inglorious wisdom on the night\u2019s events: \u201cCongratulations Richard Sherman, everyone in America outside of Washington wants to see you lose. Not that they care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're allowed to yell, get drunk and break furniture, but athletes can't talk about being the best", "title": "Football\u2019s glaring inequity: Feelings are for fans, not for players", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We're allowed to yell, get drunk and break furniture, but athletes can't talk about being the best", "title": "Football\u2019s glaring inequity: Feelings are for fans, not for players", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/25/footballs_glaring_inequity_feelings_are_for_fans_not_for_players/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/richard_sherman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We're allowed to yell, get drunk and break furniture, but athletes can't talk about being the best", "title": "Football\u2019s glaring inequity: Feelings are for fans, not for players", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/richard_sherman.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ian Blair", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Football, NFC championship, NFL, richard sherman, San Francisco 49erts, Seattle Seahawks, Super Bowl", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bb5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Football, NFC championship, NFL, richard sherman, San Francisco 49erts, Seattle Seahawks, Super Bowl, Life News, Entertainment NewsFor the record, Richard Sherman doesn\u2019t need my defense.\nAn incoming text message shed more inglorious wisdom on the night\u2019s events: \u201cCongratulations Richard Sherman, everyone in America outside of Washington wants to see you lose.\nI watched the game at a bar in New York where nearly everyone was from the Bay Area (California).\nI simply watched the carnage, the same way I watched NaVorro Bowman\u2019s knee disassemble moments earlier (ad nauseam).\nAfter each 49er score the bar erupted with joy; every Seahawks conversion deflated the high in the room."}
