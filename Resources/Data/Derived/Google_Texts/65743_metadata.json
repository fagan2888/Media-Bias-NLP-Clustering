For those on Medicare who were too weak to leave their homes, doctors, nurses, health aides, and therapists made house calls. Medicare paid for these in-home medical services according to certain reimbursement rates. The services provided included rehabilitation, supervision of medications, and checkups after hospital stays. Medicare paid a maximum of two months of these services per patient event, which was $2,869 in 2014.\n\nThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission notes that home health care services increased over the last fifteen years by 57%. The number of home health care agencies peaked at 12,215 in 2012 and is now declining. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission told congress that most home health care agencies are companies that make profits after paying their costs. These agencies hire nurses who make $65,000 annually on average and personal-care aides who make $20,000 annually on average.\n\nIn order to pay for the ACA, the plan was to cut home health care support from Medicare by 14% over a four-year period. This plan already began. Home health care payments by Medicare are being cut $60 million during this year of 2015. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently proposed to cut $350 million more in Medicare payments to home health care providers in 2016. This process is called \u201crebasing,\u201d and intends to recover supposed over-payments for home health care services made in past years.\n\nDo the Math\n\nAs reported in Modern Healthcare, the Visiting Nurse Associations of America project that for most home health care providers the Medicare cuts will create a loss of 9.77% to the home health care agencies for providing in-home health care services for patients covered by Medicare.\n\nThese Medicare cuts for home health care payments with force home health care agencies to reduce staff, stop serving Medicare patients, or face bankruptcy. Even the Obama administration admitted that the expectation is that 40% of home health care agencies will go out of business by 2017.\n\nPenny Wise, Pound Foolish\n\nThese cuts come at a time when there is a need for more coordination of health care especially for those older adults with chronic illnesses. Home health care improves patient care coordination and keeps patients from staying longer in more costly medical care facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nThis plan to reduce Medicare reimbursements for home health care is truly working against the long-term goal to provide \u201caffordable\u201d health care in America. Numerous studies show that health care in the home is the most cost efficient way to help those with chronic illnesses.\n\nIf close to half the home health care agencies go out of business in the next two years, patients who can no longer receive home health care services are inevitably going to end up back in the hospital.\n\nInsurance company Genworth estimates the average annual cost of home health care is $45,760. The average annual cost of nursing home care (semi-private room) is $80,300. Saving 14% on Medicare home health care may put 40% more of those patients back in nursing homes where the health care costs are 75% higher.\n\nSummary\n\nWhen the cost calculations are reviewed objectively, in total, there is no cost savings at all from this policy to reduce Medicare home health care reimbursements, only a gigantic disaster in the making, which ultimately costs more and reduces the quality of patient care.\n\nSources\n\nHome health agencies face $350 million Medicare cut\n\nhttp://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150707/NEWS/150709949\n\nMedicare and Medicaid Programs; CY 2016 Home Health Prospective Payment System\n\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-16790.pdf\n\nObamacare\u2019s Surprise Medicare Cut\n\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-03-06/obamacares-surprise-medicare-cut\n\nLet\u2019s end ObamaCare\u2019s Medicare home health cut\n\nhttp://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/226034-lets-end-obamacares-medicare-home-health-cut\n\nCMS finalizes 2015 payment cuts to home healthcare agencies\n\nhttp://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141031/NEWS/310319961\n\nCompare Long Term Care Costs Across the United State\n\nhttps://www.genworth.com/corporate/about-genworth/industry-expertise/cost-of-care.html\n\nHome Health care 75% Cheaper than Nursing Home Care\n\nhttp://seniorhousingnews.com/2011/08/21/home-health-care-75-cheaper-than-nursing-home-care/", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the cost calculations are reviewed objectively, in total, there is no cost savings at all from this policy to reduce Medicare home health care reimbursements, only a gigantic disaster in the making, which ultimately costs more and reduces the quality of patient care.", "og": {"site_name": "HomeCareDaily.com", "description": "During this historical time when more Americans are becoming seniors than ever before, as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), serious reductions in...", "title": "Home Health Care Faces Steep Medicare Cuts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.homecaredaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bigstock-Financial-Cliff-39694612.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-25T15:57:44-05:00", "url": "http://www.homecaredaily.com/2015/07/25/home-health-care-faces-steep-medicare-cuts/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When the cost calculations are reviewed objectively, in total, there is no cost savings at all from this policy to reduce Medicare home health care reimbursements, only a gigantic disaster in the making, which ultimately costs more and reduces the quality of patient care.", "creator": "@homecaredaily", "image": "http://www.homecaredaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bigstock-Financial-Cliff-39694612.jpg", "title": "Home Health Care Faces Steep Medicare Cuts", "site": "@homecaredaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 626343385, "app_id": "159008524244380/vvanbooven"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/homecaredaily", "published_time": "2015-07-25T15:56:56-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/valerievanbooven", "section": "Blog", "modified_time": "2015-07-25T15:57:44-05:00", "tag": "which ultimately costs more and reduces the quality of patient care."}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "These Medicare cuts for home health care payments with force home health care agencies to reduce staff, stop serving Medicare patients, or face bankruptcy.\nThis plan to reduce Medicare reimbursements for home health care is truly working against the long-term goal to provide \u201caffordable\u201d health care in America.\nDo the MathAs reported in Modern Healthcare, the Visiting Nurse Associations of America project that for most home health care providers the Medicare cuts will create a loss of 9.77% to the home health care agencies for providing in-home health care services for patients covered by Medicare.\nDuring this historical time when more Americans are becoming seniors than ever before, as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), serious reductions in Medicare payments for home health care puts the entire home health care industry at risk.\nSaving 14% on Medicare home health care may put 40% more of those patients back in nursing homes where the health care costs are 75% higher."}
