He also is credited with developing enterprise zones, which encouraged development in low-income urban neighborhoods.\n\nMr. Butler, 67 years old, said he was attracted to Brookings by the idea of working at a place that is not monolithic in its approach to public policy.\n\n\u201cBrookings is a different kind of institution. It\u2019s a collection of scholars as opposed to a team-focused organization,\u201d Mr. Butler said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to sit around in the cafeteria to talk about all kinds of different issues from the theoretical to the practical.\u201d\n\nAt Heritage, Mr. Butler ran the Center for Policy Innovation and had served as vice president for domestic and economic policy studies. Heritage President Jim DeMint, the former South Carolina senator who has overseen the think tank become more of a political animal, called Mr. Butler \u201ca leading intellectual force\u201d in policy circles.\n\n\u201cWe are sad to see him go,\u201d Mr. DeMint said. \u201cBut we certainly understand his desire to shed his heavy management responsibilities and take a post where he can concentrate on his passion \u2013 exploring long-range solutions for seemingly intractable problems.\u201d\n\nThe individual mandate Mr. Butler proposed became popular among conservatives in the early 1990s when Hillary Clinton was trying to sell a universal health-care overhaul during her husband\u2019s presidency. It served the basis of Mitt Romney\u2019s health-care overhaul when he was Massachusetts governor, but became toxic in Republican politics after President Barack Obama adopted the idea for the Affordable Care Act in 2009.\n\nBy then Mr. Butler had long renounced the idea. He wrote in a 2012 USA Today op-ed that the mandate in Mr. Obama\u2019s law was not constitutional. \u201cChanging one\u2019s mind about the best policy to pursue \u2014 but not one\u2019s principles \u2014 is part of being a researcher at a major think tank,\u201d he wrote then.\n\nMr. Butler said he expects to concentrate on \u201clong-term policy questions\u201d as opposed to specific legislation. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting involved in issues and thinking about different sets of things that maybe are not as front-and-center at Heritage, and that was my choice,\u201d he said.\n\nBrookings Vice President Ted Gayer said Mr. Butler will help to diversify Brookings, which has had a reputation as a left-of-center think tank.\n\n\u201cIt highlights what we\u2019re all about,\u201d Mr. Gayer said. \u201cWe want to have informed views, but if everybody agrees we\u2019re probably misinforming ourselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Stuart Butler, a longtime figure in conservative policy deliberations who helped promote the idea of the individual health-care mandate before later disavowing it, is ending a 35-year career at the Heritage Foundation to join the Brookings Institution.", "title": "Conservative Thinker Stuart Butler Leaves Heritage for Brookings", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/25/conservative-thinker-stuart-butler-leaves-heritage-for-brookings/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Conservative Thinker Stuart Butler Leaves Heritage for Brookings", "description": "Stuart Butler, a longtime figure in conservative policy deliberations who helped promote the idea of the individual health-care mandate before later disavowing it, is ending a 35-year career at the Heritage Foundation to join the Brookings Institution.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Reid J.
