× Man found dead in actress Demi Moore’s pool

LOS ANGELES, CA – A 21-year-old man has been found dead in actress Demi Moore’s backyard pool.

Police tell TMZ that the man was found Sunday morning at the bottom of the pool, and that it appears that he slipped and fell into the water. He did not know how to swim. Sources say an assistant, either Demi’s or one of her children’s, invited the man to a party. No one is sure who hosted the party, but sources are insisting that it was not the actress or her children and that the amount of alcohol was “a limited amount.”

Moore was not at home, and police said that none of her family was when the body was discovered.

Neighbors say that her children have been staying in the house for weeks and have been having parties day and night.

This is a developing story and Fox 8 will have updates as they become available.
