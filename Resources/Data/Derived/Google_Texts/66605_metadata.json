TowerBrook\u2019s partners are selling part of their personal stakes to Wafra Strategic as part of the transaction.\n\nThe private equity firm plans to use the proceeds to reinvest in its investment activities, according the person, including through its $3.5 billion fourth fund, which was raised in 2013.\n\nIt will seek permission from an advisory committee of investors to increase the team\u2019s commitment to the vehicle. The remaining capital would be used to make anchor investments in future funds and would also be put towards hiring and retaining staff.\n\nWafra Strategic\u2019s strategy is to invest permanent capital in passive minority stakes in established investment firms.\n\nWafra Investment Advisory is a global investment firm covering private equity and debt, public equity and debt, Islamic finance, real estate and real assets, with around $15 billion of assets and commitments under management, according to its website. It is backed by the Public Institution for Social Security of Kuwait.\n\nTowerBrook, which has offices in London and New York, is led by co-founders Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou. The team spun out of Soros Fund Management in 2005.\n\nIn December the firm put plans to sell its lending arm, Hayfin Capital Management, on ice after talks to sell the business to U.S. asset manager Guggenheim stalled.\n\n(This article first appeared in Private Equity News, a U.K. trade publication owned by Dow Jones & Co.)\n\nWrite to Ayesha Javed at ayesha.javed@wsj.com\n\n[Update: This post has been modified to clarify the relationship between Wafra Investment Advisory Group and Wafra Strategic Investors.]", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners is selling a stake in itself to a U.S. investor in order to free up capital to spend on the business.", "title": "TowerBrook Sells 10% Stake to U.S. Firm", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/01/13/towerbrook-sells-10-stake-to-u-s-firm/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "TowerBrook Sells 10% Stake to U.S. Firm", "description": "Private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners is selling a stake in itself to a U.S. investor in order to free up capital to spend on the business.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Ayesha Javed", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners is selling a stake in itself to a U.S. investor in order to free up capital to spend on the business.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-01-13T17:45:34-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/01/13/towerbrook-sells-10-stake-to-u-s-firm/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-17898", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners is selling a stake in itself to a U.S. investor in order to free up capital to spend on the business.", "title": "TowerBrook Sells 10% Stake to U.S. Firm", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/01/13/towerbrook-sells-10-stake-to-u-s-firm/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-17898", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-13T20:50:11-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners is selling a stake in itself to a U.S. investor in order to free up capital to spend on the business.\nTowerBrook informed its investors today that it would sell a 10% stake in the management company to Wafra Strategic Investors LP, a fund managed by Wafra Investment Advisory Group, according to a person close to the matter.\nTowerBrook\u2019s partners are selling part of their personal stakes to Wafra Strategic as part of the transaction.\nThe private equity firm plans to use the proceeds to reinvest in its investment activities, according the person, including through its $3.5 billion fourth fund, which was raised in 2013.\nIn December the firm put plans to sell its lending arm, Hayfin Capital Management, on ice after talks to sell the business to U.S. asset manager Guggenheim stalled."}
