Steve Beshear\u2019s (D) decision to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act opened the program to an additional 428,000 people, the Middlesboro Daily News reported.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThose 428,000 people will cost Kentucky taxpayers $257 million next year, Miller warned. What\u2019s more, in implementing the expanded plan, the state found another 60,000 people who qualified for Medicaid under its previous iteration, to the tune of $124 million a year.\n\nThe 60,000 exceeded state estimates tenfold, Miller said. He was appointed Medicaid commissioner by Beshear\u2019s successor, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, earlier this month.\n\nBevin has said he won\u2019t reverse expansion over the next two years, but will pursue a waiver with the federal government to make changes later on that would weed out some beneficiaries and attach premiums to services for others. He has also promised to end Kentucky\u2019s public health exchange, Kynect, by the end of this year.\n\nRecently, Beshear launched a major campaign to head off healthcare changes being pursued by current governor Matt Bevin. \u201cSave Kentucky Healthcare\u201d will include an online campaign to educate people about the proposed changes and a petition to avert the overhaul.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nMiddlesboro Daily News: Medicaid commissioner warns of skyrocketing spending", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/3c/a7/3ca7f887d2f6adface754c4edda88c41.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-law,healthcare-finance", "news_keywords": "Health Law,Finance", "category": "News Post", "title": "Medicaid expansion not financially sustainable, KY official claims", "pub_date": "feb 19, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-19T20:14:04", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, February 19, 2016, 08:14 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-02-06T20:14:04", "teaser": "<p>Medicaid Commissioner Stephen Miller said the expanded program will cost Kentucky $3.7 billion over the next two years.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-02-19", "sailthru.description": "Medicaid Commissioner Stephen Miller said the expanded program will cost Kentucky $3.7 billion over the next two years.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Medicaid Commissioner Stephen Miller said the expanded program will cost Kentucky $3.7 billion over the next two years.", "title": "Medicaid expansion not financially sustainable, KY official claims", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medicaid-expansion-not-financially-sustainable-ky-official-claims/414144/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/KY_State_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/d2/29/d229bbfc0d9561afaabaaebebaddf1e9.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Dive Brief:Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid commissioner told state lawmakers the program\u2019s costs will jump by 20% over the next two years to $3.7 billion as a result of Medicaid expansion.\nStephen Miller said the Medicaid program is likely not sustainable at that cost.\nRecommended ReadingMiddlesboro Daily News: Medicaid commissioner warns of skyrocketing spending\nHe was appointed Medicaid commissioner by Beshear\u2019s successor, Republican Gov.\n\u201cSave Kentucky Healthcare\u201d will include an online campaign to educate people about the proposed changes and a petition to avert the overhaul."}
