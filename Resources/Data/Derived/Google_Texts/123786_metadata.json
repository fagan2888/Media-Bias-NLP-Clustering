They include widespread use of chemical mace and electric stun guns to control agitated, mentally ill inmates, or strapping them into restraining chairs for days on end.\n\nRelated: How the Mentally Ill Are Being Warehoused in Prisons\n\nIn many cases, prison staffers have broken prisoners\u2019 jaws, noses and ribs in violent outbursts, according to the report, or left them with deep cuts that required stitches, burns and serious bruises. In a few instances, jail and prison staff abuse has led to the deaths of inmates who were suffering from schizophrenia or other serious mental illness and left to flail or lie inert on the ground.\n\n\u201cJails and prisons can be dangerous, damaging, and even deadly places for men and women with mental health problems,\u201d said Jamie Fellner, U.S. program senior adviser at Human Rights Watch and the author of the report. \u201cForce is used against prisoners even when, because of their illness, they cannot understand or comply with staff orders.\u201d\n\nRelated: State Prisons Break Away from Soaring Cost Trends\n\n\u201cUntreated or undertreated because of inadequate mental health services, these prisoners may engage in conduct correctional staff consider annoying, bizarre, frightening, disruptive, or dangerous,\u201d the report states. \u201cThey may refuse to obey orders, and they break the rules at higher rates than other prisoners. The default response of staff may be the use of force.\n\nState and federal officials and lawmakers should have seen this tragic freight train coming, but for years they either ignored the frequent warnings from mental patient advocates and prison reformers or simply were unaware.\n\nIn April 2014, a study by the Treatment Advocacy Center and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association documented that ten times as many mentally ill people were being incarcerated in jails and prisons as were being treated in psychiatric hospitals and community facilities.\n\nThe report highlighted a massive breakdown in the nation\u2019s mental health system that \u2013 regrettably -- began a half century ago and is ongoing. An historic shift in mental health care treatment from the states to federal government and local facilities beginning in the 1950s resulted in huge dislocation of the mentally ill, untold suffering by the most vulnerable in society, and a massive increase in the government\u2019s overall cost.\n\nRelated: A New Push to Boost Spending on Mental Health\n\nThere have been efforts to address the problem, but they have been modest at best. The Obama Administration and Congress in recent years have sought greater parity in spending on mental health programs that traditionally have been treated as a stepchild of the nearly $3 trillion annual U.S. health care system. The passage of the Affordable Care Act made coverage of mental health and drug treatment one of the \u201c10 essential health benefits\u201d that all insurers must offer. But health insurers and government agencies don\u2019t necessarily comply.\n\nE. Fuller Torey, a psychiatrist and lead author of the Treatment Advocacy Center study, summed it up in an interview last year: \u201cThere\u2019s been a fairly dramatic continuing increase in the number of severely mentally ill in jails and prisons. It\u2019s gone up progressively since the 1970s. The fact is that in most states the largest de facto mental institution is a jail or prison.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As shocking and depressing\u00a0as the new", "title": "Shocking Abuse of Mentally Ill Prisoners Continues", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/12/Shocking-Abuse-Mentally-Ill-Prisoners-Continues", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09102014_Prison_Bars.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/12/Shocking-Abuse-Mentally-Ill-Prisoners-Continues", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09102014_Prison_Bars.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As shocking and depressing\u00a0as the new", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe298d\"", "article_summary": "As shocking and depressing as the new Human Rights Watch report on abuse of mentally ill prisoners is, it should come as no surprise.\nThey include widespread use of chemical mace and electric stun guns to control agitated, mentally ill inmates, or strapping them into restraining chairs for days on end.\nThe report highlighted a massive breakdown in the nation\u2019s mental health system that \u2013 regrettably -- began a half century ago and is ongoing.\nThe passage of the Affordable Care Act made coverage of mental health and drug treatment one of the \u201c10 essential health benefits\u201d that all insurers must offer.\nExperts have been warning for years that state and local governments have been using prisons and jails to warehouse mentally ill people, and now we are beginning to see in vivid detail the tragic consequences of those policies."}
