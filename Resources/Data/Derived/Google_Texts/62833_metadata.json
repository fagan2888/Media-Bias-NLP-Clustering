Participants were split into two groups: a treatment group receiving care from a pharmacist and a control group managed by a nurse. Over a period of six months, McAlister and colleagues tracked each participant\u2019s progress by monitoring their blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\nThe team found that care managed by pharmacists was associated with 43 percent improvement across all factors at the end of the trial. For the control group, the figure was 30 percent. \u201cCompared with nurse-led case management \u2026 active case management by pharmacists substantially improved risk factor control at 6 months among patients who had experienced a stroke,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nThe findings persisted after the team controlled for diet, smoking, exercise, and other lifestyle factors known to influence recovery. Notably, the observed improvement was also obtained in patients who were already on medication at the start of the trial. \"The 43% absolute improvement at 6 months seen in our pharmacist case manager group was achieved despite the fact that over three-quarters of patients were already taking an antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medication at baseline, \u201c McAlister explained.\n\nCardiovascular events like strokes currently account for about 600,000 fatalities each year, making it the leading cause of death in the United States. On average, deaths and illnesses associated with coronary heart disease cost the nation $109 billion annually.\n\nThe researchers theorize that the prescribing authority of pharmacists may contribute to their success as case managers. Many of them actively adjusted the medication each patient received, thus optimizing care with so-called medical titration.\n\nSource: McAlister FA, Majumdar S, Padwal RS, et al.
