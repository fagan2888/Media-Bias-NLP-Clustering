Plus, even through she met all of her sales targets, she was constantly berated by her manager.\n\n\u201cHe was constantly telling me, \u2018You can\u2019t handle it. You can\u2019t perform under your situation,'\u201d Juarez told ABC News.\n\nEventually, she was demoted. And at that point she filed a complaint with the state.\n\nSoon thereafter, she was fired.\n\nThat\u2019s when she filed a civil suit claiming gender and pregnancy discrimination.\n\nWill the award stick?\n\nPrior to the nine-figure verdict, the jury awarded Juarez $900,000 in compensatory damages for lost wages and emotional distress.\n\nBut what about the $185 million award that was handed down just a few days later? Will it stick?\n\nProbably not, although she\u2019ll likely still receive a handsome some of money \u2014 somewhere in the neighborhood of a few million dollars \u2014 anyway.\n\nThe reason she won\u2019t collect the lottery-ticket amount: Punitive damages must bear some relationship to the compensatory award \u2014 and they typically can\u2019t exceed a 9:1 ratio.\n\nStill, the $185 million figure will take it\u2019s toll on AutoZone in the court of public opinion. The figure has grabbed national headlines and is likely sinking the retailer reputation, especially among women.\n\nSo what happens now? Employment law attorney Jon Hyman, author of the Ohio Employer\u2019s Law Blog predicts AutoZone and Juarez will continue to do the courtroom tango \u2014 with AutoZone appealing the verdict and Juarez firing back by filing motions seeking attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nThen, ultimately, Hyman says the two sides will likely come to some sort of confidential settlement.\n\nCite: Juarez v.
