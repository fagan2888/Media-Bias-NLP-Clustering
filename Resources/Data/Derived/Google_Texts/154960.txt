PEORIA, Ill. -- Over 40,000 children could run out of healthcare coverage as soon as July 1.

Lawmakers are trying to prevent this with House bill 57-36.

It would extend the " All Kids Program" to 2019, if passed.

The current program ends June 30.

One doctor at St. John's Hospital is pushing for this proposal, saying it works and it's good public policy.

"Earlier medical interventions, and preventative care improves outcomes and reduces all health care spending for our families and for our children," said Dr. Charles Lucore with St. John's Hospital.

Due to the Affordable Care Act, if the state cuts back on child medicaid assistance before 2019, it risks losing matching federal funds.
