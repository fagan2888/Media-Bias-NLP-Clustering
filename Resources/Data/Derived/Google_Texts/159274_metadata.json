Savage and the editors of The Los Angeles Times, on July 4, providing their version of the same story.\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND\u2026\n\nIt probably would not have occurred to the Founding generation (although Abigail Adams might have thought of it) that some day there would be women serving as judges and even as Justices of the Supreme Court. When Sandra Day O\u2019Connor became the first of her gender to be named to the court in 1981, America had a lively debate over whether a woman would vote differently because of her different life experience. She insisted at the time, and later, too, that it did not shape her view of the law. Some other women judges have disagreed.\n\nThere was a tinge of gender stereotyping in that debate, as it is not at all common to analyze how male Justices vote as men. The discussion has come up again each time a new female member joined the Supreme Court, and then, too, some observers have wondered anew what difference it would make.\n\nA few basics should be kept in mind. The Constitution does not impose a gender qualification for serving on a federal court. Given modern notions of legal equality, such a condition would be flatly unconstitutional (as well as politically outrageous). And it hardly needs saying that women take to legal education quite as well as men do, and now, at some law schools, they are the dominant gender. They are just as good at judging, too.\n\nAmerica has come a long way since 1873, when the Supreme Court would refuse to allow Myra Bradwell to become a lawyer, and Justice Joseph Bradley would write: \u201cThe natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life\u2026.The paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s two decisions last week dealing with access to birth control devices and methods led, perhaps not surprisingly, to a return of some of the same stereotyping in some of the public discussions. The temptation to suggest that gender-made-them-do-it was, apparently, irresistible.\n\nFirst of all, the clash between majority and dissenting Justices was primarily one of ideology: how, as a judge, one interprets the power of Congress to act, and the authority of the Executive Branch to find ways to implement what Congress has legislated. The majority went a considerable distance to read a motive of religious favoritism into what Congress had done, and the dissenters went a similarly wide distance to read the need to protect access to essential medical services \u2013 in this case, services used by women.\n\nWhen the initial Hobby Lobby decision came out early last week, there were four dissenters: Justice Stephen G. Breyer and the three female Justices. And in the follow-up decision, in a case involving the Illinois religious school, Wheaton College, Breyer went with the majority, and the three women dissented again.\n\nBut one can read the dissenting opinion, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in the most intensive search for gender motivation, and it is simply not there. Indeed, the complaint of the dissenters was that the majority had abused the court\u2019s judicial power, and had undertaken to invent new legal mechanisms on its own to support its desired outcome, to expand religious objections to public law. That is a gender-neutral dispute, and it goes to the heart of how a judge views the proper role of courts.\n\nOne can, of course, assume that the women dissenters were voting their gender, because only they, among the nine Justices, were in a class with the workers whose access to birth control was at issue. But that kind of assumption is precisely what gender stereotyping has always been about. When legal analysis is what is being undertaken, one should look for evidence of the influences that might explain the results. But, absent evidence, the mere labeling of a personal characteristic as centrally important gets in the way of a more serious inquiry into what was really going on.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\n10 cases coming soon to the Supreme Court\n\nWhen is the real Independence Day: July 2 or July 4?\n\n10 fascinating facts about the Declaration of Independence\n\nWhat is the Stone version of the Declaration of Independence?\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s adviser on constitutional literacy, looks at criticism of the Supreme Court's three female Justices and gender motivation in the Court's recent ac...", "title": "Constitution Check: Are the female Justices voting their gender?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/07/constitution-check-are-the-female-justices-voting-their-gender/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-07T10:00:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-06T18:33:56+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd76c0\"", "article_summary": "Share:EmailLyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s adviser on constitutional literacy, looks at criticism of the Supreme Court\u2019s three female Justices and gender motivation in the Court\u2019s recent actions.\nWhen the initial Hobby Lobby decision came out early last week, there were four dissenters: Justice Stephen G.
