The majority\u2019s ruling was an imperfect solution to a complicated case involving the reach of religious liberty to exempt organizations from providing certain medical benefits that they find morally objectionable to their employees. The fact that these medical benefits were almost exclusively offered to women makes this decision all the more difficult to accept for some.\n\n\n\nBut at its core, the case reveals something else as well. It brings to the forefront something we\u2019ve all known for sometime: that Obamacare\u2014for all the good it\u2019s done in increasing access to quality and affordable healthcare\u2014is a messy law. It asks employees to be at the whim of its employers\u2019 objectives and mission for what health care benefits they receive. It also asks employers to at times reject its deepest convictions in order to provide certain benefits to its employees.\n\nThis isn\u2019t sustainable. A person\u2019s access to quality healthcare shouldn\u2019t depend on who their boss is. And an employer shouldn\u2019t be heavily fined if they don\u2019t compromise their religious convictions in providing healthcare for their staff.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is a monumental first step in achieving a just and equitable American health care system that seeks first to serve those on the margins of society. But as we look towards the future, it\u2019s necessary to consider major alterations or even alternatives to Obamacare to continue to advance healthcare reform.\n\nFor those of us who value both universal access to quality healthcare and the strong American tradition of protecting religious liberty, there might be a solution in a single-payer system.\n\nA single-payer system overturns an unsound principle of Obamacare: relying too heavily on private organizations to deliver the public good of healthcare. When you require private organizations to enforce what the government believes ought to be public policy, you open yourself to a myriad of legal and ethical qualms. How can you expect organizations as diverse as Hobby Lobby, the Little Sisters of the Poor and the American Atheists to agree on what health care benefits are appropriate for their employees?\n\nAmidst all the fuss this week over the Supreme Court ruling, both sides actually agreed on one thing: they disliked the accommodation provided by the Obama Administration for religious organizations. Religious groups argue the exemption is too narrow and doesn\u2019t protect the autonomy of some organizations to practice their convictions. Women\u2019s groups argue that the current accommodation unfairly denies women working for religious groups access to birth control, which is a basic benefit in any healthcare plan.\n\nA single-payer public health care option eliminates such complications. No matter who your boss is or what business you work for, you get access to the healthcare you need. And employers will not be forced to compromise their religious beliefs while providing the public good of healthcare.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, if you have something that is both supported by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Planned Parenthood, you might be onto a plan that proves the angel Gabriel right: nothing is impossible with God.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Perhaps both sides could agree it may be a way forward", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Perhaps both sides could agree it may be a way forward", "title": "After Hobby Lobby: A Single-Payer Health Care Solution?", "url": "http://time.com/2954306/after-hobby-lobby-a-single-payer-health-care-solution/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png"}, "title": "After Hobby Lobby: A Single-Payer Health Care Solution?", "description": "Perhaps both sides could agree it may be a way forward", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "affordable care act, faith, health care, hobby lobby, obama, religion, supreme court", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "health care, Obamacare, affordable care act, hobby lobby, religion, Obama, bishops, planned parenthood"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c42\"", "article_summary": "It asks employees to be at the whim of its employers\u2019 objectives and mission for what health care benefits they receive.\nA single-payer public health care option eliminates such complications.\nHow can you expect organizations as diverse as Hobby Lobby, the Little Sisters of the Poor and the American Atheists to agree on what health care benefits are appropriate for their employees?\nPresident Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is a monumental first step in achieving a just and equitable American health care system that seeks first to serve those on the margins of society.\nNow that the initial shouting and\u2014at times\u2014vitriol from both sides has subsided after Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, it\u2019s time to take a sober look at what the ruling says about the future of health care reform in the United States."}
