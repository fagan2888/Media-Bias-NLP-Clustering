As can be seen below, the House and Senate versions put out over the last month have varied enormously over the total size of the bond and the type of projects to be funded. Concerns over cutting taxes while going farther into debt aside, the bond act shows that there is no single guiding star by which the legislature is sailing.\n\nTo be fair, some of this is just the legislative process in action. When you\u2019re making a multi-billion dollar sausage, there\u2019s going to be lots of back and forth on the ingredients. Still, while the bond bill outlines how important investments are to our economic future, it reveals relatively little consensus on what those investments are or how to make them.\n\nHere are a few of the major changes to the bill compared to what the House presented last month (For a complete breakdown of how the bond package has changed, see the document below):\n\nTotal package decreased from $2.85 to $2 billion\n\ndecreased from $2.85 to $2 billion Removed $500 million for local school construction\n\nRemoved $400 million for transportation infrastructure\n\nRemoved $215 million for state building and courthouse improvements\n\nIncreased UNC system allocation from $890 to $980 million\n\nallocation from $890 to $980 million Increased water/sewer grants and loans to local governments from $75 to $309 million\n\nto local governments from $75 to $309 million Increased Community College allocation from $300 to $350 million\n\nA few other illustrative examples of how much the plan has changed:\n\nState Parks were allocated roughly $135 million in the House\u2019s version from August. At the beginning of this week, the Senate eliminated all of these projects except for $45 million for the NC Zoo. The final version put the wider range of projects back in, but brought the total down to $100 million.\n\nwere allocated roughly $135 million in the House\u2019s version from August.
