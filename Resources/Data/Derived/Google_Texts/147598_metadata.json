Cloud is a Healthcare IT company focused on deploying hardware and software systems that will minimize inefficiencies related to compliance and auditing, giving providers more control over medical procedures, processes and records.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Cloud is to provide the healthcare industry with technologies that will result in safer and more affordable healthcare. Cloud will be the first company of its kind, operating independently to partner with, and support providers with top-tier technology and the information management systems required to compliment electronic medical records and the tools to identify and cut expenses,\u201d said James Nicholson, Senior Advisor to Cloud Medical. James was the original co-founder of Mitek, which ultimately became DePuy Mitek of DePuy Synthes, a Johnson & Johnson Company.\n\nJames Nicholson is the newly appointed CTO of Cloud and Chair of M1T Healthcare Capital Partners, a fund dedicated to backing technology enabled Healthcare companies. With the successful close of a $3.4 Million dollar round, Cloud will target facilities in need of technology improvements in primary markets throughout the United States. Cloud plans to optimize case coverage of medical procedures through real time data and video monitoring in healthcare facilities nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe current market is incredibly de-centralized with consultants, manufacturers and data technologies all pulling providers in different directions. We are filling the need for support as one single integrated hardware and software technologies company\u201d said Anthony Gude, Executive Director of M1T. \u201cOur goal is to empower the healthcare industry to adopt technologies that will allow them to control expenses and inefficiencies produced by the constant change in policy, patient claims and other liabilities.\u201d\n\nDue to the recent passing of Obamacare and additional regulatory acts such as the Sunshine Act, the resulting burden of compliance and record keeping has and will continue to increase the costs of healthcare for everyone involved. \u201cTransparency is often perceived as costly and impractical within the healthcare industry,\u201d said Steven Schlatmann, Executive Director of M1T, however \u201cThe Cloud technology suite is able to offset and control the costs of compliance, enabling better budgetary control to the healthcare services industry and promote transparency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe M1T collaboration with Cloud affirms our commitment to enhance the accuracy, security and delivery of real time data to all parties, including providers, insurers, and regulatory bodies, a tremendously impactful tool amid the debates about the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAbout M1T\n\nM1T is an American business focused on creating growth opportunities by making significant contributions within the Healthcare, Hospitality, Media, and Technology industries.
