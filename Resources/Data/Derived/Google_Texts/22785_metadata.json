Earlier this week, I heard Tony Sheridan, the president of the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, complain to Tom Ashbrook about Amazon\u2019s sales practices. The Seattle-based online giant has an unfair advantage over property tax-paying \u201cbrick and mortar stores,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a level playing field here,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cWe believe in competition, but we have to have regulations that allow us a level playing field.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a few hours later, I heard Boston Taxi Drivers Association spokesperson Donna Blythe-Shaw complain about Uber, the smart-phone driven, everyman livery service that is supplanting cabs across the country. Uber is essentially unregulated, Shaw groused; \u201cit\u2019s not a level playing field.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m always amused to note pleas for the proverbially planar playing field, which my jaded ears hear as \u201cnot tilted enough in our favor.\u201d Laying the spirit level across the metaphorical ballfield is inevitably the first resort of embattled status quo-niks feeling the hot, musky breath of change on the backs of their necks.\n\nUnbeloved public schools seek a level playing field with their more successful charter school competitors; cable TV companies lobby for taxes on their satellite TV competitors, and even Big Oil whines about its Chinese competitors, all in the name of fair play.\n\nEach of our past three presidents has called for flattening the pitch when pushing their baroque agendas of restrictive tariffs and sweetheart subsidies on behalf of the bedraggled American worker. \u201cOur workers are the most productive on earth,\u201d Barack Obama said in his 2012 State of the Union speech, \u201cand if the playing field is level, I promise you: America will always win.\u201d\n\nHow come writer Dan Okrent can solve the New York Times Saturday crossword in 13 minutes, when it takes me between 30 minutes and forever, depending on who is counting. Is it possible he\u2019s smarter than I? Naah. Let\u2019s level the playing field. From now on, Okrent can solve the puzzle in \u201creformed Egyptian\u201d (the original language of the Book of Mormon) and I\u2019ll stick to English. Now that\u2019s what I call a fair fight!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the uber-stressed cabbies, the last time I checked, the taxi business was a government-protected oligopoly dominated by ruthless fleet owners bent on euchring the driver, the consumer, and the tax authorities, in that order. A Globe Spotlight investigation exposed business conditions at Boston Cab, the city\u2019s largest fleet, replete with details of payoffs and bribes. \u201cThis is like a Third World country,\u2019\u2019 one cab driver told the Globe. \u201cYou need to give them money. That\u2019s how they do business.\u2019\u2019\n\nA level playing field, indeed.\n\nAnd yes, when I think of a bedrock commitment to fairness and equity, my mind turns instantly to the US Chamber of Commerce. Let\u2019s see. It opposed the Affordable Care Act; it opposes minimum wage hikes; it opposed the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Levelling \u2014 no. Meaningless chin music pleading for a \u201clevel playing field\u201d \u2014 yes.\n\nI don\u2019t hold myself out as a historian, but when thousands of Irish immigrants arrived in our fair city around the turn of the past century, I don\u2019t believe they encountered a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d Like almost every immigrant group before and since, they were met by overt discrimination and de facto economic enslavement that \u201cwelcomed\u201d newcomers to our country.\n\nThey made do. This has never been the country of the level playing field, and I doubt it ever will be. But at least there\u2019s a playing field, and yes, sometimes you have to run uphill.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.61210544", "eomportal-id": 619537, "description": "I\u2019m always amused to note pleas for a level playing field, which my jaded ears hear as \u201cnot tilted enough in our favor.\u201d", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "I\u2019m always amused to note pleas for a level playing field, which my jaded ears hear as \u201cnot tilted enough in our favor.\u201d", "title": "A level playing field?
