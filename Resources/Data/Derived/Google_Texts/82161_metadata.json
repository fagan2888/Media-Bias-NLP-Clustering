More than 40% said that the ACA provides subsidies to undocumented immigrants to buy health insurance, establishes something resembling a death panel, and reduces benefits for seniors currently enrolled in Medicare\u2014none of which are true.\n\nIn addition, a Public Policy Polling survey showed that 27% of Americans\u2014including 47% of African-Americans\u2013didn\u2019t know that Obamacare and ACA are the same thing.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 76% of uninsured people \u201cdidn\u2019t understand the law and how it would affect them.\u201d It also revealed that only 51% of respondents knew that the insurance exchanges were in operation, and less than half (49%) were aware of the subsidies available for low-income people.\n\n\u201cThe genuinely shocking degree of public ignorance regarding the ACA that has been revealed by this slew of recent polls, more than three years after the law was signed by President Obama, should not be something to which we respond by simply shaking our heads and lamenting that the American people are so \u2018disengaged,\u2019\u201d Justin Doolittle wrote at Truthout.\n\n\u201cNo, this ought to be viewed as a very serious political crisis and a grave threat to whatever semblance of health our badly disfigured democratic culture still maintains,\u201d he added.\n\n-Noel Brinkerhoff\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nThe American Public's Shocking Lack of Policy Knowledge is a Threat to Progress and Democracy (by Justin Doolittle, Truthout)\n\nApproval of Obama Remains Consistent, Americans Blame Congress (Public Policy Polling)\n\nSix of One - Obamacare vs. The Affordable Care Act (Jimmy Kimmel)\n\nWhat is the Individual Mandate and when will it Take Effect?
