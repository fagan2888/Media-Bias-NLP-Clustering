Consider the patient population, types of patient care changes, which payers and purchasers the changes will involve, the expected timeframe and any transition costs.\n\nEstimate how the type and volume of services will change. Consider whether the changes will provide a service that isn't currently paid for, whether the changes will provide more or less of a service than is currently paid for and whether providing the current service in a different way changes its costs.\n\nDetermine how payments and revenue will change under the current payment system. For this step, assume that only the current payment system in place. Then separately determine the payments/revenue for each provider organization and purchaser/payer.\n\nDetermine how the costs of services will change. Use a cost model to identify the fixed costs, semi-variable costs associated with the service and how they will change based on the number of patients served or the number of services delivered.\n\nCalculate the changes in operating margins for providers. Based on the previous steps, determine whether the plan will provide equal or better operating margins, lower the positive operating margins or will mean negative operating margins.\n\nCalculate the changes in payment that providers need. If the operating margin is lower or negative under the proposed change in care, you must then determine what type of payment change is necessary to restore the margin.\n\nDetermine whether a business case exists for both purchasers and providers. Consider whether the plan results in no payment changes, whether it lowers total spending or whether it would increase spending but achieve better outcomes.\n\nRefine the changes in care to improve the business case. If necessary, improve the business case by eliminating unnecessary or low-value components of the proposed sets of services, reducing the cost of delivering the proposed services or targeting the services to a different patient population.\n\nAnalyze the impacts of deviations from planned care and expected outcomes. Consider the impact on services, outcomes and payments, and whether there is a potential harm scenario that indicates a change is necessary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform report walks healthcare leaders through the necessary steps to change the way they deliver healthcare by improving outcomes and saving money without cutting fees to providers or benefits to patients.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A new Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform report walks healthcare leaders through the necessary steps to change the way they deliver healthcare by improving outcomes and saving money without cutting fees to providers or benefits to patients.", "title": "10 steps to change healthcare delivery and save money", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/10-steps-change-healthcare-delivery-and-save-money/2014-02-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform,healthcare delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c0f\"", "article_summary": "A new report walks healthcare leaders through the necessary steps to change the way they deliver healthcare by improving outcomes and saving money without cutting fees to providers or benefits to patients.\nConsider the patient population, types of patient care changes, which payers and purchasers the changes will involve, the expected timeframe and any transition costs.\nConsider whether the plan results in no payment changes, whether it lowers total spending or whether it would increase spending but achieve better outcomes.\nThe steps include:Define the planned change in care and the expected results.\nIf the operating margin is lower or negative under the proposed change in care, you must then determine what type of payment change is necessary to restore the margin."}
