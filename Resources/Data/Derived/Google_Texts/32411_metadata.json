The U.S. won WWII and Healthcare.gov still doesn\u2019t work.\n\nJeff Presley builds websites around the world.\n\nHe even created this video for Blue Cross Blue Shield to explain how the Affordable Healthcare Act is supposed to work.\n\n\u201cMy guess is they need to scrap it and start over,\u201d said Presley.\n\nIt\u2019s a very difficult program to create because of all the agencies and programs it involves.\n\nPresley says the website builders started with just a couple of programs and it grew into a mega process.\n\n\u201cIt just kept growing and growing and growing in complexity. So the blueprints were never fully defined and frozen and said OK, now spend however long it\u2019s going to take to build this out,\u201d said Presley.\n\nPresley says the website is such a mess because it\u2019s like you're building a house and constantly making changes.\n\nFor example, just a week before you move in you decide to add three floors, move the bathrooms and switch the kitchen and the bedrooms.\n\nPresley also says any website should be properly tested before it\u2019s launched, which clearly wasn\u2019t done with Healthcare.gov.\n\nNow that people have been brought in to fix it, Presley says operating problems are only a part of the issues.\n\n\u201cThey have people working in the system who they haven\u2019t even done background checks so now we have data problems, and security problems,\u201d said Presley.\n\nPresley says there is no excuse for the website failures because more than $600 million were spent to build Healthcare.gov, which is more than Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter put together.\n\nMost people can\u2019t even log into the exchange, which Presley says is one of the most basic functions in building a website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama Administration says problems with the website healthcare.gov won\u2019t be fixed until the end of the month at the earliest.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WREG.com", "description": "The Obama Administration says problems with the website healthcare.gov won\u2019t be fixed until the end of the month at the earliest.", "title": "Website Expert Explains Why Healthcare.gov Doesn\u2019t Work", "url": "http://wreg.com/2013/11/13/website-expert-explains-why-healthcare-gov-doesnt-work/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/promo208651967.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/promo208651967.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@3onyourside", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@3onyourside"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324690258", "fb": {"pages": 114737265221655}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wreg.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/9bc3246fbdba300537a296bf9ad07b3c?s=16", "application-name": "WREG.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3", "published_time": "2013-11-13T23:15:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-13T23:15:22+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3"}, "keywords": "news, affordable care act, healthcare.gov, obamacare, website problems", "google-site-verification": "uJnF6Q7vJP3k7pEVLotNZ8dGfBwvCzC3at_F3MZ_CA4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb7b\"", "article_summary": "The Obama Administration says problems with the website Healthcare.gov won\u2019t be fixed until the end of the month, at the earliest.\nThe U.S. Government had the same amount of time to build the Affordable Care Act website that it had to fight WWII.\n\u201cIt just kept growing and growing and growing in complexity.\nPresley also says any website should be properly tested before it\u2019s launched, which clearly wasn\u2019t done with Healthcare.gov.\nPresley says there is no excuse for the website failures because more than $600 million were spent to build Healthcare.gov, which is more than Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter put together."}
