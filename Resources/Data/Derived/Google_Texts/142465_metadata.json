GoCPAP.com began by offering patients with high deductible health insurance plans the ability to purchase the CPAP machines and supplies they need at a price they can afford.\n\nThe changing landscape of health insurance can be confusing and scary to navigate at times, and while many consumers have managed to find affordable health care plans for themselves and for their families, the plans often come with a high deductable. High deductible health plans are initially an attractive choice for consumers, as the monthly premiums can be substantially lower. If the beneficiaries are fortunate enough not to require any health care services throughout the year, they will have saved a significant amount of money.\n\nHowever, should a beneficiary need to purchase many common health care services such as an x-ray, or more expensive health care such as hospitalization or surgery, they must first pay large out of pocket expenses until they have met their yearly deductible, which can range from $1,250 to as high as $10,000.\n\nThis can place a large financial burden on consumers when they require medical services beyond the standard doctor's office visit or blood test, and many patients often face a difficult choice\u2014find the money to purchase the care or services they need, or go without them and suffer the unfortunate results. Insurance companies and DME providers often provide little recourse for individuals or families struggling financially, as the DME Providers contracted with insurance carriers are not permitted to offer equipment and supplies at discounted prices.\n\nNew Health Care, Same High Costs\n\nEven the new health plans offered through the Affordable Care Act, though more comprehensive in what types of basic health services they cover, can have extremely high deductibles. Health care expenses are one of the largest causes of consumer debt in the United States, and there is often little availability for low cost alternatives for various types of prescription medicine and medical equipment and supplies.\n\nLow Cost Solutions for OSA Patients\n\nGoCPAP.com understands that Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a life-threatening disease that is often difficult to manage.
