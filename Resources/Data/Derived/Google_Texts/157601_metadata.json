"article_text": "A convicted terrorist has exposed security gaps at Sydney airport after boarding a flight to Syria on his brother\u2019s passport\n\nIt is believed Khaled Sharrouf is now in Syria\n\nHe used his brother\u2019s passport to leave Australia\n\nHe fled despite being on airport watchlists and being under 24hr surveillance\n\nSharrouf is one of the \u201cterror nine\u201d arrested in 2005\n\nA CONVICTED terrorist used his brother\u2019s passport to fool Customs officers and board a flight for Syria, exposing grave security gaps at Sydney international airport.\n\nDespite not having a passport in his name, being on airport watchlists around the country and being under 24-hour surveillance as part of a counter-terror investigation, Khaled Sharrouf walked onto a Kuala Lumpur flight under the nose of Customs on December 6 and has since disappeared.\n\nThe 31-year-old father-of-four, one of the most recognisable names in law enforcement, is one of the \u201cterror nine\u201d arrested in the landmark Operation Pendennis investigation in 2005 which thwarted a planned attack on an unspecified target in Sydney.\n\n\"Sharrouf\u2019s disappearance, a signifcant embarrassment to border security agencies, was also hushed up by authorities with this newspaper blocked from accessing basic public documents about the case against him.\"\n\nTimeline of events\n\nWho are the terror nine?\n\nAuthorities strongly suspect he is now in Syria, where it is feared up to 120 other Australians are fighting in the country\u2019s civil war alongside proscribed terror organisations.\n\nA major investigation has been launched by counter-terror authorities into how he escaped the country and why it took 12 days before authorities even realised the father-of-four had disappeared.\n\nIt is understood Sharrouf had been at the centre of a major counter-terror investigation by federal police and other agencies which were supposed to be watching his every move.\n\nOn November 9 he was observed in remote bushland near Lithgow with several other men holding an unauthorised firearm.\n\nProtocol states that a person with a criminal history such as Sharrouf\u2019s would be immediately charged and taken into custody, however, for operational reasons, he was not charged over the firearm at the time and allowed to remain free.\n\nSharrouf\u2019s disappearance, a significant embarrassment to border security agencies, was also hushed up by authorities with this newspaper blocked from accessing basic public documents about the case against him.\n\nNSW Police are understood to be furious about the Customs blunder which allowed him to escape, and the lack of security at the airport.\n\nSharrouf is one of only a few people in Australia charged with plotting a terrorist act and investigators are now scrambling to locate his exact whereabouts.\n\nCourt records confirm that on December 18 documents were lodged at Sydney\u2019s Downing Centre Local Court charging Sharrouf with falsely using Australian travel documents belonging to another person.\n\nHe left the country just three days after Australian Federal Police swooped on two Sydney men for allegedly sending young Australian Muslims to fight in war-ravaged Syria.\n\nSharrouf\u2019s lawyer, Simon Joyner, said he was unable to answer questions about his client.\n\n\u201cAt this stage I will not comment on these issues,\u201d Mr Joyner said.\n\nSharrouf pleaded guilty in 2009 to possessing six clocks and one hundred and forty batteries, which he admitted were connected with the preparation of a terrorist act.\n\nA judge sentenced him to three years and 11 months jail before he was released in 2009 to spend a further year and three months on parole.\n\n\"A major investigation has been launched by counter-terror authorities into how he escaped the country and why it took 12 days before authorities even realised the father-of-four had disappeared.\"\n\nHe attempted to have his passport returned on his release was unsuccessful.\n\nAbout three weeks before he left Australia, Sharrouf was charged with possessing an unauthorised firearm and ordered to appear in Lithgow Local Court.\n\nThe charge relates to an incident on November 9 when police in the village of Glen Davis, near Lithgow, saw Sharrouf and others in remote bushland.\n\nPolice allegedly spotted a number of men with rifles and, upon approaching them, saw Sharrouf holding a weapon, which was licensed to another man present at the scene.\n\nHe did not appear in court to answer the charge on January 30 and a magistrate has since issued a warrant for his arrest.\n\nDuring Operation Pendennis investigators followed their targets to two remote bush locations where \u201ctraining camps\u201d had been set up to test fire weapons and bomb makeshift targets.\n\nLast week the NSW Attorney General\u2019s Department hindered access to basic public documents outlining the firearm charge and false passport charges against Sharrouf, with no official explanation provided.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph has since confirmed Australian Federal Police were given the final say over whether the public-record information should be released.\n\nInstead of refusing access, the department undertook a delaying tactic which, after three days of \u201cconsidering\u201d whether to release the documents, had still made no decision by Friday close of business, meaning the files could not be released before this newspaper\u2019s deadline.\n\nTimeline: TIMELINE: July 2004: Law
