Health insurers may soon be required to include more tests related to diabetes detection and prevention in their coverage offerings that the insured will not be charged for.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act lists a number of preventative services that insurers must offer free of charge, i.e. with no co-pay or special charges included in premiums. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force is charged with reviewing preventative measures and grading them. Those that receive an A or B join the list of free preventative services.
