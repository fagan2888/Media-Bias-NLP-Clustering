WASHINGTON–House Speaker John Boehner reportedly called Sen. Ted Cruz a “jackass” at a Colorado fundraiser and told attendees that he’s happy the senator’s presidential campaign keeps him away from D.C., according to The Daily Caller.

Boehner was at an event for Rep. Scott Tipton, R-Colo., where he allegedly dissed Cruz and said he was glad the senator wasn’t around to tell him how to run the House, according to two attendees.

Cruz has been a thorn in Boehner’s side since he joined the Senate. In 2013, Cruz helped rally opposition in the House to any bill that would fund both the government and Obamacare, which prompted a government shutdown. He also routinely accuses Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of betraying conservatives and squandering Republican control of Congress.

This isn’t the first time Boehner made fun of Cruz among GOP donors. At a Midland fundraiser in May, the speaker flipped the bird at Texas Republican Party Chairman Tom Mechler when asked for his thoughts on Cruz’s presidential bid.

A Boehner aide told the New York Times it was only a joke.
