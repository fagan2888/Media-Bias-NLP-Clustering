It was Boehner as we\u2019ve never seen him before.\n\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner is third in the line of succession to the presidency, and he was second in the line of succession on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno (behind Matt LeBlanc).\n\nBut, in his first and last appearance on Jay\u2019s couch Thursday night, Boehner was indisputably No. 1 in a succession of blunt, undiplomatic remarks that had the potential, by turns, of irritating House Republicans he putatively leads, prompting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to plot diabolical payback, causing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to send him a pricey bouquet, and provoking an international incident involving Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis was Boehner unplugged\u2014possibly Boehner unhinged (unhinged from his talking points, at least). In any event, it was the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the constitutional leader of one of the three branches of government, as he is seldom seen or heard on those starchy Washington Sunday shows or during his regular Thursday morning press gaggles.\n\n\u201cEver think of running for president?\u201d Leno asked him at one point.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Boehner fairly shouted.\n\n\u201cWanna show what you did when I asked you before?\u201d Leno coaxed\u2014apparently referring to a backstage hand gesture of the sort that the Ohio Republican might also have made a year ago when advising Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to perform the anatomically impossible.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Boehner said, ignoring Leno\u2019s invitation, \u201cI like to play golf, I like to cut my own grass, I do drink red wine, I smoke cigarettes\u2014and I\u2019m not giving that up to be president of the United States.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not implausible that red wine and cigarettes figured in the 64-year-old Boehner\u2019s Tonight Show preparation; he was looking far too relaxed for his somber dark suit and crisp white shirt, though maybe that hot pink-patterned tie was a tipoff. Swinging eagerly at Leno\u2019s curve balls and apparently hoping for the best, he was at once appealingly human and thrillingly dangerous.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he snapped when Jay asked if he\u2019d ever met Putin, the czar of the Sochi Olympics and the leader of 144 million Russians. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to meet him. I think he\u2019s a thug, and I think he\u2019s treated his neighbors in a disrespectful way and, frankly, I think the president ought to stand up to him.\u201d\n\nThat got applause from the Cold Warriors in the audience at NBC\u2019s Burbank studios.\n\nLeno\u2014a lame-duck television host whose final Tonight Show is scheduled for Feb. 6, after which Jimmy Fallon will commandeer the desk\u2014made some news himself, blurting \u201cI agree with you,\u201d when Boehner called indicted whistleblower Edward Snowden \u201ca traitor to the country.\u201d (As a side note, the Speaker explained that he had finally accepted Leno\u2019s repeated invitations, with only two weeks to go, because \u201cthis show is about over, and I thought I ought to get here before it\u2019s too late.\u201d To which Jay parried, \u201cI was gonna say the same thing for you!\u201d\u2014punctuating his little jab with his trademark squealing giggle.)\n\nBoehner dismissed concerns\u2014raised by Snowden, various elected U.S. officials, foreign leaders and others\u2014about the National Security Agency\u2019s massive spying on America\u2019s allies, and vice versa. \u201cLet\u2019s just get over it,\u201d he exhorted. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for thousands of years.\u201d\n\nAs for Chris Christie, the Speaker\u2019s initial stout defenses of the beleaguered governor\u2014an early frontrunner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination\u2014are no longer sounding all that stout.\n\nLeno asked if the scandal-plagued Christie is now \u201cdamaged goods.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear he knew anything about it,\u201d Boehner parsed carefully, referring to last September\u2019s politically vengeful traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge. \u201cHe took responsibility, fired the people who were involved. He apologized.\u201d Then, as if suddenly remembering all the nasty insults Christie heaped on him and the House Republicans last year concerning legislative delays of Superstorm Sandy aid, Boehner added: \u201cBut this is not gonna go away any time soon.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

It doesn\u2019t happen in Ohio.\u201d\n\nWhen Leno asked Boehner if he likes any potential Republican candidates for 2016, the Speaker replied: \u201cI\u2019m not endorsing anybody. Jeb Bush is my friend. I think he\u2019d make a great president.\u201d In other words, he endorsed Jeb Bush.\n\nProbably the most bracing part of Boehner\u2019s time on the couch was when the discussion turned to the fractious behavior of the Tea Party wing of the House Republican conference, whose frantic attempts to defund President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act led to last year\u2019s politically damaging government shutdown from which the Republican brand has yet to recover.\n\n\u201cAbout the GOP infighting\u2014is this the worst you\u2019ve ever seen it?\u201d Leno asked.\n\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Boehner began, as if getting ready to disagree. But then he blurted: \u201cMaybe it is. It\u2019s bad.\u201d\n\nBoehner was careful to praise Tea Party members of Congress who bring \u201cgreat energy to the political process\u201d\u2014a compliment that might strike some of them as patronizing\u2014but griped about \u201csome Washington organizations [a barely veiled reference to the Club for Growth, among others] who purport to represent the Tea Party, who I think mislead them. There\u2019s nothing I could do that was conservative enough for them.\u201d\n\nBoehner supported Leno\u2019s claim that the shutdown was disastrous for Republicans\u2014\u201cYep! Yep! Yep!\u201d he agreed\u2014and was at pains to explain why he let it happen. \u201cWhen you have my job, there\u2019s something you have to learn when I looked up and saw my colleagues going this way,\u201d the Speaker said. \u201cAnd you learn that a leader without followers is simply a man taking a walk.\u201d\n\nSo he went along with shutdown zealots, hoping that \u201cthe sooner we got it over with, the better,\u201d Boehner said, even though it was \u201ctactically not the right way to do it.\u201d\n\nIn another part of his chat with Jay, Boehner likened being Speaker of the House to his formative years toiling with his 11 siblings in the family business, a saloon in Cincinnati\u2014mopping the floor, waiting tables, and tending bar. \u201cYou have to learn to deal with every jackass that walks in the door,\u201d he told Leno. \u201cTrust me, I need all the skills I learned growing up to do my job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "TheLloydGrove"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201401241219, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Speaker of the House let rip at Vladimir Putin, Chris Christie and his Republican colleagues in Congress.
