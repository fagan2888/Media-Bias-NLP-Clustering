A $6,000 reward is posted in connection with a series of armed robberies in Phoenix.

Silent Witness is looking for 30-year-old Leo Orlando Arrendondo, who is believed to be behind nine holdups since Feb. 5.

The robberies have occurred at stores from 2632 S. 83rd Ave. to 5060 W. Bell Rd.

Arrendondo is considered armed and dangerous and people spotting him are asked not to approach but call police.

In the robberies, Arrendondo confronts the clerk and demands money while reaching into his waistband, according to Silent Witness Sgt. James Rothschild. He has displayed a handgun in the robberies, Rothschild said.

Since Silent Witness published a flier, the reward has jumped from $1,000 to $6,000.

"The ATF has offered an additional $5,000 for anyone with information, not in identifying the suspect, but in letting us know where he is," Rothschild said. "Silent Witness still has the original $1,000 available.‚Äù

People are eligible for the reward if they provide information that leads to his arrest and conviction.

Anyone with information about the suspect is asked to call Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS or 480-TESTIGO. People can also call Silent Witness detectives toll free at 1-800-343-TIPS. Your call will remain anonymous.
