Emily Witt writes about it for Medium (don\u2019t worry, there are no strongly NSFW photos, though given the material, you probably don\u2019t want to read this at work). Excerpts:\n\nChaturbate is a live webcam site that launched in 2011. It distinguishes itself from the many other live webcam sites by its democratic approach. It is free to watch \u2014 really free, as in no logging in or setting up passwords \u2014 and open to everyone of legal age. Its tabs offer \u201cFemales,\u201d \u201cMales,\u201d \u201cCouples,\u201d \u201cGroups,\u201d and \u201cTranssexuals.\u201d To start broadcasting, a person has only to register a name and beam herself to the world, eating Chipotle. Total sexual anarchy is forestalled by a zealous volunteer police force of users, who operate along the lines of Wikipedia moderators, reporting and shutting down any performers who look suspiciously underage or who break one of Chaturbate\u2019s few rules \u2014 the usual bans on violence, animals, and excrement.\n\nOh good, so there are some standards. Witt says she started looking into the site after an editor assigned her to do a piece on what people do in conditions like we have now, in which they have an abundance of sexual freedom. From an interview with one of the regulars on the network:\n\nShe called Chaturbate an \u201cintrovert\u2019s paradise.\u201d I asked her how it was that broadcasting her image to thousands of people over the internet could appeal to an introvert. \u201cI have complete control over the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it escalating physically. I can turn it off whenever I want. I can turn these words on the screen off whenever I want. I can kick people out. I make my own rules, nobody\u2019s telling me what to do. Not that I\u2019m necessarily a control freak but I\u2019d never had that sexually. I\u2019d never been in control of a sexual encounter until this, and I think it was something that I definitely needed.\u201d\n\nA Chaturbate woman named Wendy teaches Witt about the joys of \u201cmass intimacy\u201d:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this freedom, in that you don\u2019t actually have to meet any of these people and they don\u2019t actually know you,\u201d Wendy explained. \u201cYou can be whoever you want to be. You can show them any part of yourself that you want. You can be totally open and bare and share everything without having to worry about people rejecting you or you can totally make up a new self and be someone different.\u201d I\u2019d recently read an essay called \u201cTimes Square Red\u201d by the science fiction writer Samuel R. Delany. Delany, a gay African-American man, had in the 1970s and 1980s frequented the porno movie theaters in Times Square, where he had hundreds of casual and anonymous sexual encounters with other men. He wrote that it was a shame that women suffered risks in the pursuit of similar experiences, but that also \u201cWhat waits is for enough women to consider such venues as a locus of possible pleasure.\u201d He went on to describe the benefits of his vast experience in casual sex. The movie theaters had served as laboratories in which he had learned to discern the nuances and spectrums of his sexual desire, where sexual experimentation happened entirely outside of narratives of love or emotional entanglement. His observations about sexual attraction consistently disproved conventional notions of beauty and ugliness. (He discovered, among other proclivities, that he had a thing for burly Irish-American men, including two who had harelips.) Describing the importance of the anonymous sexual encounter, he wrote:\n\nWe do a little better when we sexualize our own manner of having sex \u2014 learn to find our own way of having sex sexy. Call it a healthy narcissism, if you like. This alone allows us to relax with our own sexuality. Paradoxically, this also allows us to vary it and accommodate it, as far as we wish, to other people. I don\u2019t see how this can be accomplished without a statistically significant variety of partners and a fair amount of communication with them, at that, about what their sexual reactions to us are. (However supportive, the response of a single partner just cannot do that. This is a quintessentially social process, involving a social response.)\n\nFor women, the pursuit of wide-ranging sexual experience has always come with disproportionate risks and stigma. But online, in the context of what Wendy called \u201cmass intimacy,\u201d some of the women I spoke with were undertaking Delany\u2019s endeavor with the risk of pregnancy, violence, and sexually transmitted infection minimized through the medium of encounter. Chaturbate and its ilk \u2014 everything from My Free Cams to the \u201cGone Wild\u201d amateur porn thread on Reddit \u2014 could be the equivalent of the darkened porno theater of the 21st century, but places more welcoming to women, where women could go to consider their desires, where they could learn what attracted others to them and to discern and name what they found attractive.\n\nSo the Internet, plus the abundance of sexual freedom, is teaching everyone to live by the values of perverts who used to go to X-rated movie theaters to have anonymous sex. Wendy tells Emily Witt that to do it right, she needs to \u201cobjectify\u201d the people on the other end of the electronic connection. One more clip:\n\nSome people might look at Max and Harper, or anybody on Chaturbate, and disagree. They might think of clean sheets, a well-made bed, a clearly defined \u201cpartner,\u201d and a closed door and think that they know exactly what sex is \u2014 loving, maybe; monogamous, probably; dignified by its secrecy; more authentic for not being shared; sacred because it\u2019s not mediated through a cell phone. Spend enough time on Chaturbate and such a view starts to feel both rarified and unambitious. Some people limit their internet sexuality to the private sphere of sexting or video chats with long-distance lovers. Others choose to meet their virtual partners in a semi-anonymous public forum. When mediated bodies can inhabit the same temporal dimension, the distinct purposes of porn, sex work, casual sex, internet dating, and social networking start to blur. Right now I see being sexual on the internet as a bold and risky form of performance. I anticipate that in the future it will just be thought of as sex.\n\nI hope you will read the whole thing, though \u2014 trigger warning, for those who need them \u2014 the discussion, though anthropological, is fairly seamy at times. Why is it important to read? Because this loveless dystopia, this pornographic pseudo-world, is increasingly the world we live in, and in which our children are being raised. I think Witt is probably right: in the future, this will just be thought of as sex (though Witt doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a problem with that).\n\nOrdinary sexual love between partners as \u201crarefied and unambitious.\u201d Philip Larkin got there first, with the bleak sarcasm of his poem High Windows, the opening of which I\u2019ve redacted for use on this blog:\n\nWhen I see a couple of kids\n\nAnd guess he\u2019s f\u2014ing her and she\u2019s\n\nTaking pills or wearing a diaphragm,\n\nI know this is paradise Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives\u2014\n\nBonds and gestures pushed to one side\n\nLike an outdated combine harvester,\n\nAnd everyone young going down the long slide To happiness, endlessly.\n\nOur civilization is producing dead souls incapable of erotic love, only despairing hydraulics. This is what it most wrong with Chaturbate and the culture that created and sustains it. It\u2019s not what it does to the body; it\u2019s what it does to the soul, to the imagination, because of what it does to the body. From the opening chapter of Houellebecq\u2019s The Elementary Particles, a novel about the total atomization of humanity in contemporary life:\n\nThe expressway back into Paris was deserted, and Djerzinski felt like a character in a science fiction film he\u2019d seen at the university: the last man on earth after every other living thing had been wiped out. Something in the air evoked a dry apocalypse.\n\nA dry apocalypse. Yes. That\u2019s what we are living through. When I talk about the Benedict Option, I largely mean creating a stronghold of hope and love where the old virtues of civilization are lived and taught, and refugees from the dry apocalypse can take shelter from the chaos, and learn how to be human again.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "Life imitates Houellebecq in a new online chat service for zombies of love", "title": "The Dry Apocalypse", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/zombies-of-love-dry-apocalypse-sex-chaturbate/", "image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_246085624.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Well, here's one for the misanthropy file: Chaturbate is an online service in which anyone of legal age can watch other people masturbate, or turn the camera on themselves and self-pleasure for the an", "title": "The Dry Apocalypse", "image": {"src": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_246085624.jpg"}, "creator": "@amconmag", "site": "@amconmag", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "maisie.allison"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "When mediated bodies can inhabit the same temporal dimension, the distinct purposes of porn, sex work, casual sex, internet dating, and social networking start to blur.\nI think Witt is probably right: in the future, this will just be thought of as sex (though Witt doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a problem with that).\nRight now I see being sexual on the internet as a bold and risky form of performance.\nWendy tells Emily Witt that to do it right, she needs to \u201cobjectify\u201d the people on the other end of the electronic connection.\nIt is free to watch \u2014 really free, as in no logging in or setting up passwords \u2014 and open to everyone of legal age."}
