But facts and moral truth aren\u2019t the same thing.\n\nFrom the Senate\u2019s report on CIA torture to Rolling Stone\u2019s tortured retraction of its blockbuster UVa rape story to what really happened to Eric Garner, December has been a bad month, especially for facts. In a country where talk is \u201ccheap\u201d and opinions are \u201ca dime a dozen,\u201d we give the facts special privileges and special status. But sometimes, the quest for facts lets us down, or leads us astray, and leaves us worse off than before, not better.\n\nRight now, that traumatic experience just won\u2019t quit. Yet instead of disbelieving that the facts will set us free, we cling to them as if they were spoils of war. We fight over their ownership and control, as if reality were a resource as scarce as the water and oil in Mad Max.\n\nJonathan Gruber, expert consultant, was dragged before Congress for laughing out loud that we, the people, couldn\u2019t handle the facts, requiring fairy tales to swallow Obamacare. Actually, rather like Gruber, we feel rather icky about fairy tales. It is an insult to say we depend on them. The facts we see as unimpeachable. Fables, with their old-fashioned claim to deliver truths through fact-free storytelling, strike us as all too imprecise\u2014smuggled-in opinions. We proud skeptics would rather trust the demonstrable facts than the alleged truth.\n\nIn the safety of the light of day, we positively revel in our facts. But when the darkness closes in, we actually run to fairy tales and fables. All it takes is a little uncertainty, a little fear, to discover that moral analogies can save us where breaking news cannot.\n\nThat\u2019s a truth deep enough to withstand even the Hollywood treatment\u2014from the forthcoming reboot of Mad Max\u2019s grim world to the adaptation of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s knowing Grimm musical Into The Woods. In his theatrical production, Little Red Riding Hood spends a whole song revealing the nasty price to be paid for trusting the facts to be good for us. She hints at her terribly teachable moment with a mercifully concealing tact altogether absent from the world of expos\u00e9s:\n\nBut he drew me close\n\nAnd he swallowed me down,\n\nDown a dark slimy path\n\nWhere lie secrets that I never want to know [\u2026].\n\nAnd I know things now,\n\nMany valuable things,\n\nThat I hadn't known before\n\n[\u2026] take extra care with strangers,\n\nEven flowers have their dangers,\n\nAnd though scary is exciting,\n\nNice is different than good.\n\n\n\nRevealing what would otherwise be secret is the business of facts. It is now understood to be the purpose of journalism. In an arrogant delusion that we\u2019re not just entitled to the facts but empowered by them, we have lost the fairy tale wisdom that what happens in the darkness should sometimes stay there, unknown. The deepest horrors of the torture report should remain de-publicized, for our sake, beneath redacted black boxes. The lurid details of rape accusations are not for glossy tabloids or rock\u2019n\u2019roll magazines but for the courtroom, where justice requires revealing what is better off concealed.\n\nTo many of us, that smacks of censorship, the highest offense to our pride in self-publicity. But no sooner are we given new bits of news than, like spoiled children with a new toy, we start smashing our playmates in the face with them. Instead of drawing us together, enlightened and informed, the Senate\u2019s incomplete torture report and Rolling Stone\u2019s inaccurate rape report have split us apart in a wrathful struggle over what counts as a fact.\n\nContrary to the belief that lies behind our public warfare, breaking news is not a moral act as liberated from criticism as moral truth itself. Facts concern what really is happening to us; truths, who we really are. The student being raped is not her rape. The detainee being tortured is not his torture. We writers and readers obsessed with breaking news manage to break down this truth, no matter how fictitious a rape or how redacted a torture turns out to be. Had we learned Little Red Riding Hood\u2019s lesson, we would know how the quest for new facts to wolf down leads to a terrifying reversal of fortune.\n\nIt\u2019s a moral analogy just as applicable to December\u2019s most adventurous real-life ginger\u2014Charles C. Johnson, the proprietor of Gotnews.com. With a nose for bogus facts, Johnson sets out to break the Internet by breaking news. Unfazed by Rolling Stone\u2019s unnerving allegations of gang rape on campus, however, he wound up fighting fake facts with fake facts\u2014posting pics of the \u201creal\u201d young woman profiled in the story, only to admit that they were, in fact, possibly not really her.\n\nJohnson has become the latest human battleground in our rancorous fight over facts, where human truth is cast aside in the pursuit of human power. \"To report the truth is a revolutionary act,\" he has tweeted, revealing what happens to our nose for truth when all we can smell are bloody facts in the water. In its original, the quote belongs to Orwell, but he added the important qualifier that truth-telling amounts to revolution only \u201cin a time of universal deceit.\u201d\n\nThe more obsessed with facts we get, the more credulous we become, it\u2019s true. But the more we see lies everywhere, the more we conclude that we can\u2019t restore reality without breaking some eggs. \"The liberated soul does not cease to act, to think, to create, to instigate revolutionary flows.\" That\u2019s not Johnson or Orwell\u2014it\u2019s Che Guevara. Who\u2019s to say what constitutes the truth about revolutionary acts and flows? Those unfortunate enough to be caught on the murderous end of the stick.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "University of Virginia, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201412131145, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "University of Virginia, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "On Torture, Chuck Johnson & Sondheim", "tags": "entity:facility/university_of_virginia,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Torture, the UVa rape, police violence\u2014we hunger for the facts, and then twist them.
