Every week a small group of MBA students read a work of fiction featuring an ethical dilemma and discussed its implications for their own business decisions.\n\nUsing Russell Banks\u2019 \u201cThe Sweet Hereafter,\u201d the story of a town mired in litigation after a school bus crash, we analyzed the conflict between morality and justice: Was it ethical for one injured girl to end the toxic lawsuits with a lie? Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d shaped our debate about personal responsibility in the realm of service: Was the uneducated butler of an English gentleman culpable for serving a Nazi sympathizer? With Robert Bolt\u2019s \u201cA Man for All Seasons,\u201d the story of Thomas More\u2019s refusal to give in to Henry VIII\u2019s break from the Catholic Church, we considered if a principle could ever be more precious than a life. And my favorite, Allan Gurganus\u2019 short story \u201cBlessed Assurance,\u201d showed us how the simple act of collecting a few cents in life insurance payments could feel like the most vile thing ever to fall under the umbrella of business. In class we easily compared the scheme in the story to more familiar financial crimes like insider trading, the young protagonist taking minuscule sums from a large number of uneducated destitute in order to enrich sellers equipped with far better information. The debate around that story was tremendous and inspiring \u2014 it moved us, if only for one day, to recognize our own selfish desire for profit and the humanity of those we might hurt with our actions.\n\nFor me, \u201cthe Moral Leader\u201d was a life-changing course, not only because it deepened my thinking on the practical aspects of morality, but also because in this class I fell in love with fiction. Shortly after that, I enrolled in a creative writing course. Later, I quit business and became a writer.\n\nNow, watching the events surrounding the massive insider-trading investigation of the hedge fund SAC, and finding myself in frequent ethics discussions with friends in finance, I often think that much of what I learned while studying to be a writer could have helped me as a business student, and my friends as they grew into leaders in their various industries. In business school, I felt strong, immune to every frailty. Successful alumni loaded with gravitas empowered my classmates and me to be bold and to act, to trust our instincts. By contrast, in writing workshops, introspective scholars preached exactness, revision and the infinite gray of the soul. Every day they exposed us to our own capacity for wickedness, all our unexamined motives. As writing students we learned to analyze human weakness, to identify hidden vulnerabilities in our characters, and by extension, in ourselves. We learned to weave a convincing narrative by reaching for the bare-bones truth. And, most important, we learned to respect language. Words, we understood, are no place to hide.\n\nRespect your audience, we were told over and over, by literary greats.\n\nNow I wonder, shouldn\u2019t we have learned how to do all that in business school? Was it acceptable that in the breeding ground for America\u2019s leadership, we placed so much focus on developing and nurturing ourselves, our image? And what about the many ways we learned to abuse language, carefully tweaking every communication until it was emptied of all meaning? Of course, business school doesn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, have the same aims as art school and I\u2019m making no grand proposals that one kind of education can fix the inadequacies of the other. (On the contrary, I\u2019m impressed that Harvard Business School has made room for a single literature course.) But I have studied at top institutions in both fields, and as time passes and the lessons blur together, I am amazed by the expanse of common ground between them, by the practical wisdom of art, and by its universality.\n\nLately, when I talk to friends in leadership positions, I find myself returning to the words of my writing teachers:\n\nLanguage exists to illuminate, not to muddle.\n\nIn her essay \u201cClose Reading\u201d Francine Prose states that good writing means putting \u201cevery word on trial for its life.\u201d Otherwise, the prose only seems accomplished when speeding through. It doesn\u2019t inspire or stand the scrutiny of a close read.\n\nWhen I was a consultant, we often played with words. We wrote, \u201cMcKinsey Analysis\u201d at the bottom of slides, when what we actually meant was, \u201cbasic client data summarized by a 22-year-old.\u201d Managers used tired jargon like, \u201cdon\u2019t boil the ocean,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t reinvent the wheel\u201d and \u201cpick the low-hanging fruit,\u201d when they actually wanted their analysts to work until 3 a.m. Employees were never fired; they were \u201ccounseled out.\u201d It was so absurd that it became a joke among the consultants at the firm. Once a colleague said about his breakup, \u201cI\u2019m trying to counsel her out of our apartment.\u201d\n\nI admit, I found the vague language soothing. I was 22 and believed I could never get fired. Besides, my firm, McKinsey & Co, had high standards, produced good work and took good care of me. They didn\u2019t invent the soul-killing language. They existed in a larger business environment that had spawned this double-speak and everyone somehow learned to decipher it. Regardless, the opportunity for such vagueness \u2014 the simple way it removes accountability or guilt or consequence \u2014 creates a fertile environment for the worst behavior, even at the best firms. It\u2019s easy for a weak, stressed-out investor to buy a few drinks for an insider, learn a little too much, and then spew a string of imprecise words, like, \u201cI have a hunch that this might be a good buy based on a mosaic of non-material information I\u2019ve gleaned using standard firm analysis.\u201d\n\nRecently I asked my teacher, the writer Charles Baxter, to say something about all the current misbehavior in the finance world. His response went straight to the heart of the matter: language. He showed me an article by Fintan O\u2019Toole in the Irish Times (June 2013) about the Anglo Irish Bank tapes in which disgraced executives displayed arrogance and greed, but no remorse, even as they discussed their own misdeeds. Says O\u2019Toole of the executives caught on tape, \u201cThe bankers are acutely self-conscious about language,\u201d using evasive linguistic techniques to distance themselves from their victims.\n\nBaxter and his peers constantly tell young writers that language is supposed to bring us closer to the truth. In the writing world, we celebrate brevity, clarity, precision. We talk about avoiding clich\u00e9s and generalities and empty jargon, because readers see through these things. No one is dazzled by a mess of words revealing nothing. And yet, such is the accepted language of the business world. It doesn\u2019t stand the scrutiny of a close read. The truth is lurking somewhere behind piles of words, scraped of meaning and jumbled together to create a desired image, a likeness that looks great only from far away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today's business leaders could learn a lot from writing teachers about how language shapes morality", "title": "Wall Street needs an MFA", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Today's business leaders could learn a lot from writing teachers about how language shapes morality", "title": "Wall Street needs an MFA", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/12/wall_street_needs_an_mfa/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/gordon_gekko.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Today's business leaders could learn a lot from writing teachers about how language shapes morality", "title": "Wall Street needs an MFA", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/gordon_gekko.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dina Nayeri", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Business, Fiction, novelists, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95fd\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Business, Fiction, novelists, Wall Street, Business News, Life News, Entertainment News, NewsIn my second year at Harvard Business School, I took an elective called \u201cthe Moral Leader,\u201d the only literature-based course in the curriculum.\nIn business school, I felt strong, immune to every frailty.\nShortly after that, I enrolled in a creative writing course.\nOf course, business school doesn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, have the same aims as art school and I\u2019m making no grand proposals that one kind of education can fix the inadequacies of the other.\n(On the contrary, I\u2019m impressed that Harvard Business School has made room for a single literature course.)"}
