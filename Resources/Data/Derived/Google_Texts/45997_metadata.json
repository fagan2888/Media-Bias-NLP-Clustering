What should also be evident is how weak and petty his attackers\u2019 cases purport to be. Christie and Bush plan to attack Marco Rubio\u2019s inexperience\u2013a route the more junior senator, Cruz, cannot pursue. Cruz, in his typical fashion, wishes to score points by attacking Rubio\u2019s immigration stance. Assuming Rubio remains poised and positive, none of these attacks should draw blood.\n\nOn Rubio\u2019s Experience\n\nIf Republicans should have learned anything from Barack Obama\u2019s candidacy and presidency, it should have been that inexperience is an overrated line of attack. For starters, the attack failed when employed by Senator John McCain in 2008 and by Governor Mitt Romney in 2012. Especially in an election year in which the media narrative names 2016 the year of the outsider. Rubio can turn the inexperience argument into a derivative of Ben Carson\u2019s and Carly Fiorina\u2019s speeches about career politicians\u2019 culpability for America\u2019s woes.\n\nMore to the point, though, inexperience has not harmed the Obama presidency. None of Obama\u2019s most egregious acts resulted from his lack of experience. Rather, his worldview is to blame. Inexperience did not lead to the failed Stimulus Package\u2013a belief in big government did. Inexperience did not lead to the Affordable Care Act\u2013a belief in big government did. Obama\u2019s failed foreign policy did not result from a lack of executive experience. Instead, he was led by the liberal belief that America should be less involved in world events.\n\nMarco Rubio\u2019s lack of executive experience says nothing about what matters most\u2013his conservative convictions. A conservative as experienced as Barack Obama was in 2007 can still offer hope to a movement looking to turn the country in a better direction.\n\nOn Immigration\n\nSenator Cruz\u2019 attacks on immigration will likely fall flat for a few reasons. First, Marco Rubio is right in insisting that the 12 million illegal immigrants to this country cannot be deported. The cost to detain, try and ultimately deport costs too much money for very little (if any) benefit. Furthermore, the economic costs of uprooting large swaths of the American workforce and home owners only compounds the impossibility of such a policy. Senator Cruz either knows this, and is promising to do so anyway (lying), or does not know this\u2013making him stupid. Cruz is not stupid, but he does have a reputation for bending the truth for political gain.\n\nSecondly, Rubio\u2019s approach to immigration varies neither from Christie\u2019s nor from Bush\u2019s. Marco Rubio can easily deflect Cruz\u2019 criticism by using his enemies as a shield.\n\nThirdly, immigration ranks much lower on the list of issues most pressing to Americans at large than it does on Republicans\u2019 priority list. New Hampshire; being less conservative than Iowa, and being a state that allows independents to vote in the primary; likely will not punish Marco Rubio for whatever heresy he has committed on this issue.\n\nFinally, Marco Rubio has claimed to have learned his lesson from the Gang of 8 experience (which, incidentally passed in the Senate, unlike any legislation Ted Cruz was a part of). His stance on immigration falls within the mainstream of the Republican Party and within the country on a whole.\n\nThe attacks on Marco Rubio have been loathsome, not just because they threaten to damage him if he becomes the nominee, but also because they lower the stature of some very good conservative patriots. Governor Christie has so much to boast about without resorting to negativity. Bush, too, possesses unmatched substance and intelligence to continue to bring to the conservative cause and the Republican Party. These attacks are beneath him, especially as Marco Rubio\u2019s mentor. The Republican Party\u2013indeed the nation\u2013needs unity now, more than ever. Republicans can neither win nor govern effectively without unity. Attacking a young, rising star will do more damage to the party, the attackers\u2019 reputations, and to the country than perhaps Marco Rubio\u2019s detractors realize.\n\nWritten by Joseph Hunter\n\nOfficial website; http://blackandredblog.wordpress.com/", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "language": "en"}, "article_summary": "Marco Rubio\u2019s choice will be evident beginning with the only debate between the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary.\nChristie and Bush plan to attack Marco Rubio\u2019s inexperience\u2013a route the more junior senator, Cruz, cannot pursue.\nFirst, Marco Rubio is right in insisting that the 12 million illegal immigrants to this country cannot be deported.\nCruz, in his typical fashion, wishes to score points by attacking Rubio\u2019s immigration stance.\nOn ImmigrationSenator Cruz\u2019 attacks on immigration will likely fall flat for a few reasons."}
