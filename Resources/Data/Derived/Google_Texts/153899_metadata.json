(Photo: AP)\n\nLargely unnoticed by their targets, the human resources departments of large corporations are beginning to gather spy-agency-quality intelligence on their current and future employees. The hottest topic in human resources is \u201cpredictive analytics,\u201d synthesizing a worker\u2019s traits and behaviors to estimate how he or she will perform in the future.\n\nNo one knows exactly where unleashing \u201cbig data\u201d on workers will take us. There are indications that it could get intrusive and abusive. According to analysts Raffael Devigus and Chase Rowbotham, there are also hints that it could make managerial decisions fairer, replacing \u201cgut feel\u201d with \u201cunbiased data-driven decisions.\u201d Chances are that in the early going, digital surveillance of employees will be both creepy and cool.\n\nPredictive analytics will fundamentally alter the relationship between employee and enterprise. It will redraw the boundaries of worker privacy and managerial discretion. Either by court case or legislation, it will change the law. \u201cToday\u2019s workers are left with a Hobson\u2019s choice of giving up their privacy or giving up their job, if the predictive analytics even allow them to have the job,\u201d wrote University of Wyoming associate professor Robert Sprague in a law journal.\n\nFew people recognize how much digital evidence they leave in their wake. A person\u2019s profile of \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits \u2014 openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism \u2014 can now be discovered through analysis of her Facebook posts and likes, and machine coding of what she has written online. Her tweets can be mapped to determine how often she is \u201cserene,\u201d \u201calert,\u201d \u201cdepressed,\u201d \u201ctense\u201d or \u201celated.\u201d Her LinkedIn profile can be mined for such variables as the number, executive level and geographic dispersion of her connections.\n\nUntil recently, rigorous analytical scrutiny was reserved for the most valuable and the most dangerous \u2014 those about whom making the right decision was worth the high cost. Professional sports franchises routinely used Moneyball-style predictive models to help decide which athletes to recruit or draft.\n\nAs the digital trail of most employees grows, as the ability of software to harvest and make sense of that information increases, and as competitors rush into the field, the cost of predicting an employee\u2019s potential will decrease to the point that it becomes common. Predictive analytics is the hottest buzzword in HR, holding out chances for adopters \u201cto win that long-coveted seat at the C-table,\u201d as a 2014 Jibe executive brief expressed it.\n\nThe more garden-variety predictive analytics offerings, with roots in traditional HR computer systems, promise to connect the dots among data that are already within the purview of the company. If a single repository holds a person\u2019s tenure, time since last promotion, pay trend, frequency of recognition and performance levels \u2014 and if external data show what that person could be making elsewhere \u2014 the computer could quite appropriately signal it\u2019s time the employee be given a raise or better opportunity.\n\nBut it\u2019s going to get messy. There will be poor decisions given too much weight because they were \u201cempirical.\u201d There will be abuses. There will be lawsuits, either because the computer picked someone else for a promotion or \u2014 if predictive analytics proves to be far superior to human judgment \u2014 because a company relied solely on people rather than the new machine.\n\nThis messiness will produce a backlash. There will be new legislation and court rulings to redefine worker privacy and managerial discretion in a predictive analytics world. We\u2019ll need ethical standards, a Hippocratic oath of HR surveillance, that ensures the science serves employees with better job fit and opportunities as much as it serves the business.\n\nThe backlash will improve how predictive analytics informs decisions about people, but it won\u2019t stop the train. The work is too intriguing, too likely to eventually make the business of managing better, so long as the primary input to the calculations is a large dose of humanity.\n\nRodd Wagner is a best-selling author and confidential adviser to senior business and government leaders.
