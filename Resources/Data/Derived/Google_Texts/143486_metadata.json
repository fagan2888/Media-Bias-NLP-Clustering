Ted Cruz slammed Republican leadership on Monday for slavishly serving the interests of major corporations \u2014 and worse, leading attacks from the Left on its conservative grassroots base.\n\nThe Democrats are \u201crelentless\u201d in pursuing their principles, Cruz said, which include ever-increasing government spending and unlimited abortion rights. They\u2019re \u201cwilling to crawl over broken glass with a knife between their teeth to fight for their principles,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nRepublican leadership \u201creflexively surrenders,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cPresident Obama simply has to utter the word shutdown and Republican leadership runs for the hills.\u201d\n\nCruz explained three types of votes take place in the Senate: \u201cshow votes,\u201d a limp-wristed attempt to placate voters by staging a pre-ordained surrender to Democrats; votes that simply grow government; \u201cmust-pass\u201d votes that include continuing resolutions, appropriations bills, and debt ceiling raises.\n\nThe Texas senator compared GOP leadership to an NFL coach that declares \u201cwe forfeit\u201d at every single coin toss. The \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution rubberstamps Obama\u2019s hard-left agenda.\n\n\u201cIt funds 100 percent of Obama\u2019s agenda, executive amnesty, Obamacare, the Iran nuclear deal. It is essentially a blank check to Barack Obama,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cHow is it that Speaker Boehner can promise there would never be a shutdown? Because I believe Speaker Boehner has cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Cruz said. He believes Boehner plans to cling to his Speakership for another month in order to ram through a spending deal which will continue to fund industrial baby body parts seller Planned Parenthood, thereby avoiding a government shutdown.\n\nRepublican leadership told voters they needed a majority in the House of Representatives in 2010, and a majority in the Senate in 2014 in order to effectively oppose Obama. Voters delivered in \u201ctidal wave\u201d elections, Cruz said. But now, nine months after the November election in which Republicans gained nine Senate seats, voters ask Cruz in town halls: \u201cWhat exactly have those Republican majorities accomplished?\u201d The spontaneous response to their own question is \u201cabsolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nBut Cruz said it\u2019s far worse than that. \u201cIt would have been better if the Republican majorities did \u2018absolutely nothing,'\u201d he said, but they took the lead in imposing the cromnibus, Obamacare, executive amnesty, continued funding of Planned Parenthood, and confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general \u2014 even after she promised to act as lawlessly as Eric Holder and to never oppose Obama.\n\n\u201cWe keep winning elections but the people we put in office don\u2019t do what they said they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Cruz said. GOP leadership is \u201cquite competent and willing to fight. The question is what they\u2019re fighting for.\u201d\n\nA list of major corporations\u2019 priorities would be identical to that of the GOP leadership\u2019s, Cruz said. Voters\u2019 are far, far down on the list. And defunding Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t among \u201cthe priorities of K Street,\u201d Cruz added.\n\nThe billionaires who fund Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t despise their base,\u201d Cruz said, unlike top GOP donors. \u201cThey don\u2019t despise the radical gay rights or radical environmental movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very large percentage of top donors actively despise our base\u2026 who voted you and me into office,\u201d Cruz continued. He added he\u2019s talked with many New York Republican donors who ask three questions: Do you support same-sex marriage? Are you pro-choice? Pro-amnesty? \u201cThe people writing the checks agree with the Democrats,\u201d Cruz said, and look down on the Republican base as \u201chicks and rubes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is why the Republican leadership likes show votes,\u201d Cruz said. But now, \u201cvoters understand difference between show votes and real votes.\u201d\n\nA restless base has sparked scorn and fear in the GOP establishment.\n\n\u201cNotice how much energy Majority Leader McConnell devotes to attacking conservatives? Notice how much energy Speaker Boehner devotes to attacking conservatives?\u201d Cruz said. Boehner denounced Cruz as one of the GOP\u2019s \u201cfalse prophets\u201d and a \u201cjackass\u201d on Sunday\u2019s Face The Nation. He\u2019s repeatedly and publicly mocked the same Tea Party voters who helped elect him and significant Republican majorities. His described his attitude towards dealing with conservatives as: \u201cGarbage men get used to the smell of bad garbage. Prisoners learn how to become prisoners, all right?\u201d\n\nBoehner is free to insult whomever he likes, Cruz said. But, he asked, \u201cWhere is that level of venom and animosity to President Obama and the Democrats? It\u2019s Republican leadership that leads the onslaught attacking conservatives.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News has dubbed the season of Washington Kabuki as \u201cFailure Theater\u201d during Boehner\u2019s embarrassing tenure as Speaker, during which he fought for the interests of the Chamber of Commerce and liberal GOP donors.\n\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
