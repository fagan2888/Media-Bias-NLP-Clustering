Why not? He\u2019d just finished taking his finals, and his University of Albany\u2019s lacrosse team had advanced to the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nEven though it was a little after 9:00p.m., the house echoed with the joyful noise of happy little ones at play. All of a sudden, Thompson let out an \u201coof,\u201d and the phone filled with a shriek that made him laugh. It didn\u2019t take much to visualize his daughters Godehoag, 4, and Ehwageyosta, 2, running around, glad to see that Daddy was home. There was a muffled discussion, then \u201chang on a second.\u201d When he came back to the conversation, he said, \u201cSorry about that, the little one\u2019s two now,\u201d and that pretty much covered it. \u201cWhat was the question again?\u201d\n\nHe has been interviewed by the New York Times, ESPN the Magazine, Lacrosse Magazine, and appeared on ESPN and ABC Tonight. Answering questions and talking about his place in the Creator\u2019s Game is now as natural for him as behind the back passes and highlight-reel goals.\n\nAnd, here he is going into his final NCAA Tournament with the Great Danes, hoping to win the national championship. \u201cI\u2019m not even thinking about [my] last game or when that might be,\u201d he told ICTMN. \u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of lacrosse to be played in my college career, and I\u2019m focused on doing whatever I have to do to win a national championship.\u201d\n\nThe Great Danes (16-2) will face No. 1 Notre Dame at Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver Saturday, May 16. It\u2019s the same quarterfinal match-up of a year ago, when the Irish won 14-13 victory in overtime. \u201cCoach (Scott Marr) has been stressing not to go into this game thinking about revenge,\u201d said Thompson, who is averaging a nation-leading 6.29 points a game with 48 goals and 59 assists this season. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on ourselves. What we gained from last year is that we need to finish. Last year, we had the game and we let it go. This year is about finishing every game and finishing every play.\u201d\n\nIn Albany\u2019s 19-10 over Cornell in the opening round of the NCAA playoffs last week, Thompson tied the Division I record in assists held by Tim Nelson, totaling 221 in his career, and surpassed the record of 354 career points held by former Cornell standout Rob Pannell with a total of 386.\n\nRELATED: Thompson Brothers Share LAX Tewaaraton Award, Make History...Again\n\nLyle Thompson Talks Great Danes 2015, Billy Mills and Wedding Bells\n\nAgainst Cornell, the 2014 co-Tewaaraton Award winner -- he was awarded the trophy with his brother, Miles Thompson -- had three goals and six assists for nine points, standing with 395 points in his career. This season, he has 116 points, the third-highest single season points mark in DI history behind his own 2014 mark of 128 and his brother\u2019s mark of 119.\n\nThompson was with the Iroquois Nationals last summer when they won the bronze medal in the World Championships in Denver.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lyle Thompson is going into his final NCAA Tournament with the University of Albany hoping to add national champion to the list of his accomplishments.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/13/ualbanys-lyle-thompson-ready-notre-dame-rematch-160345", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/lyle_thompson_6.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "UAlbany's Lyle Thompson Ready for Notre Dame Rematch"}, "abstract": "Lyle Thompson is going into his final NCAA Tournament with the University of Albany hoping to add national champion to the list of his accomplishments.", "dc": {"title": "UAlbany's Lyle Thompson Ready for Notre Dame Rematch"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/13/ualbanys-lyle-thompson-ready-notre-dame-rematch-160345", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Lyle Thompson, Great Danes, University of Albany, NCAA Tournament, Iroquois Nationals, Miles Thompson", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-05-13T10:58-04:00", "dcterms.title": "UAlbany's Lyle Thompson Ready for Notre Dame Rematch"}, "article_summary": "All of a sudden, Thompson let out an \u201coof,\u201d and the phone filled with a shriek that made him laugh.\nThis season, he has 116 points, the third-highest single season points mark in DI history behind his own 2014 mark of 128 and his brother\u2019s mark of 119.\nLyle Thompson sat in his off-campus house in upstate New York and let out a sigh of relief.\nThompson was with the Iroquois Nationals last summer when they won the bronze medal in the World Championships in Denver.\nEven though it was a little after 9:00p.m., the house echoed with the joyful noise of happy little ones at play."}
