Which GOP candidate can you imagine speaking at an RNC-sponsored LGBT gala?\n\nPresident Obama doesn\u2019t act like a lame duck. The night before addressing the UN General Assembly on global cooperation to counter extremists, Obama threw a few elbows at Republicans for their outdated ideas about LGBT rights. In a 20-minute speech to about 530 people at a Democratic National Committee gala in New York City on Sept. 27, Obama said, \u201cThe good news is they probably won\u2019t use marriage equality as a wedge issue [in 2016] like they did in 2004\u201d because \u201cthe country has come too far.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, without naming names, Obama alluded to GOP presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Ben Carson and ridiculed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2019s call to defy the Supreme Court on marriage equality:\n\n[Huckabee, though unnamed] says Americans should just disobey the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling entirely. I\u2019m sure he loves the Constitution \u2014 except for Article III. (Laughter and applause.) And maybe the Equal Protection Amendment. And 14th Amendment, generally. (Laughter.)\n\nObama was introduced by Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in last June\u2019s successful marriage equality lawsuit before the Supreme Court whom the president called a \u201ctrailblazer.\u201d Obama went on to say, \u201cWe now live in an America where our marriages are equal\u2026.Tonight we live in an America where \u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u2019 is something that \u2018don\u2019t exist.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe gala-goers, who paid between $1,200 and $33,400 for a seat at the DNC event at the Gotham Hall in mid-town Manhattan, also heard Obama talk about the success of his administration in creating 66 consecutive months of job gains in the private sector, significantly lowering the unemployment rate, and providing health insurance to 17 million Americans through the Affordable Care Act, the Gay City News reports.\n\nLGBT DNC donors were particularly interested Obama\u2019s remarks about religious liberty, which the right wing is trying to claim gives them a right to refuse to adhere to non-discrimination laws and policies protecting LGBT people and same sex couples. Obama said:\n\nWe affirm that we cherish our religious freedom and are profoundly respectful of religious traditions. But we also have to say clearly that our religious freedom doesn\u2019t grant us the freedom to deny our fellow Americans their constitutional rights. (Applause.) And that even as we are respectful and accommodating genuine concerns and interests of religious institutions, we need to reject politicians who are supporting new forms of discrimination as a way to scare up votes. (Applause.) That\u2019s not how we move America forward.\n\nHere are President Obama\u2019s remarks in full, via the White House:\n\nREMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT AT DNC LGBT GALA\n\nGotham Hall\n\nNew York, New York\n\n5:57 P.M. EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, New York! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Democrats! Thank you, New York! (Applause.) Thank you. Everybody, sit down. Obergefell. (Applause.) Just to be clear. It is good to be in New York. (Applause.) Although, I do apologize \u2014 this week is rough for you guys. (Laughter.) I mean, traffic is bad enough during UNGA, but you add the Pope to it \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 and that\u2019s serious traffic.\n\nGive it up for Betty Who! (Applause.) And give it up for Jim for not just the terrific introduction, but Jim represents all the trailblazers and pioneers and activists whose courage and persistence have made America a better place. Please give him a big round of applause. (Applause.) We\u2019re very proud of him.\n\nWe\u2019ve got some outstanding members of Congress and elected officials who are here tonight, including the chair of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. (Applause.) It is Debbie\u2019s birthday today. (Applause.) You threw her quite a party. We\u2019ve also got DNC treasurer, Andy Tobias. (Applause.) Senator Tammy Baldwin. (Applause.) New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is here. (Applause.) Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is here. (Applause.) And of course, all of you are here. (Applause.)\n\nSeven years ago we came together not just to elect a president, but to reaffirm our faith in that most American of ideals \u2014 the notion that people, no matter where they come from, what they look like, what their last name is, or who they love can change this country. (Applause.) And from the beginning, that faith was tested \u2014 by a Great Recession, by political obstruction, by established barriers and everyday indignities, all of which reminded us that our march toward equality was unfinished.\n\nAnd time after time, the cynics told us that we were foolish to keep believing, that we were na\u00efve to hope, that change was too messy or not possible at all. And if you admit it, there were some in this room here who were skeptical that everything that needed to happen would happen. The cynics were wrong. Tonight, we live in an America where \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d is something that \u201cdon\u2019t exist.\u201d (Applause.)\n\nWe live in an America where all of us \u2014 LGBT or not \u2014 are protected by a hate crimes law that bears Matthew Shepard\u2019s name. (Applause.) We live in an America where a growing share of older generations recognize that love is love, and younger generations don\u2019t even know what all the fuss was about. (Applause.) And tonight, thanks to the unbending sense of justice passed down through generations of citizens who never gave up hope that we could bring this country closer to our founding ideals \u2014 that all of us are created equal \u2014 we now live in America where our marriages are equal as well. (Applause.)\n\nIt\u2019s getting better for all of us. Our businesses have created 13 million new jobs in the past five and half years. (Applause.) In 2012, the Republican nominee for this office promised to get the unemployment rate down to 6 percent by the end of next year. (Laughter.) We moved that up a little bit and got it down to 5 percent right now. (Applause.) We were told that Obamacare would kill jobs, explode the deficits, destroy freedom. Today, we\u2019ve seen 66 consecutive months of private sector job growth \u2014 (applause) \u2014 a streak that just happened to begin the month I signed Obamacare into law. (Applause.) Meanwhile, we\u2019ve cut our deficit by two-thirds, and over 17 million Americans have health insurance because of Obamacare. (Applause.) And along with the 17 million who\u2019ve got health insurance through Obamacare, there are tens of millions more \u2014 all of you if you\u2019ve got health insurance \u2014 who now know that in this country, you can\u2019t be discriminated against just because you get sick. (Applause.) Those days are in the past.\n\nReading scores are up. College attendance is up. High school graduations are up. We\u2019ve doubled the production of clean energy. We are making incredible progress when it comes to climate change. (Applause.) On every metric, by every standard, we\u2019ve made progress.\n\nNow, you would not know this \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 if you were listening to the busload of Republicans fighting each other for this job. (Laughter.) It somehow doesn\u2019t come up in debate. (Laughter.) In their world, everything was terrific back in 2008 \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 when we were in the midst of a spiral into the worst financial crisis and economic crisis since the Great Depression, when unemployment and uninsured rates were rising and when our economy was shedding jobs each month, and we were mired in two wars, hopelessly addicted to foreign oil, and bin Laden was still at large. Those were the Golden Years, apparently. (Laughter.) And then, I came in and messed it all up. (Applause.)\n\nI have to say, I don\u2019t pay attention to much of this stuff. (Laughter.) But you got to give these folks credit for chutzpah. (Laughter.) I mean, they maintain a straight face when they\u2019re saying this. And then, in interviews, the reporters are, like, just kind of letting them talk as if what they were saying was true. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd so since everything was doing so well back in 2007-2008, now if we can just repeal Obamacare, and gut Wall Street reform, and shut down our government over women\u2019s access to health care, and deny that the planet is getting warmer, they\u2019ve got a plan to get us back on track. (Laughter.)\n\nNow, the good news is they probably won\u2019t use marriage equality as a wedge issue like they did in 2004 because the country has come too far. (Applause.) In fact, America has left the leaders of the Republican Party behind. One of their leading candidates argued that going to prison turns you gay. (Laughter.) Well, you think I\u2019m \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t go into this? (Laughter.) No, I mean, I\u2019m just stating the facts. Another candidate boasts that he introduced an amendment to end nationwide marriage equality \u2014 which isn\u2019t even an accomplishment at all. (Laughter and applause.) A third says Americans should just disobey the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling entirely. I\u2019m sure he loves the Constitution \u2014 except for Article III. (Laughter and applause.) And maybe the Equal Protection Amendment. And 14th Amendment, generally. (Laughter.)\n\nNow, look, for some Americans, there\u2019s no doubt that this change has been a world-wind. And we believe that these changes have been for the better. But we have to recognize \u2014 and in fact, I know the people in this room do because they felt it in their own family sometimes, or in the workplace \u2014 that with change, with any progress, comes some unease. And as Americans, I think we have to acknowledge that. I think that it\u2019s important for us to recognize that there are still parts of the country that are getting there, but it\u2019s going to take some time.\n\nWe affirm that we cherish our religious freedom and are profoundly respectful of religious traditions. But we also have to say clearly that our religious freedom doesn\u2019t grant us the freedom to deny our fellow Americans their constitutional rights. (Applause.) And that even as we are respectful and accommodating genuine concerns and interests of religious institutions, we need to reject politicians who are supporting new forms of discrimination as a way to scare up votes. (Applause.) That\u2019s not how we move America forward.\n\nSo to secure the gains this country has made requires continued vigilance, not complacency. This country has come too far, and people of goodwill in both political parties are too plentiful to turn back now. We\u2019ve made sure that federal contractors can\u2019t fire a worker just for being gay. (Applause.) We should make sure that no American lives in fear of being fired just because of who they love. (Applause.) We\u2019ve come a long way in changing hearts and minds so that trans men and women can be who they are \u2014 not just on magazine covers, but in workplaces and schools and communities. (Applause.) And to build on that progress, we should support efforts to ban so-called \u201cconversion therapy\u201d for minors. (Applause.)\n\nSo we\u2019ve got to keep striving every day to treat each other the way I believe God sees us, as equal in His eyes.\n\nHarvey Milk once said, \u201cIf a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.\u201d But to those of us who\u2019ve made it through those doors, we\u2019ve got a unique obligation to reach back and make sure other people can make it through those doors, too. (Applause.) We have a responsibility to stand up to bigotry \u2014 not just against us, but against anybody, anywhere. (Applause.) We have a responsibility to stand up for freedom \u2014 not just our own freedom, but for everybody\u2019s freedom. (Applause.) We speak up to condemn hatred against anybody \u2014 gay or straight, black or white, Christian, Muslim, Jew, non-believer, immigrant \u2014 (applause) \u2014 because we remember what silence felt like when hatred was directed at us, and we\u2019ve got to be champions on behalf of justice for everybody, not just our own. (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s what makes us human. And that\u2019s America at its best \u2014 our ability to connect, our ability to see ourselves in somebody else. To be an ally to the marginalized, to the dispossessed, to the discriminated against. To recognize our joy and our struggles and our fears and our hope and our love in somebody else.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the trans activist demanding dignity. Maybe it\u2019s the immigrant hoping to contribute, or the middle-class kid struggling to pay for college. Maybe it\u2019s the woman denied equal pay, the African-American denied the right to vote, the worker denied a living wage. Their stories may not be ours, but surely we can see our stories in theirs. We can make their fight our own.\n\nAnd in the end, that\u2019s what makes me proudest to be a Democrat. (Applause.) I think we\u2019re right on most policy issues. I think that we have the better argument in economics and foreign affairs. But at the core of this party today as it\u2019s currently constituted \u2014 and we have to remind ourselves that it hasn\u2019t always been that way. There have been times where the Democratic Party stood in the way of progress. And there have been times where Republicans, like Abraham Lincoln and Everett Dirksen, stood on the right side of change.\n\nRight now, what makes me proudest about being a Democrat is, is that at our core, we really do believe in everybody having a shot. At our core, we really do believe that that\u2019s not just a theoretical assertion, but it\u2019s an obligation. It compels us. It\u2019s part of one American family \u2014 to fight on behalf of those who haven\u2019t had the same kind of chances that we do. To make sure that everybody has dignity and respect, and that every kid out there is able to live out their dreams.\n\nWe mean it when we say that all are created equal. And we understand that that has to be operative in our own individual lives, but we also have to express it through the common enterprise called government. We mean it when we say that in this country, of all countries, everyone deserves an equal shot.\n\nAnd so, Democrats, over the next 14 months, we have to work even harder than we did when I was first on the ballot. We\u2019re going to have to work harder to protect the gains that we\u2019ve made. We\u2019re going to have to work harder to widen the circle of opportunity for all who strive for it. It will not be easy. There\u2019s always a contest in this country since its founding between hope and fear. What makes America special is, is that though sometimes we zig and zag, eventually hope wins out. But it only wins out because folks like you put your shoulder behind the wheel and push it in that direction.\n\nThat was true in the past. That will be true in the future. I look forward to working with you to make sure it happens in this election cycle.\n\nThank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.) Thank you. (Applause.)\n\nEND 6:19 P.M.
