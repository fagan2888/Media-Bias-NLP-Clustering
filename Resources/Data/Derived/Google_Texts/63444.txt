All in all, there are about 76 million baby boomers in the U.S. today. And the Census Bureau estimates that that 61 million will be around when the youngest boomers hit 65 in 2029.

There’s one thing these baby boomers can’t avoid — going from ‘boomers,’ to ‘elderly.’

Healthcare will never be the same and it’s going to be the best drug companies, insurers and suppliers and distributors that will be the next great growth stocks for the next two decades.

According to the American Hospital Association, more than 37 million boomers will be managing more than one chronic condition by 2030, with one out of four, or 14 million, living with diabetes; almost half will be living with arthritis and more than one-third, or over 21 million, will be classified as obese and living with all the health risks associated with obesity.

If you think Obamacare has changed the face of healthcare, you ain’t seen nothing yet.

These seven large-cap healthcare companies are already dominating their sectors and should continue their leadership well into the next decade.
