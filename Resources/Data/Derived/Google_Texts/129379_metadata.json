It\u2019s very difficult if a whole department has to go away because it\u2019s not part of the proper role of government.\u201d\n\nDuring his time in the state legislature, Beason was no stranger to fighting tax hikes. In 2011, then-Senator Beason blocked Jefferson County from passing an amendment to the state constitution re-establishing an occupational tax.\n\n\u201cThey told me it was going to shut down the county government, but I just went and got my tag renewed last week and they\u2019re still alive and kicking,\u201d Beason said Wednesday.\n\n(More after the photo)\n\n\n\nAs policy advisor with AFMA, Beason\u2019s sights aren\u2019t only set on what\u2019s happening on the state level.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things coming down from the federal government, regulations on business are growing every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that every business owner probably violates some federal law or regulation every day because they don\u2019t even know it exists is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBetween EPA regulations and other increased regulatory burdens on business owners, Beason warns that what happens at the federal level won\u2019t only make life more difficult and expensive for business owners, it will have a significant impact on consumers, too.\n\n\u201cThese things are a real risk. It\u2019s not just causing the utility company to pay more, it\u2019s causing you and I to pay more. Even though the federal government thinks it can hide it in your power bill, it\u2019s still a tax increase.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Yellowhammer named AFMA one of its top 5 conservative groups in the state.\n\nAFMA Chairman Paul Reynolds is also Alabama\u2019s National Committeeman on the Republican National Committee. Back here at home, Reynold\u2019s group fills a void for Alabama conservatives looking for content online, especially on Facebook where the group has over 13,000 \u201clikes\u201d and posts a steady stream of infographics and articles. Article titles that will give you a sense of what to expect from AFMA include, \u201cObamaCare regulations are 8 times longer than the Bible,\u201d \u201cAttention Alabama AARP: stop pushing Obama\u2019s environmental agenda,\u201d and \u201cStop promoting ObamaCare in Alabama\u2019s schools.\u201d AFMA publishes a \u201cWatch List,\u201d that is somewhat of a counter to the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201cHate list.\u201d Groups who made the AFMA Watch List include the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Alabama Association for Justice, Alabama Arise and the Alabama Environmental Council.\n\nBeason plans on working with AFMA to make Alabama a more business-friendly and economically free state. He envisions making economic policy so easily understood that it becomes a part of every day conversations.\n\nBut his first undertaking is getting as many people as possible to sign the BentleyTaxHike.com petition.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you build a society that\u2019s plugged in and knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nLike this article?
