Jeanne Shaheen in a TV ad of \u201cprofiting from her votes in Congress.\u201d But the scandal is how the group distorts the facts.\n\nThe ad says that \u201cShaheen\u2019s wealth has surged while in public office,\u201d but her family\u2019s estimated net worth has actually declined since she took office in January 2009.\n\nThere is also less than meets the eye to the ad\u2019s claims about \u201ca shady stock deal and a conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nThe claim about \u201cvotes\u201d that supposedly enriched her family refers to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \u2014 a stimulus plan that was backed by all Senate Democrats. After the plan became law, the National Science Foundation awarded a stimulus grant of less than $78,000 to Ultrawave Labs for breast cancer research. Shaheen\u2019s husband, William, was an adviser to the company at the time and held stock options worth between $1,001 and $15,000. But the Shaheen campaign says the option expired and the family did not earn a profit.\n\nHas Shaheen\u2019s Wealth \u2018Surged\u2019?\n\nThe ad, titled \u201cCronyism,\u201d is the work of Ending Spending Action Fund, a conservative super PAC headed by businessman Joe Ricketts, the founder of a company now known as TD Ameritrade. It began airing Aug. 26 and immediately came under attack from campaign lawyers for the New Hampshire Democratic senator, who is running this fall against former Sen. Scott Brown. An NBC affiliate in Boston asked the group to change it after the Shaheen campaign complained.\n\nBrian Baker, the super PAC\u2019s president and general counsel, told us in an email that the group will not change the voice-over but it will add one additional citation to the ad. Baker told us the ad is \u201c100% accurate and truthful and fully supported by the back-up,\u201d which he provided to us.\n\nThe ad begins by saying, \u201cNew Hampshire families have struggled \u2026 but official records show Shaheen\u2019s wealth has surged while in public office.\u201d Shaheen joined the Senate in January 2009.\n\nThe super PAC\u2019s backup material says that the Shaheen family\u2019s estimated net worth has increased from $3.4 million in 2008 to $5.4 million in 2012, citing an analysis by opensecrets.org of personal financial disclosure statements that are filed annually by members of Congress.\n\nBut that ignores the senator\u2019s latest report filed in May 2013. That report shows her estimated net worth \u2014 as calculated by opensecret.org\u2019s method \u2014 was $2.7 million in 2013, down 21 percent from $3.4 million in 2008.\n\nPersonal financial disclosure reports do not provide precise amounts, but rather ranges \u2014 such as $0-$1,000; $1,001-$15,000; $15,001-$50,000; $50,001-$100,000; $100,001-$250,000; $250,001-500,000; $500,001-$1,000,000. Opensecrets.org defines \u201cnet worth\u201d as \u201cthe average of the maximum debt figure subtracted from the maximum asset figure and the minimum debt figure subtracted from the minimum asset figure.\u201d\n\nThe 2008 report showed her family\u2019s assets ranged from $2,944,938 to $6,077,918, while her liabilities ranged from $650,005 to $1,500,000. By opensecrets.org\u2019s calculation that results in a net worth in the range of $4,577,918 to $2,294,933 \u2014 which averages to $3.4 million.\n\nFor 2013, her family\u2019s assets ranged from $3,746,028 to $7,892,000, while her liabilities ranged from $2,030,012 to $4,200,000, based on our analysis of the 2013 report. Shaheen\u2019s net worth ranged between $1,716,016 and $3,692,000 \u2014 which averages to a net worth of $2.7 million, using the opensecrets.org method of calculating average net worth.\n\nIn an Aug. 27 Associated Press article, the lawyers for Ending Spending took a different approach to determining Shaheen\u2019s wealth than the one presented in the group\u2019s backup document. \u201cEnding Spending\u2019s lawyers said that Shaheen shouldn\u2019t be allowed to count debts, such as 10 mortgages included in her 2013 financial disclosure,\u201d AP wrote. \u201cOnly her assets should be considered, no matter how much they are mortgaged.\u201d\n\nThe personal disclosure reports do show that the range of the Shaheen family\u2019s gross assets have increased, from somewhere between $3 million to $6 million in 2008 to $3.7 million to $7.9 million in 2013. But so have the family\u2019s liabilities, which is why it has a lower net worth.\n\nA \u2018Shady\u2019 Deal?\n\nThe ad then goes on to tie Shaheen\u2019s wealth to her votes in Congress without sufficient evidence.\n\n\u201cNews reports raise questions about Shaheen\u2019s family profiting from her votes in Congress, a shady stock deal and a conflict of interest,\u201d the ad says. \u201cLike Shaheen\u2019s vote for Washington\u2019s failed stimulus, which gave taxpayer dollars to a company financially tied to her family.\u201d\n\nAll of these claims stem from a June 24 article in the Boston Globe that focused in large part on a relatively small financial stake that the senator\u2019s husband had in Ultrawave Labs, a California-based start-up that is seeking to develop a high-resolution, cost-effective breast imaging system to detect breast cancer.\n\nThe Globe said that in 2009 her husband became an adviser in the company and acquired stock options in the firm worth between $1,001 and $15,000. The company that year received $77,715 in federal stimulus money from the National Science Foundation \u201cto fund research in a novel medical imaging technology.\u201d\n\nShaheen, of course, voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which gained final Senate approval on Feb. 13, 2009, in a 60-38 vote. That was the bare minimum of votes needed to pass the legislation. All 55 Democratic senators present that day voted for the bill, along with two independents and three Republicans.\n\nThe Globe and Ending Spending do not provide any evidence that Shaheen voted for the stimulus to benefit her family. The $77,715 project \u2014 a rounding error in a bill worth $816 billion \u2014 was not earmarked in the legislation at the time of her vote. The NSF awarded the contract on June 6, 2009 \u2014 about four months after the Senate\u2019s final vote.\n\nThe ad, again quoting from the Globe, goes on to say, \u201cThe Shaheen family law firm even tried to profit by helping clients \u2018grab a share\u2019 of taxpayer money designed to help \u2018jump-start\u2019 our ailing economy.\u201d\n\nThe Globe article said that her husband\u2019s law firm, Shaheen & Gordon, had \u201ca government relations arm and set up a \u2018stimulus opportunities team\u2019 in 2009 to help clients grab a share of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed that year to help jump-start the economy.\u201d However, as the Globe also noted, the stimulus team was a failure.\n\n\u201cThe firm, in a statement released by the campaign, said the stimulus practice was short-lived, had no clients, and that William Shaheen was not involved in it,\u201d the Globe wrote.\n\nOne last thing about Ultrawave Labs, and that\u2019s the claim in the ad that \u201cShaheen\u2019s family got stock options, then failed to properly report them, raising ethical questions.\u201d That, too, is a distortion of the facts.\n\nShaheen did properly report the stock options. The senator\u2019s report covering financial activity in 2009 lists stock options in Ultrawave Labs valued between $1,001 and $15,000, and the transaction date as Nov. 16, 2009.\n\nWhen the ad says that the family \u201cfailed to properly report them,\u201d it is actually talking about the senator\u2019s failure to report that the stock option turned out to be worthless.\n\nEnding Spending cited a June 27 story in the conservative Washington Free Beacon that carried the headline, \u201cShaheen to Amend Financial Disclosure After Accusations of Shady Stock Deal.\u201d The article said, \u201cPersonal disclosure reports filed by Shaheen in May still listed the stocks as assets and also say they are not scheduled to expire on Sep. 1, 2019. However, the Shaheen campaign says those stocks have in fact expired. A Shaheen spokesperson told a Concord Monitor reporter Thursday that Shaheen will amend her financial disclosure statement to correct the information.\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s 2013 report lists the value of the stock options as \u201cNone (or less than $1,001).\u201d\n\nOther Claims\n\nThe ad contrasts the Shaheen family\u2019s wealth with New Hampshire families struggling since she took office. The ad says, \u201cGas prices doubled, higher health care costs, higher taxes, record national debt.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the federal debt owed to the public has increased steadily since 2009. It now stands at $12.7 trillion. It is also accurate that some taxes have gone up for higher-income Americans as a result of the bipartisan \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d package that Congress passed on New Year\u2019s Day 2013 and the Affordable Care Act. Shaheen voted for both.\n\nGasoline prices have doubled, too, so that\u2019s accurate \u2014 as far as it goes. When Shaheen took office in January 2009, the average retail price of all grades of gasoline sold in New England was $1.81 per gallon. In August, it was nearly $3.68 \u2013 slightly more than double, according to the Energy Information Administration data cited by Ending Spending.\n\nBut as we have noted in \u201cObama\u2019s Numbers,\u201d our quarterly reports on key statistical indicators during the Obama administration, the price of gasoline dropped dramatically in late 2008 and early 2009 due to a worldwide recession that had reduced demand. The $3.68 per gallon in August is well below the record for New England of $4.14 set in July 2008, which was before Shaheen took office.\n\nIt\u2019s also questionable to blame Shaheen \u2014 or any single member of Congress \u2014 for the cost of gasoline given that the price for a barrel of oil is set on world markets. She\u2019s no more responsible for gasoline prices than she is for the sharp rise in U.S. domestic oil production that has happened during her time in office. In 2013, U.S. crude oil production reached a 24-year high and net imports dropped to their lowest level since 1996, as the EIA reported in March.\n\nEnding Spending also provided thin evidence for the claim that there are \u201chigher health care costs\u201d in New Hampshire.\n\nThe super PAC cited a Dec. 18, 2013, article by the Concord Monitor on a state Insurance Department report on 2012 health insurance rates. The article said that \u201cpremiums increased only about 1 percent in 2012, down from a 3.8 percent increase in 2011.\u201d That slight increase occurred before the federal and state health insurance exchanges opened in the fall of 2013, so it wasn\u2019t related to the mandated changes in policies that took effect this year.\n\nAs for the cost of health care premiums after the law took effect, the PAC provided an Associated Press article dated Sept. 25, 2013, that said the premium for \u201ca mid-range benchmark plan in New Hampshire will average $360 a month for an individual, slightly higher than the national average.\u201d The article was based on an analysis by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. The AP did not say whether rates have gone up or down compared with the previous year.\n\nThe article did say, however, that the $360 state average was before federal subsidies. Subsidies could cut costs to $94 for 27-year-old males making $25,000 per year, according to the article.\n\nThe super PAC also points to a preliminary analysis of 2015 state Insurance Department rate request filings for health insurance plans on the individual market. But the analysis \u2014 which was conducted by Pricewaterhouse Coopers Health Research Institute \u2014 comes with many caveats. It said it had only \u201climited information\u201d on New Hampshire, as of Aug. 15. The institute gives a proposed 15 percent rate increase for New Hampshire in 2015, but that is based on only one insurance carrier.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was the only insurer to offer health plans in New Hampshire on the state exchange in its first year. The state Department of Insurance said in a June 2 press release that it will have four carriers in 2015.\n\nIn addition to Anthem, Assurant Health, Harvard Pilgrim and Minuteman Health have announced plans to sell health insurance on the exchange, the state says. \u201cHaving a larger number of carriers will give consumers many more choices in terms of cost, plan design, and provider network,\u201d the department said in its press release.\n\nOther caveats: The proposed rates do not include federal subsidies, which will help reduce the cost for some, and the proposed rates must be approved by state regulators.\n\n\u201cRegulators in most states haven\u2019t yet reviewed these proposed rate increases, as they do those variations will likely shrink,\u201d the institute says.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 29: Ending Spending changed the 30-second version of this TV ad to identify the Center for Responsive Politics as the source of the screen text that reads \u201cShaheen\u2019s wealth has surged while in public office.\u201d The center operates opensecrets.org. Baker, the super PAC\u2019s president and general counsel, told us that Ending Spending did not change that same image in the 60-second version of the ad, which is the version that we write about here.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ce2\"", "article_summary": "Shaheen\u2019s net worth ranged between $1,716,016 and $3,692,000 \u2014 which averages to a net worth of $2.7 million, using the opensecrets.org method of calculating average net worth.\nBut so have the family\u2019s liabilities, which is why it has a lower net worth.\nBy opensecrets.org\u2019s calculation that results in a net worth in the range of $4,577,918 to $2,294,933 \u2014 which averages to $3.4 million.\nThe ad says that \u201cShaheen\u2019s wealth has surged while in public office,\u201d but her family\u2019s estimated net worth has actually declined since she took office in January 2009.\nThe ad begins by saying, \u201cNew Hampshire families have struggled \u2026 but official records show Shaheen\u2019s wealth has surged while in public office.\u201d Shaheen joined the Senate in January 2009."}
