That\u2019s well below today\u2019s top rates of 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%.\n\nMuch bigger standard deduction: Trump would also increase the standard deduction to $25,000 for single filers and $50,000 for married couples. That\u2019s about four times higher than the current one.\n\nLimit value of itemized deductions: Most filers would choose the extra-large standard deduction under Trump\u2019s plan. But those who still choose to itemize would be limited in how much of a deduction they could claim. The only deductions not subject to the limitation would be the mortgage interest deduction and charitable contributions.\n\nSame investment tax rates: Trump would continue to offer today\u2019s preferential income-based tax rates rates of 0, 15%, and 20% on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.\n\nSeveral taxes eliminated: Trump would repeal the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, and the 3.8% surtax on investment income created under Obamacare.\n\nTax cuts for all, but a boon for the rich\n\nThe Tax Policy Center analysis estimates that Trump\u2019s tax plan would cut taxes for everyone.\n\nBut the biggest tax benefit by far would go to the very wealthiest households.\n\nMiddle-income households would see their taxes cut by an average of $2,700, or 4.9% of after-tax income. Those in the top 0.1%, however, would see their taxes reduced by an average of $1.3 million, or 19% of their after-tax-income.\n\nAnd contrary to Trump\u2019s assertions that he would crack down on investment fund managers who benefit from a very low tax rate on some of their income today, the Tax Policy Center found those managers could see a windfall under Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign never responded to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s questions about his proposals. But the think tank said when it had to fill in the blanks by making assumptions about Trump\u2019s intentions, it chose those that would minimize the benefits to high-income households as well as the plan\u2019s potential revenue loss. In other words, it gave Trump\u2019s plan the benefit of the doubt.\n\nA serious deficit buster\n\nThe analysis estimates that Trump\u2019s tax plan would increase deficits by at least $9.5 trillion over a decade and by another $15 trillion in the second decade.\n\nThose figures don\u2019t include the interest costs that would be incurred if the government borrowed money to make up the difference. Interest could add several more trillion dollars to the debt.\n\nAnd all that additional debt could negate the positive economic effects of lowering rates, such as boosting incentives to work, save and invest.\n\nTo support those potentially good effects, the revenue loss from Trump\u2019s tax plan would have to be counteracted by spending cuts. Really, really big, unprecedented spending cuts.\n\nJust in 2025 alone, the Tax Policy Center estimates that federal spending would need to be cut by at least 20%. That would amount to more than 100% of defense spending, or 82% of domestic program spending, or 41% of Medicare and Social Security spending.\n\nBut here\u2019s another thing: Trump on several occasions has said he wouldn\u2019t touch Medicare and Social Security.\n\nSo that would mean he\u2019d need to cut vast amounts of defense and domestic spending combined, which would likely be intolerable politically and practically.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the Tax Policy Center analysis, a Trump campaign spokesperson said, \u201cThe policy speaks for itself and many experts, including Larry Kudlow, have praised the plan since its release in September.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK (Dec. 22, 2015) -- When Donald Trump put out his four-page tax plan in September, he said it wouldn't increase deficits.
