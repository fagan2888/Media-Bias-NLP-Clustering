We have always had a broadly conservative party in our politics, a broadly progressive party. They have always been at each other\u2019s throats, and it\u2019s easy to just assume that that is what our political discourse looks like.\n\nThis book says, rather than take it for granted, let\u2019s think about what it is, and where it comes from and why. And one good way to do that is to think about the first real instance of the recognizable left-right divide, which we find in an intense ideological debate that was taking place in Britain and in America at the end of the 18th century, in a period that we identify with the American Revolution and the French Revolution.\n\nBut it was also about a struggle to define the free society, a struggle about the tension between progress and tradition that is still very much with us, but that can be difficult to discern beneath the intense debates about particular policy questions that our politics are about.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Why this debate, though, this particular \u2014 there were others who were writing\u2026\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: \u2026 who were thinking. Why these two men, Burke and Paine.\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: In a way, the back looks at the broader debate that gripped Anglo-American politics at the time by looking through the eyes of these two very prominent and very interesting participants in the debate.\n\nEdmund Burke is thought of as one of the fathers of modern conservatism. Thomas Paine is one of the fathers of modern radicalism. And they engaged one another. The important thing about it for seeing it as a debate is, they were contemporaries, they knew each other, they exchanged letters, and, especially importantly, they exchanged public writings, essays that tried to answer one another.\n\nSo, it is a real debate. They ask questions and answer questions. And they get to something like the bottom of what the real differences are between an outlook that we would now identify with the left and with the right.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it\u2019s unfair to ask you this because you spend the entire book, over 200 pages, looking at it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But \u2014 but if you had to boil it down, what would you say is the essence of the disagreement?\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes. Yes.\n\nOne way to think about the essence is, you start out looking at a world that is filled with both successes and failures, good and bad things. Are you struck first by what is working and you want to build on that and are grateful for it, or are you struck first by what is failing and are outraged by it and want to uproot it and try to start over?\n\nBurke and a lot of conservatives after him is first struck by what is working, because he begins with very low expectations of human beings. He thinks we\u2019re fallen creatures, we\u2019re very limited in our abilities. And so he\u2019s amazed by anything that works at all, and wants to build on it, rather than try to uproot society and fix problems in a radical way.\n\nPaine thinks, there is no excuse for failure, things should work better, and that means that, when we see a society in which injustice reigns, we have to start from scratch and in a radical way change things.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Of course, today\u2019s conservatives, in many ways, the shoe is on the other foot\u2026\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: \u2026 because they look at what is going on and they want to make some radical changes.\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: They think government has gotten too big in this country.\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And they want to do some radical things to change it.\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: In a lot of ways, that\u2019s true. And the book gets at that as well.\n\nSo one way to understand that is a lot of the differences between left and right now are disagreements about the liberal welfare state, about a set of governing institutions established in America in the middle of the 20th century that themselves embody a certain kind of liberal outlook.\n\nThey exist in pursuit of an egalitarian ideal, and they try to achieve it by applying technical knowledge to society, by empowering experts. And one of the big differences between Burke and Paine is the difference about what kind of knowledge is really available to us to solve social problems.\n\nPaine says society should seek to apply scientific knowledge, technical knowledge to address our problems. Burke says society is much too complicated to be amenable to those kinds of technical solutions, and instead we should try to use social knowledge, dispersed knowledge that we can really only access through the institutions that exist between the individual and the state, the families, civil society, markets, to try to make the best of knowledge that society as a whole possesses, rather than any specific group of experts.\n\nThat difference about what kind of knowledge we can have is really crucial to a lot of disagreements between left and right, especially economic disagreements. It\u2019s absolutely at the heart of the health care debate, for example.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think that holds \u2014 that is a dispute that holds up today, with all that we have learned, with all that\u2019s changed in the political system?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes.\n\nThere\u2019s still a basic disagreement about whether you solve social problems by using dispersed knowledge, by using markets to gather up people\u2019s preferences and knowledge, or whether you solve it by putting the right experts in charge and giving them the power to make their expertise matter.\n\nI think, if you think about the left and right in the health care debate, that is a big part of the difference between how conservatives and liberals want to solve the problems we have.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Of course, what we\u2019re looking at today, though, is in many instances, the two sides have disagreed, not just over health care, they have disagreed over economic policy, over immigration policy.\n\nAnd the result has been they fail to come together at all, to even engage in a debate. They just \u2014 we end up having dysfunction, gridlock, whatever word you want to use.\n\nWhat would Paine and Burke think about that?\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: There\u2019s a lot of truth to that.\n\nAnd it is one reason to write a book like this now. We live in a moment now where the two parties are ideologically coherent in a way that they haven\u2019t been in a long time. We really have not only a Republican and Democratic Party, but a conservative and liberal party. Our parties used to be divided along regional lines or over specific issues like race.\n\nNow Democrats are more liberal than they have been in a very long time, Republicans are more conservative than they have been in a very long time. And I think we can learn from the Burke-Paine debate what an actual constructive debate between left and right looks like.\n\nOne thing conservatives could learn is Burke\u2019s disposition to policy. That is, conservatives, he says, should want to solve public problems before they get so big that they invite more radical solutions. So, he was a reformer. He wanted to be engaged in governing, in a way that today\u2019s right doesn\u2019t do enough of.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And you\u2019re saying they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not \u2014 they haven\u2019t done that?\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes. There is a kind of recoil from the particulars of governing, from policy, in a lot of the rhetoric on the right. And they would do well to think about policy.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And what about on the left?\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: I think the left could learn from Thomas Paine that the greatest oppressors of the poor and the weak in human history have been their governments. This was a strongly held view of Paine\u2019s. He was worried about the dangers of public power.\n\nAnd I think the left in America today as much too cavalier about consolidating power and expanding the power of the government. And they could learn the essential importance of limiting, constraining, channeling that power for the very purposes that they want to serve through politics.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say \u2014 what do you say, Yuval Levin, to people who \u2014 this is all very interesting, and it\u2019s important and it\u2019s important to know about history\u2026\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: \u2026 but today we have problems that are \u2014 that affect real people\u2019s lives, whether it\u2019s immigration policy, and what happens to people who are suffering, whether it\u2019s health care, budget decisions\u2026\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: \u2026 that \u2014 that what you have done is interesting, but it doesn\u2019t really apply to what we\u2019re dealing with now?\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Yes.\n\nWell, one of the reasons to look to history when you think about public policy is that our society in a certain sense has always been arguing about the same kinds of questions. What does it mean to be a free society? How do we find a balance between order and liberty, between progress and tradition? We still face those questions now.\n\nAnd so the way that they have been faced by very wise people in the past can be helpful. And not only that, but you can learn about how to \u2014 about the roots of your own beliefs and your own arguments by looking at history in ways that are difficult to do in the intensity of the moment now. So to can help calm down our disagreements a little bit and let us think about what it is we are actually disagreeing about.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And still stay connected to the human beings whose those policies affect?\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Exactly. Politics is always about reality. It\u2019s always about people. It\u2019s always about solving problems. It can\u2019t be understood as a pure abstraction, as philosophy. It\u2019s not philosophy.\n\nBut it has to be informed by world views that have to do with what we want our society to be.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Yuval Levin, the book is \u201cThe Great Debate: Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, and the Birth of Right and Left.\u201d\n\nThank you very much.\n\nYUVAL LEVIN: Thank you very much.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How and where did partisanship -- now prevalent in American politics -- originate?
