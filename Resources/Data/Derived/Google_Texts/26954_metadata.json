Or a readmission could be representative of a low-quality outcome, because the readmission was due to a lower standard of care. It also potentially could be linked to other factors, such as the patient's lack of access to a primary-care physician, the study authors suggest.\n\n\u201cPredicting readmissions is notoriously difficult,\u201d they write. More research is needed to understand if simply allowing the additional readmission to occur might lead to less-costly overall care, they said.\n\n\n\nA safety-net hospital was defined in the study as those whose percentage of Medicare disproportionate-share patients fell within the highest quartile, which the authors say indicates the hospital cared for more low-income patients relative to other hospitals in the same geographic region.\n\n\n\nOf the 242 hospitals analyzed, 60 were defined as safety net. To make the comparison, researchers used data from the 2013 Medicare Impact File; a CMS list of hospitals that received Medicare payments in March 2013; Hospital Compare data from 2011; the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development; and data on hospital referral regions from the Dartmouth Institute.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Are all 30-day readmissions really a bad thing?
