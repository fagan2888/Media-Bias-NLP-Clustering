“We already have Zika in the United States. But it is travel related,” said Dr Fauci, speaking in a television interview on Sunday.

“The concern is that we will have local transmission; in other words, people who get infected in the United States, get bitten by a mosquito, but who have never left the continental United States.

“We fully expect that that will happen as we get to the more robust mosquito season in the next month or so.”

Dr Fauci said that the disease’s arrival was inevitable, so the priority should be in limiting mosquito breeding grounds and installing screens in homes.

“We need to make sure that those local outbreaks don’t become sustained and don’t become disseminated,” he said. “That’s the reason why we need to have a very, very forceful preparation right now before that happens.”

Zika is transmitted via mosquitos and, it is now known, sexual contact. While most people develop a fever which passes quickly, pregnant women have given birth to babies suffering from severe brain damage. In some cases adults have also become paralysed from the virus.
