What does it take to get\u2014I mean, a lot of you guys have been here for a number of years and I see you all kind of stand over here, have to get quarantined and roped off, but then I see a certain media member that has all access out there on the field. I noticed he had a very tight shirt on today. Is that why he gets the all access (laughing)?\n\n\u201c[Mike] Klis, I don\u2019t want to see you in a tight shirt, but that might be what it takes to get out there. I didn\u2019t mention Jay Glazer, but maybe that\u2019s who I was talking about. I mean, all-access, gets to ride with the head coach, so I think it\u2019s the tight shirt. That was a boys small today. Maybe think about that if you want more access until then I guess you are all going to be over here in your little quarantine. I have nothing to do with the all access thing. Like I said, I think it\u2019s the boy medium who\u2019s wearing the small.\n\n\u201cLast thing, I know you wanted to know the ball security thing. Did [Head Coach John Fox] give the answer?\n\nMedia: \u201cSame as the green he said.\u201d\n\nManning: \u201cIt\u2019s a different color because of training camp, does that make any sense?\u201d\n\nMedia: \u201cSo will it be green for the regular season?\u201d\n\nManning: \u201cIt won\u2019t be blue during the regular season, but it\u2019s training camp. What color are they during training camp?\u201d\n\nMedia: \u201cBlue ball.\u201d\n\nManning: \u201cThere it is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,media,Peyton Manning,Training Camp", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Peyton Manning asks the media about one reporter's tight shirt \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd \"the boy medium who's wearing the small\" \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd and explains, sort of, the team's \"blue ball\" for training camp.", "title": "The Peyton Manning conversation you'll be sad you missed", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/24/peyton-manning-conversation-youll-sad-missed/28396/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/manning-ball-495x321.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Peyton Manning asks the media about one reporter's tight shirt \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd \"the boy medium who's wearing the small\" \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd and explains, sort of, the team's \"blue ball\" for training camp.", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/24/peyton-manning-conversation-youll-sad-missed/28396/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/manning-ball-495x321.jpg", "title": "The Peyton Manning conversation you\u2019ll be sad you missed", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Peyton Manning asks the media about one reporter's tight shirt \u2014 \"the boy medium who's wearing the small\" \u2014 and explains, sort of, the \"blue ball\" for camp."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf15d\"", "article_summary": "\u201c[Mike] Klis, I don\u2019t want to see you in a tight shirt, but that might be what it takes to get out there.\nAfter answering a slew of questions from reporters after Day 1 of training camp on Thursday, Peyton Manning turned the tables on the media, picking out one reporter in particular.\nI mean, all-access, gets to ride with the head coach, so I think it\u2019s the tight shirt.\nI have nothing to do with the all access thing.\nI noticed he had a very tight shirt on today."}
