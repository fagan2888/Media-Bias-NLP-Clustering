Now that she has formally entered the presidential race, the family may face political pressure and some legal requirements to provide further details of their personal finances and those of the foundation, giving voters a clearer view of the global network of patrons that have supported the Clintons and their work over the past 15 years.\n\nThe multiple avenues through which the Clintons and their causes have accepted financial support have provided a variety of ways for wealthy interests in the United States and abroad to build friendly relations with a potential future president. The flow of money also gives political opponents an opportunity to argue that Hillary Clinton would face potential conflicts of interest should she win the White House. Though she did not begin delivering paid speeches or join the foundation until 2013, upon ending her tenure as secretary of state, the proceeds from her husband\u2019s work benefited them both.\n\nBill Clinton was paid more than $100 million for speeches between 2001 and 2013, according to federal financial disclosure forms filed by Hillary Clinton during her years as a senator and as secretary of state.\n\nA spokesperson for Bill Clinton declined to comment on the overlap between speech sponsors and foundation donors, saying only that the former president\u2019s speaking schedule has been largely consistent since he left the White House.\n\nCraig Minassian, a spokesperson for the foundation, said it makes sense that supporters of the foundation would also be eager to hear from the former president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that organizations who believe strongly in the Clinton Foundation\u2019s mission and are impressed by its results are genuinely interested in President Clinton\u2019s perspective,\u201d Min\u00adassian said. \u201cThe president often says the foundation is his life today, and he welcomes any opportunity to educate people about it and encourage more people to work together to solve some of the most critical global challenges we all face.\u201d\n\nHow the Clintons went from \u2018dead broke\u2019 to rich\n\nThe Post analysis shows that, among the approximately 420 organizations that paid Bill Clinton to speak during those years, 67 were also foundation donors that each gave the charity at least $10,000.\n\nMany of those funders were major financial institutions that are viewed suspiciously by liberals whom Clinton has been courting as she seeks to secure the Democratic nomination \u2014 and avoid a vigorous primary challenge from the populist left.\n\nFour major financial firms \u2014 Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup \u2014 collectively have given between $2.75 million and $11.5 million to the charity, which is now called the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Between 2001 and 2013, their combined speech payments to Bill Clinton came to more than $3 million.\n\nThe Post analysis also revealed aspects of Bill Clinton\u2019s paid speaking career during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure at the State Department that were not clear from her public filings.\n\nThose included:\n\n\u25cfThe role played by dozens of companies and organizations, some of them associated with foreign governments or with interests before the U.S. government, in serving as secondary hosts for a number of the speeches. In her filings, Hillary Clinton typically disclosed only the primary sponsor of each speech.\n\nOne such \u201csub-sponsor\u201d was Boeing, a major government contractor whose interests Hillary Clinton promoted in her official duties at the State Department.\n\n\u25cfFour speeches delivered by Bill Clinton did not appear in Hillary Clinton\u2019s filings. One such speech was a 2012 address to an annual meeting of the Carlyle Group, a politically connected private-equity firm.\n\nA spokesperson for Bill Clinton\u2019s office said the former president at times spoke to benefit the foundation, which would not trigger a disclosure requirement for Hillary Clinton. None of the four speech sponsors are listed as foundation donors. The spokesperson said the proceeds were classified as non-tax-deductible revenue \u2014 not donations.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 finances have already become a political flash point with the much-anticipated release next month of a new book examining the foundation and the family\u2019s personal wealth. The Clinton campaign has dismissed Clinton Cash, written by conservative author Peter Schweizer, as a partisan attack.\n\nThe Post received a copy of the manuscript after signing a non-disclosure agreement with publisher HarperCollins. This article is based on reporting and documents collected independently from Schweizer\u2019s book.\n\nThe foundation itself has also emerged as an issue. In recent weeks, some Democrats have expressed anxiety about the foundation\u2019s receipt of millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Records show that the foundation accepted contributions from seven foreign governments during that time, including one donation that the foundation has acknowledged violated an ethics agreement with the Obama administration designed to limit new foreign-government donors.\n\nForeign governments gave millions to Clintons\u2019 foundation\n\n\n\nClinton aides have said the foundation goes beyond legal requirements and industry standards in its transparency. Its Web site lists donors and their contribution amounts, expressed in ranges.\n\nIt is not unusual for former presidents to boost their income through an active schedule of paid lectures; records show Bill Clinton has often shared the stage with former president George W. Bush or delivered speeches in front of groups that had previously hosted Bush or his father, former president George H.W. Bush.\n\nClinton has been in particular demand as a speaker because of his renowned oratory and growing popularity in post-presiden\u00adtial life, partly based on the widely respected work of the foundation. Speech organizers, which have included universities, charities and major lecture series, report that the former president is a major draw and that he often boosts attendance for annual events.\n\nWhat sets the Clintons apart is the vast reach of their donor network and the extent to which they have tapped it for the broad range of their personal, political and charitable work.\n\nThe Post\u2019s analysis, based on foundation disclosures, State Department documents, financial filings and other records, shows that the lines between Clinton\u2019s paid speeches and his work for the foundation often blurred as he traveled the world promoting the charity and reaping millions in payments.\n\nTechnology companies Microsoft and Cisco Systems, for instance, donated at least $1 million each to the foundation. The two companies paid Bill Clinton a total of $1.02 million in speaking fees for a series of lectures.\n\nIn September 2012, the Italian fitness equipment company Technogym paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in the northern Italian city of Cesena at a conference devoted to \u201ccreating a better and more sustainable world through people\u2019s health,\u201d according to financial disclosures and documents Bill Clinton\u2019s office submitted to the State Department.\n\nTechnogym, which has also given between $25,000 and $50,000 to the foundation, reported in a news release that the speech came about in part because of the foundation\u2019s work fighting childhood obesity.\n\nClinton spent much of his remarks discussing the work of the foundation to improve global health and comparing it to efforts by the company and its affiliated charity to promote the same ideas. \u201cSo I\u2019m very interested in all these things that the Wellness Foundation and that this conference and that Technogym does \u2014 because we are trying to do this,\u201d Clinton said, according to a YouTube video of his remarks.\n\nTechnogym did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe intermingling of foundation and paid work was also apparent earlier that year when Bill Clinton addressed an advertising festival in Cannes, France.\n\nGrupo ABC, a major Brazilian advertising company, paid Bill Clinton $450,000 for the June 2012 appearance. Foundation records show that the firm has given the charity between $1.5 million and $6 million.\n\nExcerpts from the event posted on YouTube show that Clinton was introduced with a video devoted to the work of the charity. \u201cI personally believe that if the American people give you the honor of serving them, you should keep doing it after you leave office,\u201d Clinton says in the video.\n\nState Department records show that Bill Clinton gave a speech and participated in a moderated question-and-answer session in Cannes for 1,000 advertising employees and then attended a reception for 75 at a luxury hotel.\n\nGrupo ABC spokesperson Sergio Malbergier said the company has worked with a series of global charities and nongovernmental organizations as part of a belief in being a \u201csocially responsible organization.\u201d He said the company has supported the Clinton Foundation \u201cbecause of the importance and effectiveness of its work.\u201d\n\nBill Clinton was invited as a keynote speaker to help celebrate the company\u2019s 10th anniversary, Malbergier said, because company leaders have found his vision \u201ca great source of inspiration.\u201d\n\nA Clinton Foundation official said organizations that pay for the former president to speak are often interested in the work of the charity and request that Clinton address it in his remarks.\n\nThe Post analysis also found other previously unreported aspects of Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking career.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton named the sponsoring organization for each of her husband\u2019s speaking engagements, separate documents show that Bill Clinton\u2019s office listed 97 additional sub-sponsors that had been proposed to help with these speaking events.\n\nBill Clinton disclosed the additional information as part of a voluntary ethics process undertaken when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. He agreed to seek State Department approval of his paid speaking engagements to avoid conflicts of interest for his wife.\n\nThe correspondence between Bill Clinton\u2019s office and the State Department was released in July after the conservative group Judicial Watch sought the records, ultimately filing suit to force their release.\n\nHillary Clinton was not obligated to disclose the sub-sponsors in her annual filings. The State Department\u2019s correspondence with Bill Clinton\u2019s office provides the only indication of the additional interests that helped support the former president\u2019s paid speaking career.\n\nIn 2010, for instance, Hillary Clinton disclosed that her husband had been paid $250,000 to address the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.\n\nBut Bill Clinton\u2019s office alerted the State Department that other sponsors for the event were proposed to include Etisalat, a large Middle Eastern telecommunications company whose majority owner is the government of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nLikewise, in 2012, Hillary Clinton\u2019s disclosures show, Bill Clinton was paid $250,000 for a Boston speech to the Global Business Travel Association.\n\nBut the documents filed by Bill Clinton\u2019s office show that a proposed sub-sponsor was the aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing. During a 2009 trip to Russia, Hillary Clinton made a personal pitch for a state-owned airline to buy Boeing jets.\n\nGordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesperson, said the company has sponsored the major travel event for several years, regardless of its invited speakers.\n\nFor Hillary Clinton and Boeing, a beneficial relationship\n\nSome sub-sponsors also were foundation donors, including Boeing, which has given more than $1 million to the charity.\n\nIn addition, the Post analysis found that Bill Clinton delivered some paid speeches during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure at the State Department that were not publicly disclosed.\n\nBy law, Cabinet members and lawmakers must disclose speeches for which their spouses were paid at least $200. And the foundation has voluntarily updated its donor list on its Web site each year since 2008.\n\nBut four speeches were not disclosed in either fashion.\n\nA spokesperson for Bill Clinton\u2019s office said that the former president \u201ccomplied with disclosure requirements in every case\u201d and that any speech fee not disclosed as personal income by Hillary Clinton went to the foundation.\n\nBut he said those fees were not tax deductible for the sponsoring organization and thus were not considered donations to the charity. He said they were included in the revenue figure provided in the foundation\u2019s tax filings.\n\nThe examples The Post found were:\n\n\u25cfA speech delivered in October 2011 in front of 9,000 at the University of Rochester\u2019s Meliora Weekend, the school\u2019s annual reunion and parents weekend. University officials confirmed that he delivered the speech for a fee, which they would not disclose.\n\n\u25cfAn appearance at the Minneapolis Heart Institute\u2019s annual gala, also in October 2011. Event organizers said Clinton was supposed to attend in person but appeared via video link after a snowstorm confined him to Washington. They said a $25,000 fee was paid for his appearance at the event that, according to State Department records, was also sponsored by the Land O\u2019Lakes dairy company.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a speaker who could speak personally about heart disease and heart treatment,\u201d said Minneapolis Heart Institute spokeswoman Melissa Hanson. \u201cIn addition, we wanted someone with first-class credibility. President Clinton was a natural fit.\u201d\n\n\u25cfA September 2012 question-and-answer session at the annual investors meeting of the politically connected private-equity company the Carlyle Group. A spokesperson would not comment on Bill Clinton\u2019s fee. According to Politico, Hillary Clinton was paid to appear at the same event a year later, after she stepped down as secretary of state.\n\n\u25cfBill Clinton\u2019s participation as the guest of honor at a dinner in Limerick, Ireland, in November 2012 at which scholarships were awarded to Irish students. A spokeswoman for the organizing group confirmed Clinton traveled to Ireland to take part in the dinner.\n\nRosalind Helderman is a political enterprise and investigations reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nThis article was published originally in The Washington Post.\n\nRead More at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Bill Clinton was paid at least $26\u00a0million in speaking fees by companies and organizat", "title": "For Clintons, Charity Begins at Home with More Than $100 Million in Speaking Fees", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/23/Clintons-Charity-Begins-Home-More-100-Million-Speaking-Fees-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_Clintons_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/23/Clintons-Charity-Begins-Home-More-100-Million-Speaking-Fees-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_Clintons_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Bill Clinton was paid at least $26\u00a0million in speaking fees by companies and organizat", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6824\"", "article_summary": "The two companies paid Bill Clinton a total of $1.02 million in speaking fees for a series of lectures.\nThe Post analysis also revealed aspects of Bill Clinton\u2019s paid speaking career during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure at the State Department that were not clear from her public filings.\nThe Post analysis also found other previously unreported aspects of Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking career.\nBut the documents filed by Bill Clinton\u2019s office show that a proposed sub-sponsor was the aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing.\nGrupo ABC, a major Brazilian advertising company, paid Bill Clinton $450,000 for the June 2012 appearance."}
