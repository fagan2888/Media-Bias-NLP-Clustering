The Obama administration has repeatedly insisted that the website\u2019s repeated crashes were due to unexpectedly high traffic.\n\nA White House spokesman criticized Issa's decision late Friday, but said the request is being reviewed and the administration plans to issue a response to the subpoena.\n\n\"This is an unfortunate and unnecessary step since we made clear several times that Todd Park is willing to testify,\" Rick Weiss, a spokesman for the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a statement. \"We had hoped the Committee would work with us to find an alternative date to give Todd time to focus on the immediate task at hand: getting the website fixed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has yet to formally take a position on a variety of proposals from Congress to address issues that have arisen since the insurance sign-ups launched on Oct. 1, including the ongoing backlash over health policy cancellations.\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., has proposed requiring insurance companies to reinstate canceled plans, and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is supporting a measure to delay for a year the penalties for going without insurance.\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, is asking Obama to extend the open enrollment period for insurance exchanges because of the widespread problems with the website.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed
