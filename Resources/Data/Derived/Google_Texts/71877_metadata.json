(Robinson Kuntz/Daily Republic)\n\nFAIRFIELD \u2014 Challenger Dave Miller\u2019s roots in Republican politics reach back to when he was 8 years old in New York and helped with Richard Nixon\u2019s campaign for president in 1968.\n\nThat effort won him an invitation to Nixon\u2019s inauguration, an event Miller missed because of his youth.\n\nMiller\u2019s parents were active in the GOP and knew Nelson Rockefeller, the Fairfield resident recounted.\n\nHis June 7 run against incumbent Jim Frazier, D-Oakley, in the 11th Assembly District will benefit from a pro-outsider mood among voters and strong opposition in Contra Costa County to Frazier, Miller said.\n\nThe candidate Name: Dave Miller\n\nAge: 52\n\nEducation: Received a health and human services policy internship in sophomore year of college and internship lasted 28 years. Fifteen of those years specialized in assisting the execution of social investigations and subsequent prosecution of clients deemed to have committed welfare fraud of any kind. The previous 13 years were spent in human services finance, as well as administrative assistant to the director of finance for health.\n\nCurrent occupation: Managing general partner of Span Corp., a political consulting firm.\n\nEndorsements: Former RNC Chairman Micheal Steele; Law Enforcement Officers for Media Accountability; Niger Innis, spokesman of the Congress on Racial Equality; U.S. Senate candidate Tom Del Beccaro; Former Assemblyman Dan Logue; Former congressional candidate Rick Tubb; radio and television commentator Rick Amato; Solano, Sacramento and Contra Costa Republican Parties; American Independent Party.\n\nIssues: Making energy less expensive in California, cutting his salary as a state assemblyman, massive regulatory reform, strong support for the 2nd Amendment, voter ID program, opposing high-speed rail.\n\n\u201cThey want him out so bad,\u201d Miller said.\n\nHe likened the discontent to the scene in the 1974 movie \u201cYoung Frankenstein\u201d when villagers storm the castle.\n\nFrazier faces a test in 2016 that he didn\u2019t get two years ago, Miller said.\n\n\u201cHe had a college student up against him,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThis time Frazier is running against a full-time candidate, Miller said.\n\nThe Republican candidate is optimistic about winning the Assembly seat and said the district has been trending more conservative.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tired of politics the way it\u2019s being played out,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMiller said tax increases and political bullying are helping change the district\u2019s political makeup. He has criticized the 100 percent rating Frazier received from Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThe Planned Parenthood ratings may as well be called the \u2018Who\u2019s a friend of Planned Parenthood list,\u2019 \u201d Miller said last November. \u201cThe sooner federal funding is seriously re-examined for Planned Parenthood, the better off we\u2019ll all be.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the passage of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said, \u201cisn\u2019t Planned Parenthood a redundant medical service to taxpayers?\n\n\u201cI would rather comment on the \u2018F\u2019 score he received from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association,\u201d Miller said of Frazier, \u201cor the failing 37-percent rating he got from Caltax.org, another taxpayers association.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s campaign website includes the assertion that, \u201cRight now we have someone in office that does not represent our interests. Someone who believes building a train, that won\u2019t see its first passenger for over three decades, is more important than dealing with our water crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Fairfield resident worked for 30 years in the Department of Social Services for New York State.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s 11th Assembly District includes portions of Solano, Contra Costa and Sacramento counties, to include Fairfield, Suisun City, Rio Vista, Vacaville and Travis Air Force Base.\n\nReach Ryan McCarthy at 427-6935 or [email protected].", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Republic", "description": "FAIRFIELD \u2014\u00a0Challenger Dave Miller\u2019s roots in Republican politics reach back to when he was 8 years old in New York and helped with Richard Nixon\u2019s campaign for president in 1968.
