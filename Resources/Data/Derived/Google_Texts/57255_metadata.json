The case could cut out a major provision of Obamacare, causing the law to unravel. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the case. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nThe outcome of the Supreme Court arguments about the new health-care law could turn on how to interpret a single hotly contested phrase in the massive bill. But the case has already highlighted this truism: Congress can sometimes be sloppy.\n\nThe justices on Wednesday hear arguments about federal subsidies that help millions of Americans afford insurance, with challengers arguing the Affordable Care Act, as written, only allows these payments for coverage bought through marketplaces set up by state governments. After all, the plaintiffs say, the bill says subsidies only apply in cases of \u201can Exchange established by the state.\u201d\n\nGet the latest updates from inside the Supreme Court here\n\nBut two-thirds of the states, mostly Republican led, have balked at setting up their own insurance marketplaces. So in these places, consumers buy coverage through an exchange set up by the federal government. The Obama administration and its allies say Congress clearly meant to include all Americans who qualified, regardless of whether they bought the insurance through a state exchange.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, how did Congress end up writing such an ambiguous provision? And why hasn\u2019t anyone on Capitol Hill fixed it?\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear a challenge to President Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIt turns out, Congress often makes mistakes when writing laws.\n\nIn other instances, sometimes a few years later, Congress comes back with a \u201ccorrections bill\u201d to fix mistakes that have become apparent. Sometimes lawmakers wait for the courts to tell them what they got wrong and then make amends after the fact.\n\n\u201cThis happens all the time,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), the No. 2 Republican leader. \u201cJust in terms of statutory construction, trying to figure out: What in the world did Congress mean?\u201d\n\nBut partisan differences over Obamacare run so deep that there\u2019s been no possibility of fine-tuning the law or winning agreement among lawmakers over what it actually means.\n\nCornyn and other Republicans who oppose the health-care law are hoping that a majority of the five justices take the \u201cstrict construction\u201d view. \u201cYou can\u2019t infer anything, but from the words on the paper. That\u2019s the only thing Congress votes on,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats reject that approach. \u201cOur intent was clear,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.\n\n\u201cThis seemed like a non-serious court case,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said, rejecting the idea that Democrats had erred in writing the bill. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to come back and amend this.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what happening at the Supreme Court \u2014 and what comes next\n\nIf the Supreme Court invalidates the subsidies paid for insurance bought on the federal exchange, millions of Americans could see their costs soar and cancel their coverage, sparking further cost hikes and cancellations. This dynamic could ultimately undermine the financial viability of the entire health-care program. According to administration officials and their allies, this is certainly not what the ACA\u2019s backers in Congress wanted \u2014 even if they didn\u2019t say so explicitly.\n\nWhile legislative drafts can often contain muddied language, the battle over Obamacare may represent the most significant legal challenge to a law based on what some might consider careless wording.\n\nThe issue of imprecise lawmaking came up recently in the context of the District of Columbia\u2019s plan to legalize possession of marijuana. Congressional Republicans sought to impose restrictions on the plan by using a massive December bill to fund almost all of the federal government. They included a line forbidding the new marijuana measure from taking effect by including a line in legislation providing federal funds to the District.\n\nAfter the fact, GOP lawmakers discovered that District officials had found a loophole to exploit. District officials declared that the restriction was null and void because the marijuana law had already been enacted when the voters approved it, and last week the law took effect, making it legal to smoke marijuana.\n\nThe issue seems destined for the federal courts \u2014 and also for a potential do-over by Republicans when they write funding legislation later this year.\n\nBack in 1987, Congress had to rewrite a landmark budget-cutting bill, known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, that called for automatic spending cuts. A congressional Democrat sued, arguing that such mandatory cuts were unconstitutional because only Congress could dictate spending, and the Supreme Court invalidated the law.\n\nThe next year Congress passed what many dubbed \u201cGramm-Rudman-Hollings 2,\u201d clarifying how the spending cuts would work.\n\nCongress also had to rework its long-term highway bill drafted 10 years ago. The $300 billion bill also contained a litany of mistakes or issues that became out of date over time, leading to a \u201ctechnical corrections\u201d bill in 2008. Some funding levels for projects needed to be revised by small amounts \u2014 a transportation center went from receiving $2.225 million to $2.25 million \u2014 and others were reduced or nixed.\n\nSuch technical corrections have never been possible for the health-care law.\n\n\u201cUnder different circumstances,\u201d Cornyn said, \u201cthere might be some collective effort to offer a correction or a change to sustain it. But in this instance, because the parties are so polarized, because this was done as a purely partisan piece of legislation, it\u2019s going to be up to the courts to decide.\u201d\n\nWhile the law had won a majority of votes in both the Senate and House, they were all Democratic votes. Cornyn argued that this closed the door to fixing its flaws.\n\n\u201cIt is a mistake to do something on a purely partisan basis, because it\u2019s not, ultimately, sustainable,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Battle represents the most significant challenge to a law based on what some may consider careless wording.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.kane.3367", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Battle represents the most significant challenge to a law based on what some may consider careless wording.", "title": "Obamacare case shows Congress often misses mark when writing legislation", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamacare-case-shows-congress-often-misses-mark-when-writing-legislation/2015/03/03/f711b4de-c1cf-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/03/National-Politics/Images/P_Explains_Supreme_Court_Health_Overhaul-0946b-3510.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@pkcapitol"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamacare-case-shows-congress-often-misses-mark-when-writing-legislation/2015/03/03/f711b4de-c1cf-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "congress, burwell, supreme court, obamacare supreme court, affordable care act, aca obama, chuck schumer, john cornyn", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.kane.3367"}, "eomportal-uuid": "f711b4de-c1cf-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "congress, burwell, supreme court, obamacare supreme court, affordable care act, aca obama, chuck schumer, john cornyn"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce00f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis seemed like a non-serious court case,\u201d Sen.
