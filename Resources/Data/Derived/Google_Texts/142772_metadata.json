We\u2019re supposed to be covered through Nov. 30. In October, I paid the November premium for that coverage: more than $2,100.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to get a scary glimpse into what might be unfolding. I had my annual physical scheduled for Nov. 18. My doctor\u2019s office called Friday morning at about 9:40 to let me know that I was now considered uninsured, because they\u2019d been notified that Health Republic would no longer be paying claims. Therefore, if I wanted to keep my appointment, I would be doing so as an uninsured patient and would be expected to pay out of pocket for services rendered.\n\nNow, I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect my doctor \u2014 or any health care provider \u2013 to donate his or her services because of my insurance company\u2019s insolvency. Fortunately, my immediate need was not an emergency and, since I had already have new insurance lined up for Dec. 1, I suggested we just postpone my checkup till after that date.\n\nBut did new development mean I am now uninsured? What happens if I get sick and \u2014 God forbid \u2014 need to go into the hospital before Dec. 1? Or need surgery? Will I be headed for bankruptcy too, like the ill-fated health insurance co-op I signed up with? And what about people with ongoing critical care needs? The person insured by Health Republic who\u2019s on chemo? Or what about a pregnant woman who\u2019s going to give birth before the end of the month? What about the local hospital \u2014 and doctors who\u2019ve already provided care or may be forced to continue to provide care? Are they going to get stuck with the tab? How could this be happening?\n\nAnd \u2014 wait a minute! \u2014 what about the 2,100 bucks I paid Health Republic for health insurance for the month of November?\n\nAfter spending nearly the entire day Friday trying to sort through this \u2014 as a reporter and as a subscriber \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to say the only thing I\u2019m sure of is I\u2019m not getting a refund, no matter what.\n\nA Health Republic\u2019s customer service representative flatly denied \u2014 quite indignantly \u2014 that there was any kind of \u201chold\u201d on payment of claims. \u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t be here answering this phone, would I?\u201d She pooh-poohed the Newsday report as \u201csomething somebody read on the internet\u201d (using the word internet as if it were pond scum.) I got much the same response from the guy who answered the phone at the Department of Financial Services consumer hotline. Nope. Ain\u2019t happening.\n\nExcept it is.\n\nThe DFS\u2019 own official spokesperson confirmed it for Newsday, though he didn\u2019t answer my four phone calls or email on Friday. (I love government-employed press officers who won\u2019t return reporters\u2019 phone calls. I mean, that is, after all, their job. This is a phenomenon that\u2019s become all too commonplace in the Cuomo administration, sadly. But that\u2019s another column.)\n\nAnd the spokesperson for the Healthcare Association of New York, which represents more than 500 hospitals, nursing homes and health care facilities statewide said the state issued the \u201chold\u201d on Nov. 6.\n\nPBMC\u2019s president Andy Mitchell told me Friday hospital officials are trying to figure out what it all means for the hospital. One thing seems pretty clear: it\u2019s going to take a significant financial hit.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if health care providers can legally pull out of the Health Republic network, now that they\u2019ve been told they won\u2019t \u2014 or may not? \u2014 get paid. Sure they have a contract with Health Republic. But if Health Republic is telling them they won\u2019t get paid, what good is that contract? Not much. I recall a concept from my contracts class in my first year of law school. It\u2019s called \u201canticipatory repudiation\u201d or \u201canticipatory breach.\u201d When notified of an anticipatory breach, the other party has a duty to \u201cmitigate damages\u201d \u2014 i.e. it can\u2019t continue to provide services and expect more payment. Now, I\u2019m not sure whether anything in any statute pertaining to health insurance co-ops or any provision of the Affordable Care Act changes this well-settled doctrine of contract law, but it seems to me the doctors have a case.\n\nThe scariest thing of all is how nobody really knows what the hell is going on or how this plays out.\n\nThe situation is \u201cvery very fluid,\u201d says Andy Mitchell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rapidly evolving,\u201d said a press spokesperson for State Sen. Kemp Hannon, who chairs the state senates standing committee on insurance.\n\nOur State Senator, Ken LaValle said it\u2019s changing \u201calmost by the minute.\u201d\n\nI spoke to LaValle twice on Friday. He suggested I make the call to the DFS hotline and see what they had to say. Obviously, they are not coming clean with consumers. He said the senate will be holding hearings to investigate the whole situation.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t help someone who needs health care, who has paid up their insurance premium and is now getting (there\u2019s no nicer way to put this ) screwed \u2014 by the insurance company, under the supervision and with the blessing of our government.\n\n\u201cThis is, quite honestly, a bowl of spaghetti that\u2019s congealed and you just have to unwind it,\u201d LaValle said.\n\nSeems to me that\u2019s an assessment that can be applied to a whole lot of government lawmaking nowadays. And inevitably, it\u2019s the taxpayers and consumers who pay the price.\n\nDenise Civiletti is an owner of East End Local Media Corp., publishers of RiverheadLOCAL. and SoutholdLOCAL.
