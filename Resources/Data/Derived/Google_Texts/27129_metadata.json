I ask people to name the President who put peacetime government limits on wages and prices, and created the EPA. Not everyone remembers that Richard Nixon took all of those actions, all of which were ill-considered \u2014 and all of which Congress authorized, implicitly and explicitly. But the real entertainment in this taped segment of the Bill O\u2019Reilly-Barack Obama Super Bowl interview that first aired last night isn\u2019t Obama\u2019s attempt to use Nixon to make himself look moderate, but the claim that no one would care about four dead Americans in Benghazi and the incompetence that caused it if it weren\u2019t for those darned kids at Fox News, or something.\n\nOh, and at the same time, Obama wants Fox to give him some credit for their ratings:\n\nThis interview rolls smoother than the live interview aired on Sunday, in which both men kept talking over each other and mostly circled around the legitimacy of the questions. O\u2019Reilly and Obama have a good discussion on poverty and the breakdown of the family, and Obama mostly dodged the Keystone question in an amicable way. The debate gets more contentious around the welfare state, but it\u2019s still sharp and interesting.\n\nBut after offering repeated shots at Fox in an interview to which the White House agreed to participate, O\u2019Reilly puts Obama on the spot and challenges him to specify how Fox News has been unfair. Obama gets caught unprepared:\n\nO\u2019REILLY: Fox News. I can\u2019t speak for Fox, but I\u2019m, you know, the table-setter here at 8 o\u2019clock. Do you think I\u2019m unfair to you? Do you think I\u2019ve been giving \u2013 OBAMA: Absolutely, of course you are Bill! But, I like you anyway. Um \u2013 O\u2019REILLY: Ok, but give me how I\u2019m unfair. OBAMA: It\u2019s, it\u2019s \u2014 but, look . . . O\u2019REILLY: Give me how I\u2019m unfair, c\u2019mon! You can\u2019t make that accusation without telling me! OBAMA: [Laughs] Bill, we just went through an interview in which you asked about \u2014 uh, healthcare not working, IRS, were we wholly corrupt, Benghazi \u2013 O\u2019REILLY: Right. OBAMA: So the list of issues that you talk about \u2013 O\u2019REILLY: But these are unanswered questions! OBAMA: But, but, but \u2014 they\u2019re defined by you guys in a certain way. But, that \u2014 look, this is ok. If you wanna be \u2014 if you wanna be President of the United States, then you know you\u2019re gonna be subject to criticism, and \u2013 O\u2019REILLY: But if it\u2019s unfair \u2014 I wanna know if it\u2019s unfair. OBAMA: [Laughs] O\u2019REILLY: Criticism is criticism! It\u2019s my job to give you a hard time. OBAMA: Here \u2014 here\u2019s what I would say. I think regardless of whether it\u2019s fair or not, it has made Fox News very successful. O\u2019REILLY: But if I\u2019m unfair, I want \u2013 OBAMA: Here\u2019s \u2014 here\u2019s the thing you guys \u2014 here\u2019s what you guys are gonna have to figure out, is what are you gonna do when I\u2019m gone? I\u2019m tellin\u2019 ya. O\u2019REILLY: Our ratings were high when you weren\u2019t here! OBAMA: Oh, man, you know \u2014 [Laughs] O\u2019REILLY: OOOOH! [Laughs] OBAMA: I\u2019ve been a big money-maker for you guys. [Laughs]\n\nYes, because Fox News languished at the bottom of the ratings until 2009.
