The most 100 common procedures came from data provided by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nOf the 50 hospitals, NerdWallet calculated which one had the lowest procedure price and ranked how many times the hospital showed the cheapest rate, Pratini said.\n\nMRMC had 30 of the most affordable treatments out of 100, giving them the top spot, Pratini said.\n\n\u201cMaury Regional has the most, least expensive treatments, if you will,\u201d she said.\n\nNerdWallet used the Medicare discharge data because it is the largest publicly available source of information on what hospitals charge patients for particular procedures, Pratini said. The data should paint an accurate portrayal of what hospitals charge all patients because procedures are billed the same, regardless of Medicare enrollment, Pratini said.\n\nMany hospitals choose to not publicly release billing data for all of their patients, and the Medicare discharge data is the closest to overall prices that can be found, she added.\n\nMedicare is a health insurance program for people age 65 or older, or people under age 65 with certain disabilities, according to the CMS website. About 14 percent of Maury County\u2019s population is age 65 or older, according to 2012 U.S. Census data.\n\nThe top five most treated ailments at MRMC are sepsis, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, emphysema and fluid in lungs, according to the Medicare discharge data.\n\nMRMC Chief Financial Officer Nick Swift said he believes the NerdWallet data accurately represents the hospital\u2019s low-cost pricing, but the information should be taken with \u201ca grain of salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe data itself is good data. It just doesn\u2019t represent all our patients. It only represents the Medicare population,\u201d Swift said. \u201cWe charge everybody the same. So, what we charge Medicare patients is the same as any other patient, and that\u2019s true for every hospital in the country.\u201d\n\nMRMC Chief Executive Officer Alan Watson said the hospital monitors patient cost data internally and said it was not too surprising to hear about the designation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to be a low-cost provider \u2014 sometimes \u2014 but you might lose quality and service to get there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cSo, we are always balancing those three things.\u201d\n\nWatson noted that the NerdWallet study showed MRMC has a 74 percent patient satisfaction rate based on numbers collected from Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems. HCAHPS gathers data about patients\u2019 perspectives of hospital care.\n\nThe national patient satisfaction average is 71 percent, Pratini said.\n\nThe second most affordable hospital is the Cookeville Regional Medical Center about 120 miles east of Columbia, according to the NerdWallet study. The least affordable health care facility is the Saint Francis Hospital in Memphis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maury Regional Medical Center was named the most affordable hospital in Tennessee based on Medicare patient discharge data collected by a consumer information website.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "TIM HODGE thodge@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "Maury Regional Medical Center was named the most affordable hospital in Tennessee based on Medicare patient discharge data collected by a consumer information website.", "title": "MRMC named most affordable in state", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/business/mrmc-named-most-affordable-state", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_MRMC-napala-pratini-boxed_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/business/mrmc-named-most-affordable-state", "title": "MRMC named most affordable in state", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=704381", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=704381", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Business,,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-23T16:42:08-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4231\"", "article_summary": "Maury Regional Medical Center was named the most affordable hospital in Tennessee based on Medicare patient discharge data collected by a consumer information website.\nThe top five most treated ailments at MRMC are sepsis, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, emphysema and fluid in lungs, according to the Medicare discharge data.\nMRMC had 30 of the most affordable treatments out of 100, giving them the top spot, Pratini said.\nThe second most affordable hospital is the Cookeville Regional Medical Center about 120 miles east of Columbia, according to the NerdWallet study.\nNerdWallet used the Medicare discharge data because it is the largest publicly available source of information on what hospitals charge patients for particular procedures, Pratini said."}
