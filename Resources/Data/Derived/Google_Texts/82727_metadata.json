(Lydia DePillis/The Washington Post)\n\nWHEATON, Ill. \u2014 Parent-teacher conference days are usually long and exhausting for Erica Bray-Parker, a high school social studies teacher in the well-off Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn. But Nov. 5 was especially brutal. The day before, voters chose as their next governor an avowed foe of the teachers union she helps lead, millionaire businessman Bruce Rauner.\n\n\u201cIt was draining, in and of itself, but it was also defeating,\u201d Bray-Parker remembers, sitting after work in her cozy Wheaton bungalow. Spending four hours talking with parents about helping students, it was hard to forget how the public often views teachers unions. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who say, \u2018I like my son\u2019s teacher, but oh, teachers, they shouldn\u2019t have tenure; it\u2019s impossible to fire teachers,\u2019 which isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nTeachers at her school, who belong to Illinois\u2019 chapter of the National Education Association, had done more than ever before to try to get their own members out to vote on Election Day. They had held a postcard-writing party after school. They had gone to the union headquarters to call prospective voters \u2014 from a room bannered with talking points on how Rauner had said that unions are a \u201cfinancial tumor\u201d and how his \u201cdraconian budget\u201d would cut education spending by $2 billion.\n\nThe union had sent fliers to members comparing Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn\u2019s statements about education to Rauner\u2019s, and eight-minute videos describing what happened in Wisconsin after Republican Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 an ideological ally of Rauner\u2019s \u2014 effectively eliminated collective bargaining.\n\nUltimately, though, teacher votes themselves weren\u2019t enough \u2014 and Bray-Parker is now at a loss for how to reach the public, when the widespread image of teachers unions is about as toxic as it\u2019s ever been. As attacks on teacher tenure have mounted, pushes for charter schools and vouchers have intensified, and new testing and curriculum mandates have made her job more challenging than ever before, Bray-Parker has found herself squarely in a dilemma: How to fight for job security and the freedom to teach kids without the constraints of testing, when politicians and the public don\u2019t trust the institutions bearing the message?\n\nThe question took on added urgency in the 2014 election cycle, with the victories of several Republican governors whom the teachers unions had pledged to defeat. Rick Snyder in Michigan, Paul LePage in Maine and Rick Scott in Florida all support policies \u2014 various combinations of school vouchers, charter schools, and merit-based pay \u2014 that the unions oppose. Nationwide, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers spent $60 million on state, local and federal races to push its agenda but had little success. Their biggest victory was a state superintendent\u2019s race in California.\n\nThere is one strategy teachers unions feel still could make them more effective: evolve into more of a \u201cprofessional\u201d union, respected for its expertise in the field, as much a part of shaping policy as the politicians \u2014 but also an advocate for its members. Both the NEA and the other major teachers union, the American Federation of Teachers, have taken stabs at collaboration over the last decade. But so far, that hasn\u2019t done much to improve their public image or political standing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard to be more of a professional union, not the \u2018gimme my benefits, gimme my pension\u2019 union anymore,\u201d Bray-Parker says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying that for a few years, and the message isn\u2019t coming across.\u201d\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the AFT, adds that \u201cit\u2019s simply common sense to listen to educators; they are closest to the classroom and they know what\u2019s needed for all kids to succeed. That\u2019s what research also says, what teachers want and why we have been working for decades to have educators\u2019 voices included in decision-making from the schoolhouse to the statehouse.\u201d\n\nAs a parallel, Bray-Parker thinks of the doctors\u2019 lobby, the American Medical Association, which wields tremendous clout in everything from Medicare reimbursement rates to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and tends to be regarded as more of an impartial guardian of public health. There\u2019s even a joke in the teacher world: No Dentist Left Behind, riffing off the 2001 law that built in corrective actions for school districts whose students didn\u2019t meet certain standards, regardless of circumstance. As in, would you take away a dentist\u2019s license if she worked in a low-income area and her patients kept coming in with cavities? No, of course you wouldn\u2019t; it\u2019s not her fault.\n\nThat\u2019s why, despite the slow progress, teachers unions are keeping at it.\n\n\u201cGiven how they are being construed in a lot of the popular media, there is a strong push to prove that unions are there to improve public education, and that teachers are the experts,and shouldn\u2019t be considered the enemy,\u201d says Katharine Strunk, an associate professor at the University of Southern California School of Education who studies teachers unions. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re seeing local unions across the country trying to make this case for themselves, rather than being construed as working against what\u2019s good for kids.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nIf the NEA did pull off a shift toward \u201ctrust us, we\u2019re experts\u201d unionism, it would only be a return to its roots.\n\nFounded in Philadelphia in the 1850s as a courtly men\u2019s club, which came up with policy ideas such as a national Department of Education and tried to standardize spellings of words, the group remained more of a think tank and benevolent association, fighting against child labor and for the quality of teaching for minorities. Only in the 1950s, with the rise of the American Federation of Teachers and the spread of collective bargaining, did the NEA shift into more of a labor union as we know it today, advocating on behalf of its members\u2019 pay, benefits and terms of employment.\n\nIn 1983, the Reagan administration published \u201cA Nation at Risk,\u201d a report finding widespread failure in the public education system. The document touched off a frenzy of efforts to infuse education with standards and metrics, which teachers felt undermined their autonomy in the classroom. Unions resisted those changes but rarely won. To get a seat at the table, NEA leadership in 1997 proposed an approach called \u201cnew unionism,\u201d under which unions were supposed to collaborate with school districts on curriculum development, scheduling, testing standards, evaluations \u2014 rather than simply saying no.\n\nThat idea met with mixed reviews. Some local union leaders thought that even participating in the discussion was a capitulation to state leaders, and they preferred to stick with their adversarial tactics. During the 2000s, a number of reform-minded union presidents were elected in cities, only to later lose their seats to more militant challengers. The local nature of labor power means that national leadership can say one thing, but chapters do the opposite, and that can lead to some pretty big battles at the local level \u2014 the now-famous war between the Chicago Teachers Union and Mayor Rahm Emanuel being exhibit A.\n\nStill, as the administration of President George W. Bush continued, and as his signature education law, the No Child Left Behind Act, which required stringent testing, began to take effect, the need to get involved in policymaking seemed more urgent than ever.\n\n\u201cThe big shift happened when Bush came in and there was no communication,\u201d says Thomas Tully, the NEA representative for Bray-Parker\u2019s district. \u201cThat was really done to us. We just had to accept the consequences. Things are much more successful when we are at the table negotiating, shaping, legislation that affects all educational workers, support personnel, bus drivers, you name it.\u201d\n\nOut of the national spotlight, local unions have been working with districts to give teachers exactly that kind of role. Susan Moore Johnson, a research professor at Harvard\u2019s graduate school of education, cites Baltimore and Montgomery County, Md., as examples of places where union contracts cover a broad range of issues and major decisions are made jointly. Supported by groups such as the Teachers Union Reform Network, and even grants from and research in cooperation with the national unions themselves, they\u2019ve come up with new avenues for collaboration, notably recruitment and professional development. \u201cThe reality is that there are a lot of local unions that are doing very professional things that people outside of education would be surprised about,\u201d she says.\n\nPaul Gamboa, a former fifth-grade teacher who became a local union president a few districts over from Bray-Parker, saw an evolution at least in the NEA\u2019s attitude just over the past few years. \u201cI remember actively trying to avoid them at the new teacher luncheon. My impression was that they protected bad people,\u201d he remembers. His suspicions were borne out at his first couple of NEA meetings, where, he recalled, the most vocal people harped on protecting their jobs rather than bettering education. Gradually, that started to shift, as legislative bombs dropped with little teacher participation.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at things that unions stood for in the past, they were not exactly the forefront of education reform,\u201d Gamboa says. \u201cThat is drastically changing now, but we are playing catch-up now to change that perception.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem may be that the public is still pretty far apart from teachers unions on some of the issues. Take teacher tenure, for example. According to this year\u2019s Education Next survey, only 32 percent of the public supported it, compared to 60 percent of teachers. The split is even wider on whether districts should pay teachers on the basis of their students\u2019 performance. Overall, 41 percent of those interviewed thought teacher unions had a negative effect on education, while 34 percent thought they had a positive effect.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at things that unions stood for in the past, they were not exactly the forefront of education reform,\u201d Gamboa says. \u201cThat is drastically changing now, but we are playing catch-up now to change that perception.\u201d\n\nAnd ultimately, teachers unions may be facing a national mood that\u2019s just not disposed in their favor.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it could get worse, but right now I think it\u2019s just as bad as it\u2019s ever been. People don\u2019t want to believe that the unions are constructive, just generally,\u201d says Harvard\u2019s Moore Johnson. \u201cI used to think that more explanation would make a difference, but I think there\u2019s a big political shift in the country, both about unions and about public education, whether it will or should survive, and that is making it very hard to inform anyone.\u201d\n\nFor teachers, the everyday consequences of not having a role in policy decisions are very real. Bray-Parker says that in the last four years, she\u2019s had to deal with the implementation of the Common Core standards, the introduction of new technology, and a complete change in evaluation procedures. Meanwhile, more students with special needs are being thrown in with everyone else, and everybody\u2019s expected to take AP classes. That adds up to the most overwhelming of any period during her 21-year career. \u201cTaken individually, it\u2019s all good stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when it explodes at one time, it\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\nThat feeling is national: According to the annual MetLife survey of the American teacher, job satisfaction took a huge dive after 2008, from 62 percent to 39 percent in 2012. Bray-Parker says she knows a few veteran teachers who just decided not to come back from maternity leave, since the job\u2019s become so challenging. Others are seeing whether they might have the option to retire early, fearful of what might be ahead.\n\nWhile the teachers in Illinois prepare for battle with Rauner next year, they are also looking to have a hand in the curriculum and testing that they\u2019ll have to implement down the line. Focused on making the union a positive presence outside contract negotiations, Bray-Parker\u2019s chapter has done more outreach to local reporters, sponsored a charity race, joined the local chamber of commerce, supported the student newspaper and the PTA.\n\nSometimes, it feels like introducing an entirely different side of the teachers that parents have already gotten to know.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we have to get our union name out there, like, \u2018look at this great stuff we\u2019re doing as a union,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s making relationships with the community, as a union. \u2018We are teachers, and oh by the way, we\u2019re a union.\u2019 Instead of, \u2018we\u2019re a union of teachers.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Faced with victories by anti-union Republicans in the Nov. 4 midterms, teachers unions are looking to change their image.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Faced with victories by anti-union Republicans in the Nov. 4 midterms, teachers unions are looking to change their image.", "title": "Could teachers unions work more like doctors\u2019 associations?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/11/17/could-teachers-unions-work-more-like-doctors-associations/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2014/11/DSCN2559-1024x768.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/11/17/could-teachers-unions-work-more-like-doctors-associations/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "teachers unions; nea; aft; education; unions; illinois; rauner; Erica Bray-Parker; education reform;", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "teachers unions; nea; aft; education; unions; illinois; rauner; Erica Bray-Parker; education reform;"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff64\"", "article_summary": "The question took on added urgency in the 2014 election cycle, with the victories of several Republican governors whom the teachers unions had pledged to defeat.\nSpending four hours talking with parents about helping students, it was hard to forget how the public often views teachers unions.\nBoth the NEA and the other major teachers union, the American Federation of Teachers, have taken stabs at collaboration over the last decade.\nThat\u2019s why, despite the slow progress, teachers unions are keeping at it.\nThe day before, voters chose as their next governor an avowed foe of the teachers union she helps lead, millionaire businessman Bruce Rauner."}
