With the relaunch of \u201cCrossfire,\u201d Jones maintains that the hosts will get beyond talking points quickly in a half-hour program: \u201cIn 22 minutes of television, you have to really get down to the secondary, the tertiary, the root of these debates and these discussions. I think America needs that.\u201d\n\n\"Crossfire\" returns to CNN Monday, September 9, at 6:30pm ET.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With \"Crossfire\" returning to CNN this Monday, September 9, CNN is taking a closer look into the hosts' lives with a series of Web videos.
