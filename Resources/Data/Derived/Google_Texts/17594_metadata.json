I want to turn away but Bill O'Reilly is TRUMAN CAPOTE TALKSHOW DRUNK. #wow \u2014 Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) March 4, 2016\n\nOkay, I have to stop watching this. Bill O'Reilly is the wet-brain carnival geek from NIGHTMARE ALLEY. I'm the villain here. #GOPDebate \u2014 Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) March 4, 2016\n\nBe that as it may, until President Trump has something to do with it, we live in a democratic society with due process. It would be negligent not to presume O\u2019Reilly sober until proven sloshed. So let\u2019s break it down.\n\nDonald Trump:\n\nO\u2019Reilly keeps his composure quite well in the Trump spin-room interview. He interrupts Trump\u2019s tired \u201c(Mitt Romney\u2019s) a failed candidate\u201d spiel in typical fashion. He asks Trump why he thinks he \u201cengender(s) so much loathing\u201d from his own party. His posture is impeccable:\n\nHe does get a little too friendly with Melania, but, to be fair, Trump initiates the exchange to ease the tension after suggesting that O\u2019Reilly ask his therapist why his coverage of the Trump campaign has become increasingly negative.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been fair,\u201d O\u2019Reilly reverses, even after Trump introduces \u201cmy boy Eric\u201d so as to avoid a heated post-debate debate. To poke a bear like Trump, you\u2019d have to be drunk, stupid, Mitt Romney, or a combination thereof.\n\nO\u2019Reilly will not stop: \u201cYou wanna give me an example?\u201d And when Trump says no, \u201cC\u2019monnn!\u201d\n\nThankfully for everyone\u2019s sake, O\u2019Reilly finally recognizes he\u2019s hit a dead end and switches gears, this time looking ahead to the Convention this July in Cleveland. Unable to find the words \u201cbrokered convention,\u201d O\u2019Reilly settles for, \u201cthe under table thing.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio:\n\nA little blip right off the bat: He calls it the \u201cpost-Factor\u201d instead of the \u201cpost-debate Factor.\u201d Splitting hairs here; he still has the benefit of my doubt.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is the case, but I might start watching \u201cThe Factor\u201d more if he treats all his interviewees like he did Rubio. After talking about Trump the entire time, O\u2019Reilly gave Rubio the last 30-or-so seconds to explain how he\u2019ll win Florida. Then, squeezing in the last word, Bill says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna work.\u201d And throws to commercial. Fuck objectivity; that was beautiful.\n\nTed Cruz:\n\nO\u2019Reilly messes up the name of his show again \u2014 a serious blow to his case for sobriety. Bill has a certain smug cadence, resting on the last word in a clause, which he\u2019s mastered over a century on-air. \u201cContinuing nowww with The Factorrr\u201d was what he was going for. At the last second, though, he tried to fit in \u201cSpecial Edition of,\u201d then decommitted. In a vacuum, the stumble is a brain fart. But up against his shaky performance thus far, it\u2019s fair to get suspicious.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several outlets called O'Reilly's performance \"awkward,\" but was he drunk?
