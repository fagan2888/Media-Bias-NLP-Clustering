Following the morning skate Tuesday, Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said goalie Semyon Varlamov would miss a “couple weeks” after an MRI detected a “groin problem” on Monday.

“That’s all I can say for now,” Roy added.

Rookie Calvin Pickard will start Tuesday night against the visiting Nashville Predators after being called up from the minors Monday, shortly after practice when Varlamov injured his groin for the third time this season.

Varlamov will miss his 10th game with the same ailment Tuesday.

Pickard will begin his third stint with the big club, playing in his eighth NHL game. He has Colorado’s best goals-against average (2.49) and save percentage (.922).

The injury-riddled Avs also called up forward Paul Carey on Monday and forward Borna Rendulic on Tuesday, to round out the fourth line against the Predators. Roy originally said he would go with just 19 available players but the team chose differently and will give Rendulic, 22, his first shot in the NHL.

Rendulic played all his hockey in Croatia before this season.
