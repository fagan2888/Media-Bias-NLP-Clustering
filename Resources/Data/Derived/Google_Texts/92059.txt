It’s not exactly surprising that Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, is taking the Seattle Seahawks in this Sunday’s Super Bowl over the Denver Broncos — but she’s going with a pretty specific prediction for how the game will turn out.

“I think that [cornerback Richard] Sherman is going to intercept a Peyton Manning pass and put us over the top by 13 points,” she told KIRO Radio. “I just have confidence in the greatest team in America.”

Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado Democrat, was spotted Tuesday sporting a Peyton Manning jersey in the halls on Capitol Hill — and is already instigating some intra-party trash talk in response to Mrs. Murray’s prognostication.

“Sorry @PattyMurray but closest @RSherman_25 will come to greatness = trying to keep up w @DemaryiusT,” Mr. Udall tweeted Wednesday, referring to Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.

Though Mrs. Murray laughed when she was asked whether she had any inside information, the prediction could be an indication that the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman has done her homework.

The last time Manning, the Broncos quarterback, played in a Super Bowl, in 2010, his Indianapolis Colts were favored against the New Orleans Saints. Oddsmakers are giving the edge to the Broncos this year.

That year was also the last time two No. 1 seeds advanced to the Super Bowl until the Seahawks and Broncos did so this year.

With just over three minutes left in Super Bowl XLIV, the Saints’ Tracy Porter picked off a pass from Manning and scored on a 74-yard interception return, effectively clinching the 31-17 Saints win.
