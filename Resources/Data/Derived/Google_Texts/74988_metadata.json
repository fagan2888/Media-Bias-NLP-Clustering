She is not seeking re-election. Former U.S. Attorney Ken Sukhia is one of the four who want the job. He says he got into the race because he felt that America was decending into socialism and secularism. \"I figure life is short and I wanted to participate in the battle to save our American principles and way of life\" Sukhia said. \"I think I have a responsiblity to do our part to fight that battle\". America is facing some tough issues this year. Sukhia says the top two issues would be National Defense and fighting terrorism. \"We have a serious problem with terrorism at our doorstep, now as U.S. Attorney, I put foreign and domestic terrorists behind bars, Sukhia said, so one of the things that I believe I know how to address is the terrorism issue\". The Tallahassee attorney says he thinks we can defeat ISIS and cripple them to a point that they are no longer a threat to us. \"But it has to be done with resolve and with purpose, Sukhia Said, and unfortunately that's not what we have seen out of Washington lately\". \"I believe we have some fine candidates, but I am the only candidate who has actually fought on the front lines for the conservative causes we hold dear and have fought on those front lines all my life\". \"I fought Obamacare, I fought terrorism, I fought illegal immigration, I put illegal immigrants behind bars, I fought the Federal government in the last 23 years representing companies and individuals facing their oppressive regulations\" Sukhia said of his experience. \"I fought for the internet decency act when I went to Washington, on my own dime, I went to Washington to testify on behalf of Terry Schiavo that she might be given a right to life\". Ken Sukhia also represented the militry with President George W. Bush in the 2000 election recount battle, as his Federal Council. Sukhia faces three other Republicans in the August 30th election.
