I wouldn't really talk to anyone. I feel like now I'm more outgoing,\" said McLymore.\n\nMcLymore's success plays a big part in that.\n\n\"I actually like being in front of people now, like big crowds or whatever,\" said McLymore.\n\nBig crowds certainly didn't bother Mclymore at the USA Karate Junior National championships in July. The 17-year-old rising senior won a bronze in sparring and that earned him an alternate spot on the USA team heading to the Pan Am Junior Games held at the end of August in Peru.\n\n\"I am not usually one to get emotional. But there may may have been a quick tear or two, not more than that. I was really proud,\" said McLymore.\n\nMcLymore has been studying karate for nine years now at Mo's Karate in Cary and he's not the only member of the dojo to bring home a medal. Three other students, Dakota Marquess, Daniel Puertolos and Cameron Marquess, brought home a total of one bronze, three silvers and a gold in their age groups but their divisions were not eligible for the Pan Am team.\n\n\"I had fun, because we would cheer each other on when we were not competing,\" said 12-year-old Dakota Marquess.\n\n\"It would have been awesome to win, but even getting second in a competition that high-level, it really meant a lot to me and helped boost my confidence a lot,\" said 14-year-old Cameron Marquess.\n\n\"All of us are like one team - come to the class together, practice together,\" said Mo's Karate Sensei Mohsen Mahmoud. \"They love each other, and that is the good thing that makes them good.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just the students, Mahmoud won his fifth USA title in the senior division.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-08-23 18:48:53", "description": "Cary High's Kenneth McLymore won a bronze medal at nationals in sparring in July, earning him a spot as an alternate on the USA team heading to the Pan Am Junior Games in Peru.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-08-23 18:48:53", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13919123|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cary High's Kenneth McLymore won a bronze medal at nationals in sparring in July, earning him a spot as an alternate on the USA team heading to the Pan Am Junior Games in Peru.", "title": "Cary's McLymore earning national karate success :: WRALSportsFan.com", "url": "http://www.wralsportsfan.com/cary-s-mclymore-earning-national-karate-success/13919123/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wralsportsfan.com/asset/boxing/2014/08/23/13919124/13919124-1408833788-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wralsportsfan", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-23T18:48:53-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRALSportsFan.com", "description": "Cary High's Kenneth McLymore won a bronze medal at nationals in sparring in July, earning him a spot as an alternate on the USA team heading to the Pan Am Junior Games in Peru.", "title": "Cary's McLymore earning national karate success :: WRALSportsFan.com", "url": "http://www.wralsportsfan.com/cary-s-mclymore-earning-national-karate-success/13919123/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wralsportsfan.com/asset/boxing/2014/08/23/13919124/88774-picture-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "Big crowds certainly didn't bother Mclymore at the USA Karate Junior National championships in July.\nMcLymore has been studying karate for nine years now at Mo's Karate in Cary and he's not the only member of the dojo to bring home a medal.\n\"All of us are like one team - come to the class together, practice together,\" said Mo's Karate Sensei Mohsen Mahmoud.\nAnd it wasn't just the students, Mahmoud won his fifth USA title in the senior division.\n\"I actually like being in front of people now, like big crowds or whatever,\" said McLymore."}
