( Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nAs we continue to marvel at the success of the far-right rabble in the House Republican caucus in getting Speaker John Boehner to give up the gavel and go home to Ohio, I\u2019m still stuck on an observation made by my highly placed source on Capitol Hill when we spoke on Sunday. \u201cWill the opposition stop yelling long enough to organize and take power?\u201d asked the source. \u201cThey seem content to stay outside and throw rocks.\u201d\n\nOp-ed pieces in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday add some historical context to that astute view. They both illuminate the problem with the so-called Freedom Caucus and why it will never go beyond causing chaos in congress.\n\n[GOP caucus chaos: Where\u2019s the Whip when you need one?]\n\n\u201cThe extremists have the ability to disrupt the congress, but not to lead it,\u201d writes Geoffrey Kabaservice in a column for the Times. \u201cTheir belief that shutdowns will secure real concessions is magical thinking, not legislative realism. And the more power they gain, the less likely it becomes that a Republican-controlled Congress can pass conservative legislation, or indeed any legislation at all.\u201d\n\nKabaservice is the author of \u201cRule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party.\u201d His Times piece draws a parallel between what is happening today with what happened in the 1960s. Then, the \u201cradicals\u201d who rallied around the presidential campaign of Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) \u201chad no interest in developing a governing agenda.\u201d Today, \u201c[t]he radicals have no realistic alternative solutions of their own. Even to contemplate the negotiations and compromises such policies entail would sully their ideological purity.\u201d\n\n[McCarthy will get whipped like Boehner and Cantor]\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kimberley Strassel contrasts the current Republican revolutionaries with those of 1994. She runs down the history of the \u201crebellion\u201d that started in 1989 led by then-Rep. Newt Gingrich (Ga.) and culminated in his rise to speaker of the House when the GOP took over the chamber for the first time in 40 years. \u201cNow, that\u2019s an insurgency,\u201d Strassel writes before asking the pertinent question. \u201cWhere is today\u2019s Newt Gingrich?\u201d\n\nThat gets to the heart of what my source said. There is a lot of complaining about the GOP leadership, but its far-right opposition doesn\u2019t have enough gumption to rally around one of its own to lead the caucus. \u201cThe Boehner opposition has demands, but it hasn\u2019t been willing or able to stand up a candidate who will persuade 218 Republicans to follow,\u201d Strassel explains. \u201cIt can obstruct the leadership agenda but can\u2019t elect its own leaders.\u201d\n\nThe lower leadership posts of majority leader and majority whip will field suitably hard-line conservative candidates. But the fact remains that beyond defund Planned Parenthood, repeal Obamacare, kill the Export-Import Bank and whatever else has \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cend\u201d as its legislative raison d\u2019etre, the Republican House majority is neither about compromise nor governing. McCarthy\u2019s reputation for back-slapping bonhomie and his role in bringing the Tea Party revolution into the House means that a bad situation could get worse.\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThey seem content to stay outside and throw rocks.\u201d", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\u201cThey seem content to stay outside and throw rocks.\u201d", "title": "This ain\u2019t your dad\u2019s Republican Revolution", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/29/this-aint-your-dads-republican-revolution/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/files/2013/10/boehner4.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@capehartj"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/09/29/this-aint-your-dads-republican-revolution/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "boehner resigns; boehner resignation; kevin mccarthy; house majority leader mccarthy; house majority whip; majority whip mccarthy; kimberley strassel; geoffrey kabaservice; kabaservice new york times; strassel wall street journal; strassel republican party; kabaservice republican party; barry goldwater; rule and ruin kabaservice", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "boehner resigns; boehner resignation; kevin mccarthy; house majority leader mccarthy; house majority whip; majority whip mccarthy; kimberley strassel; geoffrey kabaservice; kabaservice new york times; strassel wall street journal; strassel republican party; kabaservice republican party; barry goldwater; rule and ruin kabaservice"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ab6\"", "article_summary": "House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), left, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\u201cIt can obstruct the leadership agenda but can\u2019t elect its own leaders.\u201dThe lower leadership posts of majority leader and majority whip will field suitably hard-line conservative candidates.\nBut the fact remains that beyond defund Planned Parenthood, repeal Obamacare, kill the Export-Import Bank and whatever else has \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cend\u201d as its legislative raison d\u2019etre, the Republican House majority is neither about compromise nor governing.\nMcCarthy\u2019s reputation for back-slapping bonhomie and his role in bringing the Tea Party revolution into the House means that a bad situation could get worse.\nThey both illuminate the problem with the so-called Freedom Caucus and why it will never go beyond causing chaos in congress."}
