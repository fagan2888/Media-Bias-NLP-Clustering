At the top was a letter, announcing that \u201cemails in the enclosed documents which use the account name \u2018Lew Alcindor\u2019 (Abdul-Jabbar) denote emails to or from Attorney General Eric Holder.\u201d\n\nRelated Image Expand / Contract\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d said Leopold, who was seeking DOJ emails regarding a request for the agency to open a probe into charges that the CIA had been spying on the Senate intelligence committee staff. Leopold broke the story about the bizarre Holder-Alcindor alias for VICE News on Thursday.\n\n\u201cPeople may say, \u2018what\u2019s the big deal?\u2019 but this is so important,\u201d Leopold tells FoxNews.com. He insists that using an alias might complicate document searches, pointing out that the emails he received don\u2019t even mention Holder\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cIt raises the question of whether they are trying to thwart public records requests and the Federal Records Act. It just seems shady.\u201d\n\nBut DOJ insists the practice is above-board and legal, and top officials across the administration use aliases all the time to screen out spammers and unwanted emails.\n\nHolder had two others during his tenure, both of which had to be changed due to breaches, a DOJ spokesman told FoxNews.com. Aliases are used because it is too easy for people to figure out officals\u2019 emails using the .usdoj.gov domain, he said.\n\nThis was not the first time the Holder aliases have been reported. Former DOJ spokesman Brian Fallon confirmed them in May, although he would only say that one was based on \u201can athlete.\u201d Holder left the agency in April of 2015 and was replaced by Loretta Lynch, who, incidentally, has an alias as well.\n\n\u201c(Holder\u2019s) addresses were known to DOJ officials handling Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and congressional inquiries,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe FOIA office specifically notes when emails are from the Attorney General.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he added, there is no possibility that FOIA requests are being thwarted, as Leopold suggests. \u201cThat is about keeping the wrong people from getting the Attorney General\u2019s email address. The people who archive these files know what his name is.\u201d\n\nCalls to the public affairs group handling Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s press were not returned by press time. The NBA\u2019s all time scorer, 19-time All-Star and six-time MVP has been called a renaissance man, writing books and an opinion column, as well as getting out in front on political and cultural issues. After a visit to Holder\u2019s office last year to film a documentary on race, Holder\u2019s aide made it clear that Holder is a fan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the AG\u2019s hero, and he revolutionized the sport,\u201d Margaret Richardson, Holder\u2019s chief of staff at the time, told The Washington Post.\n\nLeopold doubts he would have received the \u201cAlcindor\u201d emails if his request hadn\u2019t risen to the level of a lawsuit. As someone who has filed hundreds of FOIA requests in the last three years, he believes the use of any alias will only frustrate the process.\n\n\u201cFor an administration that claims to be transparent, this completely contradicts that,\u201d he said, noting the aftermath of Hillary Clinton using her own private email and server to conduct official business when she was Secretary of State.\n\nLaura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), told VICE that the practice of using aliases was fairly widespread.\n\n\u201cThere is no prohibition against it, so long as they can be linked to the actual name,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nKelley Vlahos contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Cabinet,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/White House", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-26 04:07:01 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Former Attorney General Eric Holder not only used an email alias to conduct formal agency business, but appropriated the birth name of one of his idols, NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, according to the Department of Justice.", "twitter": {"description": "Former Attorney General Eric Holder not only used an email alias to conduct formal agency business, but appropriated the birth name of one of his idols, NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, according to the Department of Justice.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/26/eric-holder-aka-lew-alcindor.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2016/02/26/eric-holder-aka-lew-alcindor/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1456513943277.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Eric Holder aka Lew Alcindor?", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Cabinet\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/White House\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Eric Holder aka Lew Alcindor?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2016/02/26/eric-holder-aka-lew-alcindor/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1456513943277.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-26T18:56:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/26/eric-holder-aka-lew-alcindor.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"3019e183-dde8-4eb8-9435-e1b5d9d1f92b\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Former Attorney General Eric Holder not only used an email alias to conduct formal agency business, but appropriated the birth name of one of his idols, NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, according to the Department of Justice.", "dc.identifier": "3019e183-dde8-4eb8-9435-e1b5d9d1f92b", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "cabinet,whitehouse", "description": "Former Attorney General Eric Holder not only used an email alias to conduct formal agency business, but appropriated the birth name of one of his idols, NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, according to the Department of Justice.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Eric Holder Aka Lew Alcindor?", "dcterms.created": "2016-02-26 04:07:01 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Former Attorney General Eric Holder not only used an email alias to conduct formal agency business, but appropriated the birth name of one of his idols, NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, according to the Department of Justice.", "title": "Eric Holder aka Lew Alcindor?
