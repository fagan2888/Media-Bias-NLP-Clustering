On April 19, 1995, 168 people were killed and 680 injured in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City—leaving the country in mourning and in shock.

The blast damaged or destroyed 324 buildings, ruined 86 cars and shattered 258 windows in nearby buildings. It was the work of two domestic terrorists, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.

Today, 20 years later, we take a look back at the destruction and lives changed—and lost—by the terrorist attack.
