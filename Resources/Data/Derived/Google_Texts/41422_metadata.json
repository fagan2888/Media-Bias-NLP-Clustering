Pancrase is a prestigious Japanese-based mixed martial arts promotions company.\n\nRitch said his popularity is high in the Asian country because he competed as a professional wrestler there in the early 2000s. He participated in a pair of different circuits, Battlarts and the New Japan Pro Wrestling. \u201cPeople there will mob me for my autograph and to get a picture with me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people in Japan though are so polite. They will wait for their turn. I don\u2019t know how they know it, but they know when my flight will come in and they will wait at the airport...they know what hotel I\u2019m staying at and they will wait there for me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m treated like a rock star there. But I don\u2019t mind it at all. I\u2019ll do anything for the fans. Sometimes I have autographed cards and hats to give them.\u201d\n\nRitch, who was unbeaten in nine fights in 2014, has only fought once so far this year. That\u2019s because he tore the labrum in his shoulder in January during a fight in Phoenix.\n\nThough Ritch said he was dominating the bout, his opponent Shonie Carter was awarded a technical knockout as his injury prevented him from continuing into the second round. Instead of surgery to repair his shoulder, Ritch had Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), a revolutionary procedure involving the injection of his own blood. \u201cI\u2019m in great shape now,\u201d said Ritch, who opened his own school, Cannon Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, in Glendale this past December. The school has about 35 members. \u201cWe\u2019re just killing it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re kicking everybody\u2019s ass in every competition we go to.\u201d\n\nAs for Ritch, there is some question as to how many MMA fights he has had in his pro career, which began in 1991.He said he has had 202 pro fights and has a record of 112-88-2. But Pancrase 269 officials are billing his record as 53-78-0.\n\nSato, who is also currently a pro wrestler, has a MMA record of 22-21-4.\n\nRitch has only seen tapes of some of Sato\u2019s fights. But he knows what his game plan will be going in. \u201cI\u2019m going to try and keep it as a stand-up fight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also good at the wrestling parts, but I know that\u2019s what he is really good at.\u201d\n\nRELATED: One-Eared Native Boxer Killing It in MMA\n\nAnd though he\u2019s approaching the quarter-century mark in his pro career, Ritch has not thought of retiring any time soon.\u201cI\u2019m going to be 45 in September,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as my body holds up, and as long as I keep winning, I will keep at this. My desire is still there and my technique is still there. If I can get my cardio up, I feel like I can beat anybody.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shannon Ritch, the 44-year-old mixed martial artist with Choctaw ancestry is gearing up for his next fight, scheduled Aug. 9 in Tokyo.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/16/choctaw-mma-rock-star-huge-japan-161096", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/shannon_ritch.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Choctaw MMA Rock Star Is Huge in Japan"}, "abstract": "Shannon Ritch, the 44-year-old mixed martial artist with Choctaw ancestry is gearing up for his next fight, scheduled Aug. 9 in Tokyo.", "keywords": "MMA, Shannon Ritch, Japan, Yokyo, Pancrase 269, New Japan Pro Wrestling, Hikaru Sato, light heavyweight bout", "dc": {"title": "Choctaw MMA Rock Star Is Huge in Japan"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/16/choctaw-mma-rock-star-huge-japan-161096", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-07-16T10:47-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Choctaw MMA Rock Star Is Huge in Japan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1a8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m not really famous here in the United States, but in Japan, I\u2019m really famous,\u201d said Ritch, who lives in Glendale, Ariz. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay, that people don\u2019t really know me in the U.S.\nShannon Ritch, the 44-year-old mixed martial artist with Choctaw ancestry is gearing up for his next fight, scheduled Aug. 9 in Tokyo.\nHe participated in a pair of different circuits, Battlarts and the New Japan Pro Wrestling.\nRitch said his popularity is high in the Asian country because he competed as a professional wrestler there in the early 2000s.\nSato, who is also currently a pro wrestler, has a MMA record of 22-21-4."}
