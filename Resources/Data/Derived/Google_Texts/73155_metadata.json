The rule was published in the July 15 Federal Register, with comments due Sept. 8 (80 Fed. Reg. 41,685).\n\nAdditionally, the proposed rule would clarify the requirement that arrangements seeking a Stark law exception be set out in writing, noting that the arrangements don't need to be documented through a formal contract and can instead qualify for the exception through a collection of multiple documents \u201cevidencing the course of conduct between the parties.\u201d\n\nEasing Technical Burdens\n\nDanielle Sloane, an attorney with Bass, Berry & Sims PLC, Nashville, Tenn., told Bloomberg BNA July 9 that the proposed Stark provisions are a very good step for the health-care industry.\n\n\u201cCMS is saying \u2018we recognize some of the technical burdens of the Stark law, and we'll clean it up,'\u201d Sloane said.\n\nSloane said the CMS has a large backlog of Stark law self-disclosures, which has given the agency insight into typical arrangements, most of which present no risk.\n\n\u201cThe proposed rule doesn't alleviate the need to comply with Stark, but it does alleviate the need to self-disclose for technical violations,\u201d Sloane said. \u201cThis is a huge step toward easing Stark enforcement.\u201d\n\nLinda A. Baumann, an attorney with Arent Fox LLP in Washington, told Bloomberg BNA July 13 that the Stark provisions also represent a chance for the health-care industry to help shape the regulations.\n\n\u201cThe provisions include multiple specific opportunities to provide comment, and the CMS seems to be very open and amenable to accepting them,\u201d Baumann said.\n\nBaumann said she hoped health-care providers would take advantage of the chance to comment on the provisions, noting that the volume of comments can help make a difference.\n\nBeyond the expanded opportunities to comment, Baumann said the Stark provisions may represent an attempt by the CMS to reform the Stark law before Congress takes action.\n\n\u201cThe Stark law has nothing to do with quality of care, and maybe it's gone too far,\u201d Baumann said.\n\nThe Stark law prohibits Medicare self-referrals, which occur when a provider refers Medicare patients to entities with which the provider or his or her immediate family members have a financial relationship.\n\nThe proposed physician payment rule would begin implementing a new performance-based Medicare reimbursement system for doctors and other providers.\n\nWriting Requirement\n\nKevin G. McAnaney, of the Law Office of Kevin G. McAnaney in New York, agreed that the new written requirements describing why an arrangement merits a Stark exception address a significant portion of Stark violations caused by simple mistakes.\n\n\u201cConfirmation that the writing can be satisfied by multiple documents, the 90-day grace period to get signatures and the extended holdover safe harbor will go far to eliminate the most senseless and irritating Stark violations,\u201d McAnaney told Bloomberg BNA July 9.\n\nAccording to an agency fact sheet, the CMS proposes to allow a 90-day grace period to obtain missing signatures from an arrangement without regard to whether the failure to obtain the signatures was inadvertent. Under current regulations, parties have up to 90 days to sign a compensation arrangement if the failure was inadvertent, but only 30 days if it was deliberate.\n\nThe holdover provision would permit an arrangement that satisfies the requirements of a Stark exception to continue indefinitely after expiration, assuming it still meets the conditions of the exception. Currently, holdover arrangements can continue for six months after the arrangement's expiration.\n\n\u201cThe notice signals that CMS understands that the key Stark requirements are the financial terms of the arrangement and not the ticky-tacky writing requirements, which simply confirm the financial terms are met,\u201d McAnaney said.\n\nPayments Exception\n\nAs for the new hospital subsidy exception, the CMS said it was necessary due to shortages of primary-care physicians, especially in rural areas, coupled with more people receiving insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe believe that employing a nonphysician practitioner (rather than merely contracting on an independent basis with a nonphysician practitioner) indicates a commitment by the physician to increase the availability of patient care services to his or her patients on an ongoing basis and, as such, is an important safeguard against program and patient abuse,\u201d the proposed rule said.\n\nTo guard against any abuse, the proposed rule said any arrangement covered by the exception couldn't be \u201cconditioned on the physician's or the nonphysician practitioner's referral of patients to the hospital providing the remuneration.\u201d\n\nThe hospital payments exception would only apply in cases where the nonphysician practitioner was a bona fide employee of the physician receiving payment from the hospital, and where the purpose of the nonphysician practitioner was to provide primary care services to the physician's patients.\n\nThe proposed rule defined nonphysician practitioners to include only physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives.\n\nSubsidy Limits\n\nHospitals would only be able to make payments earmarked for nonphysician practitioner employment for the first two years of employment, and the amount of the payment would be capped at either 50 percent of the salary, signing bonus and benefits of the nonphysician practitioner or a figure reached by subtracting the value of services performed by the nonphysician practitioner from his or her overall salary, signing bonus and benefits, whichever amount was lowest.\n\nIn addition, the proposed rule laid out two alternatives for establishing a minimum level of primary care service provided by the nonphysician practitioner.\n\nUnder one alternative, 90 percent of a nonphysician practitioner's patient services would have to be primary care, while in the other alternative at least 75 percent of a nonphysician practitioner's patient services would have to be primary care.\n\nThe CMS also asked for comments on whether the payments exception should be extended to include payments to physicians to help them employ nonphysician practitioners as independent contractors.\n\nTimeshare Arrangements\n\nThe second new Stark exception concerns timeshare arrangements, in which a hospital provides a physician with a fully furnished office.\n\nUnder the new exception, timeshare arrangements would be afforded a safe harbor if they met certain conditions, including:\n\n\u2022 the arrangement is in writing, is signed by all interested parties and covers all equipment and office space used;\n\n\u2022 the arrangement is between a hospital or physician organization and a physician;\n\n\u2022 the office space is used by the physician primarily to perform patient evaluation and management services;\n\n\u2022 any equipment covered by the arrangement is located in the office space;\n\n\u2022 the timeshare arrangement is not contingent on referrals;\n\n\u2022 the arrangement's compensation is set in advance; and\n\n\u2022 the arrangement would be commercially reasonable even if no referrals were conducted.\n\n\u201cWe believe that timeshare arrangements that include the use of office space can be structured in a way that does not post a risk of program or patient abuse,\u201d the proposed rule said.\n\nHospital Recruiting\n\nThe proposed rule would also revise a Stark exception allowing rural hospitals, FQHCs and RHCs to pay physicians recruiting bonuses by defining their geographic area.\n\nThe proposed rule included two potential approaches to defining geographic area \u201cin recognition that rural hospitals, FQHCs, and RHCs often serve patients who are dispersed in wider geographic areas and may need to recruit physicians into more remote areas in order to achieve their goals of providing needed services to the communities they serve.\u201d\n\nUnder one approach, the geographic area would be defined as the \u201clowest number of contiguous zip codes from which the FQHC or RHC draws at least 90 percent of its patients.\u201d\n\nThe second approach would define the geographic areas as the lowest number of contiguous or non contiguous ZIP codes.\n\nThe proposed rule also included a request for comments on a series of questions pertaining to the role of the Stark law as the health-care system transitions to a value-based payment methodology.\n\nFor instance, the CMS asked whether the Stark law is an obstacle to clinical and financial integration, and whether there's a need for new exceptions to fit with alternative payment methods.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: James Swann in Washington at jswann1@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brian Broderick at bbroderick@bna.com\n\nThe 2016 proposed physician fee schedule rule is at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-07-15/pdf/2015-16875.pdf.\n\nA CMS fact sheet is at http://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2015-Fact-sheets-items/2015-07-08.html.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/cms-proposal-creates-n17179933809/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "The 2016 proposed physician fee schedule rule would create new exceptions under the physician self-referral law, also known as the Stark law, in addition to easing...", "title": "CMS Proposal Creates Self-Referral Exceptions"}, "csrf-token": "BsU7ceY8hMqFGzvigoixQXjO7l9MYgc-T9zdYALGlioG_zMq-Ge3TNxrMQHtUWPrDTj0ofV10kEDm-VlCYmpAEXvpX2QB1jHMFihBJEm7Cs1:HhqhWqbCjo7rvxiMcE2-h1mIp1EY1HhwcqK3Y4LIuIalzVoSc2UsSMH06DtmN2yP5FlUk6rJRjnTOxZZWlToccMpnl8NA-kyAGktoRlPHLc1", "description": "The 2016 proposed physician fee schedule rule would create new exceptions under the physician self-referral law, also known as the Stark law, in addition to easing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCMS is saying \u2018we recognize some of the technical burdens of the Stark law, and we'll clean it up,'\u201d Sloane said.\n\u201cThe Stark law has nothing to do with quality of care, and maybe it's gone too far,\u201d Baumann said.\nBy James SwannJuly 9 \u2014 The 2016 proposed physician fee schedule rule would create new exceptions under the physician self-referral law, also known as the Stark law, in addition to easing compliance burdens.\nFor instance, the CMS asked whether the Stark law is an obstacle to clinical and financial integration, and whether there's a need for new exceptions to fit with alternative payment methods.\nThe proposed physician payment rule would begin implementing a new performance-based Medicare reimbursement system for doctors and other providers."}
