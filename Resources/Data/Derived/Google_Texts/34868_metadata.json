He was then taken by American Medical Response ambulance to a Topeka hospital with injuries that were considered serious.\n\nLawrenz was alert and talking before he was taken to the hospital.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Phil Anderson", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "A man suffered serious injuries Saturday when a grappling hook grabbed the cab of the pickup truck he was in at a salvage yard in northeast Topeka, authorities said. \r\nShawnee County sheriff's Cpl.", "title": "Man seriously hurt Saturday when hydraulic claw grabbed pickup cab at Topeka salvage yard", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2013-10-19/man-seriously-hurt-hydraulic-claw-grabs-pickup-cab-topeka-salvage-yard", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/lead_photo/baileys.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "A man suffered serious injuries Saturday when a grappling hook grabbed the cab of the pickup truck he was in at a salvage yard in northeast Topeka, authorities said.Shawnee County sheriff\u2019s Cpl.
