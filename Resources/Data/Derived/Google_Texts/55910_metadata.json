TeamSTEPPS, a teamwork-focused quality curriculum that focuses on patient safety, is thus an in-demand tool, with Day 1 of the TeamSTEPPS National Conference bringing out more than 800 attendees to explore the methodology.\n\nSessions ranged from getting C-suite leaders to see the value in TeamSTEPPS to tailoring it to the ambulatory setting; as well as to workshops that exemplified how to integrate specific quality improvement methods within teams.\n\nDuring the latter, a room packed with nurses, physicians and those with \u201cquality\u201d in their titles learned how to marry TeamSTEPPS ideas with Lean principles, and discovered through group exercises the value in shared tenets of the two schools of thought. Together, groups devised process maps for hypothetical case studies, learned firsthand the value of the Five S\u2019s \u2014 Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize and Sustain (through a humbling exercise of trying to chronologically follow numbers that were displayed in random assortments), and discussed the importance of tailoring other tools to the health care environment, including PDCA (plan-do-check-act), root cause analysis and the Seven Wastes of Lean manufacturing. Robert Martin, an organizational psychologist at UCLA Health, noted that UCLA added an eighth waste: not utilizing talent, which, for example, makes the case for the loss that occurs when a nurse spends more time making charts than at a patient\u2019s bed.\n\nLori Scanlan-Hanson, a registered nurse and quality specialist at the Mayo Clinic, was excited to see quality methodologies being taught at a STEPPS conference.\n\n\u201cThe methodology of quality combined with the methodology of TeamSTEPPS is absolutely attainable,\u201d she said. \u201cThe two very clearly support each other. I would like to see TeamSTEPPS go further; I\u2019d like to see it implemented across our institution more consistently, and since we have a really robust quality education, I think the way to go is to just integrate the two.\u201d\n\nScanlon-Hanson said that the value in these philosophies boils down to two elements that are ultimately crucial in getting better outcomes: trust and safety.\n\n\u201cIs there a sense of trust built within the team [that is] doing the work? That all goes back to quality outcomes,\u201d she said. \u201cThat culture of safety we know nationally is on everybody\u2019s mind. So, you build a culture of safety through programs like TeamSTEPPS and through quality applications.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Day 1 of the TeamSTEPPS National Conference showed attendees how they could make a case for implementing the quality methodology to the C-suite, in ambulatory settings and how to marry it with Lean.", "csrf-token": "yUSvVvtsUnvpQoQkuhG5HistUjk2DjfRpXjRVnQ7HTU=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/June/STEPPs_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "description": "Clinical leaders gathered at the TeamSTEPPS National Conference made a strong pitch to the C-suite for building the quality program into the fabric of their organizations.", "card": "summary", "title": "TeamSTEPPS and Lean: A Marriage Made in Heaven"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/June/STEPPs_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "type": "Article", "description": "Clinical leaders gathered at the TeamSTEPPS National Conference made a strong pitch to the C-suite for building the quality program into the fabric of their organizations.", "title": "TeamSTEPPS and Lean: A Marriage Made in Heaven"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "TeamSTEPPS National Conference, TeamSTEPPS Lean manufacturing, quality healthcare lean, patient safety TeamSTEPPS hospitals, PDCA hospitals", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde21\"", "article_summary": "DENVER \u2014 With health care payments becoming increasingly tied to quality outcomes, hospital and health system leaders are more focused than ever on putting a premium on high-value patient care.\nThat all goes back to quality outcomes,\u201d she said.\nSo, you build a culture of safety through programs like TeamSTEPPS and through quality applications.\u201d\nRobert Martin, an organizational psychologist at UCLA Health, noted that UCLA added an eighth waste: not utilizing talent, which, for example, makes the case for the loss that occurs when a nurse spends more time making charts than at a patient\u2019s bed.\nLori Scanlan-Hanson, a registered nurse and quality specialist at the Mayo Clinic, was excited to see quality methodologies being taught at a STEPPS conference."}
