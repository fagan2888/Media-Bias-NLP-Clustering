A study by the New York Federal Reserve offers some new evidence that the latter group is correct. According to the study\u2019s authors:\n\nWe find that institutions more exposed to changes in the subsidized federal loan program increased their tuition disproportionately around these policy changes, with a sizable pass-through effect on tuition of about 65 percent. We also find that Pell Grant aid and the unsubsidized federal loan program have pass-through effects on tuition, although these are economically and statistically not as strong.\n\nThe argument goes like this: Since government aid programs make it easier for students to pay the sticker price of admission, no matter how high that price rises, universities have every incentive to respond by charging more. The universities have little to worry about\u2014they get paid up front, regardless of how difficult it is for the students to repay the government (or the government\u2019s actual creditors: the U.S. taxpayer).\n\nThe new study does indeed find evidence of this connection between loans and price gouging. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s write-up portrays the issue as analogous to the housing bubble:\n\nImagine a scenario in which the federal government helps households pursue the American dream with ultra-loose credit, only to see prices skyrocket and families take on loads of debt they can\u2019t repay. Yes, it sounds like the housing market of a decade ago, but some say it is also the challenge of today\u2019s higher-education system.\n\nWSJ also takes note of some of the study\u2019s limitations, which nevertheless suggest that federal aid\u2019s distorting effect on tuition prices might be even more powerful:\n\nOne thing the latest research doesn\u2019t address is the effect of student aid on graduate-school tuitions, which have disproportionately driven the surge in student borrowing. And grad school is perhaps where the market is most distorted by federal policies. The federal government limits how much undergrads can borrow\u2014up to $57,500 total\u2014but doesn\u2019t for grad students, who can borrow to cover any amount their schools charges through a decade-old program known as Grad PLUS. Economists say that has given institutions unprecedented pricing power. Debt-forgiveness programs also could be desensitizing grad students to high prices.\n\nAndrew Gillen, a researcher for the Charles Koch Foundation who has studied the economics of higher education for years, told WSJ that graduate school tuition hikes didn\u2019t outpace undergraduate tuition hikes until after the implementation of Grad PLUS\u2014implying that easier access to federal dollars is indeed a likely culprit.\n\nThe implications of these findings are massive. Liberal policymakers\u2014President Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren among them\u2014shouldn\u2019t be let off the hook when they offer young people (and some middle-aged and even old people) the same tired promises about making higher education more affordable. College becomes less affordable with each passing day, and federal intervention is at least partly to blame.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Driving up tuition prices.", "title": "Study: Yes, Student Loans Are Making College More Expensive", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/03/study-yes-student-loans-are-making-colle", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14386346401094.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Driving up tuition prices.", "title": "Study: Yes, Student Loans Are Making College More Expensive", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14386346401094.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Economics", "published_time": "2015-08-03T20:54:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Debt-forgiveness programs also could be desensitizing grad students to high prices.\nWe also find that Pell Grant aid and the unsubsidized federal loan program have pass-through effects on tuition, although these are economically and statistically not as strong.\nA study by the New York Federal Reserve offers some new evidence that the latter group is correct.\nThe new study does indeed find evidence of this connection between loans and price gouging.\nCollege becomes less affordable with each passing day, and federal intervention is at least partly to blame."}
