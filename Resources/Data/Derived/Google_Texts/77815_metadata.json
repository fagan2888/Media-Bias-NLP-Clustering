It might have \u201cshape memory\u201d to instantly mold to a specific man. Or it might come with pull tabs so a man could slip it on with little fuss.\n\nThose ideas are among the winners announced Wednesday by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation of a contest to create a condom that men would actually use. The contest, the foundation said, aimed to decrease unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases with \u201ca next-generation condom that significantly preserves or enhances pleasure.\u201d\n\nThe foundation received 812 applications, chose 11 and awarded the winners $100,000 each. They could receive up to $1 million after they develop the ideas. Steven Buchsbaum, a Gates Foundation official, said winners ranged from a longtime condom manufacturer in India to American chemical engineers to British design consultants whose previous work included vacuum cleaners.\n\nMany ideas involved materials besides latex, aiming for thinner, stronger, less constricting condoms with better sensation, \u201creducing the loving distance between partners, so they will be more close,\u201d said Dr. Papa Salif Sow, a Gates senior program officer. Other ideas focused on \u201chow to improve the donning,\u201d he said, because \u201cin sub-Saharan Africa, sex is basically done with low light and it might be very difficult to see the direction of the condom.\u201d\n\nWinners include the \u201cultrasensitive reconstituted collagen condom\u201d proposed by Apex Medical Technologies in San Diego. Apex\u2019s president, Mark McGlothlin, said his product would feel like skin and be made from collagen fibers from cows\u2019 Achilles tendons or possibly fish skin.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re unbelievably strong,\u201d said Mr. McGlothlin, who currently gets beef tendon from a Vietnamese grocery. \u201cI could yank all day and not break this thing.\u201d\n\nA \u201cwrapping condom\u201d proposal by the California Family Health Council in Los Angeles will build on a version manufactured in Colombia, made of polyethylene plastic that \u201cclings like Saran Wrap rather than squeezes,\u201d according to Ron Frezieres, the council\u2019s vice president for research. It would come in three-packs the size of a credit card and almost as thin, he said, and, like another grant winner called the Rapidom, would have pull tabs to \u201ckeep you from being confused about which way to put it on,\u201d Mr. Frezieres added.\n\nAt least two winners will work with polyurethane, including Richard Chartoff, a University of Oregon chemical engineer, who foresees a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d design having shape memory to \u201cfit like an extra layer of skin, conforming to the shape.\u201d He is also considering adding nanoparticles containing antiviral or antibacterial drugs, and, more prosaically, offering different colors.\n\nStephen Ward, a Gates Foundation program officer, said that among the problems tackled were \u201cimproving lubrication, internal friction, external friction, heat transfer.\u201d\n\nTwo or more grantees might be teamed to make one design, he added. \u201cThere\u2019s not one magic bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is making them easier for people to use in the moment, in the dark, whatever situation they\u2019re in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/11/22nyt-condoms-acropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Gates Foundation issued design challenge, to bump up just 5% usage"}, "article_summary": "Those ideas are among the winners announced Wednesday by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation of a contest to create a condom that men would actually use.\nBy Channon Hodge and Pam BelluckThe New York TimesThe condom of the future might be made of cow tendon or fish skin.\nSteven Buchsbaum, a Gates Foundation official, said winners ranged from a longtime condom manufacturer in India to American chemical engineers to British design consultants whose previous work included vacuum cleaners.\n\u201cThe idea is making them easier for people to use in the moment, in the dark, whatever situation they\u2019re in.\u201d\nOr it might come with pull tabs so a man could slip it on with little fuss."}
