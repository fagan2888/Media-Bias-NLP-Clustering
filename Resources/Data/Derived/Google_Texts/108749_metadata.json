Last week, I rode to the Buccaneers game.\u201d\n\nAs The Tattered Saints tore into a lively rendition of \u201cRun, Run Rudolph,\u201d bicyclists browsed food vendors Rollin\u2019 Zoinks, Nico\u2019s Arepas Grill, American Weiner and Small Batch Ice Cream.\n\nNear a long row of sky-blue bikes, Eric Trull, Coast\u2019s program director, showed people how the rental program works.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have just over 100 bikes available to the public,\u201d Trull said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be scaling it up as demand dictates, and we can go as many as 300 bikes\u201d if needed.\n\nCoast offers regular annual memberships for $79; monthly memberships for $30; or daily for $5. Those plans allow up to an hour\u2019s use a day; the average bike-share trip is 14 minutes. Information about membership and other aspects of the program can be found at coastbikeshare.com.\n\nTechnology on the bikes allows riders to either swipe a card or punch in an account number, allowing them to unlock the bikes and go.\n\nCoast\u2019s bikes are now available around downtown, Hyde Park, Ybor City, Davis Island and the Channel district, but the program could expand to areas like West Shore and Seminole Heights.\n\nTampa is providing space on city rights of way, but taxpayers aren\u2019t contributing to the project.\n\nTo Ken Sides, an engineer in Tampa, Coast\u2019s launch was indicative of the city\u2019s \u201ctransition from a backwater town to a happening place to be.\u201d\n\nSides seemed most excited about the \u201cconnectivity\u201d that the bike rental program can help residents realize.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this event \u2014 and the park \u2014 has the support of (city) leadership is significant,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is downtown finally breaking free to the north.\u2019\n\nAs bicyclists browsed Coast\u2019s line-up of bikes, Tampa City Councilman Mike Suarez talked to passersby.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to encourage more people to ride,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great amenity in urban areas and a good way to get from one place to another.\u201d\n\nJames Shirk, who chairs the Metropolitan Planning Organization\u2019s Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Committee, touted the safety records of similar programs in other areas.\n\n\u201cThere have been 23 million rentals and no fatalities since the start of bike-share programs in North America,\u201d Shirk said. \u201cThe first one started in Montreal five years ago, and now there are programs in Washington, New York, Boston, Denver, San Francisco and Chicago.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the links of public transportation. People always have the issue of making the last mile to or from their destination. If you work in Tampa, you can take the bus, then get off the bus and ride a bike the last mile. You can go to Ybor, then back to your office.\u201d\n\nBike-related vendors on Sunday included Jamis Bicycles, City Bike Tampa, Tampa Bay Cycle, Seminole Heights Bicycle Club and Velo Champ.\n\nFrank Parra, a University of South Florida engineering student, distributed bicycle and pedestrian safety information beneath a sign that read: \u201cSafety doesn\u2019t happen by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here for USF\u2019s Center for Urban Transportation and our research is sponsored by the Department of Transportation,\u201d Parra said. \u201cWe do these all over the state. We were just in Miami at a NASCAR event. We do a lot of surveys about bicycle-motorist safety.\u201d\n\nReporter Jerome R.
