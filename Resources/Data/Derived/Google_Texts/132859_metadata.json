However, according to a new lawsuit, Chobani Greek Yogurt isn't as nutritious as it seems. The yogurt allegedly has the same nutritional value as fudge ice cream bar, the New York Daily News reported.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing \u2018Greek\u2019 about the products,\u201d the lawsuit states, \u201cThe name of the brand itself is not Greek... None of the products sold in the U.S. are made in Greece or made by Greek nationals.\u201d\n\nThe yogurt giant is also being accused of deceiving customers about the yogurt's supposed health benefits. The yogurt has 16 grams of sugar \u2014 that\u2019s more than half of the daily recommended amount set by the World Health Organization. They also allegedly create confusion to their customers by writing \u201c0%\u201d on the labels \u201cwithout providing any context as to what the 0% represents,\u201d the complaint writes. The two plaintiffs, Barry Stoltz and Allan Chang, are suing for an unspecified monetary amount because they claim that they were tricked into thinking that zero percent meant no calories of sugar, when it actually means non-fat. They also believe that the company is a farce.\n\n\u201cWith deceptive packaging and marketing, consumers are deceived into thinking that junk food can be a healthy alternative,\u201d said lawyer C.K. Lee of Manhattan, who filed the suit.\n\nThe company responded to the claim in a statement. \u201cMuch like English muffins and French fries, our fans understand Greek yogurt to be a product description about how we authentically make our yogurt and not about where we make our yogurt in upstate New York and Idaho,\u201d Chobani wrote.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Chobani has come under fire. Last year, Whole Foods dropped the brand claiming that it wanted to sell more non-genetically modified foods. Chobani also had a number or recalls from yogurt that went sour because of mold contamination.\n\nHowever, despite this bad news and news of this lawsuit, Chobani and Upstate Niagara Cooperative Inc. recently won a bid to supply school lunches in seven states operated under the federal school lunch program. The pilot program is being administered to students in Arizona, California, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New York, and Mississippi during the first month of the school year, New York Business Journal reported.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chobani, yogurt", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A lawsuit against the yogurt giant says that Chobani Greek Yogurt isn't even Greek and that claims of it being healthy are untrue.", "title": "Chobani Greek Yogurt May Not Be As Healthy As It Claims To Be", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chobani-greek-yogurt-lawsuit-complaint-says-yogurt-isnt-greek-and-health-benefits-arent-proven", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/shutterstock176213447.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A lawsuit against the yogurt giant says that Chobani Greek Yogurt isn't even Greek and that claims of it being healthy are untrue.", "title": "Chobani Greek Yogurt May Not Be As Healthy As It Claims To Be", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chobani-greek-yogurt-lawsuit-complaint-says-yogurt-isnt-greek-and-health-benefits-arent-proven", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/shutterstock176213447.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/23/shutterstock176213447.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-23T12:04:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-23T12:11:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A lawsuit against the yogurt giant says that Chobani Greek Yogurt isn't even Greek and that claims of it being healthy are untrue."}, "article_summary": "However, according to a new lawsuit, Chobani Greek Yogurt isn't as nutritious as it seems.\nA lawsuit against the yogurt giant claims that the company isn't even Greek and that claims it being healthy are untrue.\nMany companies use the words, \u201call natural\u201d, \u201cwhole\u201d, \u201clow fat\u201d and other health buzzwords to market to their health-conscious customers.\nThe yogurt has 16 grams of sugar \u2014 that\u2019s more than half of the daily recommended amount set by the World Health Organization.\nThe yogurt allegedly has the same nutritional value as fudge ice cream bar, the New York Daily News reported."}
