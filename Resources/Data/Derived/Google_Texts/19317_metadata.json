Or maybe that is not quite right. Trump has humiliated those of us who gave the Republican Party the benefit of the doubt. Surely the competent hands running against him would make Trump appear as out-of-his-depth as he is? Even after these leaders proved uninspiring, surely there would be enough voters left in the party who recognize that Trump is about as transparent a con man as the \u201cSimpsons\u201d monorail salesman?\n\nIn fact, the Republican Party is proving that it is filled with Homers. At this point, Trump leads \u2014 bigly, as he would say \u2014 in national polls of GOP voters, with nearly 50 percent of Republicans behind him. His approval numbers among Republicans are also reviving. He is right on course to getting the 1,237 delegates he needs to take the nomination on the first ballot. He is Republican voters\u2019 choice.\n\nIn retrospect, perhaps Trump\u2019s triumph was more predictable. After all, this is a party that rejected the closest they had to thoughtful candidates early on in the primary. A party that has tolerated and benefited from outrageously insulting myths about President Barack Obama, his heritage and his agenda. A party that has repeatedly and recklessly abused the statutory debt limit and the budget process. A party that sneers at those concerned about climate change. A party that covers up its deficiencies by assaulting the legitimacy of the mainstream press. A party that, as a partial result, often seems incapable of sorting exaggerations and lies about public policy - \u201cObamacare has death panels!\u201d; \u201cclimate regulations would destroy the economy\u201d \u2014 from facts. A party whose leaders have made outrageous and unkeepable promises to increasingly frustrated voters. A party that, when given the choice between staging a grand emotional outburst and governing, has repeatedly chosen to stage a grand emotional outburst.\n\nTrump may have more humiliations in store for us. Surely nominating an embarrassingly unprepared demagogue will result in total electoral disaster for the GOP? Surely Trump will lose not just independents, but also conscientious Republicans who recognize what a threat he is? Surely many of these Republicans will vote for Hillary Clinton instead \u2014 or at least not vote at all \u2014 in November? Surely their partisanship and anti-Clinton animus will not blind them to Trump\u2019s obvious unsuitability for the job? Surely they will realize that they probably cannot win with a Trump ticket in a general election, but they can at least save themselves from moral oblivion? Surely the electoral map will be drastically different from that of the last several elections? Maybe, but I\u2019m not betting a steak dinner on it.\n\nStephen Stromberg is a Post editorial writer.
