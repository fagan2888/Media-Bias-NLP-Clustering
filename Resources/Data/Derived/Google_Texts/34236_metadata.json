But the administration is still working to draw new customers to the health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSince Nov. 1, roughly 2.84 million people, both new and returning, have bought healthcare plans through HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said Wednesday. Of those, 36 percent were new customers.\n\nOf the customers who have selected plans since Nov. 1, more than 800,000 did so during the week of Nov. 29-Dec. 5. During the same week of open enrollment in 2014, about 618,000 people signed up for coverage. From Nov. 22 to Nov. 29 in 2015, 394,000 people bought plans, up from 303,000 during the same week in 2014, according to CMS.\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe administration has said that this open enrollment period, which began Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31 and marks the third under the Affordable Care Act, would face more challenges than previous open enrollment periods in attracting new consumers. \"They are a little harder to reach,\" Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell has said.\n\nOne reason is because the number of uninsured Americans has decreased substantially throughout the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. In 2014, about 32 million non-elderly Americans lacked health insurance, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Now the government estimates that number to be 29 million. The Affordable Care Act has been credited with helping to bring down the rate of the uninsured to a record low of 11.9 percent.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nDuring previous enrollment periods, officials \"have gotten the low-hanging fruit, the people who really wanted coverage, who needed it and were quick to sign up,\" Peter Cunningham, professor of healthcare policy and research at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia, told HealthDay News in October. In other words, those who really want health insurance have already signed up.\n\nThose who do not have health insurance for 2016, whether that means skipping getting coverage through their employers, on exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, or elsewhere, will pay a penalty of 2.5 percent of their annual income or $695 per adult, whichever is higher.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare, obamacare enrollment, obamacare extension, affordable care act extension, obamacare tax penalty, how much is the tax penalty for not having insurance, unamerican to pay tax penalty, health insurance penalty, how to sign up for health insurance,", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "This year, getting new customers to sign up for health insurance has been more difficult than in previous years.", "title": "Obamacare Enrollment 2016: Sign-ups Surge As Administration Tries To Draw In New Customers", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obamacare-enrollment-2016-sign-ups-surge-administration-tries-draw-new-customers-2220187", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/10/rtr4yy4c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This year, getting new customers to sign up for health insurance has been more difficult than in previous years.", "title": "Obamacare Enrollment 2016: Sign-ups Surge As Administration Tries To Draw In New Customers", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/obamacare-enrollment-2016-sign-ups-surge-administration-tries-draw-new-customers-2220187", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/10/rtr4yy4c.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/12/10/rtr4yy4c.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "National", "published_time": "2015-12-10T12:12:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-10T15:54:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This year, getting new customers to sign up for health insurance has been more difficult than in previous years."}, "article_summary": "But the administration is still working to draw new customers to the health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act.\nOne reason is because the number of uninsured Americans has decreased substantially throughout the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Affordable Care Act has been credited with helping to bring down the rate of the uninsured to a record low of 11.9 percent.\nIn 2014, about 32 million non-elderly Americans lacked health insurance, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.\nDuring the same week of open enrollment in 2014, about 618,000 people signed up for coverage."}
