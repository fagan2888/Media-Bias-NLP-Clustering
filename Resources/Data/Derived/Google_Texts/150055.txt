Colorado transportation officials announced Sunday they’ll keep a stretch of Interstate 70 near Glenwood Springs closed for several more days — extending one of the longest closures in decades — as crews using helicopters install cable-and-rope barriers.

A slide that loosened boulders as big as small cars pounded I-70 nearly a week ago, forcing the closure. One hit a passing tractor-trailer truck.

Over the past week, Colorado Department of Transportation crews removed an estimated 400 tons of rock from Glenwood Canyon, mostly from an area 9 miles east of Glenwood Springs.

They planned to open one lane of I-70 between 4 p.m. and 9 a.m. using pilot car escorts, officials said. Large trucks still will be routed along detours adding up to 146 miles, using U.S. 40 and U.S. 50. Snow expected Monday night may complicate the work.

“This week will be more about putting in fencing and tie-backs,” CDOT’s northwest region coordinator Dave Eller said.

“We feel confident we’ve got the large material down and it should be safe if we get the moisture. … It may be muddy. We don’t anticipate any problems.”

CDOT has hired a contractor to haul away rock, including three large boulders removed on Sunday. On average, 300 vehicles per hour move through Glenwood Canyon.

Rock falls threaten travelers along hundreds of miles of roads through Colorado mountains, where freezing and thawing loosens slopes. CDOT has installed barriers along major routes to reduce risk.

“It is a constant battle,” Eller said. “There are many locations around the state where there is not netting in place. … We do our best to mitigate loose rock.”
