Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) accused MSNBC host Thomas Roberts of making \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments on Tuesday after he asked if she hated President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law \u201cmore than you love your country.\u201d\n\nFollowing the announcement of a House Republican plan that threw a wrench in a bipartisan Senate deal to reopen the government, Roberts pointed out to Blackburn that the House was continuing to demand that part of the Affordable Care Act be repealed or delayed even after the president said the law was nonnegotiable.\n\n\u201cDo you hate Obamacare more than you love your country?\u201d Roberts wondered.\n\n\u201cI think that comments like that, that you are making, are just incredibly inappropriate,\u201d Blackburn replied.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate to shut down our government and take all the hostages of Americans that you\u2019ve taken?\u201d Roberts pressed. \u201cNo, no, no. It\u2019s not inappropriate because you\u2019ve taken the government hostage through a shutdown. And all the American people, you\u2019re now walking them to a cliff, the economy, and you\u2019re going to push them over, one by one, based on the fact that you don\u2019t like the ACA. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to yourself! We didn\u2019t want a government shutdown,\u201d Blackburn insisted. \u201cJust listen to the way you\u2019re sounding. My goodness! We didn\u2019t want a government shutdown. We don\u2019t want a government default.\u201d\n\nRoberts reminded the Tennessee Republican that she had told the Economic Club of Nashville that conservative lawmakers should do \u201ceverything we can do\u201d to derail the health care reform law, and then she praised the efforts of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).\n\n\u201cYou have been planning a shutdown since August!\u201d Roberts charged.\n\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d Blackburn shot back. \u201cWhat you are doing is so inappropriate. We didn\u2019t want a shutdown. What we want to do is solve problems.\u201d\n\nWatch this video from MSNBC, broadcast Oct. 15, 2013.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/msnbc_blackburn_roberts_131015c-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "MSNBC host grills Blackburn: \u2018Do you hate Obamacare more than you love your country?\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb0a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDo you hate Obamacare more than you love your country?\u201d Roberts wondered.\n\u201cI think that comments like that, that you are making, are just incredibly inappropriate,\u201d Blackburn replied.\nWe didn\u2019t want a government shutdown,\u201d Blackburn insisted.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s incredibly inappropriate to shut down our government and take all the hostages of Americans that you\u2019ve taken?\u201d Roberts pressed.\nIt\u2019s not inappropriate because you\u2019ve taken the government hostage through a shutdown."}
