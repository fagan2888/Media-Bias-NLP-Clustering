When people need paid care, she continued, whether at home or in an assisted living community or in nursing homes, the costs usually rise above the ability to pay.\n\nHer suggestion: establish a \u201cviable insurance mechanism\u201d that could be public, private, or some combination of the two. Feder leans toward a public social insurance model where private insurance can play a complementary role, noting that in order to effectively spread risk and reach the broadest possible population, mandatory participation would be needed.\n\nThat\u2019s similar to what Anne Tumlinson, MMHS, senior vice president of Avalere Health, said during her testimony.\n\n\u201cEven when people are educated about the risks of long-term care and are presented with long-term care insurance policies, we will not truly address financing without requiring everyone to participate,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile neither senator on the special committee endorsed the individual mandate route to long-term care insurance, both did acknowledge that people need to change their attitudes about how they\u2019ll finance their future care.\n\n\u201cAmericans should consider their future long-term care needs,\u201d Collins said, \u201cjust as they prepare for retirement or purchase life insurance.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alyssa Gerace", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "A Wednesday Senate hearing on the future of long-term care and how to pay for it raised questions and policy suggestions but provided no definitive solutions for what many have called a looming crisis.
