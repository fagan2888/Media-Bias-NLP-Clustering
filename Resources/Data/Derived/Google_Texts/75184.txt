NOGALES, Ariz. (AP) — Donald Trump’s plan to build a giant wall on the border hits close to home for some people like Berenice Andrews.

The front door of Berenice Andrews’ home is just feet away from a fence separating the U.S. and Mexico.

As the presidential contest shifts to Arizona and its Tuesday primary, Trump’s wall stirs up a range of emotions among border-area residents like Andrews.

For some, nothing short of a wall will do. For her, the fence that currently divides the U.S. and Mexico is a good enough barrier.

There are already about 650 miles of fencing, including the steel fence that divides the sister cities of Nogales in Arizona and Mexico.

Much of the border was built in the last 15 years as immigration surged. The cost has been in the billions.
