Port Canaveral is home to critical national security operations and infrastructure. A plethora of space and defense installations and programs, many of them highly classified, are situated either inside the port or within the immediate vicinity:\n\nThe Democrats who objected to the DPW deal have kept quiet and waved it through.\n\nTreasury Secretary Lew granted approval to the Port Canaveral Gulftainer deal, without a national security review, on September 26, 2014, almost exactly six months after Bill Clinton and Crescent Petroleum CEO Majid Jafar stood on stage together at the Global Education & Skills Forum 2014 in Dubai.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the role of the Clintons in the deal and the company's role in Islamic terrorism. Now some citizen activists have come out to protest.\n\nKeeping pressure on the Clinton Crime Family and exposing its international connections is vital right now.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The Democrats who objected to the DPW deal have kept quiet", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The Democrats who objected to the DPW deal have kept quiet", "title": "Citizen Activists Protest Dirty Clinton Deal Handing Over Port to Terror", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/258343/citizen-activists-protest-dirty-clinton-deal-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/06/hillary-clinton-crazy.jpg?itok=FVrWsdDy", "updated_time": "2015-06-27T17:40:07-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/258343/citizen-activists-protest-dirty-clinton-deal-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/06/hillary-clinton-crazy.jpg?itok=FVrWsdDy", "description": "The Democrats who objected to the DPW deal have kept quiet", "card": "summary", "title": "Citizen Activists Protest Dirty Clinton Deal Handing Over Port to Terror"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-12T05:03:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-27T17:40:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Port Canaveral is home to critical national security operations and infrastructure.\nQuestions have been raised about the role of the Clintons in the deal and the company's role in Islamic terrorism.\nKeeping pressure on the Clinton Crime Family and exposing its international connections is vital right now.\nNow some citizen activists have come out to protest.\nYou may remember the Dubai Ports World controversy, but while that deal became a high profile controversy because it happened under Bush, another UAE company has moved in on an even more significant port."}
