First, state delegate Eric Householder took on ObamaCare, and now Cindy Frich, his colleague in the House of Delegates, is setting her sights on protecting the Second Amendment.\n\nOn January 9, Frich and five cosponsors (the same bill was offered last legislative session and had nine cosponsors) introduced HB 2832, the Firearm Protection Act.\n\nIf it were enacted, the bill would render unenforceable any \u201cfederal law which attempts to ban semiautomatic firearm[s] or to limit the size of a magazine of a firearm or other limitation on firearms in this state\u2026\u201d\n\nThere are two forces at work in Frich\u2019s effort to thwart the federal government\u2019s constant attempt to unconstitutionally infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\n\nFirst, there is a well-established principle of federalism called anti-commandeering.\n\nPut simply, anti-commandeering prohibits the federal government from forcing states to participate in any federal program that does not concern \u201cinternational and interstate matters.\u201d\n\nWhile this expression of federalism (\u201cdual sovereignty\u201d as it was named by Justice Antonin Scalia) was first set forth in the case of New York v. United States (1992), most recently it was reaffirmed by the high court in the case of Mack and Printz v. United States (1997).\n\nSheriff Richard Mack was one of the named plaintiffs in the latter landmark case, and on the website of his organization the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, he recounts the basic facts of the case:\n\nThe Mack/Printz case was the case that set Sheriff Mack on a path of nationwide renown as he and Sheriff Printz sued the Clinton administration over unconstitutional gun control measures, were eventually joined by other sheriffs for a total of seven, went all the way to the supreme court and won.\n\nThere is much more \u201cammo\u201d in this historic and liberty-saving Supreme Court ruling. We have been trying to get state and local officials from all over the country to read and study this most amazing ruling for almost two decades. Please get a copy of it today and pass it around to your legislators, county commissioners, city councils, state reps, even governors!\n\nThe Mack/Printz ruling makes it clear that the states do not have to accept orders from the feds!\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia explained:\n\nAs Madison expressed it: \"The local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them, within its own sphere.\" The Federalist No. 39, at 245. [n.11]\n\nThis separation of the two spheres is one of the Constitution's structural protections of liberty. \"Just as the separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serve to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.\"\n\nWhen the federal government assumes powers not explicitly granted to it in the Constitution, it puts the states on the road toward obliteration and citizens on the road to enslavement.\n\nThe next principle on display in Delegate Frich\u2019s bill is known as nullification \u2014 Thomas Jefferson\u2019s \u201crightful remedy.\u201d\n\nNullification is a concept of constitutional law that recognizes the authority of each state to nullify, or invalidate, any federal measure that exceeds the few and defined powers allowed the federal government as enumerated in the Constitution.\n\nNullification is founded on the assertion that the sovereign states formed the union, and as creators of the compact, they hold ultimate authority as to the limits of the power of the federal government to enact laws that they expect the people to obey.\n\nThat is to say, the Constitution is an agency agreement between the states (the principals) and the federal government (the agent).\n\nThe law of agency applies when one party gives another party legal authority to act on the first party\u2019s behalf. The first party is called the principal and the second party is called the agent. The principal may grant the agent as much or as little authority as suits his purpose. That is to say, by simply giving an agent certain powers, that agent is not authorized to act outside of that defined sphere of authority.\n\nUpon its ratification, the states, as principals, gave limited power to the federal government to act as their agent in certain matters of common concern: defense, taxation, interstate commerce, etc.\n\nThe authority of the agent \u2014 in this case the federal government \u2014 is derived from the agreement that created the principal/agent relationship. Whether the agent is lawfully acting on behalf of the principal is a question of fact. The agent may legally bind the principal only insofar as its actions lie within the contractual boundaries of its power.\n\nShould the agent exceed the scope of its authority, not only is the principal not held accountable for those acts, but the breaching agent is legally liable to the principal (and any affected third parties who acted in reliance on the agent\u2019s authority) for that breach.\n\nUnder the law of agency, finally, the principals (states) may revoke the agent\u2019s (the federal government\u2019s) authority at will. It would be unreasonable to force the principals to honor promises of an agent that has acted outside the limits of its authority as set out in the document that created the agency in the first place \u2014 the Constitution.\n\nThomas Jefferson provided perhaps the best defense of nullification in the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 where he wrote:\n\nThat the several states who formed that instrument, being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction; and that a nullification, by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under colour [sic] of that instrument, is the rightful remedy.\n\nEven Alexander Hamilton, not exactly a champion of strong state governments, explained that an act of Congress is a law only when it is enacted lawfully. In Federalist 33 he wrote:\n\nIf a number of political societies enter into a larger political society, the laws which the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers intrusted [sic] to it by its constitution, must necessarily be supreme over those societies and the individuals of whom they are composed.... But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the larger society which are not pursuant to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land. These will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such. [Emphasis in original.]\n\nAs Cindy Frich, Eric Householder, and the cosponsors of their respective bills apparently understand, state legislators have not only the authority, but the obligation to stand in defense of liberty and prevent the federal government from using them as mere administrative subdivisions, good for nothing more than executing their unconstitutional edicts.\n\nAs of Friday, January 18, West Virginia\u2019s Firearm Protection Act was waiting with scores of other recently proposed legislation to be heard by the state\u2019s House Judiciary Committee.\n\nPhoto shows West Virginia State Capitol dome.\n\nJoe A.
