Yet while anyone who is lucky enough to have financial security may be under the impression that good times are here again, poll after poll after poll shows a clear majority of Americans still think the economy, well, sucks. Are they all crazy, or is the economic picture more complicated than it may seem?\n\nTo answer that question, Salon reached out to professor Stephanie Kelton, the economics department chair at the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City who frequently analyzes the state of the economy via the New Economic Perspectives blog and her active Twitter account (as well as appearing on TV). According to Kelton, things are not as terrible as they were just a few years ago \u2014 but they\u2019re also not nearly as rosy as they seem. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nThe state of the economy used to be a constant topic of conversation in the media, but it at least seems like that\u2019s died down a lot in the past few years. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the economy is all better, though. So how would you describe the U.S. economy today?\n\nI\u2019d say, relative to a lot of other countries in the world, the U.S. looks pretty good. But we\u2019re comparing it to some pretty rotten economic performances. Much of Europe is back in recession; youth unemployment rates in places like Spain and Greece are nearly 50 percent. \u2026 Because we\u2019re [seeing decent] top-line economic growth figures, and on the surface the unemployment situation appears to be improving, you could make the argument that the economy is improving.\n\nBut for too many Americans, it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s improving. We know that too many of the Americans who lost jobs in the downturn and that have gone on to find [new] employment are actually working for wages or salaries that are below what they were when they lost their jobs. So the economy\u2019s better [for those people] in the sense that they\u2019re no longer unemployed \u2026 but they\u2019re not making what they were before the Great Recession began.\n\nI look at the labor force participation rates, and we all know those have been on a downward trend. \u2026 You don\u2019t want to see this many people who are working part-time because their employers have cut their hours, and what they really want is a full-time job but they can\u2019t get it. You don\u2019t want to continue to see people drop out of the labor force because they\u2019re discouraged, they looked and looked and looked for a job and weren\u2019t successful and said, forget about it.\n\nSo the official numbers can mask a whole lot of those problems \u2026 when you factor all that other stuff in, the number [of un- or underemployed Americans] looks much bigger. You\u2019re looking at like 25 million Americans who want full-time work and can\u2019t find it in today\u2019s economy. And how many jobs are available? Around 4 million. So the economy\u2019s certainly nothing to write home about.\n\nAnd how does the economy right now compare to what a reasonable expectation would be in terms of the strength and character of the post-Great Recession rebound? Are we still underperforming?\n\nYeah, absolutely. We all know how long it took us to claw back the jobs, just to get back to where we were before the start of the recession, in terms of job creation. It was nearly a six-year-long slog to get back to where we were. It was the worst economic recovery in that sense since the Great Depression. We have recovered jobs more quickly in every previous recovery, going back to the Great Depression, than we did in the last one. So it was deeper, and it took longer to get out of it.\n\nDid we make mistakes? Yes. Could we have improved the pace at which we recovered? Absolutely. We didn\u2019t get the policy response right, for lots of reasons [and] people suffered a lot longer than they should have \u2014 and continue to suffer.\n\nIn his most recent speech on the economy, President Obama argued that one of the main reasons things weren\u2019t better was because of Republican obstruction and intransigence. That\u2019s something the White House has been saying for a long time, of course. If as a hypothetical we were to say the White House was able to implement every recovery policy it wanted, do you think the economy would be as improved as the White House implies?\n\nI didn\u2019t hear the recent speech, but what I\u2019ve heard [from the White House] through the years are policies that are very much consistent and compatible with supply-side economic thinking. Accelerated depreciation, for example. If he wants to see businesses invested in hiring, [Obama] says, We\u2019ll give them accelerated depreciation so they can write off in a single year the depreciation for investment in new capital! OK, but if the customers aren\u2019t there, why are businesses who are sitting on record levels of corporate profits \u2014 and they\u2019ve got cash sitting on the sidelines \u2014 why do you believe that they\u2019re gonna go out and expand productive capacity, buy new machines, build new factories and so forth if the demand isn\u2019t there? They won\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite what the media says, it's still a mess out there \u2014 and now there's reason to worry more bad news is coming", "title": "The economy still sucks: Economist Stephanie Kelton on why we can\u2019t declare victory just yet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Despite what the media says, it's still a mess out there \u2014 and now there's reason to worry more bad news is coming", "title": "The economy still sucks: Economist Stephanie Kelton on why we can\u2019t declare victory just yet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/04/the_economy_still_sucks_economist_stephanie_kelton_on_why_we_cant_declare_victory_just_yet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/detroit_housing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite what the media says, it's still a mess out there \u2014 and now there's reason to worry more bad news is coming", "title": "The economy still sucks: Economist Stephanie Kelton on why we can\u2019t declare victory just yet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/detroit_housing.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Austerity, Barack Obama, depression, economy, Editor's Picks, Inequality, Jobs, Labor, stephanie kelton, Stimulus, wages", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "You\u2019re looking at like 25 million Americans who want full-time work and can\u2019t find it in today\u2019s economy.\nMuch of Europe is back in recession; youth unemployment rates in places like Spain and Greece are nearly 50 percent.\nIn his most recent speech on the economy, President Obama argued that one of the main reasons things weren\u2019t better was because of Republican obstruction and intransigence.\nAccording to Kelton, things are not as terrible as they were just a few years ago \u2014 but they\u2019re also not nearly as rosy as they seem.\nI\u2019d say, relative to a lot of other countries in the world, the U.S. looks pretty good."}
