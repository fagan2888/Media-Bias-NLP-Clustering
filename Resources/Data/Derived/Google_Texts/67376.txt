Obamacare sign-up statistics for 2015 indicate that the enrollment pace for private health coverage under its insurance exchanges has slowed down by more than half of the number originally projected by the White House.Although the White House initially stated that “about 11.4 million Americans are signed up for private health coverage” through Obamacare, the latest actual numbers show that 5 million previously uninsured people are currently enrolled in private health coverage, according to Forbes. Ten million people signed up for Medicaid this year in the wake of the 8 million who signed up last year, Forbes noted. The census data numbers also show that the proportion of young adults aged 18-26 who are signed up for private health coverage was 60.5 percent in 2012, which is exactly the same proportion that was enrolled in 2008, indicating that those young adults are staying on their parents’ plans.Forbes also noted that 6.7 million people actually enrolled for a marketplace plan last year instead of the 8 million people who merely signed up for it. In addition, approximately 4.7 million people held a plan that would be effectively canceled by 2014.These statistics come into sharp conflict with the vast numbers triumphantly celebrated by the White House. Despite the extended open enrollment period for 2015 coverage from March 15-April 30 targeted towards those with plans ending in 2014, the numbers still have not risen to the 11.4 million Americans that White House claims enrolled, according to The Huffington Post. The extra “special enrollment period” also aimed to mitigate the backlash from uninsured taxpayers who owed fines for their 2014 returns starting at $95.This murky stats also come in the wake of efforts from health insurance companies to seek rate increases of 20 and 40 percent or more for their new customers gained under the Affordable Care Act, according to The New York Times “Rate increases will be bigger in 2016 than they have been for years and years and will have a profound effect on consumers here. Some may start wondering if insurance is affordable or if it’s worth the money,” said Jesse Ellis O’Brien, a health advocate at the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, according to The Times.
