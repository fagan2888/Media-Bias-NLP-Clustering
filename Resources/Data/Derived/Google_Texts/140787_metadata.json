NBC and the five hosts did not immediately respond to Wednesday morning inquiries, or to prior requests for comment over the past week.\n\n\u201cThese hosts have a particular responsibility,\u201d AFL-CIO organizing director Elizabeth Bunn told Salon. \u201cThey have respect and they have clout that producers alone don\u2019t have, and they\u2019re part of the larger progressive movement.\u201d She said the five anchors were \u201cuniquely positioned to hear the stories of what their parent company is doing to workers, and broadcast that to the larger American public.\u201d She urged them to follow the \u201cinspirational example\u201d of workers at Peacock Productions \u2013 a company that produces some MSNBC programming \u2013 who\u2019ve chosen to take collective action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re speculating that there\u2019s a level of fear and concern\u201d among the five celebrity anchors, Bunn told Salon. \u201cBut what we\u2019re hoping is if they meet individually or collectively with the workers,\u201d and hear \u201chow abhorrent this corporate behavior is,\u201d that \u201cas a group, they will speak out and exercise their collective voice just like workers at these production companies have exercised their voice in seeking to form a union.\u201d Bunn blasted NBC as \u201cguilty of hypocrisy and guilty of exploiting its workforce,\u201d adding, \u201cone would hope than an employer whose mission is to communicate accurately would behave more responsibly.\u201d\n\nAs Salon first reported, Chris Hayes listened to Peacock Productions workers\u2019 concerns at a private meeting held at the offices of the Writers Guild of America\u2013East, according to several people present. Like his colleagues, he has not publicly addressed the workers\u2019 allegations. WGA-E organizing director Justin Molito told Salon that Peacock Productions ran \u201ca textbook anti-union campaign that you would see at companies like Wal-Mart\u201d and alleged its exploitation of National Labor Relations Board delays amounted to \u201cthrowing in\u201d with those behind the \u201cright-wing extremist takeover\u201d decried by MNSBC.\n\nFollowing a Web petition hosted by MoveOn Civic Action, the AFL-CIO sought the five hosts\u2019 support in a letter sent Wednesday. \u201cWhat has occurred at Peacock is unconscionable,\u201d AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka and the federation\u2019s other two top officers told Sharpton, O\u2019Donnell, Maddow, Schultz and Hayes in the morning missive, first reported by Politico\u2019s Dylan Byers. They asked the hosts to \u201chelp these brave men and women appeal to Peacock and to NBC to cease their anti-union tactics. Meet with them, talk to them, call your viewers to action, and let\u2019s make a difference together.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After alleged union-busting by NBC-owned company, AFL-CIO calls out Maddow, Sharpton, O'Donnell, Schultz and Hayes", "title": "\u201cFear and concern\u201d keeping MSNBC hosts quiet in union dispute, AFL-CIO suggests", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After alleged union-busting by NBC-owned company, AFL-CIO calls out Maddow, Sharpton, O'Donnell, Schultz and Hayes", "title": "\u201cFear and concern\u201d keeping MSNBC hosts quiet in union dispute, AFL-CIO suggests", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/18/fear_and_concern_keeping_msnbc_hosts_quiet_in_union_dispute_afl_cio_suggests/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/maddow_sharpton_odonnell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After alleged union-busting by NBC-owned company, AFL-CIO calls out Maddow, Sharpton, O'Donnell, Schultz and Hayes", "title": "\u201cFear and concern\u201d keeping MSNBC hosts quiet in union dispute, AFL-CIO suggests", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/maddow_sharpton_odonnell.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AFL-CIO, Al Sharpton, Chris Hayes, Ed Schultz, lawrence o'donnell, MSNBC, NBC, Rachel Maddow, Union", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re speculating that there\u2019s a level of fear and concern\u201d among the five celebrity anchors, Bunn told Salon.\n\u201cThese hosts have a particular responsibility,\u201d AFL-CIO organizing director Elizabeth Bunn told Salon.\nFollowing a Web petition hosted by MoveOn Civic Action, the AFL-CIO sought the five hosts\u2019 support in a letter sent Wednesday.\nThey asked the hosts to \u201chelp these brave men and women appeal to Peacock and to NBC to cease their anti-union tactics.\nNBC and the five hosts did not immediately respond to Wednesday morning inquiries, or to prior requests for comment over the past week."}
