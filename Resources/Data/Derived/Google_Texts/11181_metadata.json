In the 2012 presidential election, Republican candidate Mitt Romney won 59 percent of the white vote, compared with Obama\u2019s 39 percent, according to exit polling by a consortium of major news outlets. Obama won 43 percent of the white vote in 2008 against 55 percent for opponent John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona.\n\nObamacare Blamed\n\n\u201cPoll after poll makes it very clear that Obamacare and other job-killing policies are the reason\u201d for the president\u2019s decline in popularity, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer said in a phone interview today.\n\nObama offered reflections on a variety of subjects in the New Yorker story, including his view about the dangers of playing professional football, which has been the subject of media scrutiny over players\u2019 head injuries.\n\n\u201cI would not let my son play pro football,\u201d the article quotes Obama, the father of two daughters, as saying. When asked by Remnick how those dangers squared with his enjoyment of the game as a spectator, Obama said professional players are aware of the inherent risk in playing a full-contact sport.\n\nLike Smokers\n\n\u201cThey know what they\u2019re buying into,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt is no longer a secret. It\u2019s sort of the feeling I have about smokers, you know?\u201d\n\nObama acknowledged that reports of U.S. surveillance programs, including allegations that the government tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s mobile phone, had created a \u201cbreach of trust,\u201d Remnick reported.\n\nObama said he also assumes others are trying to spy on him, and for this reason he doesn\u2019t have a phone, according to The New Yorker.\n\nHe said, \u201cthere are European governments that we know spy on us, and there is a little bit of Claude Rains in \u2018Casablanca\u2019 -- shocked that gambling is going on,\u201d the magazine quoted him as saying, referring to the actor who played the police captain in the 1942 movie.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Brian Wingfield", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama said that racial tensions may have softened his popularity among white voters within the last two years, according to a story posted on the New Yorker magazine\u2019s website today.", "title": "Obama Says Racial Animus Blunts Approval, New Yorker Reports", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-19/obama-says-racial-animus-may-soften-support-new-yorker-reports", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwuWrYiuDXfc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Brian Wingfield", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Barack H Obama", "news_keywords": "Barack H Obama", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-19/obama-says-racial-animus-may-soften-support-new-yorker-reports", "parsely-title": "Obama Says Racial Animus Blunts Approval, New Yorker Reports", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-19T19:01:03.185Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "President Barack Obama said that racial tensions may have softened his popularity among white voters within the last two years, according to a story posted on the New Yorker magazine\u2019s website today.", "parsely-tags": "Barack H Obama,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-01-19T19:01:03.185Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "President Barack Obama said that racial tensions may have softened his popularity among white voters within the last two years, according to a story posted on the New Yorker magazine\u2019s website today.", "title": "Obama Says Racial Animus Blunts Approval, New Yorker Reports", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-19/obama-says-racial-animus-may-soften-support-new-yorker-reports", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwuWrYiuDXfc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "President Barack Obama said that racial tensions may have softened his popularity among white voters within the last two years, according to a story posted on the New Yorker magazine\u2019s website today."}, "parsely-post-id": "MZNQBF6KLVR601", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwuWrYiuDXfc/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d01\"", "article_summary": "Obama said he also assumes others are trying to spy on him, and for this reason he doesn\u2019t have a phone, according to The New Yorker.\nPresident Barack Obama said that racial tensions may have softened his popularity among white voters within the last two years, according to a story posted on the New Yorker magazine\u2019s website today.\n\u201cI would not let my son play pro football,\u201d the article quotes Obama, the father of two daughters, as saying.\nObama won 43 percent of the white vote in 2008 against 55 percent for opponent John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black president,\u201d Obama said in the article by David Remnick, appearing in the magazine\u2019s Jan. 27 edition."}
