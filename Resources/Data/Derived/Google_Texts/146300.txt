SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Meat Loaf has cancelled his appearance this summer at the Illinois State Fair just days after it was announced.

The Illinois Department of Agriculture says a replacement act for the Aug. 19 concert will be announced soon.

No reason was given for the cancellation.

Meat Loaf was to perform with Styx and Tesla.

Tickets for the show had been scheduled to go on sale Saturday, but some fan club pre-sale tickets were sold via Ticketmaster. Those tickets will be refunded.

The 2015 Illinois State Fair runs Aug. 13-23 in Springfield.

The fairâ€™s music lineup includes pop-rock group The Fray, Sammy Hagar, Justin Moore, Rascal Flatts, Hank Williams Jr. and Austin Mahone.
