Bush calls Hillary Clinton his ‘sister-in-law,’ says brother Jeb could beat her in 2016

The 2016 presidential race could be between two individuals from the same family, at least according to former President George W. Bush.

In an interview with Candy Crowley on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, Bush labeled Hillary Clinton his “sister-in-law” when asked about Hillary’s relationship to the Bush family.

“You’ve often referred to Bill Clinton and you talk about his relationship with your father and how it developed and your mother as well, and he’s your ‘brother from another mother,'” asked Crowley. “What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?”

“My sister-in-law,” Bush replied, laughing.

The former Republican president has proudly showcased his friendship with Bill Clinton at events and on social media. Bush labeled Clinton his “brother from another mother” as recently as last month in an Instagram post.

However, when it comes to the 2016 presidential race, Bush’s faith lies in his brother Jeb — not Hillary Clinton.

“Do you think that your brother could run against your sister-in-law?” Crowley inquired.

“Yeah, and I think he’d beat her,” Bush replied confidently.

When Crowley described the former secretary of State as “formidable,” Bush agreed but added that his brother — a former governor of Florida — is equally so.

Rumors have been swirling for months that Jeb Bush will take on the challenge of running as a Republican candidate for president, and Hillary Clinton is also expected to run.

Clinton has said that she will announce her final decision about 2016 sometime soon after the new year.
