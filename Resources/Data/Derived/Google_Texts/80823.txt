There’s a party in Maryland, apparently. On Thursday night Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released a video of nurse Nina Pham joking around with her doctors. Pham, 26, became the first person infected with Ebola in the U.S. after caring for a Liberian patient in the hospital.

On Monday, she received a transfusion of antibodies to help fight the virus. She also received plasma from Kent Brantly, one of the first Americans involved with the outbreak — along with Nancy Writebol — to have survived infection. Pham is reportedly in good condition and improving.

According to the hospital, after Pham's physician and coworker Dr. Gary Weinstein filmed the brief interaction, in which Pham goes from laughing to wiping away tears, she was flown to a National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Md. Texas Health Presbyterian says the move comes out of fear that the virus has overwhelmed the hospital.

More than 4,400 people have died from Ebola infections since its initial outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. The agency has called the outbreak the worst on record, and is scrambling to secure more funding to protect workers, doctors, and patients. The virus carries a mortality rate of around 70 percent across the three worst-hit countries, spreading through direct contact with blood or saliva.
