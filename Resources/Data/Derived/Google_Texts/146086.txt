"The Rachel Maddow Show," citing a story by The Oregonian's Laura Gunderson, ran a segment Tuesday on Monica Wehby's interest in running the Oregon Health Authority.

As Gunderson reported, the Republican Senate candidate and pediatric neurosurgeon called Gov. John Kitzhaber the day after losing her bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley.

According to multiple sources, Wehby asked about leading the health agency -- a post that would make her the top state official in charge of implementing Obamacare in Oregon.

Maddow, in the second part of a segment called "Debunktion Junction," had a field day.

"If there were two things that the Dr. Monica Wehby campaign really wanted you to know about her, " Maddow said, "they were, number one, she's a doctor. And, number two, she really doesn't like Obamacare. That's what her whole campaign was about."

Maddow ran a clip of a Wehby commercial in which the candidate declared Obamacare "bad for Oregon" and "devastating" to Oregon families and patients. Maddow also noted, as Gunderson did, that Wehby's campaign slogan was an attack on Obamacare: "Keep Your Doctor. Change Your Senator.

Maddow gleefully described the irony of an anti-Obamacare candidate changing direction after the election: "So now she wants to run it! Not busy anymore. Ta-da!"

It's worth noting that Wehby denied asking Kitzhaber about a job. Interviewed by Gunderson last week, Wehby said she called the governor to congratulate him and to offer her expertise on health reform.
