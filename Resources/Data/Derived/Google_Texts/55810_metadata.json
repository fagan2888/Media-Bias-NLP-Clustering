At that point, 60 percent expressed the need for a third party, while 26 percent said otherwise.\n\nWith a few exceptions, a majority has supported a major third party going back to 2007. Both exceptions came in presidential election years in 2008 and 2012.\n\nIndependents continue to be the most in favor of a major third party, at 71 percent. Republicans and Democrats are nearly tied, with 47 percent and 46 percent, respectively, calling for a third party.\n\nWith the constraints of the U.S. political system, Gallup noted that third party groups might have more successes operating within an established party, similar to the Tea Party movement. However, it noted that the Tea Party's clout appears to have diminished based on recent polling.\n\n\"Americans' preference for a third party may reflect their frustration with the way the Republican and Democratic parties are performing, as well as the idea that the system ought to be open to new parties, regardless of whether this is viable in practice,\" Gallup wrote in an analysis.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,017 people from Sept. 4-7 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The call for a third party has slightly diminished since last year.", "description": "The call for a third party has slightly diminished since last year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The call for a third party has slightly diminished since last year.", "title": "Poll: 58 percent want major third political party", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/218741-poll-58-percent-want-major-third-political-party", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/218741-poll-58-percent-want-major-third-political-party", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-24T09:11-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-24T09:11:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": "poll, Third party,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/218741-poll-58-percent-want-major-third-political-party", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The call for a third party has slightly diminished since last year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Poll: 58 percent want major third political party"}, "dcterms.title": "Poll: 58 percent want major third political party"}, "article_summary": "With the constraints of the U.S. political system, Gallup noted that third party groups might have more successes operating within an established party, similar to the Tea Party movement.\nThe Gallup poll released Wednesday found 35 percent believe both parties are doing an adequate job of representing their views.\nFifty-eight percent of people believe a major third party is needed in the U.S. political process, asserting Republicans and Democrats are not doing an adequate job representing their views.\nWith a few exceptions, a majority has supported a major third party going back to 2007.\nIndependents continue to be the most in favor of a major third party, at 71 percent."}
