The auditors said the networks could be penetrated by hackers to bring down planes. While the report makes clear such a scenario isn\u2019t likely \u2013 the watchdog says it\u2019s possible.\n\nThe GAO said the FAA has serious security weaknesses within two major aviation systems that control where the planes\u2019 locations, their routes, and how they communicate with each other. The auditors expressed concern about the agency\u2019s air-traffic control information systems, as well as aircraft avionics systems that are used to operate and guide the aircraft, which they say could be hacked into and used to disrupt the entire airspace.\n\nThis is not the first time the GAO has flagged the FAA\u2019s vulnerable data systems. Back in January auditors issued a report blasting the agency for not doing enough to protect its National Airspace System (NAS) from hackers. That system controls all of America\u2019s airport and air traffic control centers.\n\nRelated: Wanted, 3,000 Hackers for Cool Pentagon Jobs\n\nThe agency said the security weaknesses pose a threat because hackers could potentially gain access to the NAS and tamper with or disrupt air traffic control operations; hackers could also potentially access FAA accounts and passwords.\n\n\u201cFAA is at increased risk that accounts could be compromised and used by unauthorized individuals to access sensitive information or systems,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe GAO recommended the FAA develop a sufficient strategy to address any cyber security weaknesses. The agency, for its part, responded that it\u2019s made progress since the first report was issued in January.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to the threat of cyberattacks in America, the sky is indeed the limit.", "title": "Why America\u2019s Planes Are in Danger of Cyber Attack", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/16/Why-America-s-Planes-Are-Danger-Cyber-Attack", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/airplane_silhouette_REUTERS_B_Mathur.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/16/Why-America-s-Planes-Are-Danger-Cyber-Attack", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/airplane_silhouette_REUTERS_B_Mathur.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When it comes to the threat of cyberattacks in America, the sky is indeed the limit.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The GAO recommended the FAA develop a sufficient strategy to address any cyber security weaknesses.\nThat system controls all of America\u2019s airport and air traffic control centers.\nRelated: Your Next Flight Could Be Hit By a Cyber AttackThat\u2019s the revelation from a new Government Accountability Office report, which claims U.S. commercial airplanes and air traffic control centers are vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks.\nThe GAO said the FAA has serious security weaknesses within two major aviation systems that control where the planes\u2019 locations, their routes, and how they communicate with each other.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s NextGen air traffic control data system has a number of security vulnerabilities that pose serious threats to the millions of passengers traveling through the skies every day."}
