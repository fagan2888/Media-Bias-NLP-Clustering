However, if caught at an early stage, syphilis can be cured and contained. The majority of syphilis cases are found in men who have had sex with other men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nSanta Barbara County Department of Health Deputy Director Susan Klein-Rothschild said syphilis infections for the county have risen at a faster rate than that of other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n\u201cIn 2011 we had five [syphilis] cases, in 2012 we had 10 cases, and in 2013 we had 22 cases. That\u2019s a big increase,\u201d Rothschild said. \u201cOur deputy health officer Lynn Fitzgibbons [talked] about maybe people not using condoms to the same degree that would have a big impact on sexually transmitted diseases.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rothschild, although the 2014 statistics are not yet in, the upward trend of the last few years suggests there will be more cases than in previous years, and thus she strongly recommends people get more educated about STDs and the benefits of getting regular screenings.\n\n\u201cPeople need to get screened, and after the Affordable Care Act, everyone should have healthcare coverage,\u201d Rothschild said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that we can address when we know about it, but if we don\u2019t know about it, how do we take care of it? Prevention, early detection, and intervention are so much more effective than trying to treat something further down the line.\u201d\n\nMary Ferris, M.D., director of UCSB Student Health, said the increasing syphilis rates may be a spillover from more urban areas like Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWhenever an infection is present that\u2019s easily spread, it\u2019s inevitable that it\u2019s going to come to our area,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a more prevalent disease. It\u2019s a contagious illness and it\u2019s spreading through sexual contact.\u201d\n\nJulie Mickelberry, the vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund in the Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties, said syphilis is challenging to treat because the mild symptoms it presents in its early stages are typically overlooked or hard to detect.\n\n\u201cOne of the challenges of combating syphilis is that especially in its early stage, it has mild or unnoticeable symptoms,\u201d Mickelberry said in an email. \u201cThe only way to confirm that someone has syphilis is to be tested for it. Students should be empowered to take control over their sexual and reproductive health.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ferris, Student Health encourages people to use condoms when having sex. Ferris also said students should also be more vigilant about using protection when they hear there is an increased presence of a given sexually transmitted infection.\n\n\u201cThe increase of syphilis should make students more concerned about sexually transmitted infections and [should] make them even more motivated to be sure to use condoms for protection,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cReally, that\u2019s the only way you can protect yourself, through a barrier, when you\u2019re having sexual relations.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ferris, STD/STI tests are fairly simple and results can be emailed to student confidentially. Students should get tested at least once a year, or every time they get a new partner, Ferris said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doesn\u2019t require an invasive exam. It\u2019s just a urine test and a blood test,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cThe tests don\u2019t always turn positive for sexually transmitted infections immediately after the contact, so waiting 2-3 weeks, especially if you\u2019re feeling fine, is better. If you have any symptoms or unusual discharges or extra pain, come in sooner.\u201d\n\nFerris also said there is a greater need for sex education because sexually transmitted diseases and infections are still common in general.\n\n\u201cI think there is always room for more education because every case of a sexually transmitted infection is preventable,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cUntil we get to zero [cases] we think that we need to keep promoting that message and emphasizing how important it is to use protection.\u201d\n\nA version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, June 25, 2014\u2019s print edition of the Daily Nexus.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/syphilis-rates-rise-in-santa-barbara/", "site_name": "The Daily Nexus", "type": "article", "description": "Syphilis rates in Santa Barbara County have more than quadrupled in the past few years as the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases continues to rise.", "title": "Syphilis Rates Rise in Santa Barbara"}, "twitter": {"description": "Syphilis rates in Santa Barbara County have more than quadrupled in the past few years as the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases continues to rise.", "title": "Syphilis Rates Rise in Santa Barbara", "url": "http://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/syphilis-rates-rise-in-santa-barbara/", "image": "http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eb9ee80d39f13cbbad56da88ef3a6ee?rating=PG&size=75", "site": "@dailynexus", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Syphilis rates in Santa Barbara County have more than quadrupled in the past few years as the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases continues to rise", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn 2011 we had five [syphilis] cases, in 2012 we had 10 cases, and in 2013 we had 22 cases.\nIncrease in Number of Cases From 2011 to 2013 Suggests Upward TrendSyphilis rates in Santa Barbara County have more than quadrupled in the past few years as the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases continues to rise.\n\u201cThe tests don\u2019t always turn positive for sexually transmitted infections immediately after the contact, so waiting 2-3 weeks, especially if you\u2019re feeling fine, is better.\n\u201cI think there is always room for more education because every case of a sexually transmitted infection is preventable,\u201d Ferris said.\nHowever, if caught at an early stage, syphilis can be cured and contained."}
