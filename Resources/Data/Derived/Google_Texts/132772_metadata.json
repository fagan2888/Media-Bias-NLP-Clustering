Because he was an egomaniac.\n\nWhy did Anthony Weiner post photos of his crotch on Twitter and then lie about it? Because he\u2019s an egomaniac and a sociopath.\n\nWhy did President George W. Bush mislead the country on Iraq? Because he\u2019s an evil warmonger.\n\nThe newest iteration of this is to ascribe a psychology to President Obama\u2019s assertion that you can keep your health insurance plan and doctor if you like them under the Affordable Care Act, a promise which will not in fact come to fruition.\n\nHistorian Arthur Herman wrote, \u201cSome people might think Obama\u2019s penchant for lying, repeatedly and blatantly \u2014 even when he knows people can check and catch him at it \u2014 is a character flaw, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s ideological, and its roots go back some 2,400 years.\u201d And by that, he means Plato. And by that, he means that all liberals lie.\n\nTo the New York Times, \u201cObama clearly misspoke,\u201d but didn\u2019t lie outright, suggesting that Obama didn\u2019t hear very well when a number of his own advisers cautioned against the strongly worded language.\n\nCNN contributor LZ Granderson admitted to the lie, but reassured that it was well-intentioned. \u201cTime and time again, Americans have said we can deal with the lies that President Obama tells us because we believe in his heart, he has the best interest for the American people.\u201d\n\nWhy delve into psychoanalysis when the plain fact of a fib is right before our eyes?\n\nBut not every left-leaning pundit-analyst is defending the President. Both Bill Maher and Piers Morgan effectively called Obama a liar, and President Clinton suggested that Obama fix the Affordable Care Act to turn the lie into reality.\n\nAnother strain of psychoanalysis measures Obama\u2019s lies next to President George W. Bush\u2019s.\n\nWashington Post columnists Jonathan Capehart, on the left, and Marc A. Thiessen, on the right, battled it out in print, with Thiessen arguing, according to Washington Post opinion editor Fred Hiatt, that Bush never actually lied about the reasons for going into Iraq.\n\nAnd there\u2019s even psychoanalysis of the psychoanalysis! When Vice President Dick Cheney said Obama had lied about the insurance plans, MSNBC host Chris Matthews effectively called those remarks racist.\n\nBreaking down the \u201ctruthiness,\u201d as Stephen Colbert might call it, of Obama\u2019s promise isn\u2019t a worthless exercise. It\u2019s one I\u2019ve engaged in, and one that America has weighed in on. The President\u2019s poll numbers, particularly on honesty and trustworthiness, have sunk to new lows in the wake of these mistruths.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t calling the President a liar that tanked his poll numbers. Republicans have insisted Obama was a liar since he announced his run for President six years ago. In some cases, they were wrong. In others, they were probably right, but most people didn\u2019t care.\n\nIt was the fact that the lie was self-evident, and that he told it to a significant number of people for whom it mattered greatly.\n\nThe public has a way of deciding what lying looks like on its own. Just ask Bill Clinton, whose popularity is higher than ever. Or Weiner, who will likely permanently reside in the ash heap of history.\n\nOne lone holdout amongst all of us Freuds is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. At a press conference on Monday, he told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether the President didn't know that everybody could keep the insurance they had and just said what he thought was right. Or whether he knew what he was saying wasn\u2019t true. I don\u2019t know which one it is. But what he should do is just tell the American people the truth of what it was.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, ironically, it\u2019s this honesty that makes Christie untrustworthy with far-right ideologues and popular with most of the country. He wisely leaves the psychoanalysis to the rest of us.\n\nContact Cupp at www.thesecupp.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "S.E.
