Ben Carson says he will run for president\n\nBen Carson confirmed on Sunday that he will announce his presidential bid on Monday.\n\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon, made the announcement in a television interview with Sinclair Broadcasting ahead of his formal campaign kickoff event, still scheduled for Monday in Detroit . Carson suggested to POLITICO the interview was a pre-interview to be released around the time of the announcement but said in it: \u201cI\u2019m willing to be a part of the equation, and, therefore, I\u2019m announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCarson later acknowledged that he did informally disclose his candidacy. His comments came at the Detroit Music Hall, where he was preparing to rehearse for his announcement.\n\n\u201cWe probably wouldn\u2019t be doing all this if we weren\u2019t\u201d running, he said.\n\nSitting next to her husband at the Detroit Music Hall for the announcement rehearsal, Candy Carson deadpanned: \u201cI think the country is probably more excited than we are.\u201d\n\nCarson gained attention, and began to draw interest from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, after his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013, where he chided President Barack Obama over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCarson has not gone unnoticed in recent months, either: He recently ripped into \u201cselfie\u2019\u2019 culture and even drew the ire of Vice President Joe Biden after he postulated that being gay is \u201ca choice.\u201d \u201cA lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they\u2019re gay,\u201d he had told CNN \u201cNew Day\u201d co-host Chris Cuomo.\n\nBut the latest arrival in the Republican field told reporter Jeff Barnd that he had learned from his experience courting controversy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wander off into those extraneous areas that can be exploited. I have learned that,\u201d he told the CBS affiliate.\n\nThe candidate\u2019s schedule took another twist Sunday night: Carson is canceling the Monday events he had scheduled in Iowa.\n\nHe was initially scheduled to head straight to the Hawkeye State after his announcement, but he got word Sunday that his mother is seriously ill, so he will head headed to Texas to see her. The campaign hopes he\u2019ll make his Tuesday events in Iowa, but whether he will is unclear.\n\nIn a video posted to his YouTube channel on Sunday, Carson laid out his vision for the country over images of diverse Americans, national monuments and familiar icons, like Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\u201cIf America is to survive the challenges of the modern world, we need to heal, we need to be inspired and we need to revive the exceptional spirit that built America,\u201d a voice-over intones in the 4\u00bd minute video.\n\nNick Gass contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He confirms his plans ahead of his formal kickoff event Monday.", "title": "Ben Carson says he will run for president", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/ben-carson-says-he-will-run-for-president-117589.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/05/03/20150503_ben_carson2_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Republicans,Ben Carson 2016,Campaign 2016,Campaigns,Ben Carson,Elections 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He confirms his plans ahead of his formal kickoff event Monday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaba4\"", "article_summary": "Ben Carson says he will run for presidentBen Carson confirmed on Sunday that he will announce his presidential bid on Monday.\nHis comments came at the Detroit Music Hall, where he was preparing to rehearse for his announcement.\nThe candidate\u2019s schedule took another twist Sunday night: Carson is canceling the Monday events he had scheduled in Iowa.\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon, made the announcement in a television interview with Sinclair Broadcasting ahead of his formal campaign kickoff event, still scheduled for Monday in Detroit .\nBut the latest arrival in the Republican field told reporter Jeff Barnd that he had learned from his experience courting controversy."}
