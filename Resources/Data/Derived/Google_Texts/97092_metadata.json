For five days straight, users first read from an iPad, then switched to a printed book for another five consecutive days.\n\nResearchers found that using light-emitting devices before bed:\n\nProlongs the time it takes to fall asleep.\n\nDelays the circadian clock, or built-in daily rhythm.\n\nSuppresses levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin.\n\nReduces the amount and delays the timing of REM sleep.\n\nReduces alertness the following morning.\n\nIncreases alertness, which may lead users to delay bedtime.\n\nWhat\u2019s alarming, the authors point out, is how many American adults use electronics before bed. Fully 90 percent of adults use some type of electronics at least a few nights per week within an hour of bedtime.\n\nThe unintended biological consequences are of \u201cparticular concern,\u201d the authors say, \u201cgiven recent evidence linking chronic suppression of melatonin secretion by nocturnal light exposure with the increased risk of breast, colorectal, and advanced prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nSounds like some Americans might want to consider a New Year\u2019s resolution to revert to printed books before bed \u2014 and give their iPads a rest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Want more sleep?
