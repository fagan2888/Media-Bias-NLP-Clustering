I\u2019ve read your pieces and I don\u2019t agree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d I replied, half-smiling, thinking Uh-oh, he\u2019s recognized me. I was worn-out; this was the third leg of my journey after two eight-hour flights.\n\nBut my co-passenger looked friendly. \u201cAre you traveling for business or pleasure?\u201d he asked. \u201cWell, I\u2019m returning from a trip to India to see my ailing dad,\u201d I said.\n\nWhat followed was a civil, quite candid conversation where we touched upon different topics: race, politics, Hillary, Obama. I\u2019m paraphrasing some bits from memory.\n\nI gathered that he is a 63-year-old Franklin resident traveling back from business, that he is a devout Christian and member of the Religious Right.\n\nAnd he asked about me. \u201cAre you married?\u201d \u201cChildren?\u201d And \u201cHow many languages do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, \u201cI had an arranged marriage. \u201cTwo sons, 18 and 20; four languages.\u201d\n\nHe: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how arranged marriages work.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s been working for me for 23 years,\u201d I said.\n\nWe talked quite a bit about race. He said he doesn\u2019t like the term \u201cCaucasian\u201d in referring to white people.\n\nHe: \u201cWhat race do you think Obama is? He had a black father, a white mother, was raised by white people,\u201d Me: \u201cHe\u2019s biracial, but he looks like a black guy, so he probably had the black experience as a young man.\u201d\n\nHe: \u201cHave you been talking to my wife? Because she feels a little like that.\u201d \u201cBut that last bit was quite condemnatory,\u201d he said. Me: \u201cWe can\u2019t deny there\u2019s institutional racism in many areas.\u201d\n\nHe: \u201cTrue; I don\u2019t know what it is to wake up in the morning, black. I can\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened in Ferguson and elsewhere. But eventually, intermarrying will hopefully solve our race issues.\u201d\n\nOn Hillary, he felt she\u2019d be a \u201cstronger\u201d president than Obama on foreign policy. I held my tongue. That Mrs. Clinton is a hawk is precisely one problem some Democrats like me have with her.\n\nMeanwhile, he shared a bag of peanut M&Ms with me. I like those too, the ones with peanuts \u2014 see, who says there can be no common ground between political opposites?\n\nHe worried, he said, that he\u2019d see Shariah law in his lifetime in places like Dearborn, Mich., with its high concentration of Arab Americans.\n\n\u201cTo me, the bigger threat to our democracy is right now with the oligarchy calling most of the shots. We voters are kind of going through the motions in our democracy,\u201d I said. It seemed like he concurred.\n\nAnd so it went, an interesting back-and-forth. At flight\u2019s end, we shook hands, each saying we enjoyed talking to the other. I meant it, and I think he did, too.\n\nPeople, whatever their politics, are usually better than the groups to which they belong. I often see this in conversations with friends and acquaintances of different political persuasions. It\u2019s when the bigger groups jockey for political power that things often go awry.\n\nI am not naive and am aware that we live in a very polarized political climate. The failure of Insure Tennessee so far, the Indiana religious freedom law, and our gun laws here highlight that.\n\nBut in the individual face-to-face interactions you often notice a little more nuance and give-and-take, a little more reasonableness from both sides that you wish were part of the bigger picture.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1GrTHtD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The columnist and a fellow passenger have a powerful conversation on their flight.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The columnist and a fellow passenger have a powerful conversation on their flight.", "title": "Civil, candid conversation between political opposites", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/04/25/candid-civil-conversation-political-opposites/26349949/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The columnist and a fellow passenger have a powerful conversation on their flight.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a3146bd6c019f89ea44fe459d7b6899db6eb109a/c=610-0-1837-1227&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317097601Z.1_20150424235423_000_GT1AJEB9H.1-0.jpg", "title": "Civil, candid conversation between political opposites", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aed5177205e9e0211d5f35eacdc54cb1230004f8/c=764-0-1684-1227/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317097601Z.1_20150424235423_000_GT1AJEB9H.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3f6a4fa05937c8ab4c3197f1e0f0138a0122655a/c=610-0-1837-1227/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317097601Z.1_20150424235423_000_GT1AJEB9H.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c42481f620140a6fa6ade7dd71b923b272906088/c=406-0-2042-1227/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317097601Z.1_20150424235423_000_GT1AJEB9H.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dacc4a8f62c570ef8490afea55783a9e5f7e0b08/c=133-0-2314-1227&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317097601Z.1_20150424235423_000_GT1AJEB9H.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-24T23:26:51.990000-05:00", "shorthed": "Political opposites, civil discourse", "articleid": 26349949, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6469a252b67f723dfca36f88d2f7cb86e209423b/c=133-0-2314-1227/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317097601Z.1_20150424235423_000_GT1AJEB9H.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/481228c40a4b29c25914e02da44fa7d9d0fcc78e/c=878-0-1568-1227/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317097601Z.1_20150424235423_000_GT1AJEB9H.1-0.jpg"}, "author": "Saritha Prabhu", "title": "Civil, candid conversation between political opposites", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "data"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "political, opposites, saritha, republican, democrat, obama, flight"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0571\"", "article_summary": "What followed was a civil, quite candid conversation where we touched upon different topics: race, politics, Hillary, Obama.\nPolitical parties (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Story Highlights The columnist and a fellow passenger have a powerful conversation on their flight.\nI like those too, the ones with peanuts \u2014 see, who says there can be no common ground between political opposites?\nI am not naive and am aware that we live in a very polarized political climate.\nI was flying into Nashville from Newark recently, when the man in the adjacent seat said to me, \u201cI can\u2019t stand the political writers at The Tennessean."}
