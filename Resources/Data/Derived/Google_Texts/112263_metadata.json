Our second phase opens about a year from now. So our oncology, neonatal intensive care will physically move into the building. We\u2019ll have 10 additional operating rooms, both robotic and minimally invasive enabled.\u201d\n\nThe hospital is an active construction site, but the building looks fully formed. This hospital is designed for mothers and babies.\n\n\u201cTwo full-time birth coordinators will be on-staff to help design personalized birth experiences for women delivering here,\u201d said Heather Fox, director of women\u2019s health and oncology. \u201cIt\u2019s not a VIP thing. It\u2019s an experience for everyone who comes into the facility.\u201d\n\nNow if you\u2019re wondering what about childbirth you can actually control, you can design the music, photos on the TV and how many family members are in the room. And there is, of course, a concierge service for gifts and goodies.\n\nBut one big thing women can choose is the kind of birth they\u2019ll have. The hospital will have midwives on staff for women who want a more natural birth.\n\nFlorida Hospital for Women has four rooms with large bathtubs. Vargas draws back a shower curtain in one of the rooms.\n\n\u201cThis shower actually has jets again that women can use to alleviate back pain as they\u2019re going through the labor process,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cSo that\u2019s just one activity we heard from women who maybe want a more natural birth.\u201d\n\nThis is Florida\u2019s Hospital\u2019s biggest investment ever in women\u2019s service. The price tag comes in at $180 million dollars, and it\u2019s right in the center of Health Village. That\u2019s a large-scale, health-centered development Florida Hospital is putting together.\n\nThe kinds of amenities being shown off on this tour mean more space and more money. Owner Adventist Health System\u2019s has done well financially, which allows them to splurge a little on the new tower.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re looking at women.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finding among young mothers in many respects the amenities are a great, attractive factor,\u201d said hospital analyst Michael Carroll.\n\nNewborns is the one area where Florida Hospital doesn\u2019t dominate the Central Florida market. But just as important, for many families, mom is the key health care decision maker. If you can get mom to love Florida Hospital, she\u2019ll come back \u2013 and she\u2019ll bring the family.\n\n\u201cIf mama\u2019s happy, the family\u2019s happy,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cAnd if you can get mom to start coming to a facility and be supportive, the family follows.\u201d\n\nThe last stop on the tour is a operating room. Even that has some upgrades: Bright lighting, video monitors \u2013 and, of course, the ability to pick the soundtrack for your C-section.\n\n\u201cMom\u2019s awake,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cSo we wanted to make sure we had some focal points.\u201d\n\n-- Reporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
