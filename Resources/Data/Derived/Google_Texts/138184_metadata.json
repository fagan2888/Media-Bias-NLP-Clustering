Recently, it took part in a study testing smoking cessation techniques, and found bribery could help people quit, but not in the way you might think.\n\nResearchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania found that bribery worked only when participants were required to pay an up-front cash deposit, and risk losing it if they relapsed. If they didn\u2019t, then they\u2019d get their money back plus a cash reward of roughly $800, Reuters reported. The researchers found these techniques were about twice as effective as simply offering a monetary reward for staying away from cigarettes and five times as effective as giving out free smoking cessation aids like the nicotine replacement therapy.\n\n\u201cIt leveraged people\u2019s natural aversion to losing money,\u201d lead author Dr. Scott Halpern told Reuters.\n\nNearly seven out of 10 current smokers in the United States admit to wanting to quit. However, it\u2019s incredibly hard. Withdrawal symptoms, stress, and weight gain \u2014 caused by hunger, one withdrawal symptom \u2014 can all lead to relapse, no matter how much a person wishes to quit. It often takes several attempts, which is why the current study tested out various techniques.\n\nFor the study, researchers tested five different smoking cessation techniques on 2,538 employees at CVS retail stores. Four of them offered different kinds of incentives while the last simply provided smoking cessation guides and resources, as well as nicotine replacement therapy and a behavior modification program if the person had health insurance.\n\nFar more participants were willing to enroll in the incentive programs promising money for abstinence. However, when compared to the group that paid a deposit, their success rates were much lower \u2014 16 percent stayed smoke-free for six months compared to 52 percent. In the group that took part in typical quitting techniques, only six percent stayed smoke-free.\n\nThe research will not only help CVS employees lead healthier lives, but also save the company money in health care costs, Reuters reported. Some research suggests employees who smoke cost companies an extra $4,000 to $6,000 a year. Incentive programs with up-front deposits may play on employees\u2019 psychologies, helping them to quit. \u201cThe fact that people actively seek to minimize loss is one of several psychological insights that can help supercharge incentive programs without increasing their costs,\u201d Halpern said.\n\nSource: Halpern S, French B, Small D, et al.
