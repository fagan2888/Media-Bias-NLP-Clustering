Most people won\u2019t get their W-2 or other tax documents until later this month.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the penalty for not having health insurance.\n\nBut at one H&R Block office in San Francisco, office manager Sue Ellen Smith is expecting things to pick up fast. The IRS commissioner declared back in November that this tax season will be one of the most complicated ever.\n\n\u201cThis year taxes and health care intersect in a brand-new way,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThis is the first year that people who do not have health insurance will have to pay a fine, and Smith says that fine could be bigger than most people expect.\n\nShe takes the example of Ray and Vicky. They\u2019re a fictional couple from an H&R Block flier. Together they earn $65,000 a year. Neither has health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe biggest misconception I hear people say is, \u2018Oh, the penalty\u2019s only $95, that\u2019s easy,'\u201d Smith says.\n\nBut a lot of people like Ray and Vicky could be in for a surprise this year, Smith says. For the fictional couple, their fine will be much more than $95. \u201cIn this situation, it\u2019s almost $450.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the penalty for being uninsured is $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater. Next year, the fine goes up to $325 per person or 2 percent of income.\n\nSmith says there\u2019s some relief for people who come in before Feb. 15. That\u2019s the deadline to enroll in a health plan through Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace. \u201cThat\u2019s the smartest move,\u201d Smith says.\n\nFor those who come in by Feb. 15, they would still have to pay the penalty for having been uninsured in 2014, but would avoid the penalty for next year.\n\nBut a lot of folks won\u2019t file their taxes until April. For them, it will be too late to do anything about the penalty for being uninsured in 2015. They\u2019ll pay a penalty in their 2014 taxes and find out that they will have to pay an even greater penalty on their 2015 taxes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re kind of stuck,\u201d says Mark Steber, the chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. The company is running role-playing exercises with tax advisers to prepare them for delivering bad news \u2014 in case taxpayers want to blame the messenger.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, that\u2019s a very difficult discussion,\u201d Steber says.\n\nSteber says Jackson Hewitt has been trying to get the government to align the health insurance enrollment deadline with the tax deadline, so people filing their taxes after Feb. 15 won\u2019t be caught off guard.\n\nBack at the H&R Block office, Sue Ellen Smith has another couple to review: Dan and Lucy. They did sign up for health insurance last year. They even got a subsidy to help them pay their premiums.\n\n\u201cThey were entitled to a $1,500 subsidy,\u201d Smith says.\n\nBut then Lucy got a part-time job, raising the family\u2019s income and reducing the amount of subsidy for which they were eligible. That means they\u2019ll have to pay the subsidy back.\n\n\u201cSo that would come out of any potential refund,\u201d Smith says. Or increase the amount of tax they pay, if they are not getting a refund.\n\nOn the other hand, for people whose incomes went down over the year, they could see their refunds go up.\n\nLater this month, Covered California will send out 1095 forms \u2014 a new tax form \u2014 detailing how much subsidy each Covered California enrollee received. Employers and insurance companies will provide different versions of the 1095 form to employees and policyholders.\n\nCovered California is expected to begin a major public information push around taxes starting mid-January.
