Bruce Braley (D-IA), insulted women and farmers \u2014 a \u201cLoras College\u2019s Public Opinion Survey Center poll had Ernst leading with 48% to Braley\u2019s 41.7%. A Rasmussen Reports poll also has Ernst leading Braley by one percentage point (45%-44%).\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News noted, Ernst navigated the GOP civil war and received endorsements from Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney and united Republicans, who need to gain six seats to win back the Senate, who thought she gave them the best chance of winning back Iowa\u2019s Senate.\n\nIn endorsing her, Palin explicitly noted that Democrats would not be able to play the phony \u201cwar on women\u201d card against Ernst, an Iraq War veteran who serves in the National Guard. She later made the point that Democrats would also not be able to play the populist/income inequality card on Ernst, who grew up on a farm castrating hogs and rides a Harley to the shooting range. Braley, Ernst\u2019s opponent, was caught on video denigrating Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) as \u201cjust a farmer from Iowa\u201d who was not smart enough to be Chair the Judiciary Committee. Longtime Iowa political observer David Yepsin said Braley\u2019s \u201celitist\u201d remarks would \u201churt\u201d him in the fall. Braley\u2019s campaign insulted farmers again last week when a prominent surrogate said that castrating hogs was \u201canimal mutilation\u201d before walking back those remarks.\n\nErnst now has a slight lead in the RealClearPolitics average of the polls after having trailed Braley by about six percentage points before she got the nomination.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst leads Democrat Bruce Braley in another poll.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst leads Democrat Bruce Braley in another poll.", "title": "Joni Ernst Leads in Third Straight Iowa Senate Poll - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/06/09/Joni-Ernst-APjpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/06/09/joni-ernst-leads-in-third-straight-iowa-senate-poll/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst leads Democrat Bruce Braley in another poll.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/06/09/Joni-Ernst-APjpg.jpg", "title": "Joni Ernst Leads in Third Straight Iowa Senate Poll - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bruce Braley, Senate, War on Women,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "War on Women", "published_time": "2014-06-09T15:50:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdccc0\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst leads Democrat Bruce Braley in another poll.\nA Vox Populi poll has Ernst with a five-point lead (49%-44%), and it is the third straight poll to have Ernst ahead after she secured the nomination last Tuesday.\nErnst now has a slight lead in the RealClearPolitics average of the polls after having trailed Braley by about six percentage points before she got the nomination.\nLongtime Iowa political observer David Yepsin said Braley\u2019s \u201celitist\u201d remarks would \u201churt\u201d him in the fall.\nIn endorsing her, Palin explicitly noted that Democrats would not be able to play the phony \u201cwar on women\u201d card against Ernst, an Iraq War veteran who serves in the National Guard."}
