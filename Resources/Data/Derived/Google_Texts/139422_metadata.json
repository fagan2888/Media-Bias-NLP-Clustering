They would bring that back and if they found any identifying information like a check or credit card, they would make a fake ID so they could go to the bank and cash the check,\u201d said Bellevue police Ofc. Seth Tyler.\n\nHe cautions people to get a mailbox that you can lock and to black out your address on your registration in your car.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. If you just want to have your name that shows that you are the owner, you can take a sharpie so they don`t have your address if they break into your car,\u201d said Tyler.\n\nNeighbors play a crucial role in preventing crime.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in this case was the neighbor saw some stolen construction signs in their courtyard of the suspect\u2019s apartment, called us and we went and investigated and that led to this huge ID theft ring being busted, so the lesson here is if you see something that doesn\u2019t look right, say something,\u201d said Ofc. Tyler.\n\nDetectives say McCabe is driving a 2010 Blue Volkswagon Jetta and is believed to be in the Seattle or Bellevue areas.\n\nIf you know where he is, call an anonymous tip into:\n\nCRIME STOPPERS: 1-800-222-TIPS\n\nCLICK HERE for information on how to TEXT A TIP to Crime Stoppers", "article_metadata": {"description": "WANTED IN BELLEVUE --\u00a0 A man accused of being the ringleader of a massive identity theft crew is on the run.
