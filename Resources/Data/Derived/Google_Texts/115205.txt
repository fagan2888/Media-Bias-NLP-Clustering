Universal Health Services Inc. reported sharply higher third-quarter profit, bolstered by higher admission rates.

But citing operating trends, the company lowered the top end of its earnings projection for the year by 10 cents, saying it now expects to make $6.75 to $7.05 a share.

The results come after recent volatility in the hospital sector after several of the large hospital operators warned their results for the quarter would miss analysts' projections, fueling concerns that the sector was entering a slump.

Like its industry peers, Universal Health--which operates medical, surgical and behavioral-health facilities--has largely benefited from an increase in newly insured patients under the Affordable Care Act.

In the most recent period, the provision for doubtful accounts--money set aside to cover the cost of unpaid bills--rose to $211.4 million, up 34% from the year earlier and 19% from the second quarter.

Overall, Universal Health reported a profit of $150.3 million, or $1.48 a share, compared with $82.8 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, largely tied to the adoption of electronic health records at its acute-care hospitals, profit rose to $1.53 a share from $1.36 a share a year earlier.

Net revenue rose 9% to $2.23 billion.

Analysts had projected profit of $1.57 a share on revenue of $2.22 billion.

On a same-facility basis, acute-care hospitals reported a 7.2% increase in revenue with admissions, excluding outpatient services, up 5.1% and adjusted patient days up 5.6%. Meanwhile, revenue from its behavioral health hospitals rose 5%, with adjusted admissions increasing and adjusted patient days up 1.6%.

Shares closed Tuesday at $116.04, up 4% this year.
