Ted Cruz \u201cthe Capitulating Canadian,\u201d for supporting a compromise bill.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Liberty PAC, which supports Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, launched the ad on YouTube. The spot mimics a monster truck rally commercial and features \u201cdefender of freedom\u201d Paul\u2019s head on a hulking body, Cruz in front of Canadian flag and President Barack Obama behind a laptop with his campaign logo on it.\n\nThe debate is a major point of contention between the two 2016 hopefuls, who once filibustered together against the Affordable Care Act and the president\u2019s use of drone strikes. Paul has made ending NSA surveillance pillar of his campaign, and filibustered PATRIOT Act authorization. Cruz co-sponsored the USA FREEDOM Act, a bill to balance privacy and security concerns that passed the House but is opposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMost legal scholars say Cruz, born in Calgary to an American-born mother, is still eligible to be president.\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign declined to comment on the ad.\n\nJews swoon for Cruz\n\nCruz hammered home his staunchly pro-Israel platform in at New York gala for an organization funded by prominent Jewish Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nThe senator criticized the pending Iran nuclear weapons deal and Obama\u2019s relationship with Israel at the dinner for The World Values Network\u2013run by Rabbi Shumley Boteach and supported by Adelson.\n\nCruz also slammed the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, meant to economically penalize Israel, calling it \u201cantisemitism plain and simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a president of the United States who will stand up and say if a university in this country boycotts the nation of Israel than that university will forfeit federal taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nGay hotelier who hosted Cruz donated to campaign\n\nIan Reisner and Mati Weiderpass hosted Cruz last month for a dinner at their New York apartment and insisted it wasn\u2019t a fundraiser. But the New York Times reported that Reisner donated to Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign, which drew harsh criticism from the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of transparency, I gave Senator Cruz a $2,700 check to show my support for his work on behalf of Israel,\u201d Reisner said in a statement to the Times \u201cWhen I realized his donation could be misconstrued as supporting his anti-gay marriage agenda, I asked for the money back. Senator Cruz\u2019s office gave the money back, and I have no intention of giving any money to any politicians who aren\u2019t in support of L.G.B.T. issues.\u201d\n\nWeiderpass and Reisner were slammed for hosting Cruz, who\u2019s actively opposed same-sex marriage. The April discussion reportedly focused on Israel and national security.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNS9jcnV6LXJvdW5kdXAtY2FwaXR1bGF0aW5nLWNhbmFkaWFuLWpld2lzaC12YWx1ZXMtZ2FsYS1kb25hdGlvbi1mcm9tLWdheS1ob3RlbGllci5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON--An attack ad focusing on\u00a0the Senate\u00a0debate over NSA surveillance called Sen.
