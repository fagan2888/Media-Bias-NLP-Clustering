Colorado State won 48-45 ( Matt York )\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- While people will talk about the fantastic finish to Colorado State's 48-45 New Mexico Bowl victory over Washington State for a while, the hot topic early was a verbal altercation between Cougars' junior quarterback Connor Halliday and CSU defensive line coach Greg Lupfer.\n\nIn video that hit the internet fast, it appeared Lupfer had used off-color language toward Halliday, who after the game admitted as much and more, though he didn't elaborate.\n\n\"Coach grabbed me and said some profane things to me,\" Halliday said. \"That's all I'll say about it.\"\n\nIn an extend clip of the incident shown on ESPN, it appears the two may have made contact, but it wasn't initiated by Lupfer. It also shows Lupfer never grabbed Halliday, but another coach, assistant strength and conditioning coach Rashad Harris, does touch Halliday in an attempt to seperate the two and get Halliday moving back toward the field and away from the CSU sideline.\n\nLupfer was not made available for comment after the game, but the school did issue a statement from him through the team's Twitter account in two posts.\n\n\"I am truly sorry for what I said. It was wrong and those words to not represent who I am and what I believe in. I apologize for the embarrassment I caused Colorado State University, this team & my family,\" they read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt happened after the first of Halliday's six touchdown passes on the day. Colorado State coach Jim McElwain said after the game he didn't know exactly what had transpired between the two.\n\n\"I heard something about it, but honestly I don't know anything until I look at it,\" McElwain said. \"We'll definitely handle it in a quick manner, whatever it is.\"\n\nBy the end of the game, Colorado State athletic director Jack Graham had seen the video, had already talked to Lupfer and planned to investigate further.\n\n\"I'm fully aware of what happened; I've seen footage of what happened,\" Graham said. \"We're going to take a deep dive on this. It appears as if it was a very inappropriate event. We will take a deep and thorough dive around it. If it is what it appears to have been, that's not who we are, it's not who Colorado State University is. It's unacceptable behavior, and we'll deal with it appropriately.\"\n\nGraham said if during their investigation they needed to call Washington State, he would. He also said they would not rush to judgment, adding they will take as much time as necessary to come to the right decision.\n\nRecords all around -- Colorado State running back Kapri Bibbs continued his impressive debut season, rushing for 169 yards and three touchdowns in the win. It bumps his season totals to 1,741 yards, 31 touchdowns and 186 points on the season -- all single-season records. His touchdowns are also a Mountain West record and lead the nation. His scoring this season already ranks eighth on the career list, the touchdowns second. His three touchdowns in the game tied the bowl's record.\n\nQuarterback Garrett Grayson entered the game as the school's single-season passing yardage leader, a figure he increased to 3,696. His 31-of-50 performance also gave him the single-season marks for completions (297) and attempts (476), and he tied Justin Holland's record with 23 touchdown passes in a year.\n\nKicker Jared Roberts made four field goals, giving him 21 on the season, tying for the second most in a season. With 17 points, he also established the record for kicker scoring at CSU with 122 points, surpassing the 118 of Jeff Babcock in 2002.\n\nThey helped cap the most impressive offensive season in Rams history, as they produced a record 6,044 yards and 507 points while running 1,051 plays.\n\nMax Morgan's five tackles give him 134, the 10th-best season total.\n\nSo close -- Colorado State's two biggest offensive plays weren't the best they've produced at the New Mexico Bowl.\n\nCharles Lovett and Garrett Grayson connected for a 63-yard touchdown pass, but in 2008, Billy Farris and Rashaun Greer hooked up for a 69-yard score.\n\nAnd Bibbs' 75-yard run was two shy of Gartrell Johnson's game-clincher.\n\nBowl numbers -- Colorado State finished with a total of 5,105 tickets distributed, surpassing what the team did in 2008. It helped produce a crowd of 27,104, the fourth largest crowd in the bowl's history, which witnessed the longest New Mexico Bowl ever at 4:06. ... The temperature at kickoff was 38 degrees which tied the 2011 game as the second coldest. ... Washington State's 35 first-half points broke the game's record. ... CSU is now the only undefeated team with multiple appearances in New Mexico Bowl history at 2-0. It gave them eight wins on the season, the most since 2002, when the Rams won 10 to claim the Mountain West title.\n\nMike Brohard can be reached at 635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and @mbrohard\n\nEds note: This story has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_24774562/assistant-csu-football-coach-greg-lupfer-apologizes-outburst", "modificationDate": "2013-12-22T11:26:41-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1221/20131221__22rhscfn~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard  Sports Editor", "description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- While people will talk about the fantastic finish to Colorado State's 48-45 New Mexico Bowl victory over Washington State for a while, the hot topic early was a verbal altercation between Cougars' junior quarterback Connor Halliday and CSU defensive line coach Greg Lupfer.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:24774562:view"}, "startDate": "2013-12-21T20:08:27-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_24774562/assistant-csu-football-coach-greg-lupfer-apologizes-outburst", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1221/20131221__22rhscfn~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- While people will talk about the fantastic finish to Colorado State's 48-45 New Mexico Bowl victory over Washington State for a while, the hot topic early was a verbal altercation between Cougars' junior quarterback Connor Halliday and CSU defensive line coach Greg Lupfer.", "title": "Assistant CSU football coach Greg Lupfer apologizes for outburst"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- While people will talk about the fantastic finish to Colorado State's 48-45 New Mexico Bowl victory over Washington State for a while, the hot topic early was a verbal altercation between Cougars' junior quarterback Connor Halliday and CSU defensive line coach Greg Lupfer.", "title": "Assistant CSU football coach Greg Lupfer apologizes for outburst", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_24774562/assistant-csu-football-coach-greg-lupfer-apologizes-outburst", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1221/20131221__22rhscfn~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-21T20:08:27-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2023-12-21T20:00:56-0700", "sailthru.title": "Assistant CSU football coach Greg Lupfer apologizes for outburst", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CSU", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Mike Brohard", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1221/20131221__22rhscfn~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-12-21T20:10:31-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald CSU Colorado State University Rams sports football basketball"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01dd\"", "article_summary": "Colorado State coach Jim McElwain said after the game he didn't know exactly what had transpired between the two.\nBy the end of the game, Colorado State athletic director Jack Graham had seen the video, had already talked to Lupfer and planned to investigate further.\nBowl numbers -- Colorado State finished with a total of 5,105 tickets distributed, surpassing what the team did in 2008.\nIf it is what it appears to have been, that's not who we are, it's not who Colorado State University is.\nI apologize for the embarrassment I caused Colorado State University, this team & my family,\" they read."}
