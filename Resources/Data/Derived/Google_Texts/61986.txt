× Milwaukee communities sending help for Ebola victims

BROOKFIELD (WITI) — Ebola is hitting countries in West Africa hard — here in Milwaukee communities are coming together to send help.

Hundreds gathered all day long at the Cross of Life Lutheran Church on Saturday, October 18th, that started at 8:30 a.m in Brookfield.

They are packing food for victims in Liberia in West Africa, one of the countries suffering the worst of the outbreak.

“We are doing such an amazing thing, every time a box is packed our tables are having fun, we’re cheering. This is really a positive and amazing environment to be a part of, it’s been really fun,” said Ally Flynn, volunteer coordinator.

All of the food is coming from Worldwide Hunger Relief, a non-profit in Waukesha.

All volunteers purchased the box they are packing, and they took donations to pay for shipping.
