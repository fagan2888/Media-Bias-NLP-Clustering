A once-dominant program\u2014the longest running in television virtue of being on the air since 1947 \u2014 MTP has fallen from first to third for the third straight quarter, sitting behind ABC\u2019s This Week and CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. In fact, the show is currently experiencing the worst ratings in its 74-year history.\n\nMatters hit a low point two months ago when the Washington Post reported that network brass had ordered psychological research of host David Gregory and his family. It was apparently all done in an effort to see how the 18-year NBC veteran could relate to audiences more easily. Regardless of the reasoning (NBC later disputed the characterization of the resource tapped to do the research), the public portrayal of Gregory being in need of any outside help was an embarrassment to the program and network.\n\nAll of that said, it is curious to see MTP preempted for the third time in five weeks due to sports programming (English Premier League Soccer on May 11; Monaco Grand Prix on May 25; French Open Men\u2019s Final today, June 8)\u2026.especially when considering the current struggles of the program. Note: Meet the Press has been preempted for the Monaco Grand Prix and French Open for years (Premier League is a new development), as the contract for each calls for network coverage of said events (See: NBC Sports Network on cable will not suffice). But with all of the other channels available under the NBC Universal umbrella to allow MTP to avoid being preempted altogether\u2014which only forces its dwindling audience to turn to its competitors and perhaps risks losing them for good\u2014why not move it during the preempt weeks to MSNBC and CNBC?\n\nThe recommendation especially applies to the lost show this week. It\u2019s no secret that all of the cable news networks\u2014particularly Fox News\u2014saw ratings increases in light of the Bowe Bergdahl controversy that dominated the week. Pundits and politicos are having a field day with this story. Passions are higher than usual. Audiences are obviously engaged. It was therefore worth it for MTP to call an audible here, as the show would have undoubtedly benefitted and had a higher chance of being newsworthy than other weeks regardless of channel venue. That is, of course, unless NBC execs have no issue with losing badly to CBS and ABC each week\u2026because neither Face the Nation or This Week are ever preempted for any other kind of programming outside of breaking news.\n\n\u201cMeet the Press has always been the must-stop place where news is made and critical conversations take place,\u201d declared NBC News President Deborah Turness in April, \u201cand we will continue that charge while at the same time adapting and innovating with new ideas on all platforms and connecting what\u2019s happening in Washington to Americans across the country.\u201d\n\nStrong words from Ms. Turness.\n\nBut ultimately hollow when considering the show has been off the air just as much as on lately\u2026\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Joe Concha on Twitter @ConchaMedia", "article_metadata": {"description": "As you may have heard, NBC\u2019s Meet the Press is struggling more than Susan Rice lately on Sunday mornings.
