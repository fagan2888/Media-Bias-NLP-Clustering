It\u2019s failing the very people it was intended to help,\u201d Carly Fiorina said at the GOP\u2019s debate in Milwaukee earlier in the week.\n\nBut repeal of the landmark federal health care law immediately raises the question of how the candidates would replace it or at least deal with the consequences of its repeal.\n\nIt\u2019s an important issue in Florida, a state that continues to rank among the worst when it comes to providing health care coverage for its growing population.\n\nA new national survey by the personal finance website WalletHub was released this week, highlighting the states with the highest and lowest uninsured rates in 2014. It showed Florida had the third highest rate of uninsured residents at 16.57 percent, trailing only Alaska and Texas.\n\nBut there has been significant improvement under Obamacare, with 695,899 persons gaining health insurance since 2010 and the uninsured rate falling from 21.26 percent, WalletHub said.\n\nFlorida still has many challenges, including ranking 46th among all the states with 9.34 percent of its children uninsured in 2014. Massachusetts was the national leader, with only 1.54 percent of its children uninsured. Florida\u2019s adult uninsured rate was 18.45 percent last year.\n\nAnother trend is that the uninsured rate is higher in the states, like Florida, that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Those states had an uninsured rate of 12.74 percent, compared to 9.35 percent in the states that expanded Medicaid, WalletHub said.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, whose state has expanded Medicaid, has differentiated himself on that issue from the other candidates, calling for Obamacare\u2019s repeal but saying he wants to find a way to retain the Medicaid expansion effort.\n\nMost candidates have not outlined detailed health care plans. At the Milwaukee debate, Fiorina told a moderator that states could replace the health care coverage for its sickest residents with chronic diseases by providing state-run \u201chigh risk\u201d insurance pools.\n\nThe problem is the high-risk pools have a spotty history. The coverage plans remain expensive for individuals and even with higher premiums, the states must subsidize the coverage costs. Florida tried it but closed its pool to new participants in 1991 because of the cost.\n\nObamacare will also be an issue that will unite the Democrats in next year\u2019s presidential election. They will rally their supporters in defense of the health care plan.\n\nU.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, said this week she is supporting a state constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid to cover people who earn 133 percent of the federal poverty level, $32,252 for a family of four.\n\n\u201cWhy were you re-elected? You were elected to do something,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd one of the things I am doing is helping leading the fight to get (this amendment) on the ballot, telling the Legislature I served in for 10 years to take the money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://politics.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/11/AP_588571429930.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "All GOP candidates are united on this issue.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "But repeal of the landmark federal health care law immediately raises the question of how the candidates would replace it or at least deal with the consequences of its repeal.\nThey want to repeal Obamacare, the signature policy achievement of Barack Obama\u2019s two terms as president.\nBut there has been significant improvement under Obamacare, with 695,899 persons gaining health insurance since 2010 and the uninsured rate falling from 21.26 percent, WalletHub said.\nThose states had an uninsured rate of 12.74 percent, compared to 9.35 percent in the states that expanded Medicaid, WalletHub said.\nThey will rally their supporters in defense of the health care plan."}
