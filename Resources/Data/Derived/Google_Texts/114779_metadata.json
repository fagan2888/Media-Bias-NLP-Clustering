Spencer appears to be doing better, though he remains in serious condition.\n\nIn addition, if anyone was concerned about the New York City Marathon bringing in potential travelers or participants from Ebola-stricken countries, there need be no worries: no one from West Africa will be running in the race, and health officials have stated that there should be no fear of the virus spreading during the event.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely assumed there would be cases in New York by the time we got to the marathon, and as always, the health and safety of our runners and our volunteers is always of primary concern,\u201d Mary Wittenberg, the marathon director, said. She noted that officials \u201cheard very little from our runners\u201d regarding fears about the disease during the race, even though she and other marathon planners had been preparing for months to address the disease.\n\nThe NYC Marathon will take place on November 2, and health officials will reportedly be working on ensuring the safety of all those involved. There will be some African runners from countries that aren\u2019t affected by Ebola, but all will be screened at the airport as well as questioned to see if they\u2019ve had any contact with Ebola patients. While Idrissa Kargbo from Sierra Leone participated last year, he won\u2019t be running this year.\n\n\u201cWe are carefully monitoring updates from the CDC and the NYC Department of Health and will continue to coordinate closely with our health department partners at the city and state level to ensure the safety of participants, volunteers and spectators. The safety and security of our runners, spectators, volunteers and staff is always our main priority,\u201d Chris Weiller, VP for New York Road Runners, said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nyc marathon, ebola, ebola fear nyc", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The NYC marathon director notes that Ebola should not be a concern at the upcoming race, as there will be no runners traveling from West Africa.", "title": "Ebola Not A Concern At NYC Marathon; No West African Runners To Be Present", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ebola-not-concern-new-york-city-marathon-no-west-african-runners-will-be-present-race-308213", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/28/nyc-marathon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The NYC marathon director notes that Ebola should not be a concern at the upcoming race, as there will be no runners traveling from West Africa.", "title": "Ebola Not A Concern At NYC Marathon; No West African Runners To Be Present", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ebola-not-concern-new-york-city-marathon-no-west-african-runners-will-be-present-race-308213", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/28/nyc-marathon.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/28/nyc-marathon.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-28T17:45:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-28T17:44:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The NYC marathon director notes that Ebola should not be a concern at the upcoming race, as there will be no runners traveling from West Africa."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c77\"", "article_summary": "The safety and security of our runners, spectators, volunteers and staff is always our main priority,\u201d Chris Weiller, VP for New York Road Runners, said.\nThe NYC Marathon will take place on November 2, and health officials will reportedly be working on ensuring the safety of all those involved.\nNew Yorkers shouldn\u2019t have anything to fear when it comes to Ebola at this point; Dr. Craig Spencer, the first American with Ebola in the city, is currently isolated and being cared for at Bellevue Hospital.\nThere will be some African runners from countries that aren\u2019t affected by Ebola, but all will be screened at the airport as well as questioned to see if they\u2019ve had any contact with Ebola patients.\n\u201cWe absolutely assumed there would be cases in New York by the time we got to the marathon, and as always, the health and safety of our runners and our volunteers is always of primary concern,\u201d Mary Wittenberg, the marathon director, said."}
