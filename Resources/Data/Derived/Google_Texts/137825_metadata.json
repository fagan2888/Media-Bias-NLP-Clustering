Rick Snyder listen to Kevyn Orr after his appointment as Detroit EM March 14, 2013.

Coordinating the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history while simultaneously trying to restructure city operations, even with a posse of high-priced consultants, is a huge job. The current emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, wants to complete the bankruptcy and his term in 18 months. This is a recipe for inappropriate appointments, rich living and major mistakes.\n\nNow the mayor of Detroit, Dave Bing, has weighed in with scathing comments about Orr\u2019s performance. From The Detroit News:\n\nMayor Dave Bing reiterated Wednesday his growing frustration with how consultants and Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr have taken over City Hall and sidelined his team.\n\nThe comments came after The Detroit News obtained Tuesday a deposition in the city\u2019s bankruptcy case in which Bing said his department heads are \u2018frustrated as hell\u2019 by the consultants and Orr is \u2018not doing a competent job\u2019 restructuring city operations.\n\nBing told reporters after a Wednesday press conference urging people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act that his criticism is not personal, but city leaders should be running the day-to-day operations.\n\nDetroit\u2019s former state-appointed program manager, Kriss Andrews, who was removed from his post in July, had even harsher words for Orr. From The Detroit News:\n\n\u2018Mr. Andrews\u2019 conclusion is that the emergency manager, and I quote, threw away the head start we gave him, he frankly is not competent at all,\u2019 Ullman said. \u2018In fact, he\u2019s embarrassingly incompetent and only listened to his equally incompetent staff and (does) not well exercise the added powers he had. So Mr. Andrews gives him an A in long-term liabilities and an F in operations.\u2019\n\nI wrote in July:\n\nSince Kevyn Orr was appointed Detroit\u2019s emergency manager on March 18, his approach always seemed a little off, especially when bankruptcy is concerned. For a Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy to work, most of the parties must come to a mutual agreement about what each will sacrifice. Federal bankruptcy judges only have the authority to \u2018cram down\u2019 a minority of creditors in a specific class when the majority agrees. Federal bankruptcy judge Steven Rhodes, for example, can\u2019t force all bondholders in a class to take a 50 percent haircut. Absent that power, municipal bankruptcy usually lasts much longer than others, as parties come to an agreement.\n\nThis balancing act is no easy task for a bankruptcy leader (city official, receiver, emergency manager or lead attorney). But when Orr laid out his creditor proposal on June 14, his aggressive treatment of retirees and bondholders seemed to me like he was wielding a chainsaw where a paring knife would have been the best tool to begin the work. The law firm Jones Day, the firm Orr left before becoming emergency manager, had been involved in the corporate bankruptcy fight of Chrysler. Orr\u2019s opening punch felt like a move from corporate bankruptcy.\n\nWhat authority do Michigan\u2019s laws give to Orr? (Section 9(2)):\n\nUpon appointment, an emergency manager shall act for and in the place and stead of the governing body and the office of chief administrative officer of the local government. The emergency manager shall have broad powers in receivership to rectify the financial emergency and to assure the fiscal accountability of the local government and the local government\u2019s capacity to provide or cause to be provided necessary governmental services essential to the public health, safety, and welfare.\n\nFollowing appointment of an emergency manager and during the pendency of receivership, the governing body and the chief administrative officer of the local government shall not exercise any of the powers of those offices except as may be specifically authorized in writing by the emergency manager or as otherwise provided by this act and are subject to any conditions required by the emergency manager.\n\nThe state law authorizes Orr to give authority to Bing for whatever functions he designates. So why didn\u2019t Orr, after his appointment last March, carve out a substantial role for Bing? He had success in walking down the size of Detroit\u2019s municipal infrastructure. The idea that Orr, in 18 months time, could come in and remake Detroit city government without the support and knowledge of current officials is unrealistic. From The Detroit News again:\n\nOn Wednesday, Bing said the removal of 11 of the 25 department heads is moving the city backward in delivering city services. Bing added the business community told him it is still frustrated with public safety areas such as EMS, fire and police service. They also are frustrated over the lack of timely buses and lighting problems.\n\nMichigan Governor Rick Synder might want to re-evaluate whether granting the entire authority for a municipality to one outside individual is the best approach for righting a city\u2019s woes.\n\nDetroit CFO resigns after accusations of racism\n\nBy Joseph Lichterman\n\nDETROIT | Tue Oct 15, 2013 7:48pm EDT\n\nDETROIT (Reuters) \u2013 Detroit Chief Financial Officer Jim Bonsall resigned on Tuesday after allegations arose last week that he made racist remarks during a meeting and demeaned a co-worker.\n\nBonsall, who is white, met with Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr on Tuesday afternoon to tender his resignation, according to Orr\u2019s spokesman Bill Nowling.\n\nBonsall had been suspended with pay pending an internal investigation into his conduct, Nowling said.\n\nIn a statement issued last week, Bonsall said: \u201cI apologize and am sorry for having offended coworkers over comments I made during a recent meeting. Regardless of the outcome of the internal investigation or whether I keep my job as a result of it, it was never my intention to offend anyone.\u201d\n\nThe allegations came to light after City Treasurer Cheryl Johnson sent a letter to Orr, Mayor Dave Bing and other city officials outlining Bonsall\u2019s alleged behavior, according to Nowling.\n\nIn a meeting, Bonsall asked if he could \u201cshoot somebody in a hoodie\u201d during Angels\u2019 Night, when volunteers patrol neighborhoods throughout the city to prevent arson in the days leading up to Halloween, local media in Detroit reported.\n\nBonsall\u2019s comment appeared to allude to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black Florida teenager who was shot and killed last year. Detroit\u2019s population is about 83 percent black.\n\nJohnson, who is black, wrote in her letter that Bonsall \u201chas demonstrated a pattern of behavior that has created a hostile work environment,\u201d adding that most of his actions were directed at minority women, local media reported.\n\nOrr hired Bonsall in July. Johnson was previously the city\u2019s finance director, but earlier this month Bonsall named her treasurer, a move she considered a demotion, according to media reports.\n\nOrr said in a statement that his office will conduct the search for a new CFO.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Lichterman; Editing by Ken Wills)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://voiceofdetroit.net/2013/10/20/detroits-forsaken-leaders-orrs-cfo-resigns-over-racist-comments/", "type": "article", "title": "DETROIT\u2019S FORSAKEN LEADERS; ORR'S CFO RESIGNS OVER RACIST COMMENTS", "site_name": "VOICE OF DETROIT:  The city's independent newspaper, unbossed and unbought", "author": "Diane Bukowski"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1f5\"", "article_summary": "The current emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, wants to complete the bankruptcy and his term in 18 months.\nBonsall, who is white, met with Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr on Tuesday afternoon to tender his resignation, according to Orr\u2019s spokesman Bill Nowling.\nPhoto: Diane BukowskiBy Cate LongOctober 16, 2013MuniLand\u00bb Analysis & Opinion HomeReuters Blog Archive: Being the emergency manager for bankrupt Detroit is no picnic.\nRick Snyder listen to Kevyn Orr after his appointment as Detroit EM March 14, 2013.\nFrom The Detroit News:Mayor Dave Bing reiterated Wednesday his growing frustration with how consultants and Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr have taken over City Hall and sidelined his team."}
