The first was a 54-yard reception on a deep flag route \u2014 the second longest of his career \u2014 for a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. The other was a 12-yard, one-handed catch in the corner of the end zone that gave CU a 17-7 lead in the third quarter.\n\nThat lead crumbled, as CSU took over with its ground game. CSU\u2019s defense stiffened from that point and harassed CU quarterback Sefo Liufau into several poor throws.\n\nSpruce had 81 yards on five catches after three quarters.\n\nSpruce had combined for 99 receptions the previous two years against CSU while serving as a complementary receiver to Paul Richardson, now with the Seattle Seahawks. Spruce is now CU\u2019s go-to receiver, and he played the part to near perfection in the latest Rocky Mountain Showdown.\n\nPHOTOS: CSU 31, CU 17 in Rocky Mountain Showdown\n\nTrouble is, he had little help on offense as the Buffs could not maintain a ground game, and CSU\u2019s coverage blanketed other receivers.\n\nSpruce also plays a big role in punt returns and was outstanding in that role, too.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU receiver Nelson Spruce shines in loss", "title": "CU receiver Nelson Spruce shines in loss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/29/cu-receiver-nelson-spruce-shines-in-loss/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140829__20140830_B8_SP30FBCCUSIDEp1.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140829__20140830_B8_SP30FBCCUSIDEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T22:51:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:02:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "It wasn\u2019t enough Friday night, but Colorado wide receiver Nelson Spruce was again keen on carving up Colorado State\u2019s defense \u2014 and the hearts of Rams fans.\nA year after catching eight passes for 99 yards against CSU, Spruce produced two splendid touchdowns to account for the Buffaloes\u2019 only touchdowns in their 31-17 loss to Colorado State.\nSpruce is now CU\u2019s go-to receiver, and he played the part to near perfection in the latest Rocky Mountain Showdown.\nSpruce also plays a big role in punt returns and was outstanding in that role, too.\nSpruce had combined for 99 receptions the previous two years against CSU while serving as a complementary receiver to Paul Richardson, now with the Seattle Seahawks."}
