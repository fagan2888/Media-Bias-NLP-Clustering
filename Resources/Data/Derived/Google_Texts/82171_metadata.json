Todd Wasmund, left, holds the unit\u2019s flag during the change-of-command ceremony Friday on Cottrell Field at Fort Stewart. Wasmund assumed command from Col. John O\u2019Grady right, who helped establish the unit during his two years in the Marne Division. View Larger Fort Stewart and 3rd Infantry\u2019s Division Artillery said farewell to the leader behind its formation, Col. John O\u2019Grady, at his recent change of command on Cottrell Field.\n\n\n\nDuring his two years at Fort Stewart O\u2019Grady helped with the formation of 42nd Fires Brigade and then transformed it into today\u2019s DIVARTY with more than 2,000 soldiers.\n\n\n\nChanges of command focus on the change in leadership and some of the accomplishments of the outgoing commander. The ceremony Friday was really a lesson in leadership and how a commander can get a task done with the support of those under their command.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you came in, there really was no fires brigade, there was no DIVARTY and you stood the organization up, converted it back to a DIVARTY, right back where it should be,\u201d Maj. Gen. Mike Murray, the 3rd Infantry Division\u2019s commanding general, said in a video message from Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nBrig. Gen. James Blackburn, Task Force Marne commander, also credited O\u2019Grady for DIVARTY\u2019s formation and praised him.\n\n\n\nBlackburn also mentioned O\u2019Grady\u2019s leadership with the recent Odin\u2019s Thunder, a training exercise that coordinated units across the world to direct fire missions on Fort Stewart.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Grady is going to work as the chief of staff of the Army\u2019s Senior Fellows Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\n\nWhen he spoke, O\u2019Grady thanked God for the opportunity to command.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you think about an individual who really has no right to be standing here today, you\u2019re looking at him,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s got to be some plan. I don\u2019t know what it is, maybe just a sick sense of humor, but I am thankful and I am humble for the privilege of command.\u201d\n\n\n\nCommand is \u201ca sacred trust that we have with the American people,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inherent fabric of our profession, and it needs to be treated as such, and it needs to be treated with reverence.\u201d\n\n\n\nO\u2019Grady talked about non-commissioned officers and their creed, which is displayed in DIVARTY headquarters next to his office.\n\nThe creed \u201creminds me daily of what makes this organization great and what makes our Army great. And it\u2019s the people. And it\u2019s especially the enlisted and non-commissioned officer corps. You do all the hard things that we ask of you,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Grady ended by reminding the soldiers on the field what it means to be a soldier by invoking the sacrifices represented on Warriors Walk on Cottrell Field.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd the last thing I\u2019m going to tell you is, 468 trees.\u201d O\u2019Grady said. \u201cThey stand as guardians for what it is you should be and you must be. Don\u2019t ever forget that, and don\u2019t ever forget that sacrifice and what it means. You have a responsibility to live up to it as best as you possibly can each and every day.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe incoming DIVARTY commander, Col. Todd Wasmund, is coming from the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, where he supported Africa Command, which is based in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting day,\u201d Wasmund said before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to join the Division Artillery here in 3rd ID, and I\u2019m excited for the opportunity to serve with these soldiers.\u201d\n\n\n\nWasmund credited O\u2019Grady with how far the unit had come and how it has met the needs of the division.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat task has been enormous,\u201d Wasmund said. \u201cAnd I have only admiration for the work that you have led so well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bryancountynews.com/archives/38281/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/bryancountynews/article/2015/07/23/DIVARTY_change_of_command.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Fort Stewart and 3rd Infantry\u2019s Division Artillery said farewell to the leader behind its formation, Col.
