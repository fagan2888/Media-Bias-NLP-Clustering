Nathan Deal calls the 7.9 percent unemployment rate an \"outlier\" compared to the 300,000-plus jobs created in his first term. That includes 80,000 jobs created last year, putting Georgia sixth in the nation for job growth.\n\nDemocratic challenger, state Sen. Jason Carter calls the 7.9 percent unemployment rate for August and September proof that the state\u2019s economic plan is failing the middle class. He has pledged to boost classroom funding as one fix.\n\nAs Election Day nears, PolitiFact Georgia has moved beyond that rhetoric and fact checked specific claims about the economy and state budget from both camps.\n\nSTATE REVENUE REBOUNDING?\n\nIn a Sept. 15 candidate forum, Deal said the state\u2019s plummeting revenue levels had contributed to lower education funding. Overall revenue, he said, had just returned this year to 2007 levels, before he took office amid the Great Recession.\n\nRecords of the Governor's Office of Planning and Budget confirm that 2007 was Georgia\u2019s fiscal high water mark. Taxes revenue reached $17.8 billion that year, up $1.3 billion from 2006.\n\nAt the low point \u2013 the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010 \u2013 total tax collections fell to $14.5 billion --- or $3.3 billion off the peak.\n\nIt wasn't until fiscal 2014, which ended June 30 of this year, that total state tax collections were back to --- and slightly above --- 2007 levels, budget documents show.\n\nTax collections for 2014 were $17.9 billion. The rebound was part of the reason Deal was able to reduce state austerity cuts to public education from $1 billion-plus a year for each of the past five years to about $747 million this year.\n\nThat means the cuts remain. But the governor was right on the money with his numbers. We rated his statement True.\n\nHOW IS THE MIDDLE CLASS FARING?\n\nCarter also invoked the Georgia\u2019s economy when he said in a television ad that state leaders had not done enough on behalf of the state\u2019s middle-class residents.\n\n\"In the last 10 years, Georgia\u2019s middle-class income has dropped $6,500,\" he said in the ad. \"We have to change that.\"\n\nHistorical data from the U.S. Census bureau supports Carter\u2019s claim.\n\nThe numbers how that that the median household income in Georgia fell by an estimated $6,682, from $54,803 in 2002 to $48,121 in 2012, when adjusted for inflation.\n\nNationally, in that same period, the median household income dropped from $54,127 to $51,017, or $3,110, according to the Census Bureau's data.\n\nThat means Carter was conservative in his assessment. We rated his claim True.\n\nDOES DEAL GET CREDIT FOR RESTORING PRE-K?\n\nOn his campaign website, Deal takes credit for restoring Georgia's lottery-funded pre-kindergarten program to its traditional 180 days a year, calling it a \"real result\" of his tenure.\n\nThousands of Georgians take advantage of the nationally lauded program every year, sending their 4-year-olds to free pre-K in 3,800 classes statewide.\n\nDeal took on the falling lottery revenue and growing expenses that threatened the program and sister HOPE scholarships shortly after he took office in 2011.\n\nHe first proposed converting pre-K from a full-day to a part-day program, but he abandoned that proposal after a public outcry. As an alternative, he asked lawmakers to reduce the pre-K school year from 180 to 160 days, for a savings estimated at $22 million a year.\n\nThe governor also recommended cutting more than 300 pre-K classes across the state, forcing some teachers out of jobs and requiring those that remained to take on extra students. Lawmakers agreed.\n\nDeal subsequently recommended --- and lawmakers approved --- restoring 10 days to the 2012-2013 pre-K school year and returning to the traditional 180-day school year for the current school year. The larger class sizes, resulting in an estimated $30 million annual savings, remain.\n\nThe governor was the driving force behind the push to reinstate the days to Georgia pre-K. But he also initiated the cuts that resulted in the loss of experienced teachers. Those are important details that Deal doesn't mention.\n\nWe rated Deal's statement as Half True.\n\nSTATE MISSING OUT ON MEDICAID MONEY?\n\nBudgetary issues are central to Deal\u2019s refusal to expand the Medicaid health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDeal has argued the move would cost the state $2.5 billion over the next decade. Carter has claimed that figure doesn\u2019t include money the state would get back from the federal government by extending coverage to about 650,000 low-income Georgians now without health insurance.\n\n\"There's $30 billion in expansion funds that we've paid --- it's our money and Nathan Deal wants Washington to keep it,\" Carter in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article.\n\nThe ACA calls for 100 percent reimbursement of costs for expanding Medicaid to newly eligible enrollees in 2015 and 2016 and reimbursement of no less than 90 percent thereafter.\n\nA 2012 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that expansion would bring nearly $34 billion in new federal dollars to Georgia over a decade, according to the study. Georgia's share of the expansion during that time would be $2.5 billion.\n\nBased on that study, Carter would be right to say Georgia is missing out on $34 billion of federal money by not expanding the insurance program, and that's a good overall point. But that is not the same amount of money Georgians are projected to pay in federal taxes for the expansion, or $24 billion.\n\nWe rated Carter's statement Half True.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Georgia holding the dubious distinction of the nation&rsquo;s highest unemployment rate for the second month in a row, it is no surprise that the economy continues to be a top campaign issue in the close governor&rsquo;s race.
