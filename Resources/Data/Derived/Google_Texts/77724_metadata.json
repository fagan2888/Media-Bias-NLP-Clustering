God smiled on his labors, and he hired fellow Amish to work on his farm and in his shop. Naturally he paid them\u2014after all, Scripture tells us that the laborer is worthy of his hire. But beginning in 1970, Lee refused to pay the Social Security payroll tax on his workers' wages the government said he owed. Amish do not believe in social insurance, based on language in Paul\u2019s First Letter to Timothy: \u201cIf any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.\u201d The Internal Revenue Service took a different view, and in 1981 Lee\u2019s case ended up in front of the United States Supreme Court. If the current Court concerns itself with precedent (which I have come to doubt), United States v. Lee should play a large role in the deliberations over Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood v. Sebelius\u2014the cases, to be argued March 25, that will decide whether for-profit corporations can exempt themselves on religious grounds from the contraceptive-coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Related Story The Missing Voices in the Contraception Mandate Cases That\u2019s because the Court decided that the requirement that making Lee pay payroll tax for his workers was a \u201cburden\u201d on his rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment\u2014in fact, that paying the tax was \u201cforbidden by the Amish faith,\u201d and that mandatory payment \u201cinterferes with their free exercise rights.\u201d (Congress had tried to accommodate the Amish by providing in the statute that self-employed Amish did not have to pay Social Security tax, but Lee and other Amish also wanted an exemption from paying taxes on workers they hired.) Having found a burden on Lee\u2019s free exercise, the Court then went on to hold unanimously that \u201cthe broad public interest in maintaining a sound tax system is of such a high order, religious belief in conflict with the payment of taxes affords no basis for resisting the law.\u201d In addition, exempting objectors from paying employees\u2019 payroll tax would \u201cimpose the employer's religious faith on the employees.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Court acknowledged that Lee had a sincere belief and the tax made him violate it. But he still lost because the government had what we\u2019d call today a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in the Social Security system. \u201cWhen followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,\u201d the Court\u2019s unanimous opinion said, \u201cthe limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes that are binding on others in that activity.\u201d For those who sympathize with Lee\u2014and I do\u2014his story has a happy ending. Passed in 1994, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3127 changed the Social Security laws to exempt any employer or partnership consisting of members of any \u201crecognized religious sect\u201d that is \u201cconscientiously opposed to acceptance of the benefits of any private or public insurance\u201d from paying payroll taxes for any employee \u201cwho is also a member of such a sect.\u201d In other words, Congress did what a legislature can do and a court can\u2019t\u2014it rewrote the statute to cover the narrow case where the system could accommodate the beliefs of both employers and employees without threatening the overall program. Hobby Lobby and the other challengers to the employee-insurance mandate do not want to comply with a general regulation of what is unquestionably interstate commerce\u2014employee compensation and health insurance. In their brief filed February 10, they argue that \u201cthe mandate compels Respondents to do precisely what their religion prohibits or face draconian consequences.\u201d This is almost precisely the same claim as the one raised by Edwin Lee. If the Court is faithful to precedent, the government\u2019s interest in uniform enforcement of its health-care plan\u2014and in protecting the consciences of employees\u2014will trump that belief. There is a distinction between the two cases, of course: Lee arose under the Free Exercise Clause. The current cases concern the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was passed in 1993, well after Lee, and was intended to be more protective of free exercise rights than the Constitution. But that is, as lawyers say, a distinction without a difference: RFRA was passed because, in 1990, the Court lowered the standard for Free Exercise Claims. The standard RFRA intended to restore is precisely the standard the Court applied in Lee\u2014that is, a balance of the burden on free exercise v. the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d of the government. As far as Social Security goes, the Burger Court applied what is now the RFRA standard and rejected it unanimously.\n\nSo to uphold the Hobby Lobby claims, the Court\u2019s majority will have to find its way around Lee. There are two ways they could do that, both of them bad. Let\u2019s start, though, with the argument most people have focused on during the run-up to the contraceptive-mandate cases\u2014that being for-profit corporations, the challengers cannot assert a \u201cfree exercise\u201d claim at all. It\u2019s a strong argument, but one that takes more subtlety to assert than most published comments seem to display. It is routine to say that free exercise is an individual right, and that \u201ccorporations are not people.\u201d But in this context, the argument is flawed. That\u2019s because it is routine to say that free exercise is an individual right, and that \u201ccorporations are not people.\u201d But in this context, the argument is flawed at the outset. Free exercise is actually primarily a group right, extended to religious bodies, in corporate form or other wise. The term \u201cfree exercise\u201d in fact originally referred to a right held only by groups. It dates back at least to the 17th Century, and is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \u201cthe right or permission to celebrate the observances (of a religion)\u201d\u2014that is, a privilege granted by monarchs to specific faiths to hold their services in public. Religion, Emile Durkheim wrote, is primarily a set of \u201cbeliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.\u201d Most religious \u201cexercise\u201d can\u2019t be done alone. One of the earliest\u2014and most embarrassing\u2014cases brought under the Free Exercise Clause was entitled Late Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. United States, which upheld an Act of Congress dissolving the Mormon Church and seizing all its property ($3,000,000 in 1887 dollars). The Mormons argued that punishing their church for polygamous beliefs violated the First Amendment, but the Court ridiculed the idea. \u201cNo doubt the Thugs of India imagined that their belief in the right of assassination was a religious belief,\u201d the justices briskly reasoned, \u201cbut their thinking so did not make it so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It doesn&#39;t matter whether an employer is secular or religious, non-profit or for-profit.
