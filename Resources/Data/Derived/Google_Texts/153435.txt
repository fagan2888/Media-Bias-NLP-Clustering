Imagine yourself on the beach with a book, a cocktail and the sound of the waves in the background, and what a better place to do that than on an idyllic island.

Spring break is now in full force and summer vacation planning is fast approaching. To help you pick the best destination, TripAdvisor has released its annual list of 10 best beaches in the world based on reviews from its vast pool of users.

SLIDESHOW: The 10 Best Islands in the World

Providenciales in Turks and Caicos, which has been a trendy destination for jet setters for a while, has come up at the top of the list. For Americans, it has the advantages of being close the U.S. (only about four hours from the East Coast) and of accepting U.S. dollars.

There’s a little bit for everyone on the list, including several European islands, a couple in Asia and a few in South America as well.

The attraction of these islands isn’t just white sandy beaches and turquoise waters. Islands such as Santorini, Bali and Ko Tao in Thailand also offer great food and culture.
