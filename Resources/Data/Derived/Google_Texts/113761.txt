Supreme Court upholds ObamaCare subsidies

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 on Thursday that Americans could receive ObamaCare subsidies all across the nation, including in states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges. Opponents of the law had argued that the Affordable Care Act only allowed for premium tax credits for people purchasing insurance through exchanges set up by states, so those shopping for coverage in the 34 states using the federal marketplace were not eligible. Eight million people could have lost subsidies if the case had gone the other way.
