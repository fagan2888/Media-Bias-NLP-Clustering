In short, the Obama DOJ continues its ultra-liberal bias disregarding national security and border security.\n\nAny prosecutor or criminal investigator will tell you in terrorist attack cases a suspect\u2019s religion, ethnicity, and country of origin are factors to be considered. The recent Boston Marathon bombing is an example. Ask any Border Patrol agent what factors he or she considers when making the decision for an apprehension. Will the Obama DOJ enforce any immigration bill\u2019s alleged strict national and border security requirements? No!\n\nPresident Obama raises class warfare to new heights in an effort to deflect public concern about his flawed Affordable Care Act, about the Benghazi killings cover-up, and about former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates\u2019 book, \"Duty.\"\n\nObama has promised continued use of executive orders and bureaucratic fiat to promulgate dictatorial decrees as part of his ideological change of America, notwithstanding the Constitution. He has demonstrated this with immigration bureaucratic changes in 2011 and 2012. A recent Gallup poll shows immigration is a priority with only 3 percent of Americans.\n\nHis political ploy of concern for the Americans suffering from income inequality rings hollow for \u2014 he omits the middle class\u2019s wage stagnation, he omits the chronic and ever rising unemployment of black and brown youths (18-25 year olds), he omits the downgrading educational rankings worldwide, and he omits the muddled immigration law policies.\n\n\n\nThe president has shown himself to be a master manipulator as he halfheartedly pushes for the Democratic-controlled Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration reform legislation. As the Obama immigration policy has been on 5-year psychedelic trip \u2014 careening from zealous deportations to \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d to backdoor amnesty for illegal alien \u201cyouths\u201d to faux border security.\n\nSince 2007, Obama has promised immigration reform, with a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens as well as entitlements for them and their families. In his second term, the president is flexing his social justice muscle by adopting as his what is the Senate\u2019s immigration bill \u2014 actually it is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s immigration bill, flaws and all.\n\nThe Senate bill gives national security a wink and a nod, while the Democrats\u2019 and DOJ\u2019s attitude is, \u201cWhat difference does it make!\u201d\n\nAmericans will learn what difference an open-borders immigration bill makes, as school districts\u2019 costs rise, as taxpayers learn the costs for subsidizing healthcare for millions of legal and illegal immigrants, as the environmentalists see ecological damages increase, and as the nation\u2019s security is in greater jeopardy. The impact of at least 20 million people receiving the benefits of citizenship with no real background checks will have serious security ramifications. What difference does it make!\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 Senate bill ignores the costs to U.S. taxpayers and the related impact on the middle class and all classes. Short-term financial costs of the bill will be unsustainable with estimates of $366 billion for one year of implementation. The short-term entitlements of the bill will strain the educational, social services, and welfare systems to the point of breaking. The long-term entitlements of the bill will cost an estimated $3-4 trillion for U.S. taxpayers over seven years. What difference does it make?\n\nThe Kaiser Health News reported on Feb. 12, 2013, the Medicaid pays out $2 billion in free \u201cemergency\u201d medical coverage for illegal aliens even tough illegal aliens are not supposed to receive Medicaid benefits. A major portion of the money is for child-birth costs for illegal alien women. These births which now are 50 percent on the total yearly births give automatic citizenship to the newborns which in turn helps the undocumented parents to rise in eligibility status for legal U.S residency. What difference does it make?\n\nObama, the Democrats, social justice and immigrant advocates refuse to publicly acknowledge that a high number of illegal aliens are undereducated and have few work skills. Immigration history shows, that while this demographic benefits certain employers, it means more persons receiving entitlements. The bill includes \u201cfamily unity\u201d provisions that for each alien given residency, permits 4-6 others would secure entry with health and social welfare entitlements. What difference does it make?\n\nCombine the nation\u2019s unemployment and underemployment figures \u2014 present and future \u2014 and the failure to educate children with the necessary skills for the jobs \u2014 present and future \u2014 then one understands the impact the Senate\u2019s open-borders immigration legislation will have on America. Today, 3.9 million jobs go unfilled due an unskilled workforce.\n\nWhat difference does it make?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obama,Racial,Profiling,immigration", "pubdate": "2014-01-17T12:00:14", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "On Jan. 15 The New York Times published an article asserting that the Obama Department of Justice would be significantly expanding its definition of racial profiling to prohibit federal agents from considering religion, national origin, and gender and sexual orientation in their investigations.", "title": "Obama to Expand Racial Profiling Restrictions", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/JamesWalsh/Obama-Racial-Profiling-immigration/2014/01/17/id/547700/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/JamesWalsh/Obama-Racial-Profiling-immigration/2014/01/17/id/547700/", "title": "Obama to Expand Racial Profiling Restrictions", "description": "On Jan. 15 The New York Times published an article asserting that the Obama Department of Justice would be significantly expanding its definition of racial profiling to prohibit federal agents from considering religion, national origin, and gender and sexual orientation in their investigations.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1389960014, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Obama,Racial,Profiling,immigration", "article": {"section": "JamesWalsh", "published_time": "2014-01-17T12:00:14"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/JamesWalsh/Obama-Racial-Profiling-immigration/2014/01/17/id/547700/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Obama will Expand Racial Profiling Restrictions."}, "article_summary": "What difference does it make?\nWhat difference does it make!\nIn short, the Obama DOJ continues its ultra-liberal bias disregarding national security and border security.\nWill the Obama DOJ enforce any immigration bill\u2019s alleged strict national and border security requirements?\nIn his second term, the president is flexing his social justice muscle by adopting as his what is the Senate\u2019s immigration bill \u2014 actually it is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s immigration bill, flaws and all."}
