European Pressphoto Agency\n\nThe South Korean military\u2019s struggle to rein in hazing has resurfaced with details of the death of a soldier in April.\n\nAn army investigation found that the private, stationed in Yeoncheon near the North Korean border, died on April 6 after a solider punched him on the chest, an army spokesman said Friday. He said the cause of death was asphyxiation, as food became stuck in soldier\u2019s airway after he was hit.\n\nThe soldier, surnamed Yoon, was subjected to chronic bullying since joining the unit in December that included force-feeding him a tube of toothpaste and depriving him of sleep, the army spokesman said. The army has charged four soldiers with manslaughter and a fifth with criminal assault.\n\nThe army has fired 16 officers in the chain of command above the dead soldier, the spokesman said. The details of the case were released earlier this week by the Center for Military Human Rights in Korea, an activist group.\n\nThe army spokesman said the final hearing for the five soldiers will take place on Tuesday, when the army will also launch a committee to study recent events involving the deaths of South Korean soldiers.\n\nLast weekend, two committed suicide. In June, a soldier who had been subjected to bullying killed five of his comrades in a shooting rampage.\n\nSouth Korean men must serve in the military for about two years unless they are ruled medically unfit for service or given special dispensation. Most enter in their early 20\u2032s. Those drafted as enlisted soldiers can\u2019t leave their unit without permission, leaving them confined in the military world often months at a time.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAlso popular on Korea Real Time now:\n\nKey Takeaways From Samsung Earnings Call\n\nIs Seoul Unfairly Blocking Organic Food Imports?", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The South Korean military's struggle to rein in hazing has resurfaced with details of the death of a soldier in April.", "title": "South Korean Army Under New Hazing Cloud", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/08/01/south-korean-army-under-new-hazing-cloud/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DX897_skmili_G_20140801040308.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "South Korean Army Under New Hazing Cloud", "description": "The South Korean military's struggle to rein in hazing has resurfaced with details of the death of a soldier in April.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Jeyup S.
