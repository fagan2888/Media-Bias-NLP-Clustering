Spotlight on… John Tavares, center, Islanders

When: The Avalanche makes its only stop this season at the Nassau Coliseum on Tuesday night to play the Islanders. Colorado recently beat them 5-0 at the Pepsi Center.

What’s up: John Tavares, who suffered a serious knee injury at the Olympics in Sochi this year, is off to a good start. He had 15 points in his first 13 games, including an overtime winner last Tuesday at Anaheim.

Background: In the last 20 years, only Sidney Crosby had a bigger buildup coming out of junior than Tavares. He went first overall in 2009, two spots ahead of Matt Duchene. While Tavares scored 24 goals his rookie season, he was seen as something of a disappointment, with his speed and defensive play questioned. But he has gradually shown to be worth the hype and is now the unquestioned leader of the Islanders. He really worked on his skating before last season and is a step quicker than he was his first couple of years.



Dater’s take: Watching Tavares play his first two seasons, I thought he might become something of a bust. Nobody questioned his talent, but his hockey sense and overall commitment seemed to be lacking for such a heralded draft pick. Nobody thinks that anymore, as Tavares rededicated himself to the game and is one of the top forwards in the NHL.
