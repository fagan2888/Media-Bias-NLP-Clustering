Democratic Presidential Candidate, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders makes an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show" as the Senator dances his way on stage for his first talk show appearance since the Democratic Presidential Debate.

The Senator explains why he defended Hillary Clinton on the topic of her emails during the debate. And answers Ellen’s questions about the disappearing middle class and what can be done to solve the problem. Also, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month Ellen put the notoriously private Senator in the Hot Seat to answer some personal questions. With every question, $1000 was donated to Breast Cancer Research. In total the Senator raised $10,000, courtesy of Ulta Beauty, by answering questions like, "Which Republican candidate would he want to be stuck on a deserted island with?” and "Has he ever been in handcuffs?”

On taking the politics out of politics

Ellen: A lot of people like you. A lot. A lot of people are talking about you and like you a whole lot. I’ll tell you. I think what you said, about Hillary and the emails, you said “This may not be political.” And I think that’s the exact thing that people are sick of is people being political. I think people just need to hear you say what you feel. The Senator: I think that’s absolutely right. I think, Ellen, you hit the nail on the head and I will tell you I have been in many, many campaigns in my political life and I am very proud to say I have never run a negative political ad in my entire life and I’ve been attacked a whole lot.
