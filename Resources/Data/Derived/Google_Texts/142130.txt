Smoke from wildfires burning in the Pacific Northwest and western Canada is expected to bring haze to Colorado skies over the next few days, specifically to the Western Slope.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said Wednesday that there are no wildfire smoke health advisories in effect for the Centennial state as of yet.

The department encourages people to stay inside if smoke becomes thick in their neighborhood.
