It says \u201chealthcare surcharge.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what a KHON2 viewer saw when she recently dined out at a Hawaii restaurant.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of this type of fee before being charged to consumers in Hawaii,\u201d said Stephen Levins, executive director of the state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs\u2019 Office of Consumer Protection.\n\nIn this situation, the local restaurant had placed a three-percent surcharge on customer bills.\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s owner says that surcharge was to help pay for his workers\u2019 healthcare plans. He says the fee was displayed on the menu and on the receipt.\n\nSo can all businesses just add on this type of fee?\n\n\u201cIt really depends on the circumstances and we just have to take a look,\u201d said Levins. \u201cFor instance, if they are advertising a fee that doesn\u2019t exist, a phantom fee, it may not be allowable. If it\u2019s a legitimate fee, it may be.\u201d\n\nThe DCCA says if the consumer knows what he\u2019s paying for and the fee is going to exactly what is stated, then it could be fine. But if any of that fee is going elsewhere or consumers are misled, there can be penalties.\n\n\u201cIf we see something that appears to be unfair or deceptive trade practice, we\u2019re going to take a careful look at it,\u201d said Levins.\n\nBusinesses that violate consumer rights can face penalties ranging from $500 to $10,000 per violation.\n\n\u201cThe preferred practice for most merchants in the state of Hawaii is to just have the entire cost stated up front,\u201d said Levins.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You go to a restaurant, order your food, then pay your bill, but then you see a new fee tacked on your receipt.
