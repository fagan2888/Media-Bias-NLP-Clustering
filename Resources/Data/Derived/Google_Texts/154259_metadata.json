It\u2019s shaping up as a particularly ugly fight in an era that\u2019s come to be defined by \u201ccrisis governance.\u201d\n\nWhat does no-hold-barred warfare against a law that\u2019s been settled for three years look like? Some tea party activists are urging Republican lawmakers to shut down the government \u2014 or even default on the debt Congress itself ran up \u2014 in a quixotic effort to \u201cdefund\u201d Obamacare. In refusing to expand Medicaid, legislators in 21 states, most of them \u201cred,\u201d are not only denying their poorest citizens coverage, but also turning away billions of dollars from the federal government. Some members of Congress are refusing to help their own constituents navigate the new exchanges to get the benefits available to them. According to the Washington Post, some state legislators are getting quite creative, \u201crefusing to enforce consumer protections, for example, and restricting federally funded workers hired to help people enroll in coverage.\u201d In Missouri, \u201cofficials have been barred from doing anything to help put the law into place.\u201d\n\nAnd Republicans are refusing to support any efforts to smooth out the law\u2019s rough edges. Even a minor tweak that would fix a glitch in the law that will prevent many church employees from receiving tax credits to help buy coverage \u2014 and which may ultimately kill some churches\u2019 insurance plans \u2014 is a non-starter. Jim Sargent, the health plan director for the Unitarian Universalist Association, told Religion News Service: \u201cRepublicans are trying to undermine it. While that\u2019s going on, there isn\u2019t much you can do to fix the bill.\u201d\n\nThe latest strategy to undermine the law\u2019s success is especially pernicious \u2014 a major campaign to persuade young people without insurance to pay a penalty, skip the cheap plans they could purchase in heavily subsidized Obamacare exchanges (a young, low-income worker in California will actually be able to get very basic coverage for nothing, according to Sarah Kliff at the Washington Post) and face the risk of a debilitating injury or illness on their own.\n\nThe idea is that if young, healthy people can be convinced to stay away from the exchanges, premiums will skyrocket for everyone else and the whole scheme will come crashing to the ground.\n\nFreedomWorks is urging people to burn fake \u201cObamacare draft cards\u201d and post videos of the stunt to YouTube. Dean Clancy, vice president of the group, told the Washington Post, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it socially acceptable to skip the exchange.\u201d Twila Brase, a conservative health care activist with a group called the Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom, launched a campaign called \u201crefuse to enroll\u201d which likens participating in the exchanges to receiving welfare. The right-wing National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) released a report highlighting how much cash young people might save by paying the penalty instead of buying insurance (and predicting that they\u2019ll stay away in droves).\n\nConservative columnist Ramesh Ponnuru argues that it\u2019s no big deal to go without coverage. Those who are mangled in an accident or come down with some awful ailment \u201cwill be able to buy insurance once they\u2019re sick at the same rate they could have gotten it for when they were well,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat\u2019s the part of the Obamacare law that its defenders are usually most keen to emphasize.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a common but inaccurate belief about the law\u2019s requirement that insurers cover pre-existing conditions: you can just wait until you need insurance to purchase it. FreedomWorks said as much to an inquiring reporter from Bloomberg News. But the reality is that, after this year, you\u2019ll only be able to enroll in the exchanges for a brief period in October and December. There are a few exceptions, like if you lose a job in the middle of the year, but as Adrianna McIntyre remarked, \u201cI accidentally burned my Obamacare card\u201d isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nDavid Hogberg, author of the NCPPR study says that\u2019s not a problem. \u201cA young person who gets a serious illness in June only has to wait until October to sign up for insurance and then wait until January 1 of the next year to receive coverage,\u201d he writes. But you can\u2019t exactly let a cancer metastasize for a few months or leave a bad injury untreated. And what about someone who gets that serious illness the day after the open enrollment period ends?\n\nThis is a strategy that comes with some risk, and not just for young people who might buy the spin. As any pollster can tell you, Americans tend to distrust of the idea of government in the abstract, but are quite fond of most of what it does in the real world. They like public education policemen and environmental protection and Social Security and just about everything else the government provides that makes their lives easier and safer.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Republican establishment is so nervous about the prospect of another government shutdown. It\u2019s not only because the effort wouldn\u2019t halt Obamacare, or because polls show that even a majority of Republican voters think it\u2019s an awful idea. It\u2019s because a shutdown would be a vivid reminder that the government provides goods and services that most Americans value and like.\n\nAnd the reason the right\u2019s war on Obamacare is reaching such a fevered pitch today is that what has long been an abstraction is about to become concrete. Polls show that four years after its passage, many Americans aren\u2019t really sure what the law will do. More oppose Obamacare than approve of it, but almost all of its individual provisions poll very well. And here\u2019s a key finding: the most popular parts of the law are also the least well-known to the American public.\n\nAfter years of demagoguery and disinformation by opponents, many Americans are fearful of a \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d of the health care system, or death panels, or huge price shocks. But with most of the major benefits of Obamacare set to kick in, the realities of what the law really does are about to become undeniable. Almost 26 million people will be eligible for subsidized coverage, according to a recent analysis by Families USA, but as CNN notes, \u201cmost don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nThat represents an advantage for the law\u2019s proponents. If they can manage to get the bulk of it implemented, even with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s warts, it will provide solid evidence that the government can improve people\u2019s lives. That possibility represents an existential threat to some on the right\u2019s worldview, and it\u2019s driving them into feverish levels of opposition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This summer's heated battles over the implementation of \"Obamacare\" are a microcosm of a much larger and longstanding ideological clash over the role of the government in society.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "This summer's heated battles over the implementation of \"Obamacare\" are a microcosm of a much larger and longstanding ideological clash over the role of the government in society.", "title": "Understanding the Right's Obamacare Obsession | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AP120326042385-obamacare-protestors.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-06-18T15:51:43-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2013/09/02/understanding-the-rights-obamacare-obsession/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This summer's heated battles over the implementation of \"Obamacare\" are a microcosm of a much larger and longstanding ideological clash over the role of the government in society.", "creator": "@JoshuaHol", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AP120326042385-obamacare-protestors.jpg", "title": "Understanding the Right's Obamacare Obsession | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2013-09-02T09:58:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-18T15:51:43-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20130902, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, the Obama administration, officials in around half of the states and a network of the program\u2019s supporters are desperate to get the new health insurance scheme up and running.\nIt\u2019s shaping up as a particularly ugly fight in an era that\u2019s come to be defined by \u201ccrisis governance.\u201dWhat does no-hold-barred warfare against a law that\u2019s been settled for three years look like?\nThat possibility represents an existential threat to some on the right\u2019s worldview, and it\u2019s driving them into feverish levels of opposition.\nAnd the reason the right\u2019s war on Obamacare is reaching such a fevered pitch today is that what has long been an abstraction is about to become concrete.\nFreedomWorks is urging people to burn fake \u201cObamacare draft cards\u201d and post videos of the stunt to YouTube."}
