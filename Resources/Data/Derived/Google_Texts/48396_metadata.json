Though it\u2019s not over yet, she is starting to win that battle, and cites Shiffrin\u2019s courage on the slopes as her biggest inspiration.\n\n\u201cI feel that beats anything I can do on the race hill,\u201d an emotional Shiffrin said after the award ceremony Saturday in Are. \u201cSo she deserves to be on the top step of the podium.\u201d\n\nShiffrin clocked the fastest time in both runs to beat second-placed Veronika Velez Zuzulova of Slovakia by 1.41 seconds. Sarka Strachova of the Czech Republic was third, 2.15 back.\n\nThe result means Shiffrin, who turned 20 on Friday, is close to winning her third consecutive crystal globe as the best slalom skier on the World Cup circuit at the season finals in Meribel.\n\nHer closest rival, Sweden\u2019s Frida Hansdotter, finished sixth in Are. To beat Shiffrin in the slalom standings Hansdotter needs to win the final race while Shiffrin fails to make the top 20.\n\n\u201cI will do what I can,\u201d Hansdotter said. \u201cBut she is fantastic and in a class of her own right now.\u201d\n\nDespite her youth, Shiffrin already is Olympic and double world champion in slalom. She has 13 World Cup wins in slalom and one in giant slalom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shiffrin wins World Cup slalom, reunites with teen fan", "title": "Shiffrin wins World Cup slalom, reunites with teen fan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Shiffrin wins World Cup slalom, reunites with teen fan", "title": "Shiffrin wins World Cup slalom, reunites with teen fan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/14/shiffrin_wins_world_cup_slalom_reunites_with_teen_fan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/sweden-wcup-women\u2019s-slalom.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shiffrin wins World Cup slalom, reunites with teen fan", "title": "Shiffrin wins World Cup slalom, reunites with teen fan", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/sweden-wcup-women\u2019s-slalom.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karl Ritter", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "She has 13 World Cup wins in slalom and one in giant slalom.\nTo beat Shiffrin in the slalom standings Hansdotter needs to win the final race while Shiffrin fails to make the top 20.\n\u201cBut she is fantastic and in a class of her own right now.\u201dDespite her youth, Shiffrin already is Olympic and double world champion in slalom.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsARE, Sweden (AP) \u2014 After outclassing her opponents to win her fourth World Cup slalom race of the season, Mikaela Shiffrin invited a young girl with a bashful smile to join her on the podium.\nThe result means Shiffrin, who turned 20 on Friday, is close to winning her third consecutive crystal globe as the best slalom skier on the World Cup circuit at the season finals in Meribel."}
