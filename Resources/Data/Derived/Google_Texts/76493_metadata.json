What a switch, everyone marveled.\n\nPreviously, Trump\u2019s victory speeches seemed sprung from the WWE writers\u2019 room, all graceless boast and bombast. If he wasn\u2019t Muhammad Ali roaring over a crumpled Sonny Liston, he was the taunting chump on the sidelines of the Divison I national championship game.\n\nTuesday night, he was brief, subdued and, toward his chief GOP rival, borderline respectful. Ted Cruz was \u201cSenator Cruz,\u201d not \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted.\u201d\n\nHe even ticked the boxes of several topics that qualify as legitimate issues: trade, exporting jobs, Obamacare, military strength, illegal immigration. Why, it\u2019s almost like he really does have a presidential on-off switch, marveled the pundit class.\n\nSubsequently, Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s de facto campaign manager via K Street \u2014 home to the very lobbyists Trump rails against \u2014 told Republican National Committee hotshots gathered in Florida last week his guy\u2019s outrageousness has all been performance art, that he\u2019s all depth and substance behind closed doors, and \u2014 wait for it \u2014 he\u2019ll be rolling out his amazing indoor self as he rumbles closer to the nomination.\n\nAt Hotair, Allapundit posits a disquieting theory:\n\n\u201cThis has always been the great mystery of a Trump presidency: Will he be some sort of loose cannon, issuing illegal orders to the military and using Obama\u2019s precedents for a major executive power grab, or would he actually be too docile in being led around by Washington Republicans eager to fill the gaps in Trump\u2019s policy and institutional knowledge with their own preferences? Manafort\u2019s presentation is a small data point for the latter theory. But what a treat to be on the cusp of nominating a guy who could go in either of those two terrible directions \u2014 without having any firm sense of which it\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going with the-whole-thing\u2019s-a-con theory, and we\u2019re all marks.\n\nAfter all, come Wednesday\u2019s daylight, Trump was back to his oldies playlist during a rally in Indianapolis, conjuring up \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d and ordering the ejection of a demonstrator with a familiar, \u201cGet \u2019im outta here.\u201d Hey, you gotta give the crowd what it wants.\n\nLuckily, we have Rick Wilson, the Tallahassee-based GOP consultant, to help pierce the veneer.\n\n\u201cPolitics has surprised this man-baby in a lot of ways, but most fundamentally in that people not only take shots, but land them. ... He expresses endless outrage that the RNC hasn\u2019t cut to the chase and named him the nominee \u2014 even saying darkly about the party\u2019s convention, \u2018I hope it doesn\u2019t involve violence\u2019 \u2014 and it\u2019s pretty clear that the 67 percent of Republicans who have cast a vote against him are on his enemies list.\n\n\u201cActual pressure has made Trump brittle, bitter, and reflexively nasty. ... Trump expected he would be treated as the entitled, rules-are-for-the-little-people billionaire brat he plays on television.\u201d\n\nImagine this petulant, self-absorbed, spoiled narcissist who never allows a slight, real or imagined, to pass, entrusted with real weapons of mass destruction, says Wilson.\n\n\u201cAnd that, kids, is how we nuked Pyongyang.\u201d\n\nThe Trump we\u2019ve seen for all those years on the small screen is the same guy we\u2019ve seen in the campaign these eight months. I mean, they don\u2019t call it reality TV for nothing. Trump is who he is: a whining, thin-skinned, petty, grudge-working bully, a walking outrage whose massive negatives are well-earned, and whose opinions have worked violent vandalism on Republican principles that have formed the party\u2019s core since William F. Buckley was at Yale.\n\nFor the next two weeks, as the presidential primary wends through the Northeast and upper mid-Atlantic states \u2014 bizarrely, Trump territory \u2014 we\u2019re bound to hear more about his inevitability even as we seek precious signs that he\u2019s begun to assume the majestic airs of Lincoln, Ike and Reagan. All those who believe that didn\u2019t just drink the snake oil; they\u2019re marinating in it.\n\nThe rest know a hustler when they see one. The only remaining question is which cohort comprises a majority.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 24 Apr 2016 13:02:59 -0400", "Description": "Follow Tom Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d blog at TBO.com.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Follow Tom Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d blog at TBO.com.", "title": "A new, improved Trump?
