The sample size of the poll was 600 respondents and the margin for error is 4.1 percent.\n\nAnd the chief takeaway in the Senate race coming out of this poll is that the race is there for the taking for Bill Cassidy \u2013 but he has to do more to take it.\n\nFirst of all, Mary Landrieu\u2019s favorable number is 41 percent, against 52.2 percent unfavorable. Within that it gets worse; her strong favorables are 23.3 percent and strong unfavorables are 36 percent. Just 4.8 percent have no opinion or never heard of her.\n\nAnd Landrieu\u2019s re-elect number? It\u2019s a lousy 34.1 percent, against a 56.2 percent number for \u201celect someone new.\u201d\n\nSo she\u2019s practically a dead duck when it comes to whether the voters in Louisiana actually want to send her back to Washington for another six years.\n\nWhat\u2019s Mary\u2019s big issue right now? Beating up Gov. Jindal over his refusal to expand Medicaid. So how does the Medicaid expansion poll? From the survey\u2026\n\nWhen all you have is 42 percent on your side on your best issue, you\u2019ve got a traction problem.\n\nMeanwhile, on Obamacare \u2013 she has some serious problems that simply cannot be fixed through messaging or advertising. To wit, the survey asked whether folks had been affected by Obamacare\u2026\n\nThe vast majority of that 72.5 percent are people who get their insurance through their employer \u2013 and as we know, the shoe hasn\u2019t dropped on those folks yet, but it\u2019s going to start becoming an issue by this fall just before the election.\n\nBut of the 25.8 percent who say they\u2019ve been affected \u2013 devastation.\n\nSo between people who got booted off their insurance, had to pay more or lost their doctors you\u2019re talking about 60.2 percent of the folks Obamacare has affected who report a negative experience, against just 14.5 percent who report being able to get insurance they couldn\u2019t get before or getting to save money thanks to Obamacare.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to change the opinions of those people. Somebody who has had a negative experience with Obamacare not only won\u2019t change their negative opinion of it, they\u2019re going to scream and yell to all their friends about how horrible it is.\n\nThat\u2019s why Obamacare polls like crap in Louisiana. It isn\u2019t going to change.\n\nSo with those numbers, it\u2019s really not unreasonable to say Landrieu is on life support in her race for re-election.\n\nAnd yet, here\u2019s the key Senate race question\u2026\n\nWait, what? As bad as things are for Landrieu she\u2019s still winning by 13 points? How can that be?\n\nInterestingly, and perhaps inexplicably, the head-to-head race between Landrieu and Cassidy wasn\u2019t polled in this survey. The guess is that 13 point gap probably closes drastically if that question is asked in this survey, but it isn\u2019t.\n\nWe can fairly easily diagnose Cassidy\u2019s problem, though. Here\u2019s his approval number: 25.6 percent.\n\nOMG! What a disaster! What\u2019s his unfavorable number?\n\n11.9 percent.\n\nSome 21.6 percent have no opinion of Cassidy, and 37.7 percent have never heard of him.\n\nWhat that means is that Cassidy is going to need to go up on the air pretty soon with some TV and radio spots that define him and sell a positive image. We\u2019ve taken to disparaging Karl Rove, but his latest Wall Street Journal column does make a very good point about how Republican senate candidates are going to need to start defining themselves, and fast, or else the panicked and out-of-options Democrats out there with numbers that look a lot like Mary\u2019s do are going to paint that picture for them. Cassidy is the poster child for that \u2013 after all, Harry Reid\u2019s Senate Majority PAC has run $1.3 million worth of spots attacking him so far. It\u2019s pretty clear those ads have been ineffective, but at some point the Democrats will come up with an ad campaign that will work.\n\nBetter to start closing the sale with some voters now, so that the negative ads don\u2019t limit him before he gets going.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting analytical info to be found on the race in this poll even without the head-to-head result. To wit\u2026\n\nSo \u2013 a seven-point preference for a Republican senator in the race.\n\nAnd here are the sample\u2019s registration, party ID and ideological numbers\u2026\n\nThose numbers, as best as we can recall, track very closely with the vast majority of other recent surveys of the Louisiana electorate we\u2019ve seen. And the party registration tracks almost exactly with the numbers from the Secretary of State\u2019s office; as of Tuesday the state\u2019s voter registration numbers said 47.3 percent of the voters here are Democrats, 27.8 percent are Republicans and 24.9 percent are independents or belong to other parties. There has always been a 8-12 percent lag between people who say they\u2019re registered Republicans in Louisiana and people who actually are Republicans \u2013 that\u2019s likely due to the presence of the jungle primary election system we have here which makes it meaningless to actually be a member of a party.\n\nThe point being this looks like a relatively accurate sample of the voting population and it\u2019s not skewed.\n\nSo when we draw the conclusion that Cassidy has a ton of work to do and a big upside if he\u2019ll go out and do it, we\u2019re not kidding. This poll shows it.\n\nSomething else interesting comes from the graphical presentation of the Senate race in the second half of the release. A slide\u2026\n\nIn other words, there are lots of receptive folks out there for Cassidy to bring his message to.\n\nAnother interesting slide\u2026\n\nFor the confused\u2026\n\nCD 01 is Steve Scalise\u2019s district in suburban New Orleans and other parts of southeast Louisiana;\n\nCD 02 is Cedric Richmond\u2019s New Orleans/Baton Rouge district;\n\nCD 03 is Charles Boustany\u2019s Lafayette/Lake Charles district;\n\nCD 04 is John Fleming\u2019s Shreveport-based district which tapers down into the western part of the state;\n\nCD 05 is the Alexandria/Monroe district that Vance McAllister just won last year; and\n\nCD 06 is Cassidy\u2019s own district, where that pretty 62-21 number shows that folks who know him generally like him.\n\nBasically, nobody knows squat about Cassidy in Shreveport, and they know very little more about him in Alexandria and Monroe. And he\u2019s going to want to invest heavily in making himself known to people in Lafayette and Lake Charles as well.\n\nAnd one more slide on the Senate race\u2026\n\nYou could take the pie chart on the left as a decent approximation of what a head-to-head race between Cassidy and Landrieu might look like; namely that it\u2019s an even race like most other polls show.\n\nBut the pie chart on the right showing Cassidy with a 14-point edge and getting close to 50 among people who are actually plugged in; well \u2013 what that means is your more engaged voters are breaking heavily for Cassidy.\n\nHe\u2019s got to get more voters engaged on his side. Time to buy some ads with him and a stethoscope, or with a hard hat on, or petting a dog or something.\n\nBut another key finding in the poll \u2013 despite all the horrific numbers you might have heard about Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s approval rating, this survey shows he\u2019s on the comeback trail with Louisiana\u2019s voters (we assume at least partially as a result of the state\u2019s plummeting unemployment rate)\u2026\n\nEssentially, he\u2019s at even money with the voters \u2013 though if you apply Rasmussen\u2019s old Approval Index and compare his strong favorables with his strong unfavorables that minus-18.7 percent number is pretty ugly.\n\nStill, that\u2019s better than the 30-somethings Jindal was mired in most of last year in several surveys, so his stock appears to be rising. The survey even gave Jindal a 45-40 lead over Hillary Clinton in a 2016 presidential matchup.\n\nSpeaking of stock on the rise, get a load of the approval number on Sen. David Vitter!\n\nThat\u2019s a great result for Vitter, who\u2019s had a reputation as a divisive figure in Louisiana politics since the 2007 \u201cserious sin\u201d stuff played out across the state\u2019s media landscape. To have disapprovals below 30, and strong disapprovals below 20, shows eye-popping strength for the Senator. It also shows that if Vitter were to get behind Cassidy and push him, particularly in places like North Louisiana, it could be a big key to victory.\n\nNaturally, the 2015 governor\u2019s race made it into the survey\u2026\n\nThe Vitter-Mitch Landrieu head to head question wasn\u2019t asked, but there is little reason to think Dardenne and Kennedy voters would break against Vitter.\n\nA few other interesting results in the survey\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "This afternoon, Lane Grigsby's semi-annual poll taking the pulse of Louisiana's electorate came out - and the numbers are fascinating.
