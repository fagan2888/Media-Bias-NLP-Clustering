That would necessitate lifting the spending caps for both defense and domestic programs mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act.\n\n\u201cI think they would basically be saying the military is subservient to these other priorities if they try to filibuster the defense appropriations bill,\u201d said Ryan.\n\nRelated: Pentagon\u2019s $90 Billion \u2018Slush Fund\u2019 Comes Under Attack\n\nRyan\u2019s comments are the latest sign that Congress and the White House are headed for another long, hot summer of sorting out their spending differences. Although the former House Budget Committee Chair helped negotiate the last major budget deal following the 2013 government shutdown, he sounded combative in today\u2019s interview.\n\nRyan, the Republicans\u2019 2012 vice presidential nominee who chose to head the House tax writing committee rather than run for president in 2016, signaled that major tax reform would be put off until after the election. He also denounced the Dodd-Frank financial reform law as \u201ca huge wet rag on the economy\u201d that should be repealed and replaced with better policy for regulating Wall Street.\n\nBut Ryan\u2019s sharpest comments were on the looming spending crisis.\n\nObama has threatened to veto spending bills, including the congressional defense appropriations bill, unless GOP leaders agree to lift spending caps on domestic programs as well as defense. The president and the Democrats also are insisting that GOP leaders abandon a budget gimmick designed to funnel $38 billion of additional funds into the Pentagon\u2019s base operating budget through an emergency contingency account meant primarily to fund U.S. war operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe brewing spending crisis goes far beyond differences over spending levels. The White House and congressional Democrats are up in arms over a series of riders that advance a conservative agenda being added to spending bills.\n\nRelated: House and Senate Duke It Out Over Defense Spending\n\nIn the House, one of the appropriations bills would drastically reduce funding for the enforcement of new labor rules, according to The New York Times, while the main federal family planning program, Title X, would be eliminated. Another spending bill provision would halt regulation of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to produce oil and gas.\n\nAt the same time, intraparty feuds among Republicans over a new highway bill, reauthorization of the expired charter for the Export-Import Bank, medical research and other issues are causing fits for House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and other Republican leaders.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) warned on Thursday that the t", "title": "Paul Ryan: Threat of Government Shutdown Is Real Unless Dems Back Down", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/09/Paul-Ryan-Threat-Government-Shutdown-Real-Unless-Dems-Back-Down", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-01-27T185521Z_1_CBRE90Q1GKM00_RTROPTP_2_USA-CAMPAIGN-RYAN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/09/Paul-Ryan-Threat-Government-Shutdown-Real-Unless-Dems-Back-Down", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-01-27T185521Z_1_CBRE90Q1GKM00_RTROPTP_2_USA-CAMPAIGN-RYAN.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) warned on Thursday that the t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think they would basically be saying the military is subservient to these other priorities if they try to filibuster the defense appropriations bill,\u201d said Ryan.\nAlthough the former House Budget Committee Chair helped negotiate the last major budget deal following the 2013 government shutdown, he sounded combative in today\u2019s interview.\nAnother spending bill provision would halt regulation of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to produce oil and gas.\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) warned on Thursday that the threat of another government shutdown is real unless President Obama and the Democrats end their opposition to a GOP budget plan that boosts defense spending while capping domestic programs.\nObama has threatened to veto spending bills, including the congressional defense appropriations bill, unless GOP leaders agree to lift spending caps on domestic programs as well as defense."}
