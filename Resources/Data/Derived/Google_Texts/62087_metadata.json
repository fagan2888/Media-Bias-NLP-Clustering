Her family participated in recent demonstrations, and now she intensely waits to see if more blood will be shed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d the 65-year-old said. \u201cPutin is taunting the world.\u201d\n\nThere have been problems with phone connections since the crisis started last month, but Gajecky said she spoke to her family in Ukraine at the end of February.\n\n\u201cThey say they are upset, but also hopeful,\u201d she said.\n\nSome family and friends living in Lviv traveled more than 300 miles to the capital of Kiev to join in the protests.\n\n\u201cThey feel very strongly about what they are doing,\u201d she said.\n\nGajecky, who received her masters from Harvard University in Slavic languages and literatures, was born in a refugee camp in Austria after her parents fled Ukraine to avoid Joseph Stalin\u2019s Red Army during World War II, she said. Now, history seems to be repeating itself.\n\nShortly after the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russian forces moved into Crimea, a peninsula that juts from southern Ukraine into the Black Sea, Their arrival was sparked by the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, accused by protesters of corruption.\n\nYanukovych fled to Russia after deadly clashes between the government and the growing opposition, especially in Kiev. Yanukovych claims he is still the leader of Ukraine. Putin agrees.\n\nOlena Ruth, 34, a native Ukrainian who has lived in America since 2003, said most of her family lives in Kiev, and she has been calling them twice a day since the crisis began.\n\n\u201cThey are really happy about what happened with Yanukovych being gone, but fear that the corruption will return as former members of parliament try to reclaim their seats,\u201d Ruth said.\n\nFor the moment, most of the tension is in Crimea, but should the peninsula be annexed by the Russians, her family dreads the worst, she said.\n\n\u201cMy mother fears that with time, (Putin) will get Kiev,\u201d she said.\n\nShe estimated that about 30 percent of the 70,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union that live in the Denver metro area are from the Ukraine.\n\nIrina Serenchenko, a 22-year-old University of Colorado-Denver student, and native Russian, said the conflict is devastating to watch unfold on the news.\n\n\u201cI have visited Ukraine many times, and I love my homeland, so I want this to just end peacefully,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what these people look like, who they are.\u201d\n\nSerenchenko\u2019s family came to America in 2001 on a refugee visa, she said.\n\nThe conflict has divided her Russian and Ukrainian friends, leaving her in the middle, Serenchenko said. But, she still has an opinion.\n\n\u201cPersonally, what Putin is doing is concerning,\u201d she said. \u201cI am worried that if he gets Ukraine, he won\u2019t stop there.\u201d\n\nGajecky said that if Russia continues to \u201cforce its will\u201d on the people, a majority of Ukrainians hope, possibly even expect, countries such as the United States to intervene.\n\nMatjaz Bren, a professor of international business at Regis University, said Americans should be paying attention to what is occurring, but he said most are not \u2014 at least, not yet.\n\n\u201cAmericans, for the most part, are not interested in what is happening in other parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, a conflict like this doesn\u2019t punch you in the face, it punches you in the kidneys, and you will go down from that, too.\u201d\n\nThe larger picture Americans should be aware of is the growing friction between two nuclear powers.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a personal cost for Americans to care,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, yes, they should start paying attention now.\u201d\n\nGajecky said U.S. imposed sanctions may work, but many Ukrainians believe this was a calculated move by Putin in an attempt to reclaim Russia\u2019s place as a premier world power.\n\nPolitical Science professor and Post-Soviet Studies expert Christoph Stefes of the University of Colorado-Denver said he believes that is exactly what is occurring.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt about this,\u201d Stefes said. \u201cPutin has clearly put his foot down in an attempt to build his spheres of influence.\u201d\n\nFor protestors, including family and friends of Gajecky, the bottom line is they will not be intimidated or submit to Russia, she said. The people will stand up and fight for their new way of life, which is only 23 years old, Gajecky said.\n\n\u201cIt is in the anthem they sing: \u2018We will lay down our soul, our body, for our liberty\u2019,\u201d Gajecky said.\n\nRyan Parker: 303-954-2409, rparker@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ryanparkerdp\n\nSunday rally\n\nEvent: Denver for Peace in Ukraine rally\n\nSite: Colorado State Capitol\n\nTime: 11 a.m. Sunday, with a 1 p.m. march to the Honorary Consulate General of Russia, 1560 Pennsylvania St.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Ukrainians, experts share insight on crisis", "title": "Colorado Ukrainians, experts share insight on crisis", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/08/colorado-ukrainians-experts-share-insight-on-crisis/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140308__BN20140306_Z00_BNCD09UKRAINEp1.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140308__BN20140306_Z00_BNCD09UKRAINEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-08T15:12:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:17:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce732\"", "article_summary": "Tatianna \u201cTania\u201d Gajecky of Lakewood has more than 100 family members in Ukraine, mostly in the western city of Lviv.\nEver since their nation became independent in 1991, many Ukrainians expected the Russians would return \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make the crisis in their homeland any less terrifying.\nSome family and friends living in Lviv traveled more than 300 miles to the capital of Kiev to join in the protests.\n\u201cIt is in the anthem they sing: \u2018We will lay down our soul, our body, for our liberty\u2019,\u201d Gajecky said.\nHer family participated in recent demonstrations, and now she intensely waits to see if more blood will be shed."}
