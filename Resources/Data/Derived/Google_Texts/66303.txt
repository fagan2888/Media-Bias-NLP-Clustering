A trip to the doctor or emergency room is costing more and a national study shows a major spike specifically in the Charlottesville area.

BetterDoctor, an online healthcare resource, released a study that shows medical costs in Charlottesville have increased by almost nine percent since 2011. More specifically, it found that medical costs in Charlottesville have increased by 8.64 percent in the last four years.

Chief financial officers for both the University of Virginia Health System and Martha Jefferson Hospital say increases in medical supply costs, new technologies and upgrades to infrastructure make care more and more costly each year.

Hospital administrators say it's unfortunate that the price tag for procedures is constantly rising, but it means better care for patients in the end.

"We're able to invest in that technology and able to contribute to the community in a different way by caring for a more complex scope of patients so we're able to add to the continuum of care where patients can receive very complex care in an community hospital environment,‚Äù says Ron Cottrell of Martha Jefferson Hospital.

Both UVA and Martha Jefferson say one of the best ways to keep healthcare cost low is to make sure you have health insurance and visit the appropriate physicians or hospitals in your plan.

That being said though, they emphasize that no one should ever go without care.

Both hospitals try to work financially with patients who cannot afford procedures or who do not have insurance.
