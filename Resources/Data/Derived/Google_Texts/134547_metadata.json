David Vitter (R., La.) announced on Thursday that he is blocking a vote on the nomination of the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) until the agency responds to inquiries regarding their role in Congress\u2019s Obamacare exemption.\n\nThe Republican senator has been investigating a special exemption that Members of Congress and their staff received from an amendment to the Affordable Care Act requiring them to enter into a health care market that did not offer any provisions.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management issued a final rule in October 2013 declaring Congress a \u201csmall business,\u201d despite its having more than 12,000 employees, allowing them to collect taxpayer-funded subsidies that are not available to large employers.\n\nVitter\u2019s letter to the Acting Director of OPM, Beth Cobert, warns that due to the agency\u2019s failure to respond to previous inquiries on the matter he will block a vote on her nomination until the information is turned over to his Senate office.\n\nVitter also requested all correspondence between OPM officials and members of Congress and their staff leading up the issuance of the final rule by close of business on March 11.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy for Americans to trust their leadership in Washington when Congress cannot seem to figure out if they are a large employer or a small business,\u201d the letter states. \u201cFurthermore, congressional employees could be submitting fraudulent documents to the IRS, potentially committing a crime, if you still insist Congress is a small business.\u201d\n\nVitter is referring to tax forms that were recently distributed to Senate offices for an \u201cApplicable large business subject to the employer shared responsibly provision contained within the Affordable Care Act\u201d despite entering into the small business market.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon contacted the IRS on Feb. 18 seeking comment on the forms and letter Vitter sent to Commissioner John Koskinen at the time. In a returned statement, the IRS said that \u201chave received the congressional letter\u201d and are \u201creviewing it and will respond.\u201d\n\nNo response came. The Free Beacon contacted the same spokesperson early Thursday morning but has yet to receive a reply.\n\nThe actions of OPM and Congress led a coalition of 10 watchdog groups to file a complaint last year seeking an investigation into whether members of Congress and their staff committed fraud when applying to the health insurance market.\n\n\u201cAs open enrollment approached in 2014, members and staff realized that by enrolling as individuals, they would no longer receive generous taxpayer-funded contributions to help pay their insurance premiums as they had for decades under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program,\u201d Citizens Against Government Waste, which is leading the coalition, said in a press release at the time. \u201cThey would instead only qualify for subsidies if their household income was less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level, just like millions of other Americans that had to purchase insurance in the individual market.\u201d\n\nSen. Vitter said that Cobert\u2019s nomination will not move forward until answers are given on Congress\u2019 Obamacare exemption.\n\n\u201cAs much as federal bureaucrats enjoy hiding behind layers of red tape, we have now reached the point where OPM can no longer avoid explaining how Congress was allowed to purchase health insurance as a small business\u2014when it clearly is not,\u201d Vitter said in a statement. \u201cMs. Cobert\u2019s nomination will not move forward in any capacity until the American people have received answers as to why Washington\u2019s Obamacare Exemption exists.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for OPM said that the agency is in the process of reviewing Sen. Vitter\u2019s request and referred the Free Beacon to remarks made earlier today by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), who defended Cobert and called for the Senate to confirm President Obama\u2019s nominee as soon as possible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
