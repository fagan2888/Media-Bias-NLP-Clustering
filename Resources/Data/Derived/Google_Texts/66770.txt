Cruz better choice than Kasich for president

As Ohio's governor, John Kasich expanded Medicaid. Ohio will be punished for that in 2020 when the state assumes 10 percent of this Obamacare expansion.

Kasich is trying to grab votes and delegates from U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Cruz is a leader in advocating for smaller government. He has upheld the rights of pastors, soldiers and individuals denied their religious freedom.

Cruz has fought to reverse the escalating tax burden on us. He's committed to unleashing us from the tyrannical Obamacare law, which has resulted in unaffordable taxes on individuals and companies. In Kasich's Ohio in 2010, AK Steel Co. recorded an additional cost of $31 million from the health care overhaul. Kasich ignored the company's plight when he increased Ohio's tax obligations.

Requiring everyone to buy health insurance does not remove the burden of the overtaxed â€” it just locks up their money, which could be used for preferred health care choices.

Our government should stop rewarding illegal immigrants and others who aren't obligated to pay for hospital care. We must end their ability to walk away from paying for services received. Many hospitals face financial emergencies because of illegals' uncompensated care.

We struggle to keep up with our medical needs and shouldn't be forced to subsidize free-care patients via Obamacare's health insurance purchase requirement.

For taxpayer relief, vote Ted Cruz for president and Daryl Metcalfe for District 3 delegate in the April 26 primary.
