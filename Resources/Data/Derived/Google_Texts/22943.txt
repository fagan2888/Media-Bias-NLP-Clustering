Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne no doubt has some interesting stories to tell about hanging out with his new buddy Miley Cyrus, but “the craziest ones I’m not allowed to really speak about,” he tells Billboard at this year’s Bonnaroo.

Coyne and Cyrus recently came together to perform a cover of the Beatles' "Lucy In The Sky of Diamonds" with Miley Cyrus at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards. The pair has also covered the Beatles' "A Day in the Life,” as well as the Flaming Lips’ "Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.”

“Whenever we’ve been around her and we’ve done drugs together, it’s all just been about having fun and celebrating after absolutely working her ass off,” Coyne says.



But Coyne says his relationship with Kesha is “a little more complicated.” Coyne and Kesha had been working on a full-length album together following the pop star’s contribution to the veteran psych-rock band's "The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends" collection. But last November, Coyne tweeted that the project would never see the light of day.



“I think she’s in like a production deal, I guess, with Dr. Luke. I don’t really know, because when I do music with Kesha, we’re just doing music and I don’t really know all the levels of what’s allowable and what isn’t,” Coyne said at Bonnaroo. “And I think sometimes when we’ve done some music together, I think she forgets that she’s limited to what she’s allowed to do and what she’s not allowed to do. I think she finds that a little bit too constricting for her.”



Coyne adds that he’s still open to working with Kesha. “I think my relationship with Kesha is the same as it’s always been — when you wanna do something, let’s fucking get together and we’ll do it and we’ll figure something out,” he says.
