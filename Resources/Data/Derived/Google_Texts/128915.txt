Obamacare: 7 Things We Know Now

March 19, 2014 -- The big deadline -- the final, no-more-extensions, we-mean-business-this-time deadline -- is almost here. After March 31, Americans -- with a few exceptions -- won't be able to buy health insurance for 2014. And unlike the previous deadlines, there seems to be no chance of a last-minute reprieve. It's a good time to take a look at the state of health care reform. Here are seven things we know now about it.

1. The March 31 Deadline Is Firm Don't expect this enrollment deadline to get extended. Most uninsured people will need to buy insurance by then to avoid facing a penalty. How come they mean it this time? There have been lots of extensions and delays to the law, partly because of the botched launch of Healthcare.gov. "But if you continuously push [the deadline] back, it will look like the policy is a failure, and you're not doing what the law intended, which is to force people to buy coverage,” says John Bowblis. He's an assistant professor of economics at Miami University of Ohio who studies health insurance. Could there be one more delay? Possibly. If there are technical glitches in the final days of enrollment, federal officials are working on a plan to approve sign-ups for everyone who tries to enroll before the deadline. People with low income can apply at any time for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, though.
