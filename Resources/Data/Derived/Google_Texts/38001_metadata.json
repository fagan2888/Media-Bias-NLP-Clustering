But now all other teams in the division, including the Lobos, have at least three league losses. If New Mexico had won Saturday, the division\u2019s spot in the title game would have gone to the Lobos-Falcons winner next weekend.\n\nThe Rams, meanwhile, improved to 6-5 overall and 4-3 in the Mountain West, with a game at Fresno State remaining. Nick Stevens was 16-of-23 for 264 yards passing and Dalyn Dawkins rushed for 94 yards on 22 carries for the Rams, who won their third consecutive game.\n\nDid Stevens mind doing a favor for Air Force?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI was happy it was them because we beat them, mainly, but yeah, that\u2019s what I was kind of thinking: \u2018You\u2019re welcome, Air Force.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAsked the same question, CSU coach Mike Bobo responded: \u201cNo, not at all. Coach (Troy) Calhoun\u2019s a great guy. They\u2019ve earned it, they\u2019ve deserved it. It\u2019s not just, \u2018Hey, we beat Air Force.\u2019 You have to play a whole season, you have to play every game and it\u2019s a credit to those guys, coming back and continuing to stick with what they do.\u201d\n\nCSU rushed for 221 yards, with true freshman running back Izzy Matthews (89 yards, 15 carries) supporting Dawkins\u2019 productive might on the ground. Stevens hit clutch passes, including an 8-yard TD throw to Kivon Cartwright.\n\nDown 21-20 entering the fourth quarter, the Rams took the lead with a 12-play, 92-yard drive, with Matthews accounting for 49 of the yards and going over from the 1 with 8:41 left. Stevens hit Joe Hansley for the two-point conversion that made it 28-21, and the Rams \u2014 with a Kevin Pierre-Louis interception at the CSU 29 snuffing out the Lobos\u2019 final threat \u2014 held on.\n\nJunior wideout Rashard Higgins had eight catches for 140 yards. His third catch of the game, a 13-yard out in the second quarter, was his 224th career reception \u2014 breaking the school set by David Anderson, who played for the Rams from 2002-05.\n\n\u201cHow we started the year off, who would have thought we would be bowl eligible right now,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThat just (shows), never quit at whatever you do and always have faith.\u201d\n\nHe said of the career record: \u201cI know coming into this game, I needed a couple more catches, and I told myself \u2026 that was a goal I wanted to accomplish before the year was done. I\u2019m glad it happened the New Mexico game.\u201d\n\nBobo said CSU\u2019s bowl eligibility \u201cmeans a lot. \u2026 From where you were 2-4 and then 3-5 after the loss to San Diego State and you\u2019ve got a lot of people wondering what\u2019s going on. But I wasn\u2019t wondering. I just wanted to reiterate to the guys that we were going to stay true to our standards and our disciplines of how we go about doing things. \u2026 I felt like nobody batted an eye, they answered the challenge and they kept working, and I\u2019ve seen us improve every week.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nGame balls\n\nDeonte Clyburn, LB, CSU:\n\nHad team-leading nine tackles Saturday at New Mexico, including seven solo, as the Rams contained the Lobos\u2019 option attack.\n\nIzzy Matthews, RB, CSU:\n\nTrue freshman rushed for 89 yards, the majority of them coming on the Rams\u2019 game-winning drive.\n\nRashard Higgins, WR, CSU:\n\nHad eight catches for 140 yards and broke David Anderson\u2019s school record for career receptions.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU becomes bowl-eligible with victory at New Mexico", "title": "CSU becomes bowl-eligible with victory at New Mexico", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/21/csu-becomes-bowl-eligible-with-victory-at-new-mexico/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__Colorado-State-vs-New-Mexicop1.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__Colorado-State-vs-New-Mexicop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-21T18:36:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:31:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "ALBUQUERQUE \u2014 In the process of becoming bowl eligible Saturday, Colorado State helped its in-state rivals, the Air Force Falcons.\nIf New Mexico had won Saturday, the division\u2019s spot in the title game would have gone to the Lobos-Falcons winner next weekend.\nDid Stevens mind doing a favor for Air Force?\n\u201cI was happy it was them because we beat them, mainly, but yeah, that\u2019s what I was kind of thinking: \u2018You\u2019re welcome, Air Force.\u2019 \u201cAsked the same question, CSU coach Mike Bobo responded: \u201cNo, not at all.\nThe Rams, meanwhile, improved to 6-5 overall and 4-3 in the Mountain West, with a game at Fresno State remaining."}
