According to the Times, \u201claw enforcement officers are finely attuned to a suspect\u2019s football connections,\u201d and those connections are \u201ccited repeatedly\u201d in police reports. After all, Seminoles football means big money for Tallahassee. Each home game brings a reported $10 million to the local economy, and some of that money directly lines cops\u2019 pockets, as many on the force collect extra pay guiding traffic on game nights. And plenty of these cops are Seminoles fans, plain and simple. But beyond the fandom and the economic incentives to look the other way when it comes to players, it\u2019s not hard to imagine how a police force \u2014 which, like all police forces, is already empowered to act with impunity \u2014 would view a similarly powerful community presence like the FSU athletic department and its student athletes as equally above the law.\n\nThe reporting from the Times\u2019 Mike McIntire and Walt Bogdanich paints a frightening portrait of how the \u201ctowering presence of Florida State football\u201d repeatedly, systematically \u201ccast a shadow over justice in Tallahassee.\u201d Frightening, but not entirely new. Earlier this year, the Times also published a piece on how the Tallahassee police department, officials within the athletic department and administrators at FSU obstructed or otherwise delayed the sexual assault investigation into one of its star players, Seminoles quarterback Jameis Winston. An investigative report from Fox Sports, also released this weekend, exposed more about the extent of the alleged misconduct.\n\nBoth reports reveal a string of events in which the police and the university knowingly obstructed and manipulated the progress of the case. After the assault was reported, police did not contact witnesses (one who happened to have video of the alleged assault), did not obtain a DNA sample from Winston because doing so would \u201ccreate publicity,\u201d and, according to the woman\u2019s attorney, warned that \u201cTallahassee was a big football town\u201d and tried to pressure her into dropping the case. (This is a woefully incomplete list of everything wrong with the investigation.)\n\nThe timeline at which these events unfolded is just as galling. After allowing the case to go dormant for months, the police waited nearly an entire year after the initial report before sending it to the prosecutor\u2019s office, at which point prosecutor Willie Meggs declined to charge Winston, citing a lack of evidence. (Meggs has said the police department\u2019s handling of the case actively hindered his ability to do his job.) And according to multiple reports, school officials waited to meet with Winston until late January 2014 \u2014 a full 12 months after they knew Winston was the suspect in the case, and a month after the 2013 football season ended \u2014 to discuss the alleged crime, a blatant violation of its obligations under Title IX.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A damning report on law enforcement's willful obstruction of cases involving football players raises hard questions", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A damning report on law enforcement's willful obstruction of cases involving football players raises hard questions", "title": "College football\u2019s galling coverup: When it comes to sexual violence, who\u2019s policing the police?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/13/college_footballs_galling_coverup_when_it_comes_to_sexual_violence_whos_policing_the_police/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/AP911199914379.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A damning report on law enforcement's willful obstruction of cases involving football players raises hard questions", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/AP911199914379.jpg", "title": "College football\u2019s galling coverup: When it comes to sexual violence, who\u2019s policing the police?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "College football\u2019s galling coverup: When it comes to sexual violence, who\u2019s policing the police?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, florida state, florida state university, jameis winston, Misogyny, Police brutality, police violence, Racism, Rape, seminoles, Sexual assault, Violence Against Women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After all, Seminoles football means big money for Tallahassee.\nAccording to the Times, \u201claw enforcement officers are finely attuned to a suspect\u2019s football connections,\u201d and those connections are \u201ccited repeatedly\u201d in police reports.\n(Meggs has said the police department\u2019s handling of the case actively hindered his ability to do his job.)\nAn investigative report from Fox Sports, also released this weekend, exposed more about the extent of the alleged misconduct.\nBoth reports reveal a string of events in which the police and the university knowingly obstructed and manipulated the progress of the case."}
