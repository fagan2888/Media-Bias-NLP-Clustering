According to the newspaper, 55,000 federal workers here represent 18.8 percent of the workforce.\n\nNot all of them were furloughed, however.\n\nSigned on Sept. 30, the Pay Our Military Act allowed the Pentagon to eliminate furloughs for employees whose responsibilities \u201ccontribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members,\u201d said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in a news release.\n\nPeterson Air Force Base\n\nAt Peterson Air Force Base, 2,200 employees were furloughed, according to 1st Lt. Stacy Glaus, chief of public affairs.\n\nSome 600 employees were excepted from the furloughs in order to ensure accomplishing essential activities on base, including duties revolving around national security, emergency services, health care, safety or protection of property, said Col. John Shaw, 21st space wing commander.\n\nAt all levels, the base felt the impact of the shutdown, and the previous funding status was \u201cextremely disruptive to the Air Force,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nWith or without the furlough, every day brings challenges.\n\n\u201cNearly all of our 2,200 civilians who were furloughed have been recalled,\u201d said Jared Marquis, technical sergeant at Peterson. \u201cThis is an unprecedented event that is out of our control. We continue to address the shutdown challenges, ensure our mission is successful and take care of our airmen.\u201d\n\nAir Force Academy\n\n\u201cWe were contacted Sunday and told to bring back 950 of the 1,000 employees who were furloughed,\u201d said Academy spokesman John VanWinkle.\n\nLast week, Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson, superintendent of the service academy, said they were taking steps to mitigate disruptions to cadets and classroom instruction.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the academy is that our civilian employees have specialties \u2013 things they are experts in, subjects they teach. We\u2019ve responded by putting together some sections and cutting some classes.\u201d\n\nAbout 1,000 civilian employees were furloughed from the academy because of the shutdown \u2013 including professors, human resource professionals, attorneys and clerks. About 500 remained on the job.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not alone in this,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSpace Command had civilians furloughed.\u201d Space Command is headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base, but has offices around the globe.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Johnson said mid-week during the shutdown. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with it as best we can, and we\u2019re addressing issues as they come up.\u201d\n\nLongterm, the academy would have faced trouble with graduation requirements and accreditation, she said.\n\n\u201cWe are an institute of higher learning and there are guidelines we must follow.\u201d\n\nSchriever Air Force Base\n\nSchriever AFB had 392 civilians furloughed, all of whom were recalled Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to welcome back all of our civilians; however, it is not business-as-usual until we get an appropriations bill or continuing resolution,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Julius Delos Reyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly distressing for them to have to suffer another furlough,\u201d said Col. William Liquori, 50th Space Wing commander, of the civilians. \u201cIt creates uncertainty and a disrupting financial effect but, every member of the team is important regardless of their status under the furlough, and we will continue to do our mission during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nMilitary operations continued on, \u201cespecially those things essential to national security, safety of human life and protection of personal property. And we\u2019ll continue to do our mission throughout this difficult time,\u201d Liquori said. \u201cThe absence of appropriations is disruptive to the Air Force, and Schriever is no different.\u201d\n\nFort Carson protest\n\nLast week, around 30 men and women gathered outside Gate 1 of Fort Carson to protest the shutdown. As truckers and others drove by, they honked enthusiastically, and protesters responded with shouts and screams of agreement.\n\nAlex Nguyen, who carried a protest sign, works as an administrative assistant. One of the 1,000 civilians furloughed at Fort Carson, she is also a disabled veteran, which she called a \u201cdouble whammy.\u201d\n\nIf the shutdown lasts longer, Nguyen said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to support my three kids. If I can\u2019t pay my bills, the first thing to go is my mortgage.\u201d\n\nDerrick Knight was not furloughed from his position as a physical evaluation board liaison officer.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2019s secure until they make a firm decision, not all these temporary fixes,\u201d on the budget, Knight said.\n\nProtester Albert Rivera, a dental lab technician at Fort Carson, said, \u201cIt\u2019s tragic Congress can\u2019t fund the government.\u201d Although Rivera was not furloughed, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrible, not only for my family, but for the town.\u201d\n\nRivera\u2019s department contains 25 to 30 civilians working at each of four clinics and one surgery location. He said either four or five persons were furloughed from each location.\n\nIn an area of employment that Fort Carson drew down during the partial shutdown, Rivera said services there were limited to \u201cthe most extreme dental needs,\u201d Rivera said. His wife, a nurse at Fort Carson, also was not furloughed.\n\nGerry Swanke, national vice president of American Federation of Government Employees, said he knows how families respond when \u201cthe paycheck doesn\u2019t come\u201d because his father had no job for five years.\n\n\u201cThe blackmail in DC on ideology is exploiting the weakest among us,\u201d Swanke said. From his point of view, Swanke said the real issue is the Affordable Care Act, a law that Congress passed three years ago. Swanke added that the issue isn\u2019t bi-partisan; instead it\u2019s purple, not blue or red.\n\nFurloughing federal employees affects \u201call the things we take for granted \u2014 clean air, inspected food, clean water and care for our vets,\u201d Swanke said. \u201cThey\u2019re being exploited for ideology.\u201d\n\nMonday, Nguyen was one of the 1,000 civilians called back to work. Fort Carson Chief of Media Relations Dani Johnson said all civilians working on-post were called back to work. The commissary opened the same day as well.\n\nThere were small adjustments as shipments settled back to normal routines, she added.\n\nAir Force Space Command\n\nAll 572 civilians furloughed from the headquarters in Colorado Springs were recalled, said Dean Miller, spokesman for the Air Force Space Command.\n\nMaj. Brooke Brander said that across the command, 4,878 persons were furloughed, 1,065 exempted and 1,494 excepted. Exempted employees are employed from a separate fund, and excepted employees are \u201cprimarily performing duties for protection of life, national security, safety of persons, protection of property, medical care, acquisition and logistic support,\u201d Brander said.\n\nIn total, the Air Force Space Command has more than 42,000 persons assigned to 134 locations across the globe.\n\nThe local headquarters employs 1,200 active duty military and civilians.\n\nWhile nationwide the DoD civilian furlough has largely been eliminated, the local effects have yet to be calculated.\n\nAmy Gillentine contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Springs Business Journal", "description": "The partial shutdown of government functions became temporary Monday, when thousands of federal employees were invited back to work in Colorado Springs and across the nation.
