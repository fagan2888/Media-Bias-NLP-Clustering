With any Republican nominee likely to work for its\u2019 repeal, the Bunnies want to protect the quality health coverage that they now enjoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Secretary Of State, Hillary Clinton gained invaluable experience negotiating with foreign leaders, and the Bunnies can definitely relate to negotiating through a language barrier,\u201d they continued. \u201cThe Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe, and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will.\u201d\n\n\u201cBill Clinton presided over the most prosperous time in Bunny Ranch history, which coincided with a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans such as brothel owner Dennis Hof,\u201d the Bunny Ranch writes. \u201cThe Bunnies recognize that thriving economies are built from the bottom up, where the vast majority of their clients originate. A return to relying on the disproven theory of trickle-down economics would only serve to exclude the vast majority of hard-working Bunny Ranch clients from having the discretionary income to enjoy with their favorite Bunny.\n\nCiting Nevada\u2019s mandatory testing of legal prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases, the Bunny Ranch also applauded Mrs. Clinton for recognizing \u201cthe fact that responsible government oversight is a key to protecting the public\u2019s health from widespread disease.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid received a ringing endorsement from a legal brothel in Pahrump, Nevada, called Sheri\u2019s Ranch. In a letter, the ranch similarly commended Mr. Reid\u2019s support for the Affordable Care Act and even offered to host the senator\u2019s retirement party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nevada sex workers at Dennis Hof's famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch have launched a \"Hookers for Hillary\" Clinton website that endorses the former secretary of state's campaign for president.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Nevada sex workers at Dennis Hof\u2019s famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch have launched a \u201cHookers for Hillary\u201d Clinton website that endorses the former secretary of state\u2019s campaign for president.", "title": "Dennis Hof\u2019s Moonlite Bunny Ranch launches \u2018Hookers for Hillary\u2019 Clinton", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/17/dennis-hofs-moonlite-bunny-ranch-launches-hookers-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/17/moonlite_bunny.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/17/moonlite_bunny.jpg", "description": "Nevada sex workers at Dennis Hof's famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch have launched a \"Hookers for Hillary\" Clinton website that endorses the former secretary of state's campaign for president.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Dennis Hof\u2019s Moonlite Bunny Ranch launches \u2018Hookers for Hillary&"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Hillary Clinton, Dennis Hof"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8fb7\"", "article_summary": "Nevada sex workers at Dennis Hof\u2019s famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch have launched a \u201cHookers for Hillary\u201d Clinton website that endorses the former secretary of state\u2019s campaign for president.\nThe legal brothel near Carson City, which was the subject of HBO\u2019s \u201cCathouse\u201d series, has drafted a four-point platform explaining their endorsement.\n\u201cThe Affordable Health Care Act made health insurance available for the first time ever to the 500 independent contractors employed by Dennis Hof.\n\u201cHillary Clinton, as part of her husband\u2019s administration, envisioned health care reform in the 1990\u2019s, long before President Obama was able to sign it into law,\u201d they write.\nA return to relying on the disproven theory of trickle-down economics would only serve to exclude the vast majority of hard-working Bunny Ranch clients from having the discretionary income to enjoy with their favorite Bunny."}
