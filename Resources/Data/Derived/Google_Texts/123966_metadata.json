After losing to Wagner to relinquish her U.S. national title in January, she had one of her worst performances of the season at the Four Continents Championships in South Korea, failing to medal at an event she was predicted to easily win.\n\nHer season had started off promisingly enough with her first Grand Prix win at the NHK Trophy in Japan. But a small stress fracture in her foot forced her to pull out of the Grand Prix Finals in December and she has struggled to find her rhythm ever since.\n\n\u201cThis year was a little more rough and tumble for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m used to being at least consistently going up, maybe a little down. Wiping the ice at the Four Continents event and breaking a foot aren\u2019t really in my usual plans. Those are some pretty severe ups and downs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "US women\u2019s medal drought continues at figure skating worlds", "title": "US women\u2019s medal drought continues at figure skating worlds", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "US women\u2019s medal drought continues at figure skating worlds", "title": "US women\u2019s medal drought continues at figure skating worlds", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/us_womens_medal_drought_continues_at_figure_skating_worlds/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/china-world-figure-skating.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US women\u2019s medal drought continues at figure skating worlds", "title": "US women\u2019s medal drought continues at figure skating worlds", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/china-world-figure-skating.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Justin Bergman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Her season had started off promisingly enough with her first Grand Prix win at the NHK Trophy in Japan.\nBut a small stress fracture in her foot forced her to pull out of the Grand Prix Finals in December and she has struggled to find her rhythm ever since.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsSHANGHAI (AP) \u2014 For the ninth straight year, there wasn\u2019t an American woman on the podium at the figure skating world championships.\nWiping the ice at the Four Continents event and breaking a foot aren\u2019t really in my usual plans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I kind of hoped to do is skate strong and be tough,\u201d she said."}
