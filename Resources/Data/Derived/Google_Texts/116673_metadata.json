The final rules won\u2019t likely go into effect for months and have yet to be publicly released, a fact that has disappointed critics and activists.\n\nThe vote, which reclassified the internet as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act, was a clear win for net neutrality supporters who feared broadband providers would shortchange consumers and stifle innovation through paid prioritization that would let bigger more successful services pay for faster service.\n\nBut the vote ignited stern opposition from the FCC\u2019s two Republican Commissioners Ajit Pai and Michael O\u2019Reilly who felt the new order with the net neutrality rules was essentially \u201cObamacare for the Internet,\u201d and gave consumers less freedom and more restrictions on what kind of data plans they should get.\n\n\u201cThe Internet has become a powerful force for freedom, both at home and abroad,\u201d Pai said in his opening remarks. \u201cSo why is the FCC turning its back on Internet freedom? Is it because we now have evidence that the Internet is broken? No. We are flip-flopping for one reason and one reason alone. President Obama told us to do so.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama urged the FCC in November to reinstate the net neutrality rules and ban ISPs from throttling, blocking or otherwise hindering consumers\u2019 internet access.\n\nPai, who has openly and consistently disapproved of the new order, said and Obama\u2019s plan had \u201cglaring legal flaws\u201d that would hopefully be reversed by the courts or Congress.\n\nThe FCC voted to \u201cupend pricing plans that benefit consumers\u201d so that \u201cif a company doesn\u2019t want to offer an expensive, unlimited data plan, it could find itself in the FCC\u2019s cross hairs\u201d for favoring more usage-based pricing plans.\n\n\u201cOur standard should be simple: If you like your current service plan, you should be able to keep your current service plan,\u201d Pai said, evoking Obama\u2019s famous words when describing the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe FCC shouldn\u2019t take it away from you\u2026Consumers will be worse off under President Obama\u2019s plan to regulate the Internet. Consumers should expect their bills to go up, and they should expect that broadband will be slower going forward. This isn\u2019t what anyone was promised, to say the least.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, a conservative advocacy group Protect Internet Freedom released a video bashing the FCC\u2019s proposal to treat the internet as a utility, suggesting that it would mean more government intrusion into how people use the internet and what services they use most. Commissioner O\u2019Reilly resurrected that point in his dissent.\n\n\u201cWhile I see no need for net neutrality rules, I am far more troubled by the dangerous course that the Commission is now charting on Title II and the consequences it will have for broadband investment, edge providers, and consumers,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201c[It] is hard for me to believe that the Commission is establishing an entire Title II/net neutrality regime to protect against hypothetical harms. There is not a shred of evidence that any aspect of this structure is necessary. The D.C. Circuit called the prior, scaled-down version a \u2018prophylactic\u2019 approach. I call it guilt by imagination.\u201d\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s vote, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler quelled critics suspicions the new order would deeply meddle in broadband companies\u2019 affairs: \u201cThe action that we take today is an irrefutable reflection of the principle that no one, whether government or corporate, should control free and open access to the internet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Landmark net neutrality vote brings out stern opposition from the two Republican commissioners who voted against the order.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Landmark net neutrality vote brings out stern opposition from the two Republican commissioners who voted against the order.", "title": "Republican FCC Commissioners Invoke The Ted Cruz-Defense For Net Neutrality Vote", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/02/27/3628073/republican-fcc-commissioners-invoke-ted-cruz-defense-net-neutrality-vote/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AP761843581115.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Landmark net neutrality vote brings out stern opposition from the two Republican commissioners who voted against the order.", "creator": "@lalaurenista", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AP761843581115-321x214.jpg", "title": "Republican FCC Commissioners Invoke The Ted Cruz-Defense For Net Neutrality Vote", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AP761843581115.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AP761843581115.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-27T14:08:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/laurencwill"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d86\"", "article_summary": "Politics Republican FCC Commissioners Invoke The Ted Cruz-Defense For Net Neutrality Vote CREDIT: AP FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler listens as his fellow commissioners voice their opinions during the net neutrality vote.\nAfter a 3-2 party line vote, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reinstated net neutrality rules in its revamped Open Internet Order that prohibits internet providers from throttling or blocking access, and from setting up fast lanes.\nPresident Obama told us to do so.\u201dPresident Barack Obama urged the FCC in November to reinstate the net neutrality rules and ban ISPs from throttling, blocking or otherwise hindering consumers\u2019 internet access.\n\u201cSo why is the FCC turning its back on Internet freedom?\n\u201cThe FCC shouldn\u2019t take it away from you\u2026Consumers will be worse off under President Obama\u2019s plan to regulate the Internet."}
