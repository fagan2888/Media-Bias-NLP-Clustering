BELMAR The Coast Guard has rescued a 16-year-old girl who went missing from her dive group in the Shark River Inlet.

The dive group reported the girl missing to Belmar Water Rescue about 5 p.m. Monday. The Coast Guard launched a 25-foot boat to assist in the search. About 40 minutes later, the girl was found about a mile from her group.

The coxswain for the response boat, Petty Officer 2nd Class Nicholas Cavallo, says having a buddy system when diving makes the experience safer.
