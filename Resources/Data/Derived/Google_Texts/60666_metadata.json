Roberts, most consumers are bound to contractual terms that severely restrict avenues for holding corporations accountable. Arbitration clauses, for example, force consumers to enter the private conflict resolution proceedings as an alternative to filing a lawsuit in court. Many arbitration clauses also prohibit \u201cclass action\u201d cases, meaning each individual wanting to challenge the same practice must file his or her own separate case even when doing so would be prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a new study out that tells us why these clauses are even worse: Consumers almost never use arbitration. Out of tens of millions of people subject to arbitration clauses in agreements for credit cards, loans, checking accounts, and other financial transactions, only 900 people used arbitration between 2010 and 2012. During that same period, and even with so many contracts prohibiting court challenges, consumers filed more than 3,000 federal court cases on credit card disputes alone, including more than 400 class action lawsuits, each involving potentially millions of consumers, according to CFPB Director Richard Cordray.\n\n\u201cOne significant takeaway from these various points is that few consumers use arbitration at all, at least when compared to the number of consumers involved in lawsuits and class actions,\u201d Cordray said in prepared remarks.\n\nEven more relevant to recent Supreme Court precedent, the study found that almost none of these claims were for disputes involving less than $1,000. In one of the greatest Roberts Court blows to consumers, a five-justice majority held that California could not invalidate an arbitration clause as unconscionable, even when the clause prevented AT&T consumers from banding together to challenge a $30 charge. In a subsequent case, economists submitted affidavits asserting the cost of any one person or small business challenging this sort of fee alone exceeds the fee itself, and thus no rational person would pursue this sort of challenge on his or her own. Now, research confirms that most individuals are, in fact, rational.\n\nThe take-away is this: If consumers are prohibited by boilerplate contracts from filing their own lawsuit, and even from banding together in arbitration, they will not challenge corporate malfeasance at all, and companies like AT&T can go on bilking each of their customers out of $30, while reaping large profits in the aggregate.\n\nIn spite of Supreme Court precedent, there are other avenues for reform. Because the justices are merely interpreting a federal statute, and not the Constitution, Congress has the opportunity to clarify what they mean to say in the Federal Arbitration Act. Pending before Congress is a measure, the Arbitration Fairness Act, that would impose an outright ban on these clauses.\n\nIn fact, Congress clarified its position on forced arbitration when it explicitly banned some forms of it in the more recent Dodd-Frank Act, including in residential mortgage loan contracts. The Act also directs the Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFPB to limit or even ban use of the clauses for entities they regulate if, after studying the issue, they find that it is \u201cin the public interest and for the protection of consumers.\u201d But they\u2019ll have to get around the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is already exerting its heavy influence on the process, according to the Legal Times.\n\nAs CFPB continues to study the issue, a petition for the agency to halt forced arbitration has already garnered 17,500 signatures.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "And what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can do about it.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "And what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can do about it.", "title": "Why The Roberts Court\u2019s Anti-Consumer Decisions Are Even Worse Than They Seemed", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/12/12/3057121/roberts-courts-anti-consumer-decisions-worse/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AP120131130672-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "And what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can do about it.", "title": "Why The Roberts Court\u2019s Anti-Consumer Decisions Are Even Worse Than They Seemed", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AP120131130672-1-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@NicFlatow", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AP120131130672-1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AP120131130672-1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-12T16:45:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf461\"", "article_summary": "Justice Why The Roberts Court\u2019s Anti-Consumer Decisions Are Even Worse Than They Seemed CREDIT: AP Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard CordrayConsumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray CREDIT: Associated PressThanks in part to several recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G.
