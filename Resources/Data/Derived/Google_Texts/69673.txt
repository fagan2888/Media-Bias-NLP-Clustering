ROANOKE — Unionized store associates of Kroger may have reached an agreement after two days of negotiations.

Going on a strike may be off the table for Waynesboro and Staunton stores due to the deal, which is pending.

The tentative agreement includes higher pay, affordable health care and pension support for associates, a release said. No specifics were released on the agreement.

“We can’t release details of the latest offer publicly until all of our members have a chance to review it at the next meeting,” said Rick Howell, a Kroger cashier who served on the union’s bargaining team, in a release.

Union members are set to vote on the agreement June 8 in Roanoke.

Negotiations were resumed after the Local 400 of the United Food & Commercial Workers, or UFCW, had voted to reject the company’s previous offer and authorize a strike last week.

What sparked the debate was when Kroger refused to provide its associates with paid sick days, and proposed to force all retired employees off the company-provided health care and onto Affordable Care Act exchanges funded by taxpayers, according to the Local 400 website.

The Waynesboro and Staunton stores are part of 41 Kroger stores that have been negotiating a contract with corporate officials for increased wages and benefits.

The tentative agreement affects 41 Kroger stores in the region stretching from Kingsport, Tennessee, to Harrisonburg. Approximately 3,000 of the affected associates are union members with Local 400 of the UFCW, a release said.
