As the 2014 midterm elections approach, conservative groups are beginning to hit the airwaves with spots targeting vulnerable Democrats and their support for the health law \u2014 and the ads are playing fast and loose with the facts.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, the tax-exempt conservative action group created by brothers Charles and David Koch, took out two ads against vulnerable Democrats: Rick Nolan of Minnesota\u2019s 8th District and Ann Kuster of New Hampshire\u2019s 2nd District. Both focus on the health-care law, and they are important to dissect because they are the first trickles of what is sure to be a torrent of anti-ACA advertising.\n\nThe ad against Nolan features a middle-aged Minnesota resident named Randy Westby, who says he lost his health care plan because it no longer qualified for purchase in the exchanges. \u201cI\u2019ve had three heart attacks in the last six years. Health care is something that\u2019s essential, and my life depends on it,\u201d he continues.\n\nThe ad leans heavily on Politifact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year\u201d designation for President Obama\u2019s \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it\u201d claim, and gives the strong impression that sick people are much worse off under Obamacare.\n\nBut was Westby able to find another plan? Four million to five million people probably had their plan canceled because of updated coverage requirements, but the administration believes fewer than 500,000 of those people are still looking for another plan. The ad doesn\u2019t tell us if Westby is one of those people.\n\nNor does it note that he can\u2019t be disqualified from any of the plans on the exchanges because of his preexisting condition \u2014 and three heart attacks in six years is one heck of a preexisting condition. Are the plans available to him cheaper than what he had before? How much better is the coverage? We don\u2019t know, although given Westby\u2019s medical history and apparent age, it seems he is exactly the type of person most likely to benefit from how the new individual market is structured.\n\nThe New Hampshire ad is more general and features an actress, but it relies on the same central and shaky claim that \u201cmillions of people\u201d are losing coverage. Both ads hit the Democrats in question for voting to keep the ACA in place. (Aside from firing up the conservative grass roots, there was a good political reason for all those repeal votes in the House: to get vulnerable Democrats on the record, again and again.)\n\nA focus on horror stories like these is the likely new Republican approach to Obamacare, as the New York Times outlines today. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just a piece of paper that you can repeal and it goes away,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told the times. \u201cThere\u2019s something there. We have to recognize that reality. We have to deal with the people that are currently covered under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBut Westby may well be one of these people. And he may be getting better coverage. These will be the battle lines for the upcoming year: Republicans are gearing up to tell the horror stories, and Democrats will have to respond with stories of their own \u2014 the eight million to 10 million people who will be getting coverage under Obamacare by the end of March.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Campaign season begins with candidates twisting the truth on health-care reform.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Campaign season begins with candidates twisting the truth on health-care reform.", "title": "Lying about Obamacare continues as campaign season begins", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/12/27/lying-about-obamacare-continues-as-campaign-season-begins/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/12/27/lying-about-obamacare-continues-as-campaign-season-begins/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, health care reform, 2014 elections, midterm elections;,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, health care reform, 2014 elections, midterm elections;,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabf5\"", "article_summary": "Health care is something that\u2019s essential, and my life depends on it,\u201d he continues.\nThe ad against Nolan features a middle-aged Minnesota resident named Randy Westby, who says he lost his health care plan because it no longer qualified for purchase in the exchanges.\nYou may want to sit down before reading this: Republicans aren\u2019t being totally truthful about the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nA focus on horror stories like these is the likely new Republican approach to Obamacare, as the New York Times outlines today.\nWe have to deal with the people that are currently covered under Obamacare.\u201dBut Westby may well be one of these people."}
