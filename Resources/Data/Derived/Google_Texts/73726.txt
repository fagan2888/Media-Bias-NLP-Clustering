To the editor:

This is in response to Anne Filson’s letter to the editor of Sept. 22.

The Republican debate not grown up? Well they were responding to C-SPAN’s childish questions. They asked inappropriate questions, like: "Respond to Trump’s accusation about Fiorina: 'Look at that face. Would anyone vote for a president with that face?’" They did not get a chance to articulate their positions on the economy, foreign policy, immigration, etc.

Now we know what liberals want. Obama’s Affordable Care Act is not affordable. Ask moderate income people how affordable it is. Their deductibles are too expensive. The cost of it is much higher than their former insurance companies. Liberals have to lie to get their policies through; for instance: "If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor." "If you like your insurance plan, you can keep it."

No, Anne, we do not want universal health coverage. We do not want another liberal/socialist president. Republicans do have a plan. Part of that plan is to open up the affordable insurance companies in one state to other states. Competition is good.

The Obama presidency on immigrants has become a complete disaster. Why is the flow of immigrants to America at zero? There are no jobs here. They are going back to Mexico for that. Open up the environmentally sound Keystone pipeline, then Americans will become employed. And the illegal immigrants will flood our land again.

The illegal immigrants now are costing the American citizens a great deal of our taxes. American and Hispanic immigrant citizens are being denied such amenities and necessities. Why do Democrats aid illegal immigrants? They are potential voters to the Democratic Party, thus Democrats will be in power in perpetuity.

Right now we need a Republican president to straighten out the mess our country and the world are in.

I am keeping my eye on Cruz, Rubio, Carson and Fiorina.
