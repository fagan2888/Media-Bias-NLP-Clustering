A few tidbits:\n\nJewel refused him an on-screen kiss during an episode of \"The Lyon's Den.\" The chaste kiss ended with her wiping a hand across her mouth in disgust.\n\nAt 18, he was invited to the Playboy Mansion. It was not a chaste experience.\n\nHe hid behind a newspaper as he cried on the plane taking his oldest son to college.\n\nWarren Beatty clued him into his then girlfriend's activities in an ultra-cool way.\n\nHe got ousted as a youth coach, mostly for having the audacity to keep score during games.\n\nLes Moonves of CBS talked him out of a role on ABC's \"Grey's Anatomy\" in favor of the doomed \"Dr. Vegas\"\n\nHe could have hooked up with Madonna but blew it when he refused to dance first. He described her as having \"flawless skin and eyes that imparted secrets.\"\n\nMost of \"Love Life\" is dedicated to lessons learned from his two sons and wife. Those recollections shuck off the celebrity skin and embrace the every person's experience.\n\nLowe relishes his role of dad \u2014\u0097 coaching basketball, chaperoning field trips and pulling pranks during camping trips. He never speaks about the hardships of celebrity parenting, recognizing all parenting is tough work.\n\nThis is where he connects with readers. His self-effacing humor keeps the pace brisk.\n\nWhen explaining the parent drama during his youth coaching days, he said, \"I haven't felt such tension and disapproval since I sang with Snow White at the Oscars.\"\n\nWhen it comes to his wife of more than 20 years, women will swoon. In the sweetest of words, he writes love letters disguised as chapters.\n\nSobriety remains a priority in life, noting his sons have always known him this way.\n\nCompared to his first book, this offering gives more about the current state of the entertainment business and his approach to acting.\n\nLowe encourages taking chances and doing the unexpected, like his role as Dr. Jack Startz in HBO's \"Behind the Candelabra.\"\n\nWriting biographical books is also a challenging stretch for an artist and one Lowe does well.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Even if you just adore him or simply enjoyed his last biographical book, \"Stories I Only Tell My Friends,\" his latest retrospective will hook you.", "title": "Rob Lowe's 'Love Life' a riveting read filled with actor's stories", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/books/rob-lowe-s-love-life-a-riveting-read-filled-with/article_26b410d0-0616-597c-afbf-babd45676cae.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/b6/6b684d56-4311-5f72-bcd3-17fe81f2cfda/534a3d19cb20e.preview-500.jpg?resize=418%2C630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Even if you just adore him or simply enjoyed his last biographical book, \"Stories I Only Tell My Friends,\" his latest retrospective will hook you.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "love,biographical,lowe,rob,ginnie,graham,role,stories,actor,behind,books,scene,staff,ginniegraham", "news_keywords": "love,biographical,lowe,rob,ginnie,graham,role,stories,actor,behind,books,scene,staff,ginniegraham"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc49\"", "article_summary": "If you love Rob Lowe, you'll love his \"Love Life.\"\nRemember me on this computer Login Screen Name or Email Now I remember!\nMost of \"Love Life\" is dedicated to lessons learned from his two sons and wife.\nLowe encourages taking chances and doing the unexpected, like his role as Dr. Jack Startz in HBO's \"Behind the Candelabra.\"\nIf you feel you are currently subscribed please click on the button to attempt to find your account."}
