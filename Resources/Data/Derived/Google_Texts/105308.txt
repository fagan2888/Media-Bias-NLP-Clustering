The University of Virginia Health System has a new care option for patients with Medicare.

It's called Well Virginia, and it's been in place since January 1st.

Well Virginia is an accountable care organization (ACO) that helps Medicare patients get better access to high-quality, low-cost care across the U.S.

Doctors and hospitals work together in the ACO to provide that care.

UVa. Officials say by using Well Virginia they will be able to help patients prevent high-risk diseases later on.

"If we can manage diabetes, and prevent complications such as kidney disease, heart disease, hypertension, neuropathic disease, stroke, neuropathy, then the patient benefits obviously,” says Interim Medical Director Dan McCarter. “But the Health System benefits because it's lower cost as well."

More than 360 ACOs have been created across the U.S. since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.

UVa. says they have about 20,000 patients already using Well Virginia.
