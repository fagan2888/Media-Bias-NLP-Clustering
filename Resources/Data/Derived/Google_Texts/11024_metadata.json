Know your buyer: If the neighborhood has young families and a good school, renovate the family room/kitchen, and make sure there are enough bathrooms. Go for a playroom in a finished basement. If it\u2019s an older, retirement community, look for a one-level house and accessible fixtures.\n\n4. Keep a list of every improvement: You can educate your buyer with before and after photos of every improvement you made. If the improvements are in the infrastructure, show them how much that new boiler saves them in electricity and water every year.\n\n5. Don\u2019t Overprice: In fact, consider underpricing\u2014which could attract enough buyers who want to beat the asking price. Make sure your \u201ccurb appeal\u201d is right on the money, with trimmed hedges and shrubs and well clipped lawns. Finally, at an open house, put a basket of shoe booties for people to use. It shows how much you care about the place\u2026and they might, too.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "We know this because we read RealtyTrac\u2019s Q1", "title": "Want to Make a Cool $72,000?
