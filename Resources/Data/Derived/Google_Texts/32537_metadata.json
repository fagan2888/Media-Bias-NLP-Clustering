He\u2019s a more slashing type of guard,\u201d North Bergen coach Kevin Bianco said of Feliz. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely important to help his confidence which is why we\u2019re letting him play through his mistakes, so he can keep his confidence.\u201d\n\nFeliz wasn\u2019t the only Bruins player to excel at the foul line, as Bianco\u2019s group went a combined 31-for-35 on foul shots.\n\nBut the Bruins all but sealed the victory in the second quarter when they used a 25-2 run to turn an 11-9 game at the end of the opening frame into a blowout by halftime. North Bergen received scoring from eight different players during the second-quarter surge, including five points each from Anthony Rodrigues and Brian Fabre.\n\n\u201cThey were playing us zone so we were just moving the ball until we got an open shot,\u201d said Feliz.\n\nByron Morel paced the home team with a team-high 12 points, including a pair of 3-pointers coming in the first and fourth quarters. After trailing 36-11 at the intermission, the Bulldogs outscored the Bruins 14-12 in the third stanza but could not close the gap even after Brandon Hartwig nailed a 23-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer.\n\n\u201cI thought we played with a lot of energy,\u201d said Bianco, whose team returns to action on Monday against St. Peter\u2019s Prep. \u201c(Ferris) started being more of the aggressor in the second half which got them back in the game a little bit.\u201d\n\nBut Feliz kept his foot on the gas pedal, scoring 11 points in the fourth quarter, nine of which came from the foul line.\n\n\u201cTrying to get the win, set the tone for the season, set the pace for my team,\u201d Feliz said. \u201cStay aggressive and just play my game.\n\n\u201cIt was a good confidence boost.\u201d\n\nNorth Bergen (1-0) 11 25 12 20 \u2014 68\n\nFerris (0-1) 9 2 14 18 \u2014 43\n\nNorth Bergen 68: Abraham Feliz 3-1-15-24, Quincy Alvarez 1-0-2-4, Thomas Rivera 4-0-0-8, Alexi Dominguez 2-0-1-5, Ellis Perez 1-0-0-2, Kelvin Batista 1-0-4-6, Anthony Rodrigues 2-0-1-5, Muntasir Saleh 1-0-4-6, Brian Fabre 1-0-4-6, Darius Ryan 1-0-0-2.
