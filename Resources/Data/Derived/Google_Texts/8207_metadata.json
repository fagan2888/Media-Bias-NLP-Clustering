The first time \u2014 Paul at age 26 \u2014 was agonizing and frenzied, his body tethered to a machine meant to keep him alive as his incurable sickle cell disease progressed. When the same illness ravaged Solomon, at age 33, the Harrises reluctantly turned to hospice in the hope that his last days might somehow be less harrowing than his brother\u2019s.\n\nAt the root of the issue is a toxic distrust of a health care system that once displayed \u2018No Negroes\u2019 signs at hospitals.\n\nTheir expectations were low. \u201cThey take your money,\u201d Vernal Harris said, describing what she had heard of hospice. \u201cYour loved ones don\u2019t see you anymore. You just go there and die.\u201d\n\nHospice use has been growing fast in the United States as more people choose to avoid futile, often painful medical treatments in favor of palliative care and dying at home surrounded by loved ones. But the Harrises, who are African-American, belong to a demographic group that has long resisted the concept and whose suspicions remain deep-seated.\n\nIt is an attitude borne out by recent federal statistics showing that nearly half of white Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in hospice before death, compared with only a third of black patients. The racial divide is even more pronounced when it comes to advance care directives \u2014 legal documents meant to help families make life-or-death decisions that reflect a patient\u2019s choices. Some 40 percent of whites 70 and over have such plans, compared with only 16 percent of blacks.\n\nInstead, black Americans \u2014 far more so than whites \u2014 choose aggressive life-sustaining interventions, including resuscitation and mechanical ventilation, even when there is little chance of survival.\n\nThe racial gaps could widen when Medicare is expected to begin paying physicians in January 2016 for end-of-life counseling, and at a time when blacks and other minorities are projected to make up 42 percent of people 65 and over in 2050, up from 20 percent in 2000.\n\nAt the root of the resistance, say researchers and black physicians, is a toxic distrust of a health care system that once displayed \u201cNo Negroes\u201d signs at hospitals, performed involuntary sterilizations on black women and, in an infamous Tuskegee study, purposely left hundreds of black men untreated for syphilis.\n\n\u201cYou have people who\u2019ve had a difficult time getting access to care throughout their lifetimes\u201d because of poverty, lack of health insurance or difficulty finding a medical provider, said Dr. Maisha Robinson, a neurologist and palliative medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla. \u201cAnd then you have a physician who\u2019s saying, \u2018I think that we need to transition your mother, father, grandmother to comfort care or palliative care.\u2019 People are skeptical of that.\u201d\n\nFederal policies surrounding hospice also arouse suspicion in black communities since Medicare currently requires patients to give up life-sustaining therapies in order to receive hospice benefits.\n\nThat trade-off strikes some black families, who believe they have long had to fight for quality medical care, as unfair, said Dr. Kimberly Johnson, a Duke University associate professor of medicine who has studied African-American attitudes about hospice.\n\nJohnson said her black patients were more likely to believe there are actual religious prohibitions against limiting life-sustaining therapy, and that suffering can be redemptive, or \u201ca test from God.\u201d And those beliefs, she added, were \u201ccontrary to the hospice philosophy of care.\u201d\n\nBut now some doctors and clergy members are trying to use church settings to reshape the black community\u2019s views, incorporating the topic in sermons, Bible study groups, and grief and bereavement ministries.\n\nRobinson, who is black and a daughter of Tennessee pastors, has been helping pastors develop faith-based hospice guidelines. She tells them, \u201cGod can work miracles, yes he can, but even in hospice.\u201d\n\nThat message recently rang out from the pulpit at God Answers Prayer Ministries, an African-American church in South Los Angeles, as Bishop Gwendolyn Coates-Stone tried a sermon theme on advance care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a great cost to hold on to some of those sicknesses and diseases that eventually are going to take us out,\u201d she exclaimed into a microphone, bobbing and weaving in a swirl of royal purple robes. \u201cJust like Jesus talked about his death and prepared his disciples for his death, we ought to be preparing our disciples for our death!\u201d\n\nIn a moment of benediction, Coates-Stone made a direct plea: \u201cHelp us Lord to have the courage to have conversations with our families,\u201d she said, \u201cthat will also not leave them wandering and wondering, \u2018What should I do in case of the death of a loved one?\u2019 \u201d\n\nA gathering of older blacks convened recently by Robinson in Leimert Park, a middle-class Los Angeles neighborhood, underscored the challenges such efforts still face.\n\n\u201cHospice has not been a good place for African-Americans, unless you\u2019re in a white facility and usually you\u2019re one of few black people there,\u201d said one woman, who along with others attending the gathering asked not to be identified in order to speak frankly.\n\nThat sentiment was greeted by nods from others in the group. \u201cIt gets into money,\u201d another woman said. \u201cThe treatment is a little bit better, but then there is still the discrimination.\u201d\n\nAdvance directives, in particular, are often seen as sinister, a way for insurance companies to maximize profits. \u201cIf you say you want at all costs to live, and they say, \u2018Well, your insurance company doesn\u2019t allow that,\u2019 then they\u2019re going to pull the plug anyway,\u201d said the host of the gathering, Loretta Jones, 73, founder of Healthy African-American Families in Los Angeles.\n\nTo help allay those concerns, physicians need to be more explicit during end-of-life discussions, Robinson said. \u201cWe have to be much clearer about why we\u2019re trying to have those conversations, or we\u2019ll continue to see a pattern of people who really want life-sustaining interventions even when there\u2019s limited potential benefit.\u201d\n\nCamille Wicher, vice president of clinical operations at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, who has studied African-Americans\u2019 end-of-life choices, said hospitals needed to enlist black families who have had good hospice experiences to share their stories with friends and church members.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we learn,\u201d she added. \u201cWe learn from each other.\u201d\n\nThe Harrises are trying to use their experience to carry out that work.\n\nThe agony of their son Paul\u2019s death in a hospital room informed their treatment decisions when their next son, Solomon, became gravely ill. When his doctor conceded that blood transfusions were of little help, Solomon assented to hospice care in his parents\u2019 home. If he was going to be robbed of his future, Solomon would not, his parents decided, be robbed of a good death.\n\nAs his health failed, nurses from the hospice in Buffalo managed his pain and bathed him tenderly. A social worker helped the family grieve and counseled his young children.\n\nAll the while, parishioners from his parents\u2019 church visited Solomon, amazed to find that hospice was not the grim banishment they had always envisioned.\n\n\u201cOne of the members said, \u2018I thought you were going to put Solomon in hospice,\u2019 \u201d Vernal Harris recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018We did.\u2019 \u2018Well, when is he going?\u2019 I said, \u2018They come here.\u2019 \u2018They come to your house?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, they\u2019re taking care of him right here.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere was even time for reflection, as Solomon wrote in a poem called \u201cAfter Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cFear death?\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo, I await death.\u201d\n\nSolomon died a short while later, but the Harrises say his death has had a lasting impact.\n\n\u201cThe people in our immediate circle now view hospice positively,\u201d Vernal Harris said. \u201cI think our experience was powerful enough that it changed people\u2019s attitudes.\u201d\n\nNarseary Harris, the pastor of Prince of Peace Temple Church of God in Christ, often evangelizes about hospice during his Sunday morning sermons, while his spouse has enlisted the wives of black pastors in western New York, known as the \u201cFirst Ladies,\u201d to counter negative views about palliative care. At a recent meeting, the women discussed older church members who might benefit from hospice, and Vernal Harris wanted to hear how parishioners in the women\u2019s churches responded to some recent outreach.\n\n\u201cIt really opened up people\u2019s eyes to the negative stigma of it, feeling like, \u2018I\u2019m just putting my loved one away, and not caring for them,\u2019 \u201d said Joyce Badger of Bethesda World Harvest International Church in Buffalo. \u201cThe power of knowledge that we\u2019ve gained is really going to help our community.\u201d\n\nSarah Varney is a reporter with Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit news organization covering health care policy and politics.
