The suspensions, however, did not last long. An uproar prompted Highland Park\u2019s superintendent, Dawson Orr, to reverse the decision two weeks later.\n\nThe other books were \u201cThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,\u201d by Sherman Alexie; \u201cSong of Solomon,\u201d by Toni Morrison; \u201cSiddhartha,\u201d by Hermann Hesse; \u201cAn Abundance of Katherines,\u201d by John Green; \u201cThe Glass Castle,\u201d by Jeannette Walls; and \u201cThe Working Poor,\u201d by David Shipler.\n\n\u201cThere are no banned or suspended books in the Highland Park Independent School District today,\u201d Dr. Orr said. \u201cWe are delivering curriculum to kids; we are using instructional resources; we are working very hard to deliver a level of transparency.\u201d\n\nThe return of the books to classrooms has not ended the intense debate over who should determine what is read in public classrooms. Since September, two opposing groups of parents have mobilized.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpeak Up for Standards wants parents to have more control over removing literature they find offensive. Its leaders include Tavia Hunt, who is married to the grandson of the oil tycoon H. L. Hunt.\n\nHP Kids Read says decisions about reading materials should be left to the teachers. The group\u2019s efforts have caught the attention of national anti-censorship advocates.\n\nScrutiny of the books began in response to concerns from parents as early as last May, Dr. Orr said. It continued over the summer and at the start of the school year, with some parents circulating emails that highlighted sex scenes and references to rape, incest, prostitution and abortion in selected books. In Mr. Stein\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Racing in the Rain,\u201d a 2008 novel that follows a racecar driver\u2019s struggle to raise his daughter after his wife\u2019s death and is told from the perspective of a dog, parents identified passages they found troublesome, like a scene in which a 15-year-old girl makes sexual advances toward the driver.\n\nDr. Orr said the district hoped the temporary suspension of the books would \u201cde-escalate the situation.\u201d\n\nInstead, the move shocked many other parents in this Dallas enclave.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this school district for 14 years, and this is the first time any of this has popped up,\u201d said John Spicer, who has two children in the Highland Park district and one who has already graduated. \u201cKids had books figuratively pulled out of their hands.\u201d\n\nAt a November school board meeting, the issue was still smoldering. Marie Briner, an elementary school parent, said she was alarmed to learn of the content of some books in the curriculum. As a former Dallas County prosecutor in the child abuse division, she said that if she had found the material in a police investigation, she would have entered it as evidence that a defendant was trying to \u201cgroom\u201d potential victims.\n\n\u201cHow is this any different than my sex offenders that have a diary of their fantasies? And I have to tell you, it\u2019s not different at all,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nOther parents argued that a diverse reading list that reflected a variety of socioeconomic, racial and political viewpoints was essential in the district, which serves students in one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI love Highland Park, and I\u2019ve always had faith in the district because the parents really insist on academic excellence,\u201d Lynn Dickinson, the parent of an eighth grader, said. \u201cBut one thing to me that has always been a drawback is its homogeneous nature.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a committee of 12 parents, educators and administrators, which reviewed \u201cThe Art of Racing in the Rain,\u201d determined it was appropriate for students in grade 10 or higher. Parents can still appeal that decision to administrators.\n\nMs. Hunt was the lone dissenter on the committee. In review documents provided by the district, she said students could take \u201cconcerning messages\u201d from the book on topics like \u201cseduction, rape, child pedophilia, whether oral sex is sex, premarital sex as normative, reincarnation, or that those in authority over them approve of foul language.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis New York Times best seller would be a good book for someone to choose to read at the beach in the summer,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNot as required reading. Especially considering the opportunity costs of the literature they missed out on as a result of this assignment.\u201d\n\nHighland Park officials are reviewing the district\u2019s procedures for selecting instructional materials, which Dr. Orr said lacked clarity, and the way those selections may be challenged. Updates will be presented to the board on Dec. 9.\n\nUnder current district policy, teachers and administrators choose the materials used. The decision of whether to request parental consent for assigned readings is also made at the campus level, said Helen Williams, a district spokeswoman.\n\nIn an email, Ms. Hunt said she hoped the district would adopt changes proposed by Speak Up for Standards requiring teachers to inform parents before their children were exposed to potentially controversial materials.\n\nSome experts fear that approach, sometimes referred to as \u201cred flagging,\u201d has the same effect as pulling books off library shelves or out of classrooms. They argue that it stigmatizes texts that have educational value.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a prescription for educational chaos,\u201d said Joan Bertin, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, which has followed the Highland Park situation since the school suspended use of the books in September. \u201cIt is an extremely problematic route for the school to take.\u201d\n\nIt can also put a burden on teachers, who must identify potentially inflammatory material and find alternatives for parents who object. In November, the school\u2019s English department made a pre-emptive move, sending a letter asking parents to sign off on Mark Twain\u2019s \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\u201d Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d and Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cA Farewell to Arms.\u201d The books stayed.\n\nMillie Davis, who leads the Intellectual Freedom Center at the National Council of Teachers of English, called the Highland Park book suspensions \u201cdistressing.\u201d\n\nOver the last five years, she said, her organization had most commonly tackled challenges to modern literature and books with multicultural themes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a culture war. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cBut nearly every day I put myself in the shoes of the teachers there, and I don\u2019t know how they go to work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141129181315, "twitter": {"description": "In September, complaints about content prompted Highland Park High School in Texas to pull seven books from the curriculum, creating an uproar that led to an about-face.", "title": "End of Texas School\u2019s Book Ban Doesn\u2019t Mark the Last Chapter", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/us/end-of-schools-book-ban-doesnt-mark-the-last-chapter.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003261432"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/30/us/TTbooks1/TTbooks1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/us/end-of-schools-book-ban-doesnt-mark-the-last-chapter.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003261432", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/us/end-of-schools-book-ban-doesnt-mark-the-last-chapter.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "End of School\u2019s Book Ban Doesn\u2019t Mark the Last Chapter", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 29, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "keywords": "Texas,Highland Park (Tex),Books and Literature,Censorship,Education (K-12),Teachers and School Employees,School Discipline (Students)", "description": "In September, complaints about content prompted Highland Park High School in Texas to pull seven books from the curriculum, creating an uproar that led to an about-face.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Morgan Smith", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/30/us/TTbooks1/TTbooks1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "30ttbooks", "byl": "By MORGAN SMITH", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "In September, complaints about content prompted Highland Park High School in Texas to pull seven books from the curriculum, creating an uproar that led to an about-face.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/30/us/TTbooks1/TTbooks1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Texas,Censorship", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 29, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-11-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "School Discipline (Students)", "published": "2014-11-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Highland Park (Tex)", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141130024202, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/us/end-of-schools-book-ban-doesnt-mark-the-last-chapter.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/30/us/TTbooks1/TTbooks1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In September, complaints about content prompted Highland Park High School in Texas to pull seven books from the curriculum, creating an uproar that led to an about-face.", "title": "End of Texas School\u2019s Book Ban Doesn\u2019t Mark the Last Chapter"}, "pdate": 20141129, "des": "School Discipline (Students)", "articleid": 100000003261432, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "End of Texas School\u2019s Book Ban Doesn\u2019t Mark the Last Chapter", "col": "The Texas Tribune", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1315\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere are no banned or suspended books in the Highland Park Independent School District today,\u201d Dr. Orr said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this school district for 14 years, and this is the first time any of this has popped up,\u201d said John Spicer, who has two children in the Highland Park district and one who has already graduated.\nThat book and six others were being pulled from the curriculum over parental complaints about sexual content and explicit passages, school officials said.\nScrutiny of the books began in response to concerns from parents as early as last May, Dr. Orr said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storySpeak Up for Standards wants parents to have more control over removing literature they find offensive."}
