And I have here my son\u2019s Medicaid card. We didn\u2019t try to get him Medicaid, I\u2019m trying to pay for his insurance. But they automatically enrolled him in Medicaid.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Jan. 5, 2014\n\nThis column has been updated with a new Pinocchio rating.\n\nThis is an odd story \u2014 the saga of how Rand Paul\u2019s oldest son tried to get health insurance via the Kentucky version of Obamacare, and ended up on Medicaid, the federal-state health-care program for the poor. Paul held up the card on television to prove it, saying the system was \u201ca mess.\u201d\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact beat us to the punch with a comprehensive look at what Paul says happened \u2014 and ultimately concluded it was a \u201che-said-she-said\u201d situation that could not be fully adjudicated.\n\nLet\u2019s take a close look, and see if Paul\u2019s story adds up.\n\nThe Facts\n\nRand Paul\u2019s son, William H. Paul, is a 20-year-old full-time student at the University of Kentucky, according to the Lexington Herald Leader.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox\u2019s \u201cOn the Record\u201d on Jan. 8, Paul gave a more detailed version of what he says happened. He explained he was having trouble signing up for the Washington exchange, and eventually discovered it would cost an additional $6,000 to add his son to his policy. (Note: as far as we can tell, no individual policy in the DC SHOP exchange, which is used by members of Congress, for someone as young as Paul\u2019s son costs $500 a month, even at Platinum plan rates.)\n\nPaul then said his son could not be signed up online and had to go to the \u201cwelfare office\u201d to present his ID to \u201cprove his existence.\u201d According to Paul, \u201cSo he got there. He didn\u2019t sign up for anything. And two days later, he got his Medicaid card. So he\u2019s got Medicaid.\u201d\n\n(Actually, unless forms were incorrectly filled out, Paul\u2019s son should not qualify for Medicaid because he is listed as a dependent on Paul\u2019s tax return. As a senator, Paul\u2019s $174,000-a-year salary is too high for Medicaid, which in Kentucky is limited to individuals below 138 percent of the federal poverty level.)\n\nPaul added that when he went on the Web site of the Kentucky insurance exchange, Kynect, he encountered the same issue:\n\n\u201cSure enough, he does automatically enroll in Medicaid. And there\u2019s a big button about this big on the screen. And there\u2019s a tiny little button that says QHP, which I\u2019m not sure anybody would know what that means, but that\u2019s how you opt out of Medicaid. Otherwise, if you just keep going, you get Medicaid.\u201d\n\nOkay, given the problems with the exchanges, some sort of software glitch is entirely possible. But there are some factors that raise questions about Paul\u2019s account.\n\n1. Kentucky, unlike some states that expanded Medicaid, decided not to allow automatic enrollment into Medicaid, according to Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services.\n\nInstead, you must fill out income and family information, and then the system will decide whether or not you can purchase a health plan but qualify for a subsidy, or whether you qualify for Medicaid. \u201cNo one is automatically enrolled in Medicaid unless they apply for it,\u201d she said, adding that she could not comment specifically on individual applications.\n\nAt the beginning of the process, Bond says, there is an option to go directly to a qualified health plan \u2014 that\u2019s apparently the QHP that Paul mentioned \u2014 if you think you don\u2019t qualify for subsidies. But as for Paul\u2019s description, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t seem like a screen that I am familiar with,\u201d she said.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 10: Here\u2019s the opening screen shot. This is the first thing an applicant sees after creating an account on the exchange; it\u2019s clear that you can purchase a plan without payment assistance if you like. There is no \u201cQHP\u201d button. \u201cWe tried to keep the language very simple and clear throughout,\u201d Bond said. \u201cEverything is written at a sixth grade reading level, if possible.\u201d The full process after this screen is embedded below.\n\n2. Kynect\u2019s paper application for financial assistance specifically tells the applicant to stop if you are claimed as a dependent. (See question 27.)\n\n\u201cSenator Paul and his son were attempting to enroll in a non-Medicaid plan through the exchange Web site,\u201d said Paul spokesman Brian Darling. \u201cThey did not fill out this form, nor were they asked to provide household income information online or otherwise.\u201d\n\nBut Bond says this is impossible, unless a mistake was made: \u201cAn application for coverage would need to be completed and submitted before an individual would receive Medicaid coverage.\u201d\n\n3. There is another wrinkle. As a full-time student, Paul\u2019s son is eligible to get insurance through the University of Kentucky, which has an excellent medical center. UK students already pay a mandatory health fee that covers most university services, but the university recommends insurance for procedures not covered by the fee. UnitedHealth Plan charges about $1,900 for an annual plan, or about $150 a month. So why didn\u2019t Paul\u2019s son take that route?\n\n\u201cSenator Paul was attempting to use the Kentucky health insurance exchange Web site to explore plan options for his family when his son was automatically enrolled in Medicaid,\u201d Darling said. \u201cHe has not made a final determination about health insurance coverage at this time and continues to explore possible options for purchasing coverage.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Jan. 10: Kynect provided a series of screen shots that take you through the process. If the option to not seek payment assistance is made on the first screen, then most of the remaining information (especially related to income, etc.) would not be required, because no application would be made to determine eligibility for subsidies or Medicaid. The system is designed to only take applicants through the steps they need to go through based on the initial selection or their answers as they progress through the application.\n\nKynect Screen Shots by Glenn Kessler\n\nUpdate, Jan. 16: After waiting almost a week for a response to these screen grabs, The Fact Checker received the following statement from Darling: \u201cRegardless of which option Sen. Paul might have selected on the screenshot in question, individuals should have to affirmatively select a Medicaid plan in order to be enrolled in that plan, which Sen. Paul did not do. The process is very confusing, yet they never selected a Medicaid plan.\u201d\n\nNot to be argumentative, but the screen shots show that a) the applicant can go directly to the exchange if he or she clicks a clearly marked button that a person knows he or she does not qualify for subsidies (that\u2019s the second choice) and b) if Paul wanted to see all of the options (first choice) and if he had correctly filled in his salary, it would have said he was not eligible. So there would have been no option to select Medicaid unless information was incorrectly entered.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nLike PolitiFact, we initially found it difficult to reach a firm conclusion, but we had many questions before we obtained the screen grabs.\n\nIt is certainly a conundrum that what Paul says happened \u2014 automatic enrollment into Medicaid without filling out income information \u2014 is something that Kynect says is not supposed to happen. Obviously, there could be a software glitch \u2014 but at the same time Paul\u2019s son supposedly did not take the key steps needed to enroll, so it\u2019s unclear how the glitch could happen in the first place.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 16: The screen shots provided by Kynect cast serious doubt on the details of Paul\u2019s story. Thus we are revising the ruling from Verdict Pending to Two Pinocchios.\n\nThat may appear to some readers to be a bit generous but apparently Paul\u2019s son did end up with a Medicaid card. (Paul\u2019s office, however, said it could not provide an image of it.) The available evidence suggests this happened because of an error on the part of either Paul or his son, but there are enough uncertainties that a definitive conclusion cannot be reached. Paul earns the Pinocchios because the process he described on television does not match up with the Kynect screen shots.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are outstanding questions about the Kentucky senator's story.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "There are outstanding questions about the Kentucky senator's story.", "title": "How did Rand Paul\u2019s son end up on Medicaid?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/10/how-did-rand-pauls-son-end-up-on-medicaid/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/06/19/National-Politics/Images/2013-06-13T182734Z_01_GAC07_RTRIDSP_3_USA.jpg%3Fuuid%3DhJLw2NjuEeKd9IlTRME8MA", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/10/how-did-rand-pauls-son-end-up-on-medicaid/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, rand paul son, rand paul medicaid, rand paul obamacre, kynect, obamacare repeal, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, rand paul son, rand paul medicaid, rand paul obamacre, kynect, obamacare repeal, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,"}, "article_summary": "That may appear to some readers to be a bit generous but apparently Paul\u2019s son did end up with a Medicaid card.\nSo he\u2019s got Medicaid.\u201d(Actually, unless forms were incorrectly filled out, Paul\u2019s son should not qualify for Medicaid because he is listed as a dependent on Paul\u2019s tax return.\nThe FactsRand Paul\u2019s son, William H.
