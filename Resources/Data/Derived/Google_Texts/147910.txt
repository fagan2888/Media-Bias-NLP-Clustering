One of the first voter fraud cases Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach filed after being given prosecutorial authority has been dismissed days before it was scheduled to go to trial.

The Kansas City Star reports the charge against Olathe resident Betty Gaedtke was dropped on Friday. A jury trial was slated to begin Monday.

Gaedtke and her husband, Steven, who are in their 60s, were accused of casting 2010 general election ballots in both Kansas and Arkansas. Some of the counts involved advance voting ballots.

Steven Gaedtke pleaded guilty in December to one misdemeanor count and paid the maximum $500 fine. Two other counts were dismissed.

Kobach says Steven Gaedtke signed the couple's absentee ballots, but his wife had not.
