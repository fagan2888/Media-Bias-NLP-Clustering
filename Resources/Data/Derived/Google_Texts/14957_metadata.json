Technology will increase the sophistication of fraud schemes, said ACFE member Gerard Zack, manager director of global forensics at BDO Consulting. \u201cMore and more we are reacting to reports of fraud with, \u2018how did they do that?\u2019\u201d Zack said. For instance, how did a hacker break into the servers of the Surgeons of Lake County, in Illinois, swipe patients\u2019 personal health records, encrypt the data and then demand a ransom for the password back to the data? Schemes are becoming more complex and capitalizing on technology, including some of the new technology deployed by companies in the interest of improving efficiency,\u201d Zack said.\n\n2. Technology, such as data analytics, will also help catch fraud schemes and their perpetrators. \u201cThere will be more breakthroughs in the use of technology to detect fraud, particularly in the use of visual analytics and also in the use of tools to mine unstructured data,\u201d Zack said. \u201cTools that were thought of as cutting edge just a year or two ago will seem ancient in another year or two.\u201d\n\n3. Improving information security is a major priority. More data breaches, like the ones against Home Depot and Target, are bound to happen, according to ACFE vice president and program director Bruce Dorris. \u201cThese breaches have exposed widespread vulnerabilities among organizations that store and maintain personal information,\u201d Dorris said. \u201cThere is an increasing need for information security and protecting against data breaches.\u201d That includes security from external threats as well as internal safeguards. In Flora, Illinois, the 22-bed Clay County Hospital is in the midst of what could be a case of insider hacking \u2014 a ransom demand from someone with access to personal health records who may or may not have hacked into the system.\n\n4. Digital currencies present new risks, for both companies and consumers. An increasing acceptance of Bitcoin represents a shift in fraud risk, said Jacob Parks, associate general counsel at ACFE. \u201cVendors/sellers face reduced fraud risks from \u2018friendly fraud,\u2019 where customers fraudulently cancel credit card or bank payments after receiving an item,\u201d Parks said. \u201cDigital currency transactions are generally permanent, which makes this scheme untenable. However, consumers face an increased risk of fraud by dishonest sellers, since the transaction is often not insured or protected by an agreement with a financial institution.\u201d\n\n5. Whistleblowers have more technical sophistication and economic incentives to report fraud. \u201cU.S. policy has moved beyond simply protecting whistleblowers,\u201d ACFE\u2019s Dorris said. The U.S. has a number of programs to financially incentivize whistleblowers to expose fraud in bribery, tax evasion, corporate accounting, and of course Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. \u201cThe programs are largely still in the beginning stages, but have already had major payouts.\u201d\n\n6. Financial statement fraud could re-emerge. \u201cOne indication is the effort being made by the Securities and Exchange Commission to step up enforcement in this area,\u201d Zack said. In healthcare, many recent mergers and acquisitions are going through implementation, and many are also in the pipeline, along with emerging business ventures \u2014 leaving due diligence and skepticism, old school or high-tech, as critical tools in preventing and catching fraud.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/6-ideas-healthcare-fraud-prevention-2015", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/fraud%20feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Between online marketplaces for Social Security numbers and data hijackings at Sony and critical access hospitals, catching and preventing fraud has never been more important or dependent on technology.", "title": "2015: Six ideas for fraud prevention"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/fraud%20feature.png"}, "description": "Between online marketplaces for Social Security numbers and data hijackings at Sony and critical access hospitals, catching and preventing fraud has never been more important or dependent on technology.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "2015: Six ideas for fraud prevention"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Between online marketplaces for Social Security numbers, data hijackings, from Sony to critical access hospitals, and bill-for-sham-services Medicare schemers, catching and preventing fraud is more important than ever.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89d0\"", "article_summary": "2015 is the year of technology in fraud, according to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, with six predictions for the new year.\nTechnology will increase the sophistication of fraud schemes, said ACFE member Gerard Zack, manager director of global forensics at BDO Consulting.\nTechnology, such as data analytics, will also help catch fraud schemes and their perpetrators.\n\u201cVendors/sellers face reduced fraud risks from \u2018friendly fraud,\u2019 where customers fraudulently cancel credit card or bank payments after receiving an item,\u201d Parks said.\nBetween online marketplaces for Social Security numbers, data hijackings, from Sony to critical access hospitals, and bill-for-sham-services Medicare schemers, catching and preventing fraud is more important than ever."}
