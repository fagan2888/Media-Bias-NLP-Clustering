Now everyone from Oregonians seeking insurance to lawmakers both for and against the law want to know what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cMy belief is that Oregonians need to hold people accountable for the actions that they make. And for this particular plan, it\u2019s President Obama and essentially every Democrat who voted for it. And in the state of Oregon it\u2019s Gov. John Kitzhaber who is responsible for its implementation,\u201d Oregon state Sen. Tim Knopp, R-Bend, told Northwest Watchdog. \u201cHe (Kitzhaber) needs to explain why, as an early adopter with additional funds that other states didn\u2019t get, that we\u2019re dead last in sign ups.\u201d\n\nCover Oregon and the Oregon Health Authority have hired and reassigned more than 400 workers to help process paper applications because the website is not working \u2014 and hasn\u2019t worked properly since its launch Oct. 1. Despite millions of dollars spent on ambiguous TV and other ads, the Oregon exchange is failing.\n\nKitzhaber held a press conference earlier this month announcing additional help to process paper applications.\n\n\u201cThis is about more than a website,\u201d he said in a press release. \u201cThis is about making sure that every Oregonian who wants health insurance coverage is able to get it.\u201d\n\nOregon lawmakers, including Knopp, who serves on a Senate health care committee, will hear an update from Cover Oregon officials Wednesday during Legislative Days, three days of committee meetings to prepare for next year\u2019s session. Knopp said Oregonians want to know when they can sign up.\n\n\u201cClearly, this has been a debacle in terms of the launch of a program,\u201d he said.\n\nEven Democrats who supported the law are calling for action.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of Oregon\u2019s health insurance marketplace has been abysmal,\u201d U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat representing the fifth district, said in a statement. \u201cThe current situation is completely unacceptable, and I expect much more from a state with a reputation for being an innovator in the field of health care.\u201d\n\nHe called for Cover Oregon and the computer technology company Oracle, which the state has contracted with, to fix the problems.\n\n\u201cCatastrophic technical failures, insufficient forethought and the complete absence of effective leadership and accountability at Oracle and Cover Oregon have resulted in our state being ranked dead last in enrolling folks in new health insurance plans, which is the heart and lifeblood of the health care law and the only way Oregonians are going to receive better, more affordable care,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nSome Oregon lawmakers say they saw this coming.\n\nState Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, said in his recent newsletter that progress reports by Cover Oregon leading up to the launch showed the site wasn\u2019t ready, but it was pushed to launch anyway. Richardson, who is running for governor, said he warned Kitzhaber and lawmakers last year the site wouldn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cCover Oregon\u2019s inadequacies were identified regularly and its catastrophic failure was fully anticipated,\u201d he said. \u201cWith proper leadership, planning and execution, Oregon\u2019s expensive Obamacare disaster could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nThe Oregon House Interim Committee on Health Care and the Senate Interim Committee on Health and Human Services will meet at 2 p.m. Wednesday in Salem to hear an update from Cover Oregon Executive Director Rocky King and Bruce Goldberg, director of the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nThe Oregon Health Insurance Exchange Board is also pressuring King for answers.\n\nContact Shelby Sebens at ssebens@Watchdog.org\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
