The sounds of kids screaming, water splashing and fish fighting. Saturday morning was the annual Kids Fishing Derby at Q.V. Sykes Park in Meridian.

The Kids Fishing Derby is sponsored by the city of Meridian and has been going on for quite a few years. The lake at Q.V. Sykes Park was stocked with more than 750 pounds of catfish for the kids to catch. Some of the fish were tagged and if a child caught one of them, they received a prize. It was a fun day for everyone to enjoy.

"Itâ€™s a day for kids to come out and explore the nature part for the city. They can catch fish, relax, have fun, talk with their friends and also get free food and drink while they are here today," Parks and Recs Supervisor Aleasha Jordan says.

The fishing derby is an annual event put on by the Parks and Recreations Department of the city of Meridian.
