Not that he was actually moving to that cold country, mind you \u2014 no, no, he\u2019d still be living right here in the good ol\u2019 USA, still benefitting from all those public services that taxpayers like you and I provide.\n\nSurely, you think, this has to be a joke. A person can\u2019t really do this, can they? No, of course a \u201creal\u201d person could not get away with this You see, corporations are funny creatures. For example, they don\u2019t want to pay their share of America\u2019s tax bill, but then they\u2019re first in line demanding subsidies, grants and other special handouts from America\u2019s government to pad their financial bottom line.\n\nThat\u2019s hilarious hypocrisy \u2014 but it\u2019s no laughing matter, since it means you and I have to pay more to cover their tax avoidance, while also seeing our public money siphoned out of the programs that we need into the pockets of corporate elites, who most often use the funds against the public interest.\n\nCorporate tax dodging has become both rampant and ridiculous. Take an increasingly popular scam called \u201cinversion,\u201d which is nothing but a perversion of tax law, business ethics and common decency. It works like this: By merging with a corporation based in a country with lax tax laws, a U.S. corporation can reincorporate as a citizen of that country and shift its tax obligations there, even though all or most of its profits are made from sales in the U.S-of-A.\n\nFor example, Gregory Wasson of Long Grove, Illinois, announced that he has plans for all of the above. Gregory isn\u2019t my neighbor, but he sounds like a \u201creal\u201d person. So how is he getting away with this scam, you ask? While Greg is not personally my neighbor, or yours, the corporation he heads might be. Wasson is CEO of America\u2019s largest drugstore chain, Walgreens Corporation, the sprawling, $72-billion-a-year behemoth that is in all 50 states and has stores in thousands of neighborhoods all across the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The popular \"inversion\" scam allows American institutions to game the system.
