This kind of care is often provided too close to the end of life, and should be introduced earlier and progressively, it adds.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a bit of a lottery\u2019\n\nHealth care in Canada is funded by the Canadian government, but managed by each of the provinces and territories. The result is that services vary dramatically across the country.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s a bit of a lottery,\u201d says Andre Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky you may be living in a region or a province that provides palliative care services. But maybe someone living not that far from you may not have access to palliative care. So it\u2019s very uneven and this is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThousands not getting proper care, says cancer society\n\nThousands of critically ill Canadians are not receiving proper care, says Beaulieu and that hurts patients, their families, and it increases health care cost.\n\nCanada ranks 27th in a comparison of 40 countries in terms of providing affordable end-of-life care, says the society. Only medically necessary hospital services are paid for by the government\u2019s public health insurance system,it argues. The society suggests there be more home care services provided by government as well as improved support for caregivers. It also suggests improving training for healthcare providers.\n\nHealth ministers from across Canada will soon meet and the Canadian Cancer Society hopes they will discuss the lack of services for palliative care.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dc.description": "\u201cCritically ill Canadians are falling through the cracks when it comes to palliative care,\u201d says a report by the Canadian Cancer Society.
