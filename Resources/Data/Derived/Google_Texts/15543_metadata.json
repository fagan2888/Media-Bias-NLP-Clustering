Median funded status increased to 80 percent in 2013 after four years at approximately 70 percent, according to a May report from Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services. But the report also indicates that\u2019s still lower than the 90 percent seen in 2007, and the risks associated with such plans \u2013 such as vulnerability to stock market swings \u2013 remain.\n\n\u201cSo much of the funded status is driven by the performance of the plan\u2019s assets,\u201d said Kenneth T. Gacka, director at Standard & Poor\u2019s and co-lead writer of the report, U.S. Not-for-Profit Health Care Sector's 2013 Pension Plan Medians: Time To Exhale? Last year saw higher asset values contribute to the funded status improvement, thanks in part to strong investment markets, as well as a modest increase in discount rates that helped reduce pension liabilities. But, said Gacka, \u201cso many of these variables that come into play with defined benefit pension plans are just very unpredictable.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, hospitals are looking to reduce the risk to that aspect of their financial profiles. \u201cThere is a considerable movement away from defined-benefit plans,\u201d Gacka said. \u201cWe are seeing some shifts of the various types of plan amendments, whether it be soft or hard freezes of a defined-benefits plan, or future benefits being accrued through defined-contribution plans or similar types of structures.\u201d\n\nSwitching Lanes\n\nMaking big shifts in benefits packages can take time. But some of that time already has been lost when it comes to steering a stronger course to reducing pension plan risk by lowering liabilities. \u201cThe best time to reduce plan risk is when the plan is very well-funded,\u201d said Michael Horton, senior consultant in the retirement practice for Towers Watson, a global professional services company. \u201cOver the course of 2013 we saw a significant increase in the funded status overall of pension plans, oftentimes more than a 10 percent increase.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, however, Horton speculates that pension plans\u2019 funded status may decrease if interest rates continue to stay where they are, on the heels of discount rates that have dropped about 50 basis points since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cYou want to be able to take steps to reduce pension risks quickly when the funded status improves,\u201d he said. Towers Watson has been recommending that its clients, including not-for-profit hospitals, embrace a journey plan, which dictates pulling specific triggers as plan funding status improves. For example, when a defined-benefits plan reaches 100 percent funding status, a hospital could offer vested participants a lump sum benefit. At 110 percent or 115 percent funding status, it may purchase annuities for current retirees (a more expensive route than offering lump sum benefits).\n\nFuture State\n\nToday, even as the hospital sector steps away from defined-benefit plans, it\u2019s still rare for institutions to offer only defined-contribution plans, Gacka noted. That said, Horton believes that the last five years have brought not-for-profit hospitals to the same place that corporate America has landed: making defined-contribution plans the primary retirement vehicle.\n\n\u201cMore and more employees expect that, and if you have just entered the workforce, defined-contribution plans can be very desirable,\u201d he said. But for older employees, the lack of the defined benefits security they have known in the past may cause them to stay on the job longer.\n\nHorton has seen the average retirement age increase from 62 to well over 65 for several hospital clients, based on experience of the last few years. This poses a risk to hospitals that need workers to be physically capable of meeting job demands. \u201cIf workers are staying on just because they can\u2019t afford to retire,\u201d he said, \u201cthat could be a significant business issue for hospital employers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/managing-risk-pension-plans", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1014-HFN-SP-pension-Ken_Gacka.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "There is encouraging news for defined-benefit pension plans in the U.S. not-for-profit health sector, but the multitude of variables at play means there is also much unpredictability.", "title": "Managing the risk of pension plans"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1014-HFN-SP-pension-Ken_Gacka.jpg"}, "title": "Managing the risk of pension plans", "description": "There is encouraging news for defined-benefit pension plans in the U.S. not-for-profit health sector, but the multitude of variables at play means there is also much unpredictability.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "There was some encouraging news for defined-benefit pension plans in the U.S. not-for-profit health sector last year.
