WASHINGTON – The Healthcare Leadership Council (HLC), a coalition of leaders of the nation’s premier health care companies and organizations, has honored U.S. Rep. Randy Hultgren as a “Champion of Healthcare Innovation” at an award ceremony in Washington, D.C. Hultgren introduced an Affordable Care Act (ACA) waiver bill in June 2015 that aimed to empower states like Illinois to build their own ACA alternatives.

The award presentation took place at the Council’s annual Healthcare Innovations Expo on Capitol Hill. The day-long event is dedicated to showcasing new developments in health care technologies, treatments and practices. This year’s event featured, among other displays, emerging cancer therapies, virtual reality technologies to assist veterans with post-combat stress challenges, and uses of health data sharing to combat opioid abuse and addiction.

“We’re on the verge of a remarkable era in American healthcare. Genomic and biologic research, improved data analytics, and advanced mobile technologies are enabling people to live longer, healthier lives,” said HLC President Mary R. Grealy. “To continue this exciting transformation, we need visionary leadership and sound policymaking. We honored Representative Hultgren for providing important advocacy and leadership for patients and consumers.”
