While several newspapers refused to endorse both Terry McAuliffe and Ken Cuccinelli for governor in 2013, they have no problems deciding between Mark Warner and Ed Gillespie for U.S. Senate.\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch, which refused to endorse last year, ran an editorial in favor of Republican challenger Gillespie. So did the Washington Times. The Virginian-Pilot and the Washington Post, on the other hand, called for the reelection of Warner, the Democratic incumbent.\n\nVCU journalism professor Bill Oglesby believes that unlike the newspaper endorsements or non-endorsements in last year\u2019s election, the endorsements this year do not have a serious importance for the outcome of the race. He said with the decline of newspaper circulations, editorials don\u2019t really sway the vote either way.\n\n\u201cAt one time most everybody subscribed to one of two daily papers at least and some subscribed to both. Today many people don\u2019t subscribe to either paper,\u201d said Oglesby.\n\n\u201cFor instance in the Times-Dispatch, the people who read the Times-Dispatch read the editorial page and know that they agree with it. They probably already supported Ed Gillespie, for the most part,\u201d said Oglesby. \u201cThe people who read it and don\u2019t support their editorial position, it\u2019s for the most part not going to change their minds. So there\u2019s very little indication that it moves the needle.\u201d\n\nThe Danville Register & Bee made a change this year by endorsing Democrat Mark Warner as opposed to last year\u2019s endorsement of Libertarian Robert Sarvis. Deirdre Condit, chair of the VCU Department of Political Science, explained the difficulty of a third-party candidacy and why with or without newspaper endorsements, it would be difficult for Sarvis to gain 10 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cThird-party candidacy is very difficult in the United States. It\u2019s difficult because of structural issues, how we created the third-party system, and it\u2019s difficult because of the economic funding flow which is now heightened by Citizens United that controls elections,\u201d said Condit, referring to the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down campaign finance reform.\n\nIn the following, read about the endorsements of Virginia\u2019s leading newspapers in the senatorial race:\n\nRichmond Times-Dispatch\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote that Warner\u2019s vote for the Affordable Care Act should disqualify him and therefore endorsed Gillespie.\n\nThe newspaper wrote that \u201cEd Gillespie has run a skilled and substantive campaign, one that has offered reasonable, realistic solutions to problems that have for too long festered and multiplied.\u201d\n\nThe Times-Dispatch also wrote that Warner\u2019s support for senate majority leader Harry Reid \u201chas ensured the gridlock that Virginia\u2019s senior senator so often laments.\u201d\n\nThe editorial board concluded that \u201cWe endorse Gillespie because his philosophy embraces free markets and free people, the ultimate American solutions, and because we are confident he will serve as an able and honest senator.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Times-Dispatchasked the three candidates to make their case directly to voters and open its pages for candidate statements.\n\nThe Virginian-Pilot\n\nThe Virginian-Pilot wrote that \u201cVirginia voters would do well to send Warner back for a second term in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper wrote that \u201cWarner has helped coordinate bipartisan negotiations among rank-and-file members to craft a major deficit-reduction plan that combines spending cuts and tax increases. It has so far fallen by the wayside because of lawmakers\u2019 relentless partisan sniping.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper also criticized Gillespie\u2019s plan of repealing the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHis alternative \u2014 a tax credit-heavy plan to entice Americans to buy insurance, with a pledge that those who like their plan \u201cthrough Obamacare could keep it\u201d (sound familiar?) \u2014 promises to reshape the insurance landscape. It would serve as another major economic disruption and inject uncertainty into an industry in need of stability.\u201d\n\nThe Pilot\u2019s editorial board concluded that \u201cOf the candidates on the ballot, Warner is the better choice to represent Virginia, the one far more likely to put practicality before the narrow partisan interests that have paralyzed Washington.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post stressed that Warner is one of few lawmakers in Washington who attempts bipartisanship and therefore deserves reelection to a second term in the Senate.\n\nThe newspaper wrote that \u201cMr. Warner showed guts by defying large chunks of his Democratic base to support trimming entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare in order to forge a deal.\u201d\n\nThe Post also wrote that Gillespie\u2019s promise to never compromise on taxes is part of the problem with congressional politics.\n\n\u201cMr. Gillespie has the skills to be a bipartisan player in the Senate, as Mr. Warner has been. Yet by promising never to compromise on taxes, he has taken himself out of the hunt for an exit from America\u2019s fiscal impasse. Virginians deserve better; in Mr. Warner, they have it,\u201d the Post wrote.\n\nThe Washington Times\n\nThe Washington Times said that Virginians don\u2019t want another rubber stamp for President Obama, so the newspaper endorsed Gillespie.\n\nThe newspaper wrote that Gillespie \u201chas had a successful career in politics. He was the chairman of the Republican National Committee and a top aide of President George W. Bush. He was a prime drafter of the Contract with America, the bold statement of conservative principles that helped republicans win control of Congress in 1994.\u201d\n\nGillespie still stands for the same values as he did 20 years ago. He also advised that if voters hold him accountable for his actions, then he should be thrown out of office.\n\nThe Daily Press\n\nWith high hopes for Sen. Warner, the Daily Press in Hampton Roads supports his re-election bid and expects Warner to serve the commonwealth for another six years.\n\nThe newspaper said that while \u201csixty percent of our budget is devoted to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, we need to honestly confront the need to reform those programs, particularly in light of our aging population.\u201d\n\nThe editorial board continued to write that \u201cNot only does Sen. Warner understand that, he has been among those senators leading the charge for change. He supports the Simpson-Bowles plan, which proposed a 2-1 ratio of spending cuts to revenue increases \u2013 including reform of entitlement programs \u2013 in order to slash the deficit and lower the debt.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sen. Warner attempted to stop former state senator Phillip Puckett from resigning in June, the newspaper believes that it\u2019s best to go with the \u201croad-tested and reliable\u201d Warner than with his challengers.\n\nDanville Register & Bee\n\nThe Danville Register & Bee endorsed Warner and wrote that just like they believed in 2008, Warner has been a moderate democrat in the Senate.\n\nThe newspaper wrote that \u201cWarner has also actively worked against the president\u2019s wishes by voting against an assault weapons ban, supporting offshore oil and gas drilling off the Virginia coast and the Keystone XL pipeline, according to PolitiFact.\u201d\n\nThe editorial board also wrote that \u201cSome of Warner\u2019s most impressive work in Washington has been to reach out to Republicans to craft legislation and to take up the important work of entitlement reform, no small feats during a time of partisan rancor. That didn\u2019t please the party bosses, but it\u2019s exactly what we want in a legislator \u2014 someone who can work with members of both political parties and tackle the tough issues.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Progress\n\nThe Daily Progress in Charlottesville called for Warner\u2019s reelection as \u201che\u2019s a reliable leader who can work with the opposition. He\u2019s an entrepreneur who knows how to build and operate a successful business; he was a good governor for Virginia before he was a senator. He likely will, and should, win re-election.\u201d\n\nBut the newspaper also expressed its dissatisfaction with incumbents across the board, stating that \u201cwe\u2019ve been disappointed by a frequent reluctance to debate or directly engage opponents. The frontrunners are playing it safe. But that strategy costs voters additional chances to see their candidates in action.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd while playing it safe may help a candidate get elected, it might not be the best mind-set to carry into Congress, where bold action and reform are needed,\u201d the editorial board wrote.\n\nThe News & Advance\n\nThe News & Advance in Lynchburg endorsed Warner and wrote that he \u201chas a long track record of reaching across the political divide to try to work with everyone to do what\u2019s in the best interest of the people.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper wrote that \u201cSadly, despite Warner\u2019s greatest efforts, positions on both the right and left hardened. The next two years saw the U.S. lose its AAA bond rating and the federal government shutdown for one basic reason: No one wanted to compromise for the good of the nation.\u201d\n\nBut the editorial board concluded that \u201ccompromise is how governing happens. Mark Warner knows that. He\u2019s not a partisan hack of the left or the right; he\u2019s a centrist trying to find a middle way forward for this country.\u201d\n\nThe Roanoke Times\n\nThe Roanoke Times, on the other hand, provided its readers with a detailed assessment of the strength and weaknesses of both candidates and did not make a formal endorsement.\n\n\u201cIf you would like to see the Republican agenda enacted in its entirety, then Gillespie is the ideal vehicle to cast those votes. If you would like to see more compromise across the party lines and defiance of political orthodoxy, then Gillespie is most certainly not your man. The question for those voters: Is Warner?\u201d asked the newspaper.\n\nThe editorial board concluded that \u201cIn the end, it may come down to this: Who do you trust more to fix health insurance \u2014 the government or the insurance company? Answer that, and you\u2019ve answered the choice between Warner and Gillespie.\u201d\n\nVoters will make that choice in Tuesday\u2019s election. Polls will open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nBy Nicole Czaja, Brianna Graves, and John Hussar (Special to WTVR.com)\n\nThis story was reported by the \u201ciPadJournos\u201d mobile and social media journalism project, a cooperation between WTVR.com and VCU\u2019s Richard T.
