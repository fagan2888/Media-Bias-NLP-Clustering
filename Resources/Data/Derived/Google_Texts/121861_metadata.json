Check your iPad. It turns out the popular tablet computer might contain nickel, one of the most common allergy-inducing metals.\n\nRecent reports in medical journals detail nickel allergies from a variety of personal electronic devices, including laptops and cellphones.\n\nIt was an Apple iPad that caused a body rash in an 11-year-old boy recently treated at a San Diego hospital, according to a report Monday in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nNickel rashes aren\u2019t life-threatening but can be very uncomfortable, and they might require treatment with steroids and antibiotics if the skin eruptions become infected, said Dr. Sharon Jacob, a dermatologist at Rady Children\u2019s Hospital, where the boy was treated.\n\nDoctors traced the boy\u2019s rash to an iPad his family bought in 2010, which the boy used daily. They tested the device and detected a chemical compound found in nickel in the iPad\u2019s outside coating.\n\nHe got better after putting the device in a protective case, she said.\n\nWhether all iPad models and other Apple devices contain nickel is uncertain. Apple spokesman Chris Gaither said the company had no comment.\n\nJacob said evidence suggests nickel allergies are becoming more common, or increasingly recognized.\n\nShe cited national data showing that about 25 percent of children who get skin tests for allergies have nickel allergies, versus about 17 percent a decade ago.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Study: Electronic gadgets can cause rash in people with nickel allergy", "title": "Study: Electronic gadgets can cause rash in people with nickel allergy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/13/study-electronic-gadgets-can-cause-rash-in-people-with-nickel-allergy/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-13T21:11:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-13T21:11:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cf2\"", "article_summary": "Recent reports in medical journals detail nickel allergies from a variety of personal electronic devices, including laptops and cellphones.\nJacob said evidence suggests nickel allergies are becoming more common, or increasingly recognized.\nShe cited national data showing that about 25 percent of children who get skin tests for allergies have nickel allergies, versus about 17 percent a decade ago.\nWhether all iPad models and other Apple devices contain nickel is uncertain.\nDoctors traced the boy\u2019s rash to an iPad his family bought in 2010, which the boy used daily."}
