These include forward guidance on the future path of its policy rate, stimulating the economy through large-scale asset purchases (commonly referred to as quantitative easing), funding to ensure that credit is available to key economic sectors and moving its policy rate below zero to encourage spending,\" the bank said in a statement.\n\nThe bank will update its rate target on March 9.\n\nNorway\n\nSweden and Denmark's neighbor, Norway, is another candidate to introduce negative rates, Chandler told CNBC.\n\nRelated: Why This Isn\u2019t a Typical Bull Market Pullback\n\n\"Norway would be the second choice (after Canada). But its problem is growth not deflation,\" he said.\n\nNorway has held its key policy (sight deposit) rate at 0.75 percent since September 2015. The Norges Bank warned in December that the rate might be lowered in the first half of 2016.\n\nAs of September, Norway already has a negative reserve rate of minus 0.25 percent. This is the rate paid on deposits at the Norges Bank that are in excess of the quota for sight deposits.\n\nThe bank is due to announce its next rate decision on March 17.\n\nRelated: Are Congress and the Fed Repeating the Mistakes of the Depression?\n\nIsrael\n\nIsrael is the one country for which Citi's base case scenario is the introduction of negative rates this year. It sees the Bank of Israel cutting its policy rate to minus 0.1 percent from 0.1 percent, roughly within the next three months.\n\nThe country has suffered deflation since 2014 and consumer prices fell by 0.1 percent on the previous month in December.\n\n\"Given the large and long-lasting inflation undershoot, we expect that tolerance will have to end soon and expect some combination of negative policy rates and more aggressive FX intervention,\" Citi economists led by Ebrahim Rahbari said in a report published on Thursday.\n\nRelated: Will Market Volatility Change Minds at the Fed?\n\nThe Bank of Israel will update its rate decision on February 22.\n\nOther than Israel, Citi cites the Czech Republic, Norway and Canada as the countries' most likely to introduce a negative rate within the next one-to-two years.\n\nUK\n\nAccording to U.K.-based Oxford Economics, markets are now pricing in a greater than 50 percent of a U.K. rate cut in 2016.\n\nThis is a turnaround given that at the end of 2015, the U.K. was seen as the next major central bank likely to hike in the wake of the Fed's move in December.\n\nAs with many advanced economies, the U.K. has had very low interest rates since the global crisis \u2014 so a comparatively small cut would take rates to zero or negative.\n\n\"I guess in the case of the U.K., negative rates could not be ruled out. It is certainly not our base case, but if say there was a global recession and also some domestic weakening in the economy, it is conceivable the MPC (monetary policy committee) would have to cut rates into negative territory,\" David Tinsley, U.K. and European economist at UBS, told CNBC on Friday.\n\nThe Bank of England's has held its main bank rate at 0.5 percent since March 2009. It will make its next decision on March 17.\n\nThe U.K. economy is smaller and more open than the U.S., so it might benefit more from the weakening impact of negative interest rates on the exchange rate, said Tinsley.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Bad 2016 Has Been for Investors\n\nHowever, the MPC has previously been concerned that negative rates might hit financial institutions' ability to offer loans, he added.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nCiti says the Czech Republic may introduce negative deposit and repo rates of around minus-0.1 percent or even minus-0.2 percent at some point between April and June this year.\n\nWhen the Czech National Bank met in the first week of February, it raised the possibility of introducing negative rates.\n\n\"The Bank Board again also discussed the possibility of introducing negative interest rates in light of the widening of the interest rate differential vis-\u00e0-vis the euro area and developments in domestic financial markets,\" the bank said in a statement on February 4.\n\nA possible catalyst for negative rates could be a further rate cut by the ECB. Although the Czech Republic is not yet part of the euro zone, its economy is closely tied and two of its main trading partners, Germany and Slovakia, are part of the bloc.\n\nThe national bank will publish its next policy decision on March 31.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.
