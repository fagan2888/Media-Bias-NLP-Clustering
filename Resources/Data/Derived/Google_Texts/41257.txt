Ann Coulter sat down with Sean Hannity Wednesday night to talk about the birth of the tea party movement five years ago this week (borne from and whether it still has the same kind of power and influence it did years ago, most prominently when a tea party wave helped bring in a Republican House in 2010.

And while the two agreed the tea party is still a big force, Coulter immediately went after people she believes are manipulating tea partiers for their own benefit, “tricking Americans to send them money.” She said these tea partiers keep railing against the establishment GOP with the risk of tanking their chances of taking back the Senate.

Hannity shot back that they’re just sticking to principle, but Coulter insisted you can’t repeal Obamacare if you don’t first take control of Congress. She shouted, “Fight to give them a majority, then we will repeal Obama and have Keystone!”

She concluded that there are “shysters and con men” ruining the tea party, and no one should donate a penny to them if they have any interest in helping the cause of the Republican party.
