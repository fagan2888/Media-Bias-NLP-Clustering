The videos exposed the organization\u2019s apparent practices of trading the body parts of aborted babies on the open market, and also altering the position of babies during abortions to harvest intact organs.\n\nReferring to Planned Parenthood as \u201cChild Abuse Inc.\u201d in a floor speech during debate on the bill, U.S. Rep. Chris Smith (NJ) said, \u201cSubsidized by over $500 million taxpayers\u2019 dollars each year, Planned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to death every two minutes\u2014killing over seven million innocent children since 1973.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, undercover videos have exposed in numbing candor, several high level Planned Parenthood leaders gleefully talking about procuring children\u2019s organs for a price all while altering gruesome dismemberment procedures to preserve \u2018intact\u2019 livers, hearts and lungs from freshly killed babies,\u201d he added. \u201cFar too many politicians including our Nobel Peace Prize winning President and much of the media continue to ignore, trivialize\u2014even defend\u2014these gross human rights abuses.\u201d\n\nPresident of Live Action Lila Rose said Planned Parenthood has been \u201ccaught on video putting women and young girls at risk in its pursuit of greater profits.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that President Obama has threatened to veto this bill, as Planned Parenthood spent over $12 million to re-elect him in 2012,\u201d she added. \u201cWe urge the president to acknowledge the extensive evidence that shows Planned Parenthood covering up sex trafficking and the sexual abuse of minors, misleading women about the complications of abortion procedures, harvesting baby parts, and promoting race- and sex-selective abortions.\u201d\n\nIn response to the bill\u2019s approval, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said, \u201cWhile Planned Parenthood deserves to be permanently defunded following revelations that they likely made a profit off of selling the body parts of aborted babies, any bill that halts a significant portion of their funding should be commended.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that government funds continue to flood an organization like Planned Parenthood when there are thousands of other women\u2019s health organizations that do not commit abortions,\u201d she continued, adding:\n\nPlanned Parenthood should be forced to raise their funds entirely through private donations like any other non-profit and not rely on taxpayers for the majority of their revenue \u2013 President Obama\u2019s schedule will be free soon enough to help his favorite organization raise money privately. By then, hopefully Americans will have voted in a pro-life president who will immediately defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood, an abortion organization caught harvesting and selling baby body parts, has demonstrated time and again that it does not deserve public money,\u201d said Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie of The Catholic Association. \u201cIf he cares about women and children, President Obama should sign this bill that reallocates public funds instead to facilities providing authentic healthcare for women.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp voted for the legislation, but said it was \u201cfive years overdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time to hold this President responsible not only for his failed, unpopular D.C. takeover of Americans\u2019 health care system, but also gruesome Planned Parenthood,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cAn organization that is plagued with scandal and profits from the barbaric harvesting and sale of baby body parts should not receive a dime in federal funding.\u201d\n\nThe vote\u2019s approval comes two weeks before the annual March for Life, when hundreds of thousands of pro-life activists will descend upon the national mall in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the United States Congress for putting the bill to defund Planned Parenthood on the President\u2019s desk,\u201d said Jeanne Mancini, President of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, adding:\n\nThe decision to continue using taxpayer money to fund the abortion industry now rests with President Barack Obama and Planned Parenthood. Additionally, this bill would allow for the continued funding of the organization if they agree to stop the practice of aborting unborn babies. Planned Parenthood claims that abortion is a secondary focus of the group. Americans will now see where their priorities lie.\n\nFather Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said, \u201cToday, the cries of more than 300,000 unborn children sent to landfills, incinerators, and dissection trays last year by Planned Parenthood were heard by Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no amount of Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u2018services\u2019 that can possibly justify our government giving one dime, much less hundreds of millions of dollars, to a business that treats children worse than lab rats,\u201d he added.\n\nPavone said that if Obama follows through with a veto of the legislation, \u201che will have again shown that our nation desperately needs leaders who know the difference between serving the public and killing the public.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans have sent a bill to defund Planned Parenthood to President Barack Obama, who has said he will veto it.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Republicans have sent a bill to defund Planned Parenthood to President Barack Obama, who has said he will veto it.", "title": "Republicans Send Bill Defunding Planned Parenthood To Obama's Veto Pen", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/texas-planned-parenthood-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/06/republicans-send-bill-defunding-planned-parenthood-obamas-veto-pen/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans have sent a bill to defund Planned Parenthood to President Barack Obama, who has said he will veto it.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/texas-planned-parenthood-AP.jpg", "title": "Republicans Send Bill Defunding Planned Parenthood To Obama's Veto Pen", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Center for Medical Progress, David Daleiden, defunding Planned Parenthood, House Republicans, Live Action, March for Life, Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood videos, Priests for Life, Rep.
