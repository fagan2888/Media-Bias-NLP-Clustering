The lawmakers say that this current approach to sex education has failed, and the government should better allocate its funds.\n\n\u201cWe need to get serious about educating our young people about sex. Abstinence-only programs fail to address the challenge of unplanned pregnancies and sexually-transmitted infections among our youth, which have reached a critical level,\u201d Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), the primary sponsor of the new legislation, said in a statement. \u201cWe must ensure that we provide comprehensive sex education programs that have been proven to work, instead of throwing money away on programs that don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Title V State Abstinence Education Grant Program allocates federal dollars to support programs that advocate abstinence from sex until marriage, and does not permit any discussion of contraceptive methods other than to emphasize their failure rates. The Title V funding was first attached to a provision in the 1996 welfare reform bill and has been periodically renewed since then. President Obama \u2014 who came out against abstinence-only programming before he was elected \u2014 actually eliminated the program in his 2010 budget. But Republicans demanded to restore it as a concession for passing health reform. That GOP-sponsored amendment to Obamacare extended Title V funds through next year.\n\nLee points out that the U.S. has spent over $1.75 billion in federal funding on abstinence programs since Title V was first enacted, despite the fact that they don\u2019t effectively teach teens how to safeguard their sexual health. The congresswoman\u2019s new bill doesn\u2019t mince words \u2014 it\u2019s called the \u201cRepealing Ineffective and Incomplete Abstinence-Only Program Funding Act of 2013,\u201d and she\u2019s introduced it for several years in a row.\n\nIndeed, the states that don\u2019t require comprehensive sex ed classes are the same ones that struggle with high rates of pregnancies and STD infections. A large body of evidence has discredited abstinence-only education. And many states already opt to turn down Title V funding because of the growing proof that this approach doesn\u2019t work. California, Maine, and New Jersey were the first to decline to participate in the program \u2014 now, nearly half of the states in the U.S. turn down the money.\n\nIn addition to failing to teach kids about effective prevention methods, abstinence education also has potentially serious consequences for adolescents\u2019 sense of self-worth. By their 19th birthday, seven in ten American teens will have had sex. But messages emphasizing abstinence and sexual purity teach those teens that sexual activity is dirty and shameful. For instance, one abstinence course in Texas \u2014 a state that proudly accepts Title V funds year after year \u2014 teaches kids that having sex makes them like a chewed-up piece of gum.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Nine members of Congress have introduced the \"Repealing Ineffective and Incomplete Abstinence-Only Program Funding Act of 2013.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Nine members of Congress have introduced the \"Repealing Ineffective and Incomplete Abstinence-Only Program Funding Act of 2013.\"", "title": "House Democrats Push To Defund Failed Abstinence-Only Education Programs", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/17/3077541/democrats-repeal-abstinence-funding/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_106895699-e1387310074768.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nine members of Congress have introduced the \"Repealing Ineffective and Incomplete Abstinence-Only Program Funding Act of 2013.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_106895699-e1387310074768-321x214.jpg", "title": "House Democrats Push To Defund Failed Abstinence-Only Education Programs", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_106895699-e1387310074768.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_106895699-e1387310074768.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-17T14:57:55+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health House Democrats Push To Defund Failed Abstinence-Only Education Programs CREDIT: ShutterstockA group of nine House Democrats have introduced a measure that would end federal funding to states that run abstinence-only education programs in public schools.\nThe lawmakers say that this current approach to sex education has failed, and the government should better allocate its funds.\nThe Title V funding was first attached to a provision in the 1996 welfare reform bill and has been periodically renewed since then.\nIn addition to failing to teach kids about effective prevention methods, abstinence education also has potentially serious consequences for adolescents\u2019 sense of self-worth.\nA large body of evidence has discredited abstinence-only education."}
