And they wrote 15 percent of all prescriptions \u2014 not just those for Medicare patients \u2014 nationwide in the first five months of the year, according to IMS Health, a health care information company.\n\nBut drug companies are not required to disclose any gifts, including cash, made to nurse practitioners or physician assistants.\n\nSens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have introduced a bill to close this loophole.\n\nThe poster child for their proposal is Heather Alfonso of Middlebury, Conn.\n\nAlfonso, a nurse practitioner at a pain center, was her state\u2019s top prescriber of Subsys, a powerful painkiller used to treat cancer pain. She was writing more than $1 million worth of Subsys prescriptions a year \u2014 most of which went to patients who did not have cancer.\n\nAlfonso admitted to being paid $83,000 by the drug\u2019s manufacturer over a 14-month period to prescribe the medication.\n\nWhile most medical professionals are undoubtedly hardworking people with high ethical standards, there will always be the Alfonsos. There will also be practitioners who, without realizing it, are being influenced by companies that pay to gain access to them.\n\nThe Grassley-Blumenthal bill is facing some opposition, as did the original Sunshine Act.\n\nBut passage of this addition to the Sunshine Act should be a no-brainer for Congress \u2014 unless it prefers a patchwork of state laws aimed at plugging this loophole, which is already taking shape.\n\nThe United States faces many health care challenges, including rising drug costs and an opioid epidemic. Grassley\u2019s and Blumenthal\u2019s bill is a needed step in tackling them.\n\nMore Editorial articles \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"description": "A little-known provision of the Affordable Care Act requires drug companies and manufacturers of medical devices to report payments and gifts they make to doctors.
