I\u2019m concerned about how lightly we\u2019re taking this concept today,\u201d said Hickox, who defied state-ordered quarantine attempts in New Jersey and Maine. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that the wrong people are leading the debate and making the decisions.\u201d\n\nShe said the U.S. needs a public education campaign to better explain the virus that has killed nearly 5,000 in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. However, Hickox said she wouldn\u2019t let her experience prevent her from returning to West Africa.\n\n\u201cSomething like quarantine is not going to scare me from doing the work that I love,\u201d she said from her home in Fort Kent in northern Maine. \u201cI would return to Sierra Leone in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nHickox said she plans to have dinner with her boyfriend to mark the end of the deadly disease\u2019s incubation period, but she\u2019s not sure what kind of reception she\u2019ll get. She has been hailed by some and vilified by others for refusing to be quarantined.\n\nMost people have been supportive, she said, but others have been hateful. She received a letter from one person who said he hoped she would catch Ebola and die.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still thankful we\u2019ve had a lot of great support in this community but I\u2019d be lying if I said that it didn\u2019t make me a little bit nervous thinking about people from the other side of the debate and how they might react to me,\u201d Hickox said.\n\nA volunteer with Doctors Without Borders, she spent a month at a hospital where there were never enough beds for all of the Ebola patients who needed help. It was so hot that volunteers could only spend about an hour at a time treating patients in their protective suits. They were drenched in sweat when they finished their shifts, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ebola nurse to be advocate for health workers", "title": "Ebola nurse to be advocate for health workers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ebola nurse to be advocate for health workers", "title": "Ebola nurse to be advocate for health workers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/10/ebola_nurse_to_be_advocate_for_health_workers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/ebola-nurse-quarantined-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ebola nurse to be advocate for health workers", "title": "Ebola nurse to be advocate for health workers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/ebola-nurse-quarantined-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sharp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde77\"", "article_summary": "It was so hot that volunteers could only spend about an hour at a time treating patients in their protective suits.\nTopics: From the Wires, Life News, NewsPORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 A Maine nurse who battled politicians over her quarantine after she returned from treating Ebola patients in West Africa said she will continue speaking out on behalf of public health workers.\nA volunteer with Doctors Without Borders, she spent a month at a hospital where there were never enough beds for all of the Ebola patients who needed help.\nMonday marks the 21st day since Kaci Hickox\u2019s last exposure to an Ebola patient, a 10-year-old girl who suffered seizures before dying alone without family.\nShe received a letter from one person who said he hoped she would catch Ebola and die."}
