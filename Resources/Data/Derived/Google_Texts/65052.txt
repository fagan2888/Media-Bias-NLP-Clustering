PHILADELPHIA (AP) â€” Bill Cosby has tweeted a brief message to fans following his arrest on a sexual assault charge.

The message says, "Friends and fans, Thank You." It was sent Thursday from Cosby's Twitter account.

The 78-year-old comedian was charged this week with drugging and sexually assaulting a woman in 2004 inside his home near Philadelphia. It's the first criminal case brought against Cosby out of the torrent of allegations that destroyed his good-guy image as America's Dad.

Cosby's attorney has said the charge is unjustified and predicted her client will be exonerated.

Cosby is free on $1 million bail pending trial.
