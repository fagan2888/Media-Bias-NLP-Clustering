Those powers are a legacy of Turkey\u2019s 1980 military coup and have seldom been used.\n\nErdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, says he intends to use these constitutional prerogatives to the full, effectively shaping the presidency into a more powerful position. He is widely expected to appoint an amenable prime minister, which would allow him to continue to rule Turkey pretty much in the same way as he did while premier.\n\nThe Turkish leader, who has steered Turkey toward relative economic prosperity and enjoys widespread support in the Turkish heartland, argues that \u2014 as the first president to be directly elected by voters \u2014 he would have the mandate to rule with strengthened powers as head of state.\n\nSuch comments by a leader who has displayed an increasingly authoritarian bent are raising concerns over democracy. In the past year, Erdogan has purged thousands of police and prosecutors, increased the powers of the intelligence agency and banned access to YouTube and Twitter as he fought off corruption probes that implicated the government and family members.\n\nNihat Zeybekci, the economy minister, suggested in comments printed in Hurriyet newspaper on Thursday that the position of prime minister could become obsolete if Erdogan is elected.\n\n\u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be a prime minister, there would be a chairman of the Council of Ministers. Someone who chairs the Council of Ministers, who summons it to meetings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe latent constitutional powers were devised as safeguards to allow the president to intervene in exceptional circumstances. They were largely formulated to allow the 1980 coup leader \u2014 who became president in a referendum \u2014 to take command if necessary.\n\nThe power to chair the Cabinet \u201cis essentially meant to be used under conditions of emergency. If there is a war or something,\u201d said Ilter Turan, a professor at Istanbul\u2019s Bilgi University. \u201cIt is not one in which the president calls a session and says: Let\u2019s build a bridge. That\u2019s not the idea.\u201d\n\nPresidents take an oath to remain neutral when they come to power and the Constitution says they have to sever all ties with their political parties. It also states that the prime minister \u2014 not the president \u2014 is head of the executive.\n\nEkmeleddin Ihsanoglu, Erdogan\u2019s main rival in the presidential race, has vowed to uphold the president\u2019s traditional role. He says he is against the accumulation of too much power in one person\u2019s hands and insists it is not up to the head of state to be involved in day-to-day running of politics.\n\n\u201cIt is not the president\u2019s role to build roads and bridges,\u201d he said as he launched his campaign in July.\n\nErdogan has derided those comments.\n\n\u201cSome of the other candidates say \u2018we won\u2019t be involved in (building) roads, with energy,\u2019\u201d Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara on Thursday. \u201cI ask them to take a look at the Constitution \u2026 They should look at the president\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not placing an ornament or a vase in the presidency. (The president) will be responsible for many things, from this country\u2019s development to its unity and integrity. He will convene the Cabinet when it is necessary,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nErdogan orchestrated the constitutional change for a direct vote as part of a two-stage move toward a presidential system similar to that of the United States, albeit without all of the checks and balances of the U.S. model. The second step \u2014 a new constitution that increases the powers of the presidency \u2014 stalled after he failed to muster big enough support to bring about the change.\n\n___\n\nElena Becatoros in Istanbul contributed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the front-runner in Turkey's first direct presidential election on Sunday, says that if elected he will be an active head of state who \"sweats, runs and rushes around\" \u2014 not just a ceremonial figurehead as presidents have been in the past.", "Author": "Suzan Fraser", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the front-runner in Turkey\u2019s first direct presidential election on Sunday, says that if elected he will be an active head of state who \u201csweats, runs and rushes around\u201d \u2014 not just a ceremonial figurehead as presidents have been in the past.", "title": "Turkish elections could shift president\u2019s role", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/9/turkish-elections-could-shift-presidents-role/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/08/turkey-presidential-electionjpeg-08f4f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/08/turkey-presidential-electionjpeg-08f4f.jpg", "title": "Turkish elections could shift president\u2019s role", "description": "Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the front-runner in Turkey's first direct presidential election on Sunday, says that if elected he will be an active head of state who \"sweats, runs and rushes aro", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd057b\"", "article_summary": "Until now, Turkey\u2019s presidents have played a largely symbolic role although they can call general elections, approve or reject laws passed by Parliament and appoint prime ministers, the Council of Ministers and some high court judges.\nIt\u2019s the kind of talk that leaves detractors, already alarmed at how much power Erdogan has concentrated in his hands, in a cold sweat.\n\u201cIt is not the president\u2019s role to build roads and bridges,\u201d he said as he launched his campaign in July.\n\u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be a prime minister, there would be a chairman of the Council of Ministers.\nEkmeleddin Ihsanoglu, Erdogan\u2019s main rival in the presidential race, has vowed to uphold the president\u2019s traditional role."}
