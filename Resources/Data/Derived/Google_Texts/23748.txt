â€˜Tis the season for Slugger, Santa Claus and festive holiday fun.

The fourth annual Holiday at Hadlock brought many to the Saturday event in Portland, which featured reindeer, ornament-making, free cookies and cocoa, a visit from Santa Claus and more.

Despite the weather, about 2,000 people came out to the event, according to Sea Dogs General Manager Jeff Iacuessa.

Slugger, the Sea Dogs mascot, even got in on the holiday spirit!
