Athletic director Shawn Eichorst announced the move and said Riley would be formally introduced on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt is truly an honor to join the University of Nebraska family,\u201d Riley said in a statement. \u201cThough we love Corvallis and Oregon State, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to coach at one of the nation\u2019s most storied football programs and I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d\n\nThe 61-year-old Riley has strong recruiting ties in talent-rich California and has a reputation for doing more with less at Oregon State. He has used a pro-style offense with the Beavers and has coached NFL quarterbacks Matt Moore and Derek Anderson.\n\nRiley also is known for having a Mr. Nice Guy persona.\n\n\u201cThere was one coach who fit all the characteristics that I was seeking to lead our tradition-rich football program,\u201d Eichorst said. \u201cMike Riley has a proven record of success, a sound approach to football and teaching, an understanding of the educational mission of our university and the integrity and values that we cherish at Nebraska. I have no doubt that Mike will assemble a tremendous staff and lead our student-athletes to win Big Ten titles and compete for national championships in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nRiley is a native of Idaho and a graduate of Alabama, where he played for Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant. Riley will take over immediately but will not coach the Cornhuskers in their bowl game. Nebraska assistant Barney Cotton is interim head coach.\n\nOregon State finished this season 5-7 overall, 2-7 in the Pac-12.\n\nPelini was fired last weekend after seven years and a 66-27 overall record that included at least nine wins \u2014 and four losses \u2014 every season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike Riley of Oregon State is Nebraska\u2019s new football coach", "title": "Mike Riley of Oregon State is Nebraska\u2019s new football coach", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/04/mike-riley-of-oregon-state-is-nebraskas-new-football-coach/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141204_105359_mike-riley.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141204_105359_mike-riley.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-04T10:54:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:46:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1e9\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Nebraska hired Oregon State\u2019s Mike Riley as its new football coach on Thursday, replacing the fired Bo Pelini.\nOregon State finished this season 5-7 overall, 2-7 in the Pac-12.\nRiley has spent 14 seasons over two tenures at Oregon State, leading the Beavers to 93 wins and a 6-2 record in bowl games.\n\u201cIt is truly an honor to join the University of Nebraska family,\u201d Riley said in a statement.\n\u201cThere was one coach who fit all the characteristics that I was seeking to lead our tradition-rich football program,\u201d Eichorst said."}
