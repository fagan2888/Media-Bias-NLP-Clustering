Gerry Leonard, who plays guitar on tour and produced her new album, is incredible.\n\n2. If you saw Suzanne Vega years ago, as I did, and wondered if she\u2019s still as good in live performance, she isn\u2019t \u2014 she\u2019s better. She seems to have grown into her stage presence, and now shows wonderful energy and rapport with the audience.\n\n3. You forget how good a guitarist she is. Some of the most amazing passages were instrumental, with Vega and Leonard playing off each other or engaged in dense counterpoint.\n\n4. Has there ever been another widely heard song, let alone a massive hit, written in blank verse?\n\n5. Ironbound! Apparently by audience request; it turns out I\u2019m not the only fan who loves that song.\n\n6. The food in Joe\u2019s Pub was very good \u2014 and my friends and I shared a bottle of Malbec, which I never did manage during my whirlwind trip to Argentina.\n\n7. I didn\u2019t intend to be a groupie and go backstage, but her manager recognized me. And luckily I was wearing black; for those of my station in life, all other colors lie.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141115224016, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 15, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Suzanne Vega Saturday (Personal) ( 20141115 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Better than ever.", "title": "Suzanne Vega Saturday (Personal)", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/suzanne-vega-saturday-personal/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Better than ever.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 15, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1416109216, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T03:40:16-05:00"}, "utime": 20141116034016, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141115, "pdate": 20141115, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Better than ever.", "title": "Suzanne Vega Saturday (Personal)", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/suzanne-vega-saturday-personal/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/suzanne-vega-saturday-personal/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Suzanne Vega Saturday (Personal)", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "If you saw Suzanne Vega years ago, as I did, and wondered if she\u2019s still as good in live performance, she isn\u2019t \u2014 she\u2019s better.\nSome of the most amazing passages were instrumental, with Vega and Leonard playing off each other or engaged in dense counterpoint.\nShe seems to have grown into her stage presence, and now shows wonderful energy and rapport with the audience.\nAnd luckily I was wearing black; for those of my station in life, all other colors lie.\nHas there ever been another widely heard song, let alone a massive hit, written in blank verse?"}
