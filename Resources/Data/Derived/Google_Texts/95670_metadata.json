David Vitter, R-La., finally got a vote Friday morning on his proposal to require members of Congress, the president and vice president and their political appointees to buy health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplaces without subsidies.\n\nIt passed at 2:29 a.m. ET. -- 52-46 -- on a party line vote with Republicans providing the support.\n\nThe amendment, to a budget bill, modifies an earlier Vitter proposal in that it does not apply to congressional staffers. There's still no guarantee that it will become law.\n\nVitter said his proposal simply lives up to the provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires most members of Congress to purchase coverage on the Affordable Care exchanges. Most members already do so, but per a White House directive, receive subsidies equal to what they received previously to obtain coverage through the federal employee health insurance system.\n\nVitter called that a special deal for Congress.\n\n\"This amendment would say no, we're going to live by the statute. We're going to go to the exchanges for our health care, no special subsidy, no special deal,\" Vitter said.\n\nHis efforts to curtail congressional benefits haven't gone over very well with his colleagues -- both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said Vitter is wrong when he says Congress is given preferential treatment.\n\n\"We are treated like everyone else in the country where we have an employer contribution to our health care,\" Boxer said. \"Now colleagues, you do not have to take that employer contribution. If you don't want it, give it back. You don't need this amendment to give it back.\"\n\nThe Republican Senate budget, which passed 52-46 one hour after the Vitter amendment vote, repeals the Affordable Care Act. But repeal still requires legislation signed by President Barack Obama, and he's unlikely to sign any bill that repeals his signature health law.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Bruce Alpert, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, br-homepage, br-news, br-politics, congress, david vitter, health care law, homepage, news, politics", "title": "David Vitter gains Senate passage of measure to end health care subsidies for members of Congress", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"David Vitter gains Senate passage of measure to end health care subsidies for members of Congress \", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/03/vitter_finally_gets_vote_on_hi.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/16674792-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15575901\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-03-27T12:38:08Z\", \"author\": \"Bruce Alpert, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"affordable care act\",\"br-homepage\",\"br-news\",\"br-politics\",\"congress\",\"david vitter\",\"health care law\",\"homepage\",\"news\",\"politics\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@nolanews", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/16674792-standard.jpg", "description": "WASHINGTON -- After two years of trying, Sen.
