Students at Merritt Brown Middle School will see more law enforcement on campus Monday after a student has been charged with written threats to do bodily harm and a second degree felony.

Bay County Sheriff's officials say they responded to a call Saturday night after a Merritt Brown student posted a message on Facebook threatening gun violence at school.

Deputies spoke with the student, and they say he claims he posted the comment as a response out of anger to another post.

They said he had no access to any weapons.

Sheriff's deputies arrested the student and turned him over to the Department of Juvenile Justice.
