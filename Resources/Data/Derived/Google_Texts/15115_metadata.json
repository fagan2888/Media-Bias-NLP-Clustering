Clark took an unpaid leave in January from Coca-Cola, where she is president of brands and strategic marketing for carbon\u00adated beverages in North America, to help Clinton in what Clark called \u201ca passion project.\u201d Spence is co-founder and chairman of GSD&M, an Austin-based corporate ad firm, and has experience in politics, including with Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\nA presidential campaign, of course, is much about the brand. From her slogan to her logo to her overarching message, Hillary will need to display her brand effectively and consistently in order to secure the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nThe upside and downside, though, rest in the fact that \u201cClinton\u201d has been a brand for a longtime. Hillary will need to both leverage such notoriety and prevent Americans from remembering exactly how old the brand \u2014 and she \u2014 is.\n\n\u201cLook at Budweiser,\u201d an anonymous former campaign advisor to Obama told the Post. \u201cThat\u2019s what Hillary Clinton is. She\u2019s not a microbrew. She\u2019s one of the biggest, most powerful brands ever in the country, and recognizing that is important.\u201d\n\nBoth Clinton and Budweiser are by no means fresh brands, a fact the former 2008 presidential candidate will be forced to face as she stands up the newer brands in the Republican field like Scott Walker and Rand Paul. Jeb Bush \u2014 Busch? \u2014 is the single candidate on the GOP side that may face a brand struggle like Clinton, though it will likely be less difficult because he\u2019s never run for president before.\n\nAlas, Clinton will have to convince her followers that they still like the taste of Budweiser. Considering liberals prefer craft beers, this task might be harder than Clinton anticipates.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "According to the Washington Post, Clinton has hired experts in the consumer marketing field in order to remake the Hillary brand as the former secretary of State gears up for her likely presidential run.", "title": "Former Obama advisor: Hillary Clinton is like Budweiser - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/05/Hillary-Clinton1-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/02/22/former-obama-advisor-hillary-clinton-like-budweiser/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "hillary-clinton-run-president", "published_time": "2015-02-22T14:21:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T14:21:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a2a\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton is rebranding herself ahead of 2016.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Hillary Clinton is.\n\u201cLook at Budweiser,\u201d an anonymous former campaign advisor to Obama told the Post.\nAlas, Clinton will have to convince her followers that they still like the taste of Budweiser.\nAccording to the Washington Post, Clinton has hired experts in the consumer marketing field in order to remake the Hillary brand as the former secretary of State gears up for her likely presidential run."}
