That could bring trouble to the region and, while we\u2019re not paying much attention, to the United States, too.\n\nThe skirmish at the Virginia General Assembly might seem comical to most Americans. Trying to please their Korean-American voters, Northern Virginia legislators introduced a bill requiring Virginia textbooks to note that the Sea of Japan is also known as the East Sea. Japan\u2019s government is lobbying to kill the measure.\n\nHonestly, you might say, who cares?\n\nBut like many long-standing disputes, the argument over place names has taken on new urgency in the context of China\u2019s rise, Japan\u2019s resurgence and uncertainties in the region about the United States\u2019 staying power.\n\nBitterness spilled out a few days ago when China opened a \u201cmemorial hall\u201d \u2014 really a small museum \u2014 honoring a Korean activist at the Harbin railway station where, in 1909, he assassinated a former Japanese prime minister.\n\nA Japanese official denounced China for glorifying a \u201cterrorist.\u201d A South Korean politician responded, \u201cIf Ahn Jung-geun was a terrorist, then Japan was a terrorist state for having mercilessly invaded and plundered countries around it.\u201d\n\nThe opposing views of history aren\u2019t new. Korea, which was annexed by Japan shortly after the assassination, years ago put Ahn on a 200-won postage stamp. The assassinated prime minister, Hirobumi Ito, adorned Japan\u2019s 1,000-yen notes. Korea has long urged China to establish a memorial on the site of the killing.\n\nWhat\u2019s changed is China\u2019s attitude. After years of politely rebuffing the Korean request, the Chinese government apparently decided it had little to lose in further souring relations with Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month made a similar calculation when he visited the shrine to Japan\u2019s World War 11 dead, including its war criminals, knowing the visit would inflame both China and Korea.\n\n\u201cThe competition for leadership in Asia is alive and intensifying,\u201d former State Department official Dan Twining recently wrote in Foreign Policy. With roughly $8 trillion in annual output, China has surpassed Japan to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy. But Japan, at about $6 trillion, is not far behind, and Abe has made clear he does not believe it should cede technological, military or economic primacy to China. (U.S. output is about twice China\u2019s.)\n\nEarlier this month, Abe and China\u2019s foreign minister toured Africa almost simultaneously. In an implicit slap at China, the Japanese leader said, \u201cit is easy to come in, take out natural resources, pay off leaders and leave. We don\u2019t want to see a new co\u00adlo\u00adni\u00adal\u00adism.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia retorted, \u201cAbe has become the biggest troublemaker in Asia.\u201d\n\nThe most perilous flashpoint is a pile of rocks in the East China Sea that are controlled by Japan, which calls them the Senkakus, and claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyus. This one is more than an argument over names \u2014 fisheries and offshore oil are in play \u2014 and it could flare into something very nasty, including for the United States.\n\nImagine, for example, that a Chinese fishing boat defies the Japanese coast guard and puts in at one of the uninhabited islands. The Japanese take custody of the crew; the Chinese demand their release; shots are fired; Japan invokes the U.S.-Japan security treaty. The resulting choice \u2014 face off against China or abandon an ally \u2014 is one that no president wants to confront.\n\nFor the United States, it\u2019s a classic challenge of alliance management: be firm enough to deter any aggression by a potential foe without being so unequivocal as to encourage reckless behavior by an ally.\n\nIn this case, the best way to walk that fine line is to be more, not less, present in the region. If the nations of East and Southeast Asia know they can count on a U.S. presence, they are more likely to band together to quietly resist Chinese bullying. Neighboring countries are less likely to worry about the Japanese military modernization, which the United States favors. Japan is likelier to respond with forbearance to Chinese provocations, and China and Korea are likelier to defuse their tensions.\n\nSuch calculations were behind a policy, articulated during Obama\u2019s first term by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her assistant secretary for Asia Kurt Campbell, of a U.S. pivot to Asia. Unfortunately, many Asian officials now seem unsure how real that pivot is. They see the U.S. defense budget cut while China\u2019s grows, a second-term foreign policy team focused on other regions, a mood of withdrawal in the U.S. capital. Their inclination is to hedge their bets \u2014 to plan for a world with diminished U.S. leadership.\n\nIn such a world, fights over what to call the body of water between Korea and Japan would be the least of our worries.\n\nRead more from Fred Hiatt\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chinese-Japanese tensions could affect the U.S.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/fhiatt1", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Chinese-Japanese tensions could affect the U.S.", "title": "Fred Hiatt: Rocky waters between China and Japan could affect America", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fred-hiatt-rocky-waters-between-china-and-japan-could-affect-america/2014/01/26/96f0b22c-851b-11e3-9dd4-e7278db80d86_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/24/Foreign/Images/Japan_China_War_of_Words-0bfeb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hiattf"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fred-hiatt-rocky-waters-between-china-and-japan-could-affect-america/2014/01/26/96f0b22c-851b-11e3-9dd4-e7278db80d86_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Fred Hiatt, china, japan, korea, east sea, east china sea, shinzo abe, dan twining, harbin railway station, ahn jung-geun", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/fhiatt1"}, "eomportal-uuid": "96f0b22c-851b-11e3-9dd4-e7278db80d86", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Fred Hiatt, china, japan, korea, east sea, east china sea, shinzo abe, dan twining, harbin railway station, ahn jung-geun"}, "article_summary": "That could bring trouble to the region and, while we\u2019re not paying much attention, to the United States, too.\nYou can see the danger signs from Richmond, Va., to Harbin, Manchuria: The major powers of East Asia are increasingly angry with each other.\nJapan is likelier to respond with forbearance to Chinese provocations, and China and Korea are likelier to defuse their tensions.\nNeighboring countries are less likely to worry about the Japanese military modernization, which the United States favors.\nThis one is more than an argument over names \u2014 fisheries and offshore oil are in play \u2014 and it could flare into something very nasty, including for the United States."}
