In his assessment of Bill O’Reilly‘s Super Bowl interview with President Obama, Washington Post opinion writer Dana Milbank took issue with the tenor of the interview and said it was a perfect encapsulation of the Fox News/right-wing “Obama hysteria” with questions about Benghazi, the IRS, and Obamacare. O’Reilly did not take kindly to Milbank’s criticisms and called him out on The Hugh Hewitt show Tuesday for “lying” about the interview.



After some light banter about interview prep, Hewitt asked O’Reilly if he would ever invite Milbank on his show. O’Reilly wasted no time in calling Milbank a “weasel” who’s “beneath contempt” and would never invite him on his show. And it’s not even Milbank O’Reilly has that big of an issue with, it’s the fact that he works for The Washington Post.

“I’m not on a jihad against Milbank. I’m on a jihad, a holy war, against declining standards of journalism. The Washington Post editors… had to know that Milbank was lying. And they had to know that he was lying for a reason, that he’s a far-left zealot. It’s okay to be a liberal columnist, but once you cross the line into lying to promote what you want, then the paper’s got to take action.”
