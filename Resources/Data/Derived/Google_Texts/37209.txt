After being all but wiped out by European settlers in the 1800s, the American buffalo is finally getting its due recognition: November 2 marks the first official National Bison Day, established by a rare bipartisan Senate vote on October 30.

The effort to give the bison its day brought American Indians together with bison producers, conservationists, educational institutions, recreationists, zoological institutions, health organizations and businesses, notes the Wildlife Conservation Society. They formed a consortium, the Vote Bison Coalition, that worked to pass the resolution introduced on September 24 by U.S. Senators Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota) and Michael Enzi (R-Wyoming).

“National Bison Day is an opportunity to celebrate the bison as a living symbol of the United States,” Johnson said in a statement at the time. “Bison not only play a central role in Native American culture, they are increasingly important in South Dakota and across the nation as bison ranching and interest in this great mammal have grown.”

While various conservation and tribal groups have celebrated a National Bison Day informally int he past, this is its first time with an official federal designation. The day will fall on the first Saturday of November from now on.

The resolution is framed around the value of bison to tribes for spiritual and material sustenance, as well as giving a nod to modern-day capitalism with an allusion to the animal’s “significant economic value for private producers and rural communities,” and to its environmental importance by mentioning that it can play a “role in improving the types of grasses found in landscapes to the benefit of grasslands.” In fact there is something for everyone, even sports teams, as the animal’s symbolic use as a mascot also factors in.

The sad history of the buffalo in the wake of European colonization has been well documented. When European settlers wanted the land, they drove off the Indigenous Peoples’ main source of food, the bison. In the process they massacred millions of the majestic animals during the Plains Indian Wars, driving them almost to extinction.

Over the past few years, bison have slowly been reintroduced to their original lands, including the Fort Peck and Fort Belknap Indian reservations.
