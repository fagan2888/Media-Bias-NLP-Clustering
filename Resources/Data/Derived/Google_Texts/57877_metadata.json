Ted Cruz (R-TX) with the aim of defunding the Affordable Care Act. Scarborough bristled over Steele\u2019s suggestion that Cruz was marshaling support among small government conservatives, and said that he resents being lectured to by Cruz and Steele about the conservative movement.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me ask, do these people think that Tom Coburn is a RINO?\u201d Scarborough asked about the conservatives inspired by Cruz\u2019s filibuster-like performance in the U.S. Senate this week. \u201cDo they think George Will is a RINO? Do they think Ron Johnson is a RINO? Do they think Scott Walker, who disagrees with this strategy, is a RINO?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are these people?\u201d Mika Brzezinski asked.\n\n\u201cIf Charles Krauthammer\u2019s not a true Republican, and if Paul Ryan\u2019s not a true Republican, and if Tom Coburn\u2019s not a true Republican, and if Scott Walker\u2019s not a true Republican, I\u2019ve got bad news for them: they\u2019re in the wrong party,\u201d Scarborough insisted. \u201cThey\u2019re actual the ones who are not Republicans.\u201d\n\nSteele agreed, but attempted to make the point that the small government movement is responding to Cruz\u2019s tactics. \u201cSpeak slowly for me,\u201d Scarborough interrupted dismissively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to talk down to you,\u201d Steele clarified.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not trying to. You just are,\u201d Scarborough replied.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s motivating people goes back to big government republican spending in the Bush-era,\u201d Steele began.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Scarborough interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t lecture me about what I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to coalesce around \u2013 get people coalesced around a certain idea,\u201d Steele continued.\n\nBrzezinski and Scarborough asked what that idea might be. \u201cWhy do we have to talk about spending more money before we deal with the root causes of the problem?\u201d Steele added in an effort to summarize Cruz\u2019s platform.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lecture me,\u201d Scarborough insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about this for 12 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI criticized George W. Bush well before you and well before 99 percent of conservatives criticized George W. Bush,\u201d Scarborough declared. \u201cI criticized George W. Bush while Ted Cruz was working for George W. Bush.\u201d\n\nWatch the exchange below via MSNBC:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Photo via screen grab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "A tense exchange broke out on Thursday morning between Morning Joe\u2019s Joe Scarborough and former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele over the", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Scarborough.jpg", "title": "Scarborough Lashes Out at Michael Steele: \u2018Don\u2019t Lecture Me\u2019 About Conservatism"}, "twitter": {"description": "A tense exchange broke out on Thursday morning between Morning Joe\u2019s Joe Scarborough and former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele over the tactics used by Sen.
