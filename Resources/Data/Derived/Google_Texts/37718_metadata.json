John Hickenlooper on Thursday said he wants to bring a \u201cnonpartisan focus\u201d on job creation, the economy and small business in the 2014 session after a contentious year which saw his popularity plummet.\n\nHickenlooper, a Democrat who is up for re-election next year, said one way to gain ground is simply \u201cdoing a better job of listening.\u201d\n\nThe tragedies Colorado endured this year \u2014 fatal wildfires and massive flooding, along with a shooting last week at Arapahoe High School \u2014 have brought people together, the governor said.\n\n\u201cI think there is a different sense of community right now even among legislators. Now, we\u2019ll see how strong that is and whether it breaks down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an election year. I\u2019m not blind.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper, who a year ago was expected to coast to re-election, now has a field of at least five Republicans challenging him for the job. Recent polls have shown that about 49 percent of Coloradans do not believe he deserves a second term.\n\nHickenlooper talked about the 2014 session during a half-hour interview with reporters inside his Capitol office. He was asked about oil and gas development, the Affordable Care Act and the future of education with the failure of a tax hike proposal in November.\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s support for tougher gun laws introduced brought the first wave of discontent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see us introducing new gun laws this session, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t support repealing those laws we passed last (session),\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, if there is a way to improve them, that you have some way they work better or do a better job than what was their intention, then I think we should sit down and have the discussion.\u201d\n\nThe governor also addressed the question of whether school staffs should be armed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we should be telling school boards and school districts how to run their schools,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out we had an armed officer at (Arapahoe) and he was at the shooter in two minutes. That\u2019s amazing to me.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper upset Coloradans on the left and the right with his decision to give death-row inmate Nathan Dunlap an indefinite reprieve. He said he is unaware of any death penalty bills being introduced.\n\nThe governor and the Democratic-controlled legislature were accused of waging a war on rural Colorado in the 2013 session, in part because of a new law that doubles the renewable-energy target for rural electric cooperatives. A Republican bill to be introduced January would reduce the target from 20 percent to 15 percent.\n\nHickenlooper said if there is a demonstrated need that a concession is \u201cgoing to help them succeed, we should sit down and have that discussion.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper was criticized for not vetoing any bills in the last session, which Republicans called a rubber stamp of his party\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll find something to veto\u201d this year, he joked. \u201d I guarantee it.\u201d\n\nKurtis Lee : 303-954-1655, klee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kurtisalee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "After ugly year, Colorado Gov.
