Oscar and Grammy Award winner Jennifer Hudson teamed up with Funny Or Die for a video called “Scandalous with Jennifer Hudson.” The short clip spoofs ABC’s hit show Scandal in which the lead character fixes salacious political scandals before they go public. In Hudson’s version, things don’t go quite as planned.

“Jennifer Hudson is searching for a scandal. Too bad the Affordable Care Act fixes all of them,” the caption reads.

According to ABC News, Hudson is part of a group of entertainers who met with Obama administration officials to strategize fun ways to inform young people about the Affordable Care Act. Amy Poehler, Alicia Keys, and Oprah were also among those invited to brainstorm ideas.
