ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Ashley Young scored twice in the first half, and Manchester United beat Real Madrid 3-1 on Saturday in front of the largest crowd to see a soccer game in the United States.

United remained unbeaten in this year’s International Champions Cup, advancing to the final of the preseason tournament under new manager Louis van Gaal. Javier Hernandez added a goal in the second half for the English power.

The crowd of 109,318 at Michigan Stadium broke the previous U.S. mark of 101,799, set at the Rose Bowl for the 1984 Olympic final.

Gareth Bale scored for Real Madrid, but the European champions finished winless in three matches at this event.

Cristiano Ronaldo, the reigning world player of the year, came on as a second-half substitute for Madrid.
