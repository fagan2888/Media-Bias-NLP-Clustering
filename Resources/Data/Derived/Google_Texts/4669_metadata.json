Simratpal Singh sued the US Army last week over his ability to grow a full beard and wrap his hair in a turban. The Army attempted to test Singh's ability to properly wear gas masks and operate other necessary physical gear that every service member must be able to wear.\n\nSingh, a 10-year Army officer and combat engineer, had been wearing the articles under a temporary religious accommodation granted in December. He expected to be granted a permanent accommodation after successfully passing the gas-mask test last month.\n\nUS District Judge Beryl A. Howell gave a 32 page opinion last week issuing a restraining order on the testing.\n\n\"Singling out the plaintiff [Singh] for specialized testing due only to his Sikh articles of faith is, in this context, unfair and discriminatory,\" Howell wrote. \"It is this singling out for special scrutiny -- indeed, with the initial precaution of requiring an escort and observers for the plaintiff as he was subjected to the tests--that has a clear tendency to pressure the plaintiff, or other soldiers who may wish to seek a religious accommodation, to conform behavior and forego religious precepts.\"\n\n\u201cJustice was done today,\u201d said Eric Baxter, an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit public interest law firm that specializes in religious liberty and represents Singh. \u201cCapt. Singh has already passed through a trial by fire in Afghanistan. He did not need to return home only to face a trial by Army bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nThree other soldiers currently serve with a permanent accommodation. These include Maj. Kamaljeet S. Kalsi, Maj. Tejdeep S. Rattan and Cpl. Simranpreet S. Lamba.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judge Declares Tests on Sikh Army Soldier 'Unfair' - Justin Holcomb : US Army\u00a0Capt.
