Hot Springs, SD

A Rapid City man was killed Saturday in a one-vehicle crash near the Angostura Reservoir.

Forty-two-year-old Scott Brost died after losing control of his vehicle driving west near the park's dump station around 4:40 Saturday afternoon. Brost's car went into the north ditch and rolled. He was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The South Dakota Highway Patrol is still investigating the accident, although speed and not wearing a seatbelt are believed to be factors in the crash.
