This caused fire officials to rethink how they respond to such calls.\n\nThe result will be four, two-man paramedic trucks. The fire district\u2019s board of directors has been considering using squads since November 2014. Their purchase was approved for purchase in March 2015, fire spokeswoman Massiel De Guevara said.\n\nThe fire district took delivery of the Ford chassis in July, and they were fitted with the special boxes in December at an approximate cost of $100,000 each, De Guevara added.\n\n\u201cWe are implementing a new model of service that will increase the fire district\u2019s capabilities to continue to provide high-quality emergency medical service to our community,\u201d said Chief Tim Shackelford in a statement.\n\nThe trucks will feature two firefighter/paramedics with all the necessary life-saving equipment on board and will respond along with a fire engine or as a single unit, depending on the call.\n\nUntil now, the larger firefighting engines respond to all medical calls, De Guevara said.\n\n\u201cThe versatility of the squad allows our firefighter paramedics to provide continuous treatment and care to a greater number of patients in the community,\u201d De Guevara said. \u201cThis will leave the fire engines in public service to work on other emergency calls, such as fires and accidents.\u201d\n\nOfficials say more than 76 percent of 911 calls in 2015 were for medical services. Changes in the Affordable Care Act, increased population, and the use of 911 as a primary medical care source have helped contribute to the rise.\n\nLike the Daily Bulletin on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CHINO >> The Chino Valley Independent Fire District is moving some of its paramedics off fire engines and onto new trucks.
