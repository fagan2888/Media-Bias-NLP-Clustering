Neighborhood Health has received $495,000 in Affordable Care Act funding to develop a clinic in Lebanon.

This grant is part of a national initiative that is funding 164 new community health centers with funds totaling $101 million. Neighborhood Health is the only Nashville-area program to receive this funding; other programs funded in Tennessee are in Knoxville and Memphis.

This award will enable individuals and families in Lebanon, Wilson County and the surrounding area to have access to the affordable, quality health care that Neighborhood Health currently provides in Davidson County and Trousdale County.

Services will include comprehensive preventive and primary care provided by a physician and nurse practitioner. A licensed behavioral health provider will also provide counseling.

Mary Bufwack, CEO of Neighborhood Health, said that Lebanon was chosen because there are a large number of uninsured residents and no community health center in Wilson County. Lebanon is a town of 28,000; about 15,000 are low income and more than 6,000 are uninsured.

Bufwack noted, “A clinic serving those who are low income can have a significant impact on the health of the county. 38.7 percent of adults in the county have high blood pressure and more than 12 percent report having been diagnosed with diabetes.”

The nearest community health center which targets services to those who are uninsured and underserved is the Neighborhood Health clinic in Hartsville, on Damascus Ave. Other community clinics are in Davidson County over 30 miles away.

A projected 2,500 individuals will be served annually. The clinic will be open by September 2015. Services will be provided with payments discounted based on family size and income. TennCare and other insurance are accepted. Services will not be denied because of inability to pay.
