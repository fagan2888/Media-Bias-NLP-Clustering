FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The family of a brain-dead, pregnant Texas woman says she has been removed from life support following a judge's ruling that a Fort Worth hospital was misapplying state law in the case.

A statement sent by lawyers for the husband of Marlise Munoz on Sunday afternoon says she was disconnected from life support about 11:30 a.m.

It says her body was released to her husband, Erick Munoz, and that the family is now looking to lay her to rest.

A judge had given John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth hospital until 5 p.m. Monday to comply with his ruling to remove Marlise Munoz from life support.

J.R. Labbe, a hospital spokeswoman, issued a statement earlier Sunday saying the hospital would follow the order.
