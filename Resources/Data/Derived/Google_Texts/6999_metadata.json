Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nIt's Thursday, the 127th day of 2015 and the 26th year to the month since then-House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat who'd spent three decades in Congress, delivered an emotional farewell speech after being the first speaker forced to resign amid scandal. Wright, who died Wednesday in Fort Worth at 92, was remembered as a shrewd, powerful leader \u2013 Frank Underwood with a gavel \u2013 who had few close friends on Capitol Hill, a factor, analysts said, in his downfall, and in creation of the current hyper-partisan era. \"All of us, in both political parties, must resolve to bring this period of mindless cannibalism to an end,\" Wright said in his speech, which everyone applauded but, judging by the current dysfunction, no one seems to have really heard. Here is your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in less time than it takes to read the 1994 Contract with America:\n\nLong, Hard Slog: A day after 2008 also-ran Mike Huckabee is jumping into the presidential race comes word that 2012 also-ran Rick Santorum is going to ante up at the end of the month, putting the 2016 Republican field well on its way to an anticipated 20 presidential candidates, which has got to be a record of some kind (and a total buzzkill for Jeb Bush). Besides a debate stage that's going to look like a grade-school class photo, however, the crammed field portends a long, drawn-out primary in which no dominant candidate emerges, so the weak ones think they're too legit to quit.\n\nYield: Last week, when he upheld a Florida state law banning judicial candidates from panhandling to fund their campaigns, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts may have inadvertently entered GPS coordinates into Congress's cellphone \u2013 directions on how to get to campaign finance reform. But on the eve of a presidential election in which Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign alone could cost more than Fiji's annual GDP and one congressman after another quits because of fundraising pressure, it's an open question whether Congress will follow Roberts' directions or hit the mute button.\n\nPray for Rain: California's record-breaking drought has triggered extraordinary measures, including water rationing and bans on green grass, and most observers say it's the new normal. However, don't look to Gov. Jerry Brown's office or the Sacramento legislature for any find solutions or a way forward: they can influence the political atmosphere but they can't control the weather. And as the globe warms and the climate changes, California's political management of a natural (and perhaps permanent) disaster could give the rest of us a glimpse into the future.\n\nLeft In: He's got no charisma, relatively no money, no name recognition outside Vermont and, according to conventional wisdom, no chance against the Hillary Clinton Imperial Death Star 2016 campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent socialist, has a few things Clinton doesn't, however \u2013 including an aura of authenticity and a Howard Beale-like ability to channel national zeitgeist, and that could make things uncomfortable for her, at least in the short run.\n\nYour Morning Video: \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\"\n\nToday in Obama: After presenting the Commander in Chief trophy to the Air Force Academy football team, the president heads west for a fundraiser in Oregon, where he'll spend the night. Also, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who rejected Obamacare money for his state, then sued the White House to get health care money for his state, meets with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell to try to work things out.\n\nToday in Hillary: In another campaign finance canary-in-a-coal-mine moment, the Clinton 2016 campaign says Madame Secretary will personally solicit donors for her super PAC, the first time a Democrat has done it in the post-Citizens United era \u2013 and a signal that the upcoming race will be the most expensive ever. Also, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, says he was wrong to sign the 1994 crime bill, which analysts say triggered a prison population boom.\n\nToday on The Hill: Congress is set to take a key vote on a bill that would give them the right to eyeball any \"no nukes for no sanctions\" deal the White House reaches with Iran. What's notable is the current bill doesn't include high-profile \"poison pill\" amendments proposed by Sen. Marco Rubio, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, or Rep. Tom Cotton, the architect of the Monsters of Hawk open letter to Tehran.\n\nTweet of the Morning:\n\nWell done, @voxdotcom caption editor, well done. http://t.co/XonLcNkxkU pic.twitter.com/OFfoVFi9fz \u2014 Yair Rosenberg (@Yair_Rosenberg) May 7, 2015\n\nStat of the Day: Number of Baltimore city police officers: 2,800.

In an incident that sparked international outrage, a German U-boat in 1918 torpedoed and sank the British oceanliner RMS Lusitania off the southern coast of Ireland, killing 1,198 passengers, including 128 Americans; there were nearly 2,000 people on board. In 1942, U.S. Army Gen. Jonathan Wainwright went on a Manila radio station to announce Allied forces had surrendered the Philippines to the Japanese during World War II; three years later, Germany signed an unconditional surrender at Allied headquarters in Rheims, France, ending its role in World War II. The United States in 1963 launched the Telstar 2 communications satellite. In 1975, President Gerald Ford formally declared an end to the \"Vietnam era;\" In Ho Chi Minh City \u2013 formerly Saigon \u2013 the victorious Viet Cong celebrated its takeover.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing: In 'Return of the Also-Rans,' Santorum Set to Follow Huckabee Into the GOP's Supersized 2016 Field", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Roberts gives Congress a road map to reform, Bernie is for real and Hillary will get personal with donors.", "title": "Three-Minute Breifing: Return of the Also-Rans", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/05/07/three-minute-briefing-in-return-of-the-also-rans-santorum-set-to-follow-huckabee-into-the-gops-supersized-2016-field", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1c/e1/8764744d453992456b480f235b74/150507-santorum-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Three-Minute Briefing: In 'Return of the Also-Rans,' Santorum Set to Follow Huckabee Into the GOP's Supersized 2016 Field", "description": "Roberts gives Congress a road map to reform, Bernie is for real and Hillary will get personal with donors.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "May 7, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
