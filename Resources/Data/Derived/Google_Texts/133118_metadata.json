Last year, HRI met its goal of $100,000, with several hundred walkers taking part.\n\n\n\nBased on pledges as of early March this year, Davis said \"it looks like we\u2019re going to have more walkers than usual.\"\n\nProceeds from the walk will go towards HRI\u2019s efforts at helping those in a housing crisis, whether they are in danger of losing their homes or they already have and need help getting permanent housing. They offer emergency shelter at the Eleanor House and affordable housing properties, such as the Rickman House. Housing stabilization services aim at keeping families in their home and include eviction diversion. One program, in conjunction with United Way and Good Will, tries to keep families with school-aged children housed so that the children don\u2019t have to change schools.\n\n\u201cHousing someone and keeping them housed isn\u2019t totally about housing, it\u2019s about the overall success of the family,\u201d said Davis.\n\nSince beginning her work with HRI in November 2012, Davis said one thing that\u2019s stood out to her are the people who seek the organization\u2019s help.\n\n\u201cThe faces of homelessness are those people who are currently housed but really are behind a month or two on rent or need a security deposit or are doubled up with family, and are just on the verge of needing to go into a shelter. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re trying to catch people so they never become homeless,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a myth that people in shelters aren\u2019t working ... 67 percent of families that stay at a shelter, at least one member is employed,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey\u2019re working, but they\u2019re wages aren\u2019t enough to afford housing.\u201d\n\nDavis also said that the Affordable Care Act has affected the number of hours people are working, leading them to need housing assistance.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that people who are employed are ending up in a situation where their employers are reducing their hours. The result is not only do they not have healthcare through their employer, their income significantly decreases,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may have been stably housed for a long time and now they\u2019re facing housing crisis because employers are dropping their hours.\u201d\n\nAnother HRI goal has for this year is to make their services more accessible. Davis said she hopes to take its Housing Hour, an informational meeting about housing solutions that\u2019s held every Wednesday from 4 to 5 p.m., and make it mobile.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really invested in getting out to ministries or neighborhood centers ... Wherever people will have us to take our services to them,\u201d Davis said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also about awareness,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do a lot of things, but people tend to know us for one thing. It\u2019s about having people really have an understanding of everything we do.\u201d\n\nPledges can be made at http://www.firstgiving.com/housingresourcesinc/2014-walking-home-for-the-homeless.\n\nFor more information on Walking Home: The Walk to End Homelessness 2014 and HRI, visit http://www.housingresourcesinc.org/\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The walk, which will start at The Eleanor House at 9 a.m. on Saturday, March 22, is HRI's primary fundraiser.
