Such is the case with his New York Times column last Friday, arguing that we should be focusing on the \u201cinterrelated social problems of the poor\u201d rather than on inequality, and that the two are fundamentally distinct.\n\nBaloney.\n\n\n\nFirst, when almost all the gains from growth go to the top, as they have for the last thirty years, the middle class doesn\u2019t have the purchasing power necessary for buoyant growth.\n\nOnce the middle class has exhausted all its coping mechanisms \u2013 wives and mothers surging into paid work (as they did in the 1970s and 1980s), longer working hours (which characterized the 1990s), and deep indebtedness (2002 to 2008) \u2013 the inevitable result is fewer jobs and slow growth, as we continue to experience.\n\nFew jobs and slow growth hit the poor especially hard because they\u2019re the first to be fired, last to be hired, and most likely to bear the brunt of declining wages and benefits.\n\n\n\nSecond, when the middle class is stressed, it has a harder time being generous to those in need. The \u201cinterrelated social problems\u201d of the poor presumably will require some money, but the fiscal cupboard is bare. And because the middle class is so financially insecure, it doesn\u2019t want to, nor does it feel it can afford to, pay more in taxes.\n\n\n\nThird, America\u2019s shrinking middle class also hobbles upward mobility. Not only is there less money for good schools, job training, and social services, but the poor face a more difficult challenge moving upward because the income ladder is far longer than it used to be, and its middle rungs have disappeared.\n\n\n\nBrooks also argues that we should not be talking about unequal political power, because such utterances cause divisiveness and make it harder to reach political consensus over what to do for the poor.\n\n\n\nHogwash. The concentration of power at the top \u2014 which flows largely from the concentration of income and wealth there \u2014 has prevented Washington from dealing with the problems of the poor and the middle class.\n\nTo the contrary, as wealth has accumulated at the top, Washington has reduced taxes on the wealthy, expanded tax loopholes that disproportionately benefit the rich, deregulated Wall Street, and provided ever larger subsidies, bailouts, and tax breaks for large corporations. The only things that have trickled down to the middle and poor besides fewer jobs and smaller paychecks are public services that are increasingly inadequate because they\u2019re starved for money.\n\n\n\nUnequal political power is the endgame of widening inequality \u2014 its most noxious and nefarious consequence, and the most fundamental threat to our democracy. Big money has now all but engulfed Washington and many state capitals \u2014 drowning out the voices of average Americans, filling the campaign chests of candidates who will do their bidding, financing attacks on organized labor, and bankrolling a vast empire of right-wing think-tanks and publicists that fill the airwaves with half-truths and distortions.\n\n\n\nThat David Brooks, among the most thoughtful of all conservative pundits, doesn\u2019t see or acknowledge any of this is a sign of how far the right has moved away from the reality most Americans live in every day.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "conservatives, david brooks, economy, inequality, middle class, new york times, poor, purchasing power", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Occasionally David Brooks, who personifies the oxymoron \u201cconservative thinker\u201d better than anyone I know, displays such profound ignorance that a rejoinder is necessary lest his illogic permanently pollute public debate. \n - 2014/01/20", "title": "David Brooks\u2019 Utter Ignorance About Inequality: Robert Reich", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/david_brooks_utter_ignorance_about_inequality_20140120", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/robertreich-160.jpg", "height": 110}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Occasionally David Brooks, who personifies the oxymoron \u201cconservative thinker\u201d better than anyone I know, displays such profound ignorance that a rejoinder is necessary lest his illogic permanently pollute public debate.", "title": "David Brooks\u2019 Utter Ignorance About Inequality | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/david_brooks_utter_ignorance_about_inequality_20140120/", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/robertreich-160.jpg", "height": 110}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, David Brooks\u2019 Utter Ignorance About Inequality, conservatives, david brooks, economy, inequality, middle class, new york times, poor, purchasing power", "article": {"tag": "conservatives, david brooks, economy, inequality, middle class, new york times, poor, purchasing power", "published_time": "2014-01-20T02:11:32-08:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T03:19:33-08:00"}, "description": "Occasionally David Brooks, who personifies the oxymoron \u201cconservative thinker\u201d better than anyone I know, displays such profound ignorance that a rejoinder is necessary lest his illogic permanently pollute public debate. \n - 2014/01/20"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8aff\"", "article_summary": "Unequal political power is the endgame of widening inequality \u2014 its most noxious and nefarious consequence, and the most fundamental threat to our democracy.\nSecond, when the middle class is stressed, it has a harder time being generous to those in need.\nAnd because the middle class is so financially insecure, it doesn\u2019t want to, nor does it feel it can afford to, pay more in taxes.\nThird, America\u2019s shrinking middle class also hobbles upward mobility.\nThe \u201cinterrelated social problems\u201d of the poor presumably will require some money, but the fiscal cupboard is bare."}
