HCP has taken tangible steps to reaffirm and to demonstrate its commitment to improving health services in Riverside by appointing Guillermo Gonzalez as the regional director for member services.\n\nGonzalez, who grew up in Riverside, joins Health Center Partners with nearly 20 years of proven expertise in leading government relations, external affairs and community outreach efforts for public and corporate entities. As the former director of government relations, communication and external affairs for Gold Coast Health Plan, Gonzalez spearheaded public and legislative policy issues for the plan which serves Medi-Cal beneficiaries.

These insights will support the continued refinement of innovative localized approaches to primary care delivery.
