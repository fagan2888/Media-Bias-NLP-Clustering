Unfortunately, explanations and context per se aren\u2019t very interesting. A gray-and-yellow-themed version of Wikipedia, which seems to be what the site\u2019s \u201ccards\u201d constitute, isn\u2019t enough to win a seven-figure capital investment, as the site is rumored to have done.\n\nNo \u2014 \u201cexplaining the news\u201d means taking a side on the news. This doesn\u2019t mean the site is all bias or political cant, because there are some political arguments that really are terrible, and rest on such tendentious interpretations of the facts that they ought to be discarded. Similarly, some empirical or factual questions in our politics are deeply misunderstood, so it\u2019d be nice to have someone set the record straight.\n\nKlein says that most Americans believe such misunderstandings lie behind our ideological differences, and that that assumption \u201ccourses through the Constitution.\u201d I really don\u2019t know what to make of that. But if Vox really is about fulfilling the constitutional mandate to resolve the thorniest empirical issues facing our politics in a fair-minded way, it\u2019s failing badly.\n\nThe site\u2019s \u201ccards\u201d aim to offer a comprehensive list of all the questions one might have on a particular topic and offer balanced takes about both sides of a debate \u2014 what happens if we raise the minimum wage, say \u2014 and some offer definitive answers.\n\nThursday night, if you checked out the Obamacare card and wanted to know \u201cWhat does Kathleen Sebelius\u2019s resignation mean for Obamacare?\u201d here is your answer \u2014 the news, explained:\n\nIt largely means that Obamacare is on firm footing.\n\nHow we do we know this is true? Because the sentence links to Ezra Klein saying so. The author of the card, superb health-care reporter Sarah Kliff, doesn\u2019t start by explaining to you whether the law is a policy success \u2014 she just lets you know that her boss thinks it\u2019s a political success.\n\nThis would be the first law on firm footing in American history, I assume, that has an approval rating hovering around 40 percent. Klein is right that the law notched a couple of political victories recently, but Kliff\u2019s explanation quickly veers off into trying to explain, a good deal less convincingly, why Sebelius gets to go golfing because the law is a success as a policy matter, too:\n\nThe evidence has piled up in recent weeks that the strategy [of not panicking and firing Sebelius] worked. Obamacare\u2019s first year, despite a truly horrific start, was a success. More than 7 million people look to have signed up for health insurance through the exchanges. Millions more have signed up through Medicaid. And millions beyond that have signed up for insurance through their employers.\n\nThe last sentence, you might realize, probably has little to do with the health-care law at all (and is based off one survey with a huge margin of error that Klein nonetheless called \u201cthe best evidence we have that Obamacare is working\u201d). And millions sign up for the dubiously useful Medicaid every year \u2014 it\u2019s really unclear how many the Affordable Care Act covered. So we\u2019re left with 7 million exchange sign-ups, touted as significant by the same reporter who wrote (correctly) two months ago: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about getting 7 million people signed up for insurance \u2014 the more crucial task for the exchanges is luring healthy people into insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nKliff continues: \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know how many young people signed up in March, but it\u2019s clear that there are enough of them to keep premiums stable in 2015.\u201d Those would be the premiums that insurers are worried will rise 10 to 15 percent next year, even more in some markets. That doesn\u2019t in fact have much to do with how many young people signed up for insurance through the exchanges, and Kliff knows this. It\u2019s about uncertainty surrounding the law\u2019s risk pools \u2014 where the worry is more about how sick people are than how old they are \u2014 and that uncertainty is huge. It\u2019s not enough to doom the law, she\u2019s right, but it\u2019s enough to trouble it, and the problem has actually been exacerbated by . . . the White House\u2019s panicking. She\u2019s, again, right that \u201cinsurers are going to stick with the program in 2015,\u201d but I have no idea where she gets the notion that next year will see a \u201cwave of young, healthy applicants,\u201d any more than this year did. (It didn\u2019t.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t explaining the news; it\u2019s defending the news.\n\nKlein might well be right that Sebelius\u2019s resignation is a vote of confidence in the law by the White House that implemented it, because they hit overall enrollment projections. But his site, which people are supposed to be able to trust to cut through the spin, does a disservice to readers by pretending this means very much about Obamacare\u2019s future as a policy matter. (And whether Klein\u2019s political analysis is sound is a whole other question.)\n\nThe essay with which Klein introduced Vox made the case for a form of journalism so clear and convincing that it would help us get past our empirical disputes (which will mostly be resolved in favor of the Left) and our cheap talking points.\n\nWhy \u2014 besides his weird understanding of what courses through the Constitution \u2014 is this so important? He writes about a recent \u201ccutting-edge\u201d experiment in which people with different political leanings and varying mathematical skills were given a difficult math problem. For some of them, it was framed in a way where the right answer flattered liberal political ideas, and for others, it was framed in a way where the right answer flattered conservative ideas. According to Klein, \u201cBeing better at math made partisans less likely to solve the problem correctly when solving the problem correctly meant betraying their political instincts. People weren\u2019t reasoning to get the right answer; they were reasoning to get the answer that they wanted to be right.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t quite what the study found: Yes, even the good mathematicians had a harder time solving a problem when the answer didn\u2019t suit their politics than when it did. But being better at math still made people more likely to solve the problem, whether it suited their political instincts or not. The margin by which good mathematicians beat bad ones was just much greater when the correct answer did suit their political instincts. That\u2019s still an interesting finding, though not as \u201cutterly insane\u201d as Klein says the study\u2019s finding is.\n\nThe less-surprising finding isn\u2019t that flattering to Klein, or anyone engaged in relatively highbrow ideological journalism. It suggests you\u2019re only going to get readers to understand complicated concepts, no matter how smart they are, when you present arguments they\u2019re already inclined to agree with.\n\nThen again, that won\u2019t be a problem for most of Vox\u2019s readers, since they aren\u2019t being presented with many facts that go against the grain of their political inclinations. Take a piece by Vox on an extremely popular political talking point \u2014 that President Obama has presided over unprecedented levels of deportations and is therefore tough on immigration enforcement. This idea upsets Hispanic liberals, but moderate liberals who like Klein love to throw it at Obama critics and immigration-reform skeptics.\n\nThe conventional wisdom here happens to be totally wrong. But the piece, by Dara Lind, ignores the data that debunk it and goes to great, utterly uninformed lengths to perpetuate the existing talking point. The piece does, in other words, literally the opposite of what Vox is supposed to do.\n\nThe headline reads: \u201cObama Is Deporting More Immigrants than Any President in History: Explained.\u201d Why is the piece wrong? Well, the U.S. government is sending far fewer illegal immigrants back to their home countries than it did under George Bush, as Sean Davis explains at the Federalist. Deportations of illegal immigrants classified as \u201cremovals\u201d have gone up under President Obama, but \u201creturns,\u201d which involve a less complicated legal process, have dropped dramatically. Lind\u2019s claim of record-setting enforcement is counting only the removals, but the combined result is that many fewer illegal immigrants are being, you know, deported. Here\u2019s that, as they say, in one chart:\n\nVox makes no mention of the scale of this contrast, except to say that critics of the president argue that his deportations don\u2019t count because today\u2019s deportations would once have been \u201creturns.\u201d But that\u2019s not what critics are saying, which is clear if you go read Davis\u2019s takedown or any of the Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 work on this. Anyway, she says, because \u201cremovals\u201d carry more legal consequences for deportees, the fact that they\u2019re taking the place of \u201creturns\u201d represents a tougher policy. But we\u2019re replacing a certain number of returns with a much smaller number of removals, so you\u2019d have to consider returns almost meaningless for Obama\u2019s policies to be tougher. It\u2019s impossible for the reader to make this comparison anyway, since she doesn\u2019t show that returns have dropped dramatically, ignoring their prevalence entirely.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d Lind writes, is that \u201cthe evidence is pretty clear. Lots of people are getting deported under Obama.\u201d That\u2019s a good deal less than the article\u2019s headline claims.\n\nThe other problem is with the 2 million deportations prosecuted since Obama took office. About half of them are \u201cborder removals,\u201d which, Lind notes, Obama skeptics think are less meaningful than interior deportations. But they\u2019re not, she says, because border removals are any deportations that take place in Border Patrol territory, which \u201cis not what most people think of as the border\u201d \u2014 it stretches 100 miles into the U.S. and encompasses places where lots of illegal immigrants live long-term.\u201d\n\nThis is flat-out false: The Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency defines a border removal as \u201can individual removed by ICE who is apprehended while attempting to illicitly enter the United States at or between the ports of entry by a CBP officer or agent.\u201d\n\nIf that piece seems careless, take Libby Nelson\u2019s article claiming that the University of Connecticut\u2019s basketball team has a \u201cdirty secret\u201d: an 8 percent graduation rate. It was accompanied by this chart, showing that UConn does remarkably worse in graduating its players than the other schools that made it to the Final Four this year:\n\nExcept this represents just three years of data \u2014 a couple of dozen players for each team, maybe \u2014 which just happens to make UConn look bad.\n\nWhy did Nelson use these numbers? The NCAA\u2019s most recently released graduation rate for the program covered the 2003 to 2006 cohort, which looks at players who started school in those years and what percentage of them had graduated six years later. Does it make sense to say anything about UConn this year based on that data?\n\nThe tiny sample was recruited and taught by a different coach, a comparison that\u2019s really not too different from blaming the Obama administration for poor results achieved under the Bush administration. And a little context would have helped: The 2003\u20132006 cohort was the worst in recent history.\n\nThere are two ways to measure these schools: Given that UConn has a new coach, you can look at the NCAA\u2019s much more up-to-date statistic, the Academic Progress rating. Nelson writes, \u201cBy that standard, [which measures whether players are academically eligible and not dropping out,] UConn\u2019s new crop of players is doing fine.\u201d UConn\u2019s dirty secret (which wasn\u2019t really a secret to people who followed the NCAA tournament the last few years) is that it had one truly atrocious cohort of players, under a coach who doesn\u2019t work there anymore.\n\nAnd if you look at the larger historical context, UConn doesn\u2019t stand out either. If you move to the previous entirely separate cohort, 2000\u20132003, the team\u2019s graduation rate was 31 percent. Not good, but not nearly as bad as the one cohort Nelson picked. In the 1999\u20132002 cohort, the University of Kentucky, which looks so good on the above chart, had a graduation rate of . . . 31 percent (though, like UConn, Kentucky has only had its current coach for a few years). The University of Florida, for the 2002\u20132005 cohort, had a graduation rate of just 17 percent, down from 60 percent in the Vox chart. If Nelson had looked at this data, I don\u2019t know how she could have concluded that there\u2019s a story worth telling about UConn in particular, historically or today. At the very least, if she thought the 8 percent statistic was newsworthy, she could have provided the proper context to show that it\u2019s an outlier.\n\nI don\u2019t know how a site whose executive editor is a Harvard alumnus got a college-basketball story wrong, but it\u2019s less hard to divine what\u2019s going on with Vox\u2019s unsurprising obsession with the idea of a single-payer health-care system. (Or, as they call it for the benefit of the rubes, a \u201csingle tube\u201d system.) Sarah Kliff has a two-minute video explaining how it works, and a neat longer piece on how Vermont is building one. That would appear to be the only \u201cnews\u201d that justified this bit of explaining (some liberals, of course, look at the troubles of Obamacare and would prefer that it be replaced with a single-payer system, but they represent quite a small political constituency).\n\nKlein and Matt Yglesias have been publicizing the single-payer idea recently by focusing on how it could save money, and lots of it. As a matter of cross-national comparison, this is true: Single-payer systems in other countries spend a lot less than the U.S. health-care system. But that\u2019s a lot different from saying that it would make sense for the U.S. to transition to one, or, especially, that you\u2019re going to see this work out in Vermont alone.\n\nKliff\u2019s video explains that Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan will save between 15 and 30 percent of health-care costs by reducing overhead, according to . . . the architect of Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan. The reason given for this is that the savings from single-payer health care tend to come from the ability of the government to bargain hard with doctors. But Vermont will find it nigh impossible to do that without driving them out of the state.\n\nVermont has to raise an astonishing $2 billion in taxes to launch the system, Kliff writes, in a state that takes in only $2.7 billion a year. In return, you\u2019re not going to get a system like Britain\u2019s or Canada\u2019s that Vox says those countries love \u2014 you just get a state version of Medicare, an extremely expensive system with low overhead, respectable access, and high rates of fraud.\n\nI could nitpick more: Yglesias\u2019s take on the equal-pay debate is reasonable, but by far the most mendacious side in that debate \u2014 the one engaging in the ideological denial of facts \u2014 is the side that continually claims that women are making three-quarters what men do for the same work. That\u2019s false, but Yglesias doesn\u2019t really seem to care. He devotes his effort to pointing out that the statistics do find a 5 or so percent remaining gap when accounting for hours worked, job choice, and some unexplained factors, which almost all skeptics of the equal-pay gap admit. This is interesting enough \u2014 except that the debate we\u2019re having right now is over whether it needs to be much easier for women to bring legally actionable claims regarding discrimination. Women\u2019s earning 23 cents less for the same work might suggest we need such legislation; their earning some unknown fraction of 5 cents less doesn\u2019t.\n\nA new study finding that Obamacare\u2019s enrollees in the first few months are using extremely expensive prescription drugs at high rates was reported by Vox with the headline \u201cEarly Obamacare Enrollees Might Cost More.\u201d Because these drugs are so expensive, the reality is that early Obamacare enrollees do cost more; what we don\u2019t know is whether overall enrollees will cost more. There\u2019s important news here, but the headline is all context.\n\nYglesias\u2019s video on why the federal government\u2019s debt doesn\u2019t matter states that \u201cthe national debt\u201d is $12.5 trillion, when in fact it\u2019s more like $17 trillion (he was citing debt held by the public, which excludes debt the federal government owes to the Social Security Trust Fund and therefore Social Security beneficiaries \u2014 which is part of the \u201cnational debt\u201d as in, it\u2019s debt the federal government owes). He also described inflation as \u201ctoo much money chasing a fixed amount of stuff,\u201d which isn\u2019t how economists describe inflation anymore \u2014 but fair enough, it\u2019s a two-minute video.\n\nThere\u2019s some excellent work on Vox: Matt Yglesias\u2019s take on the Ryan budget is pretty fair, for instance (though I\u2019d have preferred if he could have donned his lavender glasses and purple windowpane jacket and delivered it on video. We can\u2019t have it all, I guess). Their piece on what would happen if the U.S. repealed the minimum wage presented the academic consensus fairly, though it was answering a question that approximately no one was asking. To the great benefit of readers, Tim Lee\u2019s post on Bitcoin took a position, but a remarkably convincing one, on what the currency will mean.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to tell someone what they should think about something under the guise of \u201chere\u2019s what you need to know about\u201d something, it really ought to include . . . everything you need to know about something.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly impossible, of course, which is why most people trying to persuade you are a little more upfront about it. This new venture isn\u2019t going to do that, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t sometimes be a useful resource and a helpful corrective.\n\nIt\u2019s just not going to stand apart or herald a new era of political honesty. Or as people might have put it more than 100 years ago, Vox non clamantis in deserto.\n\n\u2014 Patrick Brennan is an associate editor at National Review.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Fri, 2014-04-11 14:00", "sailthru.author": "Patrick Brennan", "description": "Vox.com, the new journalism venture by liberal policy wunderkind Ezra Klein, is intended, we\u2019re told, to \u201cexplain the news,\u201d provide context for it.

But they\u2019re not, she says, because border removals are any deportations that take place in Border Patrol territory, which \u201cis not what most people think of as the border\u201d \u2014 it stretches 100 miles into the U.S. and encompasses places where lots of illegal immigrants live long-term.\u201d\n\nThis is flat-out false: The Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency defines a border removal as \u201can individual removed by ICE who is apprehended while attempting to illicitly enter the United States at or between the ports of entry by a CBP officer or agent.\u201d#page#\n\nIf that piece seems careless, take Libby Nelson\u2019s article claiming that the University of Connecticut\u2019s basketball team has a \u201cdirty secret\u201d: an 8 percent graduation rate. It was accompanied by this chart, showing that UConn does remarkably worse in graduating its players than the other schools that made it to the Final Four this year:\n\n\n\nExcept this represents just three years of data \u2014 a couple of dozen players for each team, maybe \u2014 which just happens to make UConn look bad.\n\nWhy did Nelson use these numbers? The NCAA\u2019s most recently released graduation rate for the program covered the 2003 to 2006 cohort, which looks at players who started school in those years and what percentage of them had graduated six years later. Does it make sense to say anything about UConn this year based on that data?#ad#\n\nThe tiny sample was recruited and taught by a different coach, a comparison that\u2019s really not too different from blaming the Obama administration for poor results achieved under the Bush administration. And a little context would have helped: The 2003\u20132006 cohort was the worst in recent history.\n\nThere are two ways to measure these schools: Given that UConn has a new coach, you can look at the NCAA\u2019s much more up-to-date statistic, the Academic Progress rating. Nelson writes, \u201cBy that standard, [which measures whether players are academically eligible and not dropping out,] UConn\u2019s new crop of players is doing fine.\u201d UConn\u2019s dirty secret (which wasn\u2019t really a secret to people who followed the NCAA tournament the last few years) is that it had one truly atrocious cohort of players, under a coach who doesn\u2019t work there anymore.\n\nAnd if you look at the larger historical context, UConn doesn\u2019t stand out either. If you move to the previous entirely separate cohort, 2000\u20132003, the team\u2019s graduation rate was 31 percent. Not good, but not nearly as bad as the one cohort Nelson picked. In the 1999\u20132002 cohort, the University of Kentucky, which looks so good on the above chart, had a graduation rate of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a031 percent (though, like UConn, Kentucky has only had its current coach\u00a0for a few years). The University of Florida, for the 2002\u20132005 cohort, had a graduation rate of just 17 percent, down from 60 percent in the Vox chart. If Nelson had looked at this data, I don\u2019t know how she could have concluded that there\u2019s a story worth telling about UConn in particular, historically or today. At the very least, if she thought the 8 percent statistic was newsworthy, she could have provided the proper context to show that it\u2019s an outlier.\n\nI don\u2019t know how a site whose executive editor is a Harvard alumnus got a college-basketball story wrong, but it\u2019s less hard to divine what\u2019s going on with Vox\u2019s unsurprising obsession with the idea of a single-payer health-care system. (Or, as they call it for the benefit of the rubes, a \u201csingle tube\u201d system.) Sarah Kliff has a two-minute video explaining how it works, and a neat longer piece on how Vermont is building one. That would appear to be the only \u201cnews\u201d that justified this bit of explaining (some liberals, of course, look at the troubles of Obamacare and would prefer that it be replaced with a single-payer system, but they represent quite a small political constituency).\n\nKlein and Matt Yglesias have been publicizing the single-payer idea recently by focusing on how it could save money, and lots of it. As a matter of cross-national comparison, this is true: Single-payer systems in other countries spend a lot less than the U.S. health-care system. But that\u2019s a lot different from saying that it would make sense for the U.S. to transition to one, or, especially, that you\u2019re going to see this work out in Vermont alone.\n\nKliff\u2019s video explains that Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan will save between 15 and 30 percent of health-care costs by reducing overhead, according to\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the architect of Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan. The reason given for this is that the savings from single-payer health care tend to come from the ability of the government to bargain hard with doctors. But Vermont will find it nigh impossible to do that without driving them out of the state.\n\nVermont has to raise an astonishing $2 billion in taxes to launch the system, Kliff writes, in a state that takes in only $2.7 billion a year. In return, you\u2019re not going to get a system like Britain\u2019s or Canada\u2019s that Vox says those countries love \u2014 you just get a state version of Medicare, an extremely expensive system with low overhead, respectable access, and high rates of fraud.\n\nI could nitpick more: Yglesias\u2019s take on the equal-pay debate is reasonable, but by far the most mendacious side in that debate \u2014 the one engaging in the ideological denial of facts \u2014 is the side that continually claims that women are making three-quarters what men do for the same work. That\u2019s false, but Yglesias doesn\u2019t really seem to care. He devotes his effort to pointing out that the statistics do find a 5 or so percent remaining gap when accounting for hours worked, job choice, and some unexplained factors, which almost all skeptics of the equal-pay gap admit. This is interesting enough \u2014 except that the debate we\u2019re having right now is over whether it needs to be much easier for women to bring legally actionable claims regarding discrimination. Women\u2019s earning 23 cents less for the same work might suggest we need such legislation; their earning some unknown fraction of 5 cents less doesn\u2019t.\n\nA new study finding that Obamacare\u2019s enrollees in the first few months are using extremely expensive prescription drugs at high rates was reported by Vox with the headline \u201cEarly Obamacare Enrollees Might Cost More.\u201d Because these drugs are so expensive, the reality is that early Obamacare enrollees do cost more; what we don\u2019t know is whether overall enrollees will cost more. There\u2019s important news here, but the headline is all context.#page#\n\nYglesias\u2019s video on why the federal government\u2019s debt doesn\u2019t matter states that \u201cthe national debt\u201d is $12.5 trillion, when in fact it\u2019s more like $17 trillion (he was citing debt held by the public, which excludes debt the federal government owes to the Social Security Trust Fund and therefore Social Security beneficiaries \u2014 which is part of the \u201cnational debt\u201d as in, it\u2019s debt the federal government owes). He also described inflation as \u201ctoo much money chasing a fixed amount of stuff,\u201d which isn\u2019t how economists describe inflation anymore \u2014 but fair enough, it\u2019s a two-minute video.#ad#\n\nThere\u2019s some excellent work on Vox: Matt Yglesias\u2019s take on the Ryan budget is pretty fair, for instance (though I\u2019d have preferred if he could have donned his lavender glasses and purple windowpane jacket and delivered it on video. We can\u2019t have it all, I guess). Their piece on what would happen if the U.S. repealed the minimum wage presented the academic consensus fairly, though it was answering a question that approximately no one was asking. To the great benefit of readers, Tim Lee\u2019s post on Bitcoin took a position, but a remarkably convincing one, on what the currency will mean.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to tell someone what they should think about something under the guise of \u201chere\u2019s what you need to know about\u201d something, it really ought to include\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0everything you need to know about something.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly impossible, of course, which is why most people trying to persuade you are a little more upfront about it. This new venture isn\u2019t going to do that, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t sometimes be a useful resource and a helpful corrective.\n\nIt\u2019s just not going to stand apart or herald a new era of political honesty. Or as people might have put it more than 100 years ago, Vox non clamantis in deserto.\n\n\u2014 Patrick Brennan is an associate editor at\u00a0National Review.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "| National Review", "og": {"site_name": "National Review Online", "description": "Vox.com, the new journalism venture by liberal policy wunderkind Ezra Klein, is intended, we\u2019re told, to \u201cexplain the news,\u201d provide context for it. Unfortunately, explanations and context per se aren\u2019t very interesting. A gray-and-yellow-themed version of Wikipedia, which seems to be what the site\u2019s \u201ccards\u201d constitute, isn\u2019t enough to win a seven-figure capital investment, as the site is rumored to have done.\n\nNo \u2014 \u201cexplaining the news\u201d means taking a side on the news. This doesn\u2019t mean the site is all bias or political cant, because there are some political arguments that really are terrible, and rest on such tendentious interpretations of the facts that they ought to be discarded. Similarly, some empirical or factual questions in our politics are deeply misunderstood, so it\u2019d be nice to have someone set the record straight.#ad#\n\nKlein says that most Americans believe such misunderstandings lie behind our ideological differences, and that that assumption \u201ccourses through the Constitution.\u201d I really don\u2019t know what to make of that. But if Vox really is about fulfilling the constitutional mandate to resolve the thorniest empirical issues facing our politics in a fair-minded way, it\u2019s failing badly.\n\nThe site\u2019s \u201ccards\u201d aim to offer a comprehensive list of all the questions one might have on a particular topic and offer balanced takes about both sides of a debate \u2014 what happens if we raise the minimum wage, say \u2014 and some offer definitive answers.\n\nThursday night, if you checked out the Obamacare card and wanted to know\u00a0\u201cWhat does Kathleen Sebelius\u2019s resignation mean for Obamacare?\u201d here is your answer \u2014 the news, explained:\n\n\nIt largely means that Obamacare is on firm footing.\n\n\nHow we do we know this is true? Because the sentence links to Ezra Klein saying so. The author of the card, superb health-care reporter Sarah Kliff, doesn\u2019t start by explaining to you whether the law is a policy success \u2014 she just lets you know that her boss thinks it\u2019s a political success.\n\nThis would be the first law on firm footing in American history, I assume, that has an approval rating hovering around 40 percent. Klein is right that the law notched a couple of political victories recently, but Kliff\u2019s explanation quickly veers off into trying to explain, a good deal less convincingly, why Sebelius gets to go golfing because the law is a success as a policy matter, too:\n\n\nThe evidence has piled up in recent weeks that the strategy [of not panicking and firing Sebelius] worked. Obamacare\u2019s first year, despite a truly horrific start, was a success. More than 7 million people look to have signed up for health insurance through the exchanges. Millions more have signed up through Medicaid. And millions beyond that have signed up for insurance through their employers.\u00a0\n\n\nThe last sentence, you might realize, probably has little to do with the health-care law at all (and is based off one survey with a huge margin of error that Klein nonetheless called \u201cthe best evidence we have that Obamacare is working\u201d). And millions sign up for the dubiously useful Medicaid every year \u2014 it\u2019s really unclear how many the Affordable Care Act covered. So we\u2019re left with 7 million exchange sign-ups, touted as significant by the same reporter who wrote (correctly) two months ago: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about getting 7 million people signed up for insurance \u2014 the more crucial task for the exchanges is luring healthy people into insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nKliff continues: \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know how many young people signed up in March, but it\u2019s clear that there are enough of them to keep premiums stable in 2015.\u201d Those would be the premiums that insurers are worried will rise 10 to 15 percent next year, even more in some markets. That doesn\u2019t in fact have much to do with how many young people signed up for insurance through the exchanges, and Kliff knows this. It\u2019s about uncertainty surrounding the law\u2019s risk pools \u2014 where the worry is more about how sick people are than how old they are \u2014 and that uncertainty is huge. It\u2019s not enough to doom the law, she\u2019s right, but it\u2019s enough to trouble it, and the problem has actually been exacerbated by\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the White House\u2019s panicking. She\u2019s, again, right that \u201cinsurers are going to stick with the program in 2015,\u201d but I have no idea where she gets the notion that next year will see a \u201cwave of young, healthy applicants,\u201d any more than this year did. (It didn\u2019t.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t explaining the news; it\u2019s defending the news.#page#\n\nKlein might well be right that Sebelius\u2019s resignation is a vote of confidence in the law by the White House that implemented it, because they hit overall enrollment projections. But his site, which people are supposed to be able to trust to cut through the spin, does a disservice to readers by pretending this means very much about Obamacare\u2019s future as a policy matter. (And whether Klein\u2019s political analysis is sound is a whole other question.)\n\nThe essay with which Klein introduced Vox made the case for a form of journalism so clear and convincing that it would help us get past our empirical disputes (which will mostly be resolved in favor of the Left) and our cheap talking points.#ad#\n\nWhy \u2014 besides his weird understanding of what courses through the Constitution \u2014 is this so important? He writes about a recent \u201ccutting-edge\u201d experiment in which people with different political leanings and varying mathematical skills were given a difficult math problem. For some of them, it was framed in a way where the right answer flattered liberal political ideas, and for others, it was framed in a way where the right answer flattered conservative ideas. According to Klein, \u201cBeing better at math made partisans less likely to solve the problem correctly when solving the problem correctly meant betraying their political instincts. People weren\u2019t reasoning to get the right answer; they were reasoning to get the answer that they wanted to be right.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t quite what the study found: Yes, even the good mathematicians had a harder time solving a problem when the answer didn\u2019t suit their politics than when it did. But being better at math still made people more likely to solve the problem, whether it suited their political instincts or not. The margin by which good mathematicians beat bad ones was just much greater when the correct answer did suit their political instincts. That\u2019s still an interesting finding, though not as \u201cutterly insane\u201d as Klein says the study\u2019s finding is.\n\nThe less-surprising finding isn\u2019t that flattering to Klein, or anyone engaged in relatively highbrow ideological journalism. It suggests you\u2019re only going to get readers to understand complicated concepts, no matter how smart they are, when you present arguments they\u2019re already inclined to agree with.\n\nThen again, that won\u2019t be a problem for most of Vox\u2019s readers, since they aren\u2019t being presented with many facts that go against the grain of their political inclinations. Take a piece by Vox on an extremely popular political talking point \u2014 that President Obama has presided over unprecedented levels of deportations and is therefore tough on immigration enforcement. This idea upsets Hispanic liberals, but moderate liberals who like Klein love to throw it at Obama critics and immigration-reform skeptics.\n\nThe conventional wisdom here happens to be totally wrong. But the piece, by Dara Lind, ignores the data that debunk it and goes to great, utterly uninformed lengths to perpetuate the existing talking point. The piece does, in other words, literally the opposite of what Vox is supposed to do.\n\nThe headline reads: \u201cObama Is Deporting More Immigrants than Any President in History: Explained.\u201d Why is the piece wrong? Well, the U.S. government is sending far fewer illegal immigrants back to their home countries than it did under George Bush, as Sean Davis explains at the Federalist. Deportations of illegal immigrants\u00a0classified as \u201cremovals\u201d have gone up under President Obama, but \u201creturns,\u201d which involve a less complicated legal process, have dropped dramatically. Lind\u2019s claim of record-setting enforcement is counting only the removals, but the combined result is that many fewer illegal immigrants are being, you know, deported. Here\u2019s that, as they say, in one chart:\n\n\n\nVox makes no mention of the scale of this contrast, except to say that critics of the president argue that his deportations don\u2019t count because today\u2019s deportations would once have been \u201creturns.\u201d But that\u2019s not what critics are saying, which is clear if you go read Davis\u2019s takedown or any of the Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 work on this. Anyway, she says, because \u201cremovals\u201d carry more legal consequences for deportees, the fact that they\u2019re taking the place of \u201creturns\u201d represents a tougher policy. \u00a0But we\u2019re replacing a certain number of returns with a much smaller number of removals, so you\u2019d have to consider returns almost meaningless for Obama\u2019s policies to be tougher. It\u2019s impossible for the reader to make this comparison anyway, since she doesn\u2019t show that returns have dropped dramatically, ignoring their prevalence entirely.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d Lind writes, is that \u201cthe evidence is pretty clear. Lots of people are getting deported under Obama.\u201d That\u2019s a good deal less than the article\u2019s headline claims.\n\nThe other problem is with the 2 million deportations prosecuted since Obama took office. About half of them are \u201cborder removals,\u201d which, Lind notes, Obama skeptics think are less meaningful than interior deportations. But they\u2019re not, she says, because border removals are any deportations that take place in Border Patrol territory, which \u201cis not what most people think of as the border\u201d \u2014 it stretches 100 miles into the U.S. and encompasses places where lots of illegal immigrants live long-term.\u201d\n\nThis is flat-out false: The Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency defines a border removal as \u201can individual removed by ICE who is apprehended while attempting to illicitly enter the United States at or between the ports of entry by a CBP officer or agent.\u201d#page#\n\nIf that piece seems careless, take Libby Nelson\u2019s article claiming that the University of Connecticut\u2019s basketball team has a \u201cdirty secret\u201d: an 8 percent graduation rate.

Or as people might have put it more than 100 years ago, Vox non clamantis in deserto.\n\n\u2014 Patrick Brennan is an associate editor at\u00a0National Review.", "title": "Vox: Explained", "url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/375600/vox-explained-patrick-brennan", "image": "http://c8.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_related_041114_SM_Vox-Explained-Ezra-Klein_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/375600/vox-explained-patrick-brennan", "image": "http://c1.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_giant_041114_SM_Vox-Explained-Ezra-Klein3.jpg", "description": "Vox.com, the new journalism venture by liberal policy wunderkind Ezra Klein, is intended, we\u2019re told, to \u201cexplain the news,\u201d provide context for it. Unfortunately, explanations and context per se aren\u2019t very interesting. A gray-and-yellow-themed version of Wikipedia, which seems to be what the site\u2019s \u201ccards\u201d constitute, isn\u2019t enough to win a seven-figure capital investment, as the site is rumored to have done.\n\nNo \u2014 \u201cexplaining the news\u201d means taking a side on the news. This doesn\u2019t mean the site is all bias or political cant, because there are some political arguments that really are terrible, and rest on such tendentious interpretations of the facts that they ought to be discarded. Similarly, some empirical or factual questions in our politics are deeply misunderstood, so it\u2019d be nice to have someone set the record straight.#ad#\n\nKlein says that most Americans believe such misunderstandings lie behind our ideological differences, and that that assumption \u201ccourses through the Constitution.\u201d I really don\u2019t know what to make of that. But if Vox really is about fulfilling the constitutional mandate to resolve the thorniest empirical issues facing our politics in a fair-minded way, it\u2019s failing badly.\n\nThe site\u2019s \u201ccards\u201d aim to offer a comprehensive list of all the questions one might have on a particular topic and offer balanced takes about both sides of a debate \u2014 what happens if we raise the minimum wage, say \u2014 and some offer definitive answers.\n\nThursday night, if you checked out the Obamacare card and wanted to know\u00a0\u201cWhat does Kathleen Sebelius\u2019s resignation mean for Obamacare?\u201d here is your answer \u2014 the news, explained:\n\n\nIt largely means that Obamacare is on firm footing.\n\n\nHow we do we know this is true? Because the sentence links to Ezra Klein saying so. The author of the card, superb health-care reporter Sarah Kliff, doesn\u2019t start by explaining to you whether the law is a policy success \u2014 she just lets you know that her boss thinks it\u2019s a political success.\n\nThis would be the first law on firm footing in American history, I assume, that has an approval rating hovering around 40 percent. Klein is right that the law notched a couple of political victories recently, but Kliff\u2019s explanation quickly veers off into trying to explain, a good deal less convincingly, why Sebelius gets to go golfing because the law is a success as a policy matter, too:\n\n\nThe evidence has piled up in recent weeks that the strategy [of not panicking and firing Sebelius] worked. Obamacare\u2019s first year, despite a truly horrific start, was a success. More than 7 million people look to have signed up for health insurance through the exchanges. Millions more have signed up through Medicaid. And millions beyond that have signed up for insurance through their employers.\u00a0\n\n\nThe last sentence, you might realize, probably has little to do with the health-care law at all (and is based off one survey with a huge margin of error that Klein nonetheless called \u201cthe best evidence we have that Obamacare is working\u201d). And millions sign up for the dubiously useful Medicaid every year \u2014 it\u2019s really unclear how many the Affordable Care Act covered. So we\u2019re left with 7 million exchange sign-ups, touted as significant by the same reporter who wrote (correctly) two months ago: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about getting 7 million people signed up for insurance \u2014 the more crucial task for the exchanges is luring healthy people into insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nKliff continues: \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know how many young people signed up in March, but it\u2019s clear that there are enough of them to keep premiums stable in 2015.\u201d Those would be the premiums that insurers are worried will rise 10 to 15 percent next year, even more in some markets. That doesn\u2019t in fact have much to do with how many young people signed up for insurance through the exchanges, and Kliff knows this. It\u2019s about uncertainty surrounding the law\u2019s risk pools \u2014 where the worry is more about how sick people are than how old they are \u2014 and that uncertainty is huge. It\u2019s not enough to doom the law, she\u2019s right, but it\u2019s enough to trouble it, and the problem has actually been exacerbated by\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the White House\u2019s panicking. She\u2019s, again, right that \u201cinsurers are going to stick with the program in 2015,\u201d but I have no idea where she gets the notion that next year will see a \u201cwave of young, healthy applicants,\u201d any more than this year did. (It didn\u2019t.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t explaining the news; it\u2019s defending the news.#page#\n\nKlein might well be right that Sebelius\u2019s resignation is a vote of confidence in the law by the White House that implemented it, because they hit overall enrollment projections. But his site, which people are supposed to be able to trust to cut through the spin, does a disservice to readers by pretending this means very much about Obamacare\u2019s future as a policy matter. (And whether Klein\u2019s political analysis is sound is a whole other question.)\n\nThe essay with which Klein introduced Vox made the case for a form of journalism so clear and convincing that it would help us get past our empirical disputes (which will mostly be resolved in favor of the Left) and our cheap talking points.#ad#\n\nWhy \u2014 besides his weird understanding of what courses through the Constitution \u2014 is this so important? He writes about a recent \u201ccutting-edge\u201d experiment in which people with different political leanings and varying mathematical skills were given a difficult math problem. For some of them, it was framed in a way where the right answer flattered liberal political ideas, and for others, it was framed in a way where the right answer flattered conservative ideas. According to Klein, \u201cBeing better at math made partisans less likely to solve the problem correctly when solving the problem correctly meant betraying their political instincts. People weren\u2019t reasoning to get the right answer; they were reasoning to get the answer that they wanted to be right.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t quite what the study found: Yes, even the good mathematicians had a harder time solving a problem when the answer didn\u2019t suit their politics than when it did. But being better at math still made people more likely to solve the problem, whether it suited their political instincts or not. The margin by which good mathematicians beat bad ones was just much greater when the correct answer did suit their political instincts. That\u2019s still an interesting finding, though not as \u201cutterly insane\u201d as Klein says the study\u2019s finding is.\n\nThe less-surprising finding isn\u2019t that flattering to Klein, or anyone engaged in relatively highbrow ideological journalism. It suggests you\u2019re only going to get readers to understand complicated concepts, no matter how smart they are, when you present arguments they\u2019re already inclined to agree with.\n\nThen again, that won\u2019t be a problem for most of Vox\u2019s readers, since they aren\u2019t being presented with many facts that go against the grain of their political inclinations. Take a piece by Vox on an extremely popular political talking point \u2014 that President Obama has presided over unprecedented levels of deportations and is therefore tough on immigration enforcement. This idea upsets Hispanic liberals, but moderate liberals who like Klein love to throw it at Obama critics and immigration-reform skeptics.\n\nThe conventional wisdom here happens to be totally wrong. But the piece, by Dara Lind, ignores the data that debunk it and goes to great, utterly uninformed lengths to perpetuate the existing talking point. The piece does, in other words, literally the opposite of what Vox is supposed to do.\n\nThe headline reads: \u201cObama Is Deporting More Immigrants than Any President in History: Explained.\u201d Why is the piece wrong? Well, the U.S. government is sending far fewer illegal immigrants back to their home countries than it did under George Bush, as Sean Davis explains at the Federalist. Deportations of illegal immigrants\u00a0classified as \u201cremovals\u201d have gone up under President Obama, but \u201creturns,\u201d which involve a less complicated legal process, have dropped dramatically. Lind\u2019s claim of record-setting enforcement is counting only the removals, but the combined result is that many fewer illegal immigrants are being, you know, deported. Here\u2019s that, as they say, in one chart:\n\n\n\nVox makes no mention of the scale of this contrast, except to say that critics of the president argue that his deportations don\u2019t count because today\u2019s deportations would once have been \u201creturns.\u201d But that\u2019s not what critics are saying, which is clear if you go read Davis\u2019s takedown or any of the Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 work on this. Anyway, she says, because \u201cremovals\u201d carry more legal consequences for deportees, the fact that they\u2019re taking the place of \u201creturns\u201d represents a tougher policy. \u00a0But we\u2019re replacing a certain number of returns with a much smaller number of removals, so you\u2019d have to consider returns almost meaningless for Obama\u2019s policies to be tougher. It\u2019s impossible for the reader to make this comparison anyway, since she doesn\u2019t show that returns have dropped dramatically, ignoring their prevalence entirely.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d Lind writes, is that \u201cthe evidence is pretty clear. Lots of people are getting deported under Obama.\u201d That\u2019s a good deal less than the article\u2019s headline claims.\n\nThe other problem is with the 2 million deportations prosecuted since Obama took office. About half of them are \u201cborder removals,\u201d which, Lind notes, Obama skeptics think are less meaningful than interior deportations. But they\u2019re not, she says, because border removals are any deportations that take place in Border Patrol territory, which \u201cis not what most people think of as the border\u201d \u2014 it stretches 100 miles into the U.S. and encompasses places where lots of illegal immigrants live long-term.\u201d\n\nThis is flat-out false: The Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency defines a border removal as \u201can individual removed by ICE who is apprehended while attempting to illicitly enter the United States at or between the ports of entry by a CBP officer or agent.\u201d#page#\n\nIf that piece seems careless, take Libby Nelson\u2019s article claiming that the University of Connecticut\u2019s basketball team has a \u201cdirty secret\u201d: an 8 percent graduation rate. It was accompanied by this chart, showing that UConn does remarkably worse in graduating its players than the other schools that made it to the Final Four this year:\n\n\n\nExcept this represents just three years of data \u2014 a couple of dozen players for each team, maybe \u2014 which just happens to make UConn look bad.\n\nWhy did Nelson use these numbers? The NCAA\u2019s most recently released graduation rate for the program covered the 2003 to 2006 cohort, which looks at players who started school in those years and what percentage of them had graduated six years later. Does it make sense to say anything about UConn this year based on that data?#ad#\n\nThe tiny sample was recruited and taught by a different coach, a comparison that\u2019s really not too different from blaming the Obama administration for poor results achieved under the Bush administration. And a little context would have helped: The 2003\u20132006 cohort was the worst in recent history.\n\nThere are two ways to measure these schools: Given that UConn has a new coach, you can look at the NCAA\u2019s much more up-to-date statistic, the Academic Progress rating. Nelson writes, \u201cBy that standard, [which measures whether players are academically eligible and not dropping out,] UConn\u2019s new crop of players is doing fine.\u201d UConn\u2019s dirty secret (which wasn\u2019t really a secret to people who followed the NCAA tournament the last few years) is that it had one truly atrocious cohort of players, under a coach who doesn\u2019t work there anymore.\n\nAnd if you look at the larger historical context, UConn doesn\u2019t stand out either. If you move to the previous entirely separate cohort, 2000\u20132003, the team\u2019s graduation rate was 31 percent. Not good, but not nearly as bad as the one cohort Nelson picked. In the 1999\u20132002 cohort, the University of Kentucky, which looks so good on the above chart, had a graduation rate of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a031 percent (though, like UConn, Kentucky has only had its current coach\u00a0for a few years). The University of Florida, for the 2002\u20132005 cohort, had a graduation rate of just 17 percent, down from 60 percent in the Vox chart. If Nelson had looked at this data, I don\u2019t know how she could have concluded that there\u2019s a story worth telling about UConn in particular, historically or today. At the very least, if she thought the 8 percent statistic was newsworthy, she could have provided the proper context to show that it\u2019s an outlier.\n\nI don\u2019t know how a site whose executive editor is a Harvard alumnus got a college-basketball story wrong, but it\u2019s less hard to divine what\u2019s going on with Vox\u2019s unsurprising obsession with the idea of a single-payer health-care system. (Or, as they call it for the benefit of the rubes, a \u201csingle tube\u201d system.) Sarah Kliff has a two-minute video explaining how it works, and a neat longer piece on how Vermont is building one. That would appear to be the only \u201cnews\u201d that justified this bit of explaining (some liberals, of course, look at the troubles of Obamacare and would prefer that it be replaced with a single-payer system, but they represent quite a small political constituency).\n\nKlein and Matt Yglesias have been publicizing the single-payer idea recently by focusing on how it could save money, and lots of it. As a matter of cross-national comparison, this is true: Single-payer systems in other countries spend a lot less than the U.S. health-care system. But that\u2019s a lot different from saying that it would make sense for the U.S. to transition to one, or, especially, that you\u2019re going to see this work out in Vermont alone.\n\nKliff\u2019s video explains that Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan will save between 15 and 30 percent of health-care costs by reducing overhead, according to\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the architect of Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan. The reason given for this is that the savings from single-payer health care tend to come from the ability of the government to bargain hard with doctors. But Vermont will find it nigh impossible to do that without driving them out of the state.\n\nVermont has to raise an astonishing $2 billion in taxes to launch the system, Kliff writes, in a state that takes in only $2.7 billion a year. In return, you\u2019re not going to get a system like Britain\u2019s or Canada\u2019s that Vox says those countries love \u2014 you just get a state version of Medicare, an extremely expensive system with low overhead, respectable access, and high rates of fraud.\n\nI could nitpick more: Yglesias\u2019s take on the equal-pay debate is reasonable, but by far the most mendacious side in that debate \u2014 the one engaging in the ideological denial of facts \u2014 is the side that continually claims that women are making three-quarters what men do for the same work. That\u2019s false, but Yglesias doesn\u2019t really seem to care. He devotes his effort to pointing out that the statistics do find a 5 or so percent remaining gap when accounting for hours worked, job choice, and some unexplained factors, which almost all skeptics of the equal-pay gap admit. This is interesting enough \u2014 except that the debate we\u2019re having right now is over whether it needs to be much easier for women to bring legally actionable claims regarding discrimination. Women\u2019s earning 23 cents less for the same work might suggest we need such legislation; their earning some unknown fraction of 5 cents less doesn\u2019t.\n\nA new study finding that Obamacare\u2019s enrollees in the first few months are using extremely expensive prescription drugs at high rates was reported by Vox with the headline \u201cEarly Obamacare Enrollees Might Cost More.\u201d Because these drugs are so expensive, the reality is that early Obamacare enrollees do cost more; what we don\u2019t know is whether overall enrollees will cost more. There\u2019s important news here, but the headline is all context.#page#\n\nYglesias\u2019s video on why the federal government\u2019s debt doesn\u2019t matter states that \u201cthe national debt\u201d is $12.5 trillion, when in fact it\u2019s more like $17 trillion (he was citing debt held by the public, which excludes debt the federal government owes to the Social Security Trust Fund and therefore Social Security beneficiaries \u2014 which is part of the \u201cnational debt\u201d as in, it\u2019s debt the federal government owes). He also described inflation as \u201ctoo much money chasing a fixed amount of stuff,\u201d which isn\u2019t how economists describe inflation anymore \u2014 but fair enough, it\u2019s a two-minute video.#ad#\n\nThere\u2019s some excellent work on Vox: Matt Yglesias\u2019s take on the Ryan budget is pretty fair, for instance (though I\u2019d have preferred if he could have donned his lavender glasses and purple windowpane jacket and delivered it on video. We can\u2019t have it all, I guess). Their piece on what would happen if the U.S. repealed the minimum wage presented the academic consensus fairly, though it was answering a question that approximately no one was asking. To the great benefit of readers, Tim Lee\u2019s post on Bitcoin took a position, but a remarkably convincing one, on what the currency will mean.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to tell someone what they should think about something under the guise of \u201chere\u2019s what you need to know about\u201d something, it really ought to include\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0everything you need to know about something.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly impossible, of course, which is why most people trying to persuade you are a little more upfront about it. This new venture isn\u2019t going to do that, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t sometimes be a useful resource and a helpful corrective.\n\nIt\u2019s just not going to stand apart or herald a new era of political honesty. Or as people might have put it more than 100 years ago, Vox non clamantis in deserto.\n\n\u2014 Patrick Brennan is an associate editor at\u00a0National Review.", "card": "summary", "title": "Vox: Explained, by Patrick Brennan, National Review"}, "tweettext": "Vox: Explained", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Vox: Explained", "keywords": "Patrick Brennan", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Vox: Explained, Patrick Brennan, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Patrick Brennan, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf30d\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Patrick Brennan is an associate editor at National Review.\nBut if Vox really is about fulfilling the constitutional mandate to resolve the thorniest empirical issues facing our politics in a fair-minded way, it\u2019s failing badly.\nThat\u2019s false, but Yglesias doesn\u2019t really seem to care.\nAnd millions sign up for the dubiously useful Medicaid every year \u2014 it\u2019s really unclear how many the Affordable Care Act covered.\nThis idea upsets Hispanic liberals, but moderate liberals who like Klein love to throw it at Obama critics and immigration-reform skeptics."}
