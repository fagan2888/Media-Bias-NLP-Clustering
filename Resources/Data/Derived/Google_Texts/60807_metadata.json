She has served as interim chief since August, replacing Brian Kelly, who resigned after a city investigation into personnel concerns within the department.\n\nGainesville City Council rejected a couple\u2019s request Tuesday to change an original zoning to allow a fourth residential lot on Lake Knickerbocker, a high-end neighborhood off the Chattahoochee Golf Club.\n\nThe petition from Tread and Deborah Syfan was denied following objections from several residents, whose complaints included worries the move would negatively affect the lake\u2019s heavily silted waters.\n\n\u201cIt appears to me that (residents) feel that they gave you what you wanted to start with and now you want to do further,\u201d Councilwoman Myrtle Figueras said. \u201cTo me, it seems like an issue of trust rather than how much you\u2019re going to destroy the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThe property was originally zoned for three homes sharing a common driveway.\n\nThe Syfans had sought to amend the existing planned unit development on 5.4 acres on Greystone Road, west of Tommy Aaron Drive, permitting four single-family residential lots.\n\nTheir plans called for renovating a house now on the property \u201cfor their personal residence,\u201d the application states.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to explain my circumstances in how we came to want the additional lot,\u201d Tread Syfan said, responding to Figueras\u2019 concerns. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect there would be a recession and real estate values would go through the floor. Things change.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the couple wanted three lots, Syfan said.\n\n\u201cAt that time, we were going to tear the house down. But today, with real estate values what they are, it doesn\u2019t make sense to tear the house down.\u201d\n\nThe Syfans also faced opposition from David Gleason, president of the Lake Lanier-Knickerbocker Protective Association.\n\nGleason said the association\u2019s goal is not to stop development but to work to ensure there is \u201cno further damage to an already sensitive environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur concern ... is that once we begin down the slippery slope of subdividing properties, we run the risk of further damage to our lake, the fish, wildlife and migrating birds,\u201d he said.\n\nSyfan said he would comply with all stormwater regulations as needed.\n\n\u201cThey are more stringent than the ones that these people who are complaining here tonight had to abide by,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one more lot in a 2,000-acre basin. It will have a negligible impact.\u201d\n\nThe Syfans\u2019 request got support from Councilmen George Wangemann and Sam Couvillon, as well as Mayor Danny Dunagan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see where \u2026 having a fourth lot there is going to make a drastic difference,\u201d Couvillon said, adding he gave the issue careful thought.\n\nFigueras and council members Ruth Bruner and Bob Hamrick opposed the request, resulting in a 3-3 tie, which is the same as denial.\n\nSyfan said afterward he was disappointed by the vote, but \u201cwe still have three lots. I\u2019ll have to redraw the lots to save the house, which is what I\u2019ll do.\n\n\u201cFortunately, I can do that without having to go through City Council or the planning (and appeals board). I just have to have it approved by staff that it meets the current zoning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/107022/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/01/06/0107CHIEF.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Gainesville City Council rejected a couple\u2019s request Tuesday to change an original zoning to allow a fourth residential lot on Lake Knickerbocker, a high-end neighborhood off the Chattahoochee Golf Club.", "title": "Gainesville City Council denies Lake Knickerbocker housing request"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Gainesville City Council denies Lake Knickerbocker housing request"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab8b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFortunately, I can do that without having to go through City Council or the planning (and appeals board).\nGainesville City Council rejected a couple\u2019s request Tuesday to change an original zoning to allow a fourth residential lot on Lake Knickerbocker, a high-end neighborhood off the Chattahoochee Golf Club.\nIt will have a negligible impact.\u201dThe Syfans\u2019 request got support from Councilmen George Wangemann and Sam Couvillon, as well as Mayor Danny Dunagan.\nThings change.\u201dEarlier, the couple wanted three lots, Syfan said.\nFigueras and council members Ruth Bruner and Bob Hamrick opposed the request, resulting in a 3-3 tie, which is the same as denial."}
