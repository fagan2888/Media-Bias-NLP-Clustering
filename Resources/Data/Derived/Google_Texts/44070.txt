HARRISBURG — Police say a group of teenagers leaving a waterfront festival in central Pennsylvania damaged cars and a convenience store before one ended up with a gunshot wound.

PennLive.com reports that the teenagers had left the Kipona festival on the banks of the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg at about 10 p.m. Saturday.

Harrisburg police said the group moved through the streets of Pennsylvania’s capital, jumping on cars, ripping mirrors off vehicles and throwing chips and other items around a convenience store.

Capt. Kelly Wetzel said shots were later reported, and a youth was found nearby with a gunshot wound to the leg. He said the teen wasn’t shot by police.

Capt. Wetzel said “We’re very disappointed in our city’s youth. This is not the type of behavior you would expect.”
