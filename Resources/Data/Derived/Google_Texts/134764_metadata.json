The effort to apply the same religious freedom argument to anti-gay measures in states across the country has encountered tremendous resistance, not just from liberals but from business leaders, statewide Republican elected officials, and GOP celebrities who, for different reasons, seem to get that stomping away from a growing majority of the population with a middle finger hoisted overhead isn\u2019t a smart thing to do.\n\nOn Wednesday night Arizona\u2019s conservative governor Jan Brewer decided which camp she was with and vetoed her state\u2019s version of the right-to-discriminate bill.\n\nShe joins a significant faction of powerful conservatives who seem to understand that religious liberty isn\u2019t an all-purpose exemption from every law and norm conservatives don\u2019t like, and can\u2019t succeed politically as such. The threat to religious liberty can\u2019t be tenuous or imagined. Brewer underscored that fact when she effectively admitted that the Arizona bill \u2014 SB 1062 \u2014 was a spasm of right-wing cultural panic.\n\n\u201cSenate Bill 1062 does not address a specific and present concern related to religious liberty in Arizona,\u201d she said. \u201cTo the supporters of the legislation, I want you to know that I understand that long-held norms about marriage and family are being challenged as never before. Our society is undergoing many dramatic changes. However, I sincerely believe that Senate Bill 1062 has the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve. It could divide Arizona in ways we cannot even imagine and no one would ever want. Religious liberty is a core American and Arizona value, so is non-discrimination.\u201d\n\nIn other words, I feel your pain, change is terrifying, but your remedy is bulls***.\n\nHer veto carries momentous significance. It will resolve lingering ambivalence about similar efforts in other states and draw reluctant but influential players off the sidelines. I expect it\u2019ll prove to be the pivotal moment when this particular uprising began to die.\n\nBut to my eye there are two revealing things about how this all unfolded. One pertains to a faction of conservatives who continue to articulate an absurdly expansive view of religious liberty; another pertains to a subset of liberals who are drawing over-broad lessons from this and a whole series of recent culture war victories.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once upon a time, the right thought it could push its agenda behind claim of religious freedom.
