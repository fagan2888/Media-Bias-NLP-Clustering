Rick Scott, R-Fla., to fully defund Planned Parenthood in the state and to redirect the funds it currently receives to the 636 federally qualified community health centers in Florida.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer to disqualify Planned Parenthood from taxpayer funds,\u201d Stemberger said. \u201cThey should be morally disqualified from receiving public funds.\u201d\n\nStemberger said Scott should terminate both Florida\u2019s Medicaid contract with Planned Parenthood and Title X funds to the organization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking him to reprioritize the community health centers. They\u2019re more evenly distributed throughout the state and provide easier access for women.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has threatened states that have terminated their Medicaid contracts with Planned Parenthood with litigation. Stemberger said that shouldn\u2019t concern the governor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s faced threats before, and it hasn\u2019t fazed him,\u201d Stemberger said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking him to lead on this issue as he has on other issues.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Laura Goodhue, the executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said the Florida Family Policy Council was making \u201cfalse accusations against Planned Parenthood to back up their call for Gov. Scott to further restrict Florida women\u2019s access to health care.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment, Scott\u2019s office sent this statement from Scott:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Florida Family Policy Council has launched a campaign to defund Planned Parenthood in the state.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Florida Family Policy Council has launched a campaign to defund Planned Parenthood in the state.", "title": "Gov.
