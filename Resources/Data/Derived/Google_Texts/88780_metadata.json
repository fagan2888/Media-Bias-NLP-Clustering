These are only two of the proposals the House Judiciary Committee heard on Wednesday, when it sought legislative means to keep the president's use of executive authority in check.\n\nAsserting that he has been overstepping the boundaries of his constitutional authority, committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., accused President Barack Obama of creating an \u201cuber-presidency.\u201d Balance to the system of separation of powers, he said, must be restored.\n\nAt issue are Obama's actions to use his administrative powers to unilaterally delay the implementation of portions of laws such as Obamacare, and to move forward on gridlocked issues like comprehensive immigration reform. The president also recently promised that while he is willing to work with Congress on his priority issues, he will go it alone if the legislative branch fails to act.\n\n\u201cThese have not been empty proclamations,\u201d Goodlatte said of what he called Obama\u2019s refusal to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.\n\n\u201cIt is up to the Congress and the courts to check the president\u2019s overreach and restore balance to our system of government,\u201d he said.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nGeorge Washington University legal scholar Jonathan Turley, who was a part of panel during Wednesday\u2019s hearing, said the president's use of executive power threatens the stability and functioning of the nation\u2019s three-pronged system. This \u201cmassive gravitational shift of authority\u201d didn\u2019t begin with Obama, Turley said, it just \u201caccelerated at an alarming rate\u201d under his presidency.\n\nTurley did not cast blame solely on the executive branch. And, the fact that this alleged abuse of power is occurring in a political environment lacking dialogue and compromise worries him.\n\n\u201cThe current anaerobic conditions are breaking down the muscle of the constitutional system that protects us all,\u201d Turley wrote in a testimony to the committee. \u201cOf even greater concern is the fact that the other two branches appear passive, if not inert, as the executive branch has assumed such power.\u201d\n\nBut others argued that Obama\u2019s action has been within his purview.\n\nDuke University law professor Christopher Schroeder said that in using its executive authority, the administration isn\u2019t claiming the right to suspend or refuse to enforce any law.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s duty is to take care that the law is faithfully executed, not that it is flawlessly executed,\u201d Schroeder said, adding that no president can flawlessly execute the law.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee held a similar hearing in December, seeking to find out if there was presidential overreach. That another is being held had angered some Democrats, who dismissed the hearing as farce.\n\nRanking member Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who was chairman of the committee when the Democrtas had the majority, said the inquiry would have been more fruitful if there were any evidence that the president failed to fulfill his duties. Instead, he said the hearing was another attempt by the Republican majority to thwart Obama\u2019s implementation of initiatives they oppose, such as the health care law.\n\nExtending some deadlines related to the law, Conyers said, isn\u2019t failure to take care that the law is implemented, but \u201cit is rather a necessary part of meeting the obligation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obama executive overreach, obama executive order, obama executive action, obama immigration executive order, obama dream act, republican obamacare, republican obama,", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Republicans want to hit Obama where it hurts: his use of executive power on Obamacare and immigration.
