Writer Joe Rojas-Burke asks 10 true-or-false questions, and I think some of the answers may surprise you. For example:\n\nExpanding health insurance coverage and access to medical care (the focus of the federal Affordable Care Act) is unlikely to reverse the health disparities caused by the social determinants of health. TRUE: In countries that established universal health coverage decades ago, lower social status still correlates with worse health and shorter lives. The research on social determinants suggests that progress is likely to require broader social changes, such as improving access to education, boosting economic opportunity and making disadvantaged neighborhoods safer and and more vital.\n\nAnd:\n\nFood deserts \u2013 neighborhoods with few or no grocery stores selling fresh, affordable produce \u2013 are a well-defined root cause of obesity and other health problems in disadvantaged communities. FALSE: There is evidence showing that low-income and minority Americans are more likely to live in food deserts. But it\u2019s not at all clear to what extent the lack of supermarkets and grocery stores contributes to obesity or other health outcomes.\n\nPreviously: In medicine, showing empathy isn\u2019t enough, Should the lack of access to good food be blamed for America\u2019s poor eating habits? and Hopkins researchers find place, rather than race, may be greater determinant of health", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/scope/images/logo_share.jpg"}, "description": "Given the topic of today's SMS-Unplugged entry, during which Moises Humberto Gallegos discusses how things like housing insecurity and financial hardship can", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ShareGiven the topic of today\u2019s SMS-Unplugged entry, during which Moises Humberto Gallegos discusses how things like housing insecurity and financial hardship can contribute to poor health, I was interested to come across this Covering Health quiz on the social determinants of health.\nFor example:Expanding health insurance coverage and access to medical care (the focus of the federal Affordable Care Act) is unlikely to reverse the health disparities caused by the social determinants of health.\nTRUE: In countries that established universal health coverage decades ago, lower social status still correlates with worse health and shorter lives.\nThe research on social determinants suggests that progress is likely to require broader social changes, such as improving access to education, boosting economic opportunity and making disadvantaged neighborhoods safer and and more vital.\nBut it\u2019s not at all clear to what extent the lack of supermarkets and grocery stores contributes to obesity or other health outcomes."}
