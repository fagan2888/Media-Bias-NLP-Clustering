The offending post, in its entirety, was: \"Plot twist: They don't find the bomb and it goes off tomorrow.\" A lawsuit by the student\u2019s family, which does not name the student, claims he put the Facebook post up after coming home and that it was his \u201cexpression of anxiety regarding the bomb threat and a misplaced attempt at humor,\u201d as reported by PennLive.com. Nevertheless, school district administrators found the comment neither humorous nor outside their purview. The local news website reports:\n\nAccording to the suit, after learning of the post school officials contacted the boy's father and tracked down the student at an away football game at Red Lion High School.\n\n\n\nAfter meeting with the teen at the game, Superintendent Michael Snell imposed a 10-day suspension, pending further investigation, the suit states. Two weeks later, following a disciplinary hearing, the teen was hit with an additional 13-day suspension.\n\n\n\nHe also was questioned by Springettsbury Township police, who did not file criminal charges, according to the suit.\n\nKudos to the cops, at least, for recognizing no crime was committed there; that's not always a given. The family argues in their lawsuit that the school violated their son\u2019s constitutional rights, and that \u201cvague and over broad policies prohibit and chill speech that is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d And there ought to be zero tolerance for that.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Joked about a false alarm bomb threat that happened that day", "title": "Student Suspended For 23 Days, Questioned by Police for Joking About Bomb Threat on Facebook", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/03/14/student-suspended-for-23-days-questioned", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13948309646415.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A ninth-grader at a high school\nin Springettsbury, Pennsylvania, was suspended for 10 days, and\nthen an additional 13 days, for joking in a Facebook post about a\nbomb threat.
