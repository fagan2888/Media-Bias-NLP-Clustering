You can be prosecuted for what Trump said in these European capitals and that\u2019s a big part of the reason why it\u2019s not possible anymore in Europe to have a full and frank discussion of the facts that you need to consider to have an intelligent national security policy.\n\n\u201cThe reason our framers put political speech in the Constitution and made political speech the core of free expression protection is because a functioning democracy has to be able to have full and frank discussions if it\u2019s going to have the right policies and, in particular, have the right national defense policy,\u201d added McCarthy.\n\nHe also said he believes what\u2019s happening in Europe with regard to speech is very dangerous and said he hates seeing it in the United States. \u201cThere are ways to object to what Trump has proposed without attacking him personally, or immediately going to what his motivations might be.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy pointed out that it\u2019s a weak argument to go after someone personally for their opinions, suggesting critics have no solid, or better ground upon which to argue with his ideas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the sort of thing the Left does and I hate seeing it on the right,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCarthy goes on to discuss terrorism and it\u2019s direct relation to radical Islam at some length in the interview below.\n\nThe former prosecutor also recently endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 Ted Cruz Is the One Candidate Who Can Face down Washington \u2014 And Win. McCarthy said he doesn\u2019t understand the rap on Cruz out of Washington that he\u2019s too conservative. \u201cPeople are hungry for a clear, unapologetic proud American articulation of conservative principles and I think he\u2019s the first guy in a very long time that I think we can rely on for that.\u201d\n\nReinvigorating American principles will require taming Washington. It calls for restoring the Constitution as a vital limit on government, not a relic . . . or an obstacle. Ted Cruz gets this. Many Republicans talk the talk \u2014 we hear it in every election season, right up until it is time to stop campaigning and start governing. Senator Cruz walks the walk. That is why I believe he should be the next president of the United States.\n\nListen to the complete Breitbart News daily interview below:", "article_metadata": {"description": "As far as the global firestorm around Trump's recent comments, McCarthy cited the erosion of First Amendment rights in the United States.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "As far as the global firestorm around Trump's recent comments, McCarthy cited the erosion of First Amendment rights in the United States.", "title": "Andrew McCarthy: Trump Critics Are Weak And Dangerous - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Trump-RJC-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-12-11T10:22:22-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/09/andrew-mccarthy-trump-critics-weak-and-dangerous/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As far as the global firestorm around Trump's recent comments, McCarthy cited the erosion of First Amendment rights in the United States.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Trump-RJC-Getty.jpg", "title": "Andrew McCarthy: Trump Critics Are Weak And Dangerous - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Radio,McCarthy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-12-09T06:30:07-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Radio", "modified_time": "2015-12-11T10:22:22-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The former prosecutor also recently endorsed Sen.
