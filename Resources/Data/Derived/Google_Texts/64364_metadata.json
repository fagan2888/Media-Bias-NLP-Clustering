Health care fraud costs American taxpayers $80bn a year, according to an estimate by the FBI.\n\nIt was the nature of his crimes that horrified investigators, shattering the \u201csacred trust\u201d between doctor and patient by scaring patients into undergoing unnecessary treatments that may have put them at more risk than if they had never come under his care, the Guardian was told.\n\n\u201cHe was good at manipulating his patients. He would convince them that if they did not have these services that he provided, they could possibly die. We put so much faith in doctors, it shakes everyone up to realize that there is a minority who put greed first,\u201d Justin Shammot, supervisory special agent with the FBI\u2019s Cleveland office, said.\n\nBut Persaud declared that he is appealing his recent conviction and the sentence he was handed in court in Cleveland on December 18, of 20 years in federal prison, after a jury found him guilty in October of fraud, falsifying documents and money laundering.\n\nPersaud studied and was trained initially in the United Kingdom, but has been working in the US since 1984. He is an American citizen, but has had to forfeit his passport since his conviction.\n\nHe is not in custody as he awaits a date from the federal bureau of prisons to begin his incarceration, and spoke to the Guardian on his cell phone from the home in Westlake, a suburb of Cleveland, that he shares with his American wife.\n\n\u201cI did make some mistakes and I take full responsibility for that, when I dictated my notes, but none of it was fraudulent. I made some billing errors, but I did nothing wrong, medically,\u201d he insisted.\n\nFederal agents spent two years investigating Persaud from 2012 to 2014, when he went on trial, and believe his malpractice involved around 100 patients from 2006 to 2012. He is facing several civil lawsuits from patients who went under his knife.\n\nThe Ohio medical authorities are now reviewing his license, with a view to suspending or withdrawing it, investigators said.\n\nDr Persaud ran his own practice but had privileges at three area hospitals, where he performed procedures himself or sent patients for operations performed by others, many of them unnecessary, so he could reap payments from the government\u2019s Medicare scheme and from private insurers.\n\nSome patients were injected repeatedly with radioactive material for heart tests they did not need, with the doctor lying that the results showed they needed surgery, the FBI said.\n\nOthers were given bypass operations or stents for imaginary problems fabricated or exaggerated by the physician, the FBI has said.\n\n\u201cThis is the worst kind of healthcare fraud you can have and is the toughest I\u2019ve seen \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen some really bad stuff,\u201d Shammot said.\n\nOne patient, Anthony Barber, 56, had a stent put in a heart blood vessel by Dr. Persaud in 2012 that he did not need, according to a lawsuit against the doctor which is set to go to trial in November 2016 and is expected to claim in the region of $500,000 damages.\n\n\u201cThe allegations are that Harry Persaud negligently provided medical care and lied about the patient\u2019s symptoms to justify the need for cardiac catheterization and, ultimately, stenting,\u201d Michael Shroge, Barber\u2019s attorney, said.\n\nShroge said that Dr Persaud told Barber that he had a life-threatening condition. Other doctors have now told him it would be more risky for him to have the unnecessary stent removed than to leave it in his body.\n\n\u201cThis is the evilest part \u2013 I don\u2019t know that he will ever agree that he did anything wrong. They [his lawyers] have denied that he has damaged any of his patients,\u201d said Shroge.\n\nPatients testified at the sentencing about their concerns and one women told the court that Persaud\u2019s practices may have contributed to the death of her husband.\n\nPersaud was born in British Guyana and moved to the UK when he was 10. According to documents submitted as part of the civil case, the details of which Persaud confirmed, he went to Kentwood Boys school in London for his secondary education from 1971 to 1978.\n\nHe attended Southampton University School of Medicine, from 1978 to 1983 and then spent six months in training at Glan Clwyd hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, and six months training at Blackburn Infirmary, in Blackburn, Lancashire, before moving to the US in 1984, where his parents had settled.\n\nHe spent three years as a resident at Rochester general hospital in upstate New York, then moved to Cleveland, Ohio. He has run his own practice in Westlake for the past 23 years and is now an American citizen.\n\nPersaud must attend a hearing in January that will rule how much restitution he will have to pay insurers.\n\nHe told the Guardian he had never been the subject of an investigation or lawsuits previously in his career in the US or the UK. \u201cThere is no blemish on my record,\u201d he said.
