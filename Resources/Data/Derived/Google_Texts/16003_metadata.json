(CQ Roll Call file photo)\n\nThe death of the much-admired former Utah Sen. Robert F. Bennett just hours after Donald Trump effectively secured his party's presidential nomination reminded official Washington of the first visible stirrings of the unrest that Trump has now ridden to the top of his party.\n\nBefore there was Trump\u2019s \"beautiful wall,\" or oath to make America great again, there was this: Bennett, a party stalwart with a reputation for pragmatism and deftness at the pork-barrel politics that made compromise possible, brought to tears at a 2010 nominating convention as he realized that his own party was ousting him after 18 years in the Senate.\n\n[Related: The War on Trump is Over] Bennett, who had been fighting cancer and had been weakened by a stroke, died on May 4. But it was six years ago that he became the first victim of the first strike of what has lately become a full-blown \u201ccivil war inside of the Republican Party,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Republican political strategist and media consultant.\n\n\u201cThat was the rumblings, the preview of the beginning of the first act,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cNow we\u2019re in the second, and it\u2019s getting much louder, much uglier, deciding whether we\u2019re going to be a conservative party or a nationalist, populist party in the image of Donald Trump. And it\u2019s a very hairy moment for conservative Republicans.\u201d\n\nBennett was one of the most powerful conservatives in the Senate, with the passion and pedigree that in earlier times would have made him untouchable. But his skill as a legislator led to his undoing, inflaming a then-nascent faction of tea party activists in his home state whose power came as an obvious surprise to the three-term senator and many of his friends and colleagues.\n\nBennett had all the hallmarks of a classic American statesman. His father, Wallace F. Bennett , preceded him in the office. They shared the same rangy, 6-foot-6 physique. Bennett had even served as his dad's campaign manager and aide. His mother, Frances Grant Bennett , was the daughter of a Mormon Church president and served on the church\u2019s board.\n\nHe was the student body president at the University of Utah and became independently wealthy as the head of the company that made the Franklin Day Planner schedule organizer before running for the Senate. He also had a self-deprecating sense of humor. In 2004, his campaign billboards carried the slogan \u201cBig Heart. Big Ideas. Big Ears.\u201d\n\nBennett represented an old-guard of the conservative movement, a breed of politician whose strongest allegiance was to his state, and who was willing to make deals and accept incremental changes for the good of his constituents, said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center , where Bennett served as a senior fellow after his retirement.\n\n\u201cTo some extent, that was his downfall,\u201d Grumet said. \u201cHe really felt that he represented every single person in the state of Utah and not just the loudest voices that have become dominant of late.\u201d\n\nWhile he was in the Senate, Bennett would sometimes write to President Barack Obama to suggest ways the president and Congress could work more productively together, Grumet said.\n\nBennett became a close friend to then-minority leader Mitch McConnell, who gave him a seat at leadership meetings and often asked him to reach out behind the scenes to both Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\u201cBob Bennett once said that there are two kinds of senators in Washington, work horses and show horses,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to anyone who knew him which path Senator Bennett followed.\u201d\n\nHe served on the appropriations committee, where he was an expert at earmarking federal projects for his home state. And he had a reputation for seeking common ground with Democrats on complex issues, most notably when he teamed with Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, with whom he drafted a proposal to expand health insurance coverage before the dawn of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSenator Bennett was a cherished friend of mine and I have missed his presence since the day he left the Senate,\" said Wyden. \"[E]ach time I worked with him was a reminder of his incredible intellect, work ethic, and thoughtfulness. Unfortunately, those qualities are in too short supply in Congress today.\"\n\nBennett knew at the time that the measure had earned him some enemies at home, said former Democratic Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, who visited Bennett a week before his death and reminisced with him about their time in Congress. Dorgan was chairman of the Energy-Water subcommittee when Bennett was ranking member. The two would lean over to each other during breaks in hearings and ask how things were going back in their home states. Bennett\u2019s comments turned cryptic during his final years in office, Dorgan said: \"He'd say 'Well, they've got a group after me. They think I'm not conservative.'\"\n\nThe final reckoning came at a nominating convention in Utah. Under the state party\u2019s rules, delegates get to vote on candidates ahead of a primary, with the top two contenders then continuing in the race.\n\nIn the first sign that something was unusual that year, Bennett had seven opponents at the convention, a rarity for a sitting senator, said Matthew Burbank, who teaches political science at the University of Utah. They all claimed he was not conservative enough for Utah.\n\n\u201cAmong the delegates, there was a deep unhappiness, not with Bennett personally, but with what he represented: Politics as usual in Washington,\u201d Burbank said. \u201cThey saw Bennett as essentially the facilitator of big government.\u201d\n\nPolls showed that Bennett had a clear lead among general voters in the state \u2014 27 percent vs. 9 percent for his nearest competitor, now Sen. Mike Lee, according to the Deseret News . No sitting senator had been run out of office before a primary in over 60 years.\n\nBennett and his team told reporters before the convention that at worst, they expected to finish second to a rival he could handily defeat in the primary. Instead, Bennett was knocked out in an early round, provoking what the Deseret News described as a \u201clong, sustained cheer \u201d from party delegates as his defeat was announced.\n\n\u201cNobody was thinking that was what would happen,\u201d Burbank said. \u201cHere was a guy who had been a Republican all his life, and that\u2019s the message he gets. His own party was telling him, 'No you\u2019re not our guy. You\u2019re not one of us.' \u201d\n\nBennett choked back tears as he addressed the television cameras.\n\n\u201cThe political atmosphere, obviously, has been toxic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment.\u201d\n\nUtah voters ultimately replaced Bennett with Lee , who is known for his singularly strong relationship with similarly conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nAnd even Cruz wasn\u2019t the right fit for the GOP primary electorate that ultimately embraced Trump.\n\nGet breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The death of the much-admired former Utah Sen.
