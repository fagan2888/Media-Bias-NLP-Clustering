Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, likened impeachment \u201cto a muscle that has atrophied over time,\u201d and said he wants to \u201cGet that muscle working again\u2014this should be a common occurrence, this shouldn\u2019t be once in a century.\u201d\n\nChaffetz believes impeachment is within Congress\u2019 Constitutional authority. \u201cThis was the safety valve,\u201d he explained, \u201cfor somebody who\u2019s not serving the best interest of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nCongress has only impeached 19 federal officials in its history. The last impeached executive agent forced out of office was United States Secretary of War, William Belknap, in 1876 over charges of corruption.\n\nMore recently Chaffetz has led the charge to impeach Koskinen, saying he obstructed the congressional investigation into the agency\u2019s targeting of conservative groups. Chaffetz drew up impeachment articles for the taxman last October and directed his staff to hand deliver the papers to each member of Congress. Last year, the Treasury Department issued a statement backing Koskinen, saying that \u201cCommissioner Koskinen is a man of the highest integrity with a steadfast commitment to public service during difficult times,\u201d per the Associated Press.\n\nBut so far, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has hesitated to give Koskinen the boot. At a press conference last week, Ryan told reporters he\u2019d rather wait until after the election to fire the top tax agent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always an election,\u201d Chaffetz said, expressing frustration with Ryan\u2019s decision to punt on the issue.\n\n\u201cEven the speaker complains about the management of the IRS,\u201d Chaffetz said, pointing to Ryan\u2019s most recent comment on the issue. \u201cWell, we can actually do something about it other than a YouTube video. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, members of the Freedom Caucus called for impeachment of Koskinen directly from the House floor and protested leadership\u2019s hesitancy to act on the impeachment articles.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jason Chaffetz spearheaded the charge to fire IRS Commissioner John Koskinen last year.
