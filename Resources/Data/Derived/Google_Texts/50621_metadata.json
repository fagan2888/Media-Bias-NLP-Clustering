The uninsured rate for undocumented immigrants is triple that of other non citizens in the City (20%) and over six times greater than the uninsured rate for the City as a whole (10%).\n\n\u201cNew Yorkers should not be prevented from accessing health care because of a broken federal immigration system. While some in Washington continue to fight against the Affordable Care Act, we are going to expand on it by providing truly universal access to care,\u201d said de Blasio. \u201cWe have the greatest public health system in the country, and we will build on the work HHC has been doing for immigrants since its founding to ensure that every New York City resident \u2013 young or old, rich or poor \u2013 can access the care they need for themselves and their families.\u201d\n\nThe Task Force on Immigrant Health Care Access, created in June 2014, brought together City officials, immigrant advocates, public health experts, and health care providers to discuss the state of health care access for the immigrant community in New York City.\n\nAmong the major obstacles they found in the way of immigrant access to health care was affordability and language barriers. It also found that immigrants struggled to understand the care and coverage options available, specifically due to the lack of high-quality interpretation and language services and below-average cultural and linguistic competency on the part of health care providers.\n\nIn its report, de Blasio promised that, \u201call New Yorkers will be able to get the health care they need, at a price they can pay, in the languages they speak.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cDirect Access\u201d program will begin the spring of 2016, providing access to care for around a thousand uninsured immigrants in the City. The estimated initial cost is about $6 million, partially financed by the Mayor\u2019s Fund to Advance New York City.\n\n\u201cOne of the priorities of the Mayor\u2019s Fund is to discover and implement innovative programs that have the potential to improve the lives of New Yorkers. Evaluating new ways to guarantee affordable, reliable and timely health care services for our immigrant community is exactly in line with our mission,\u201d said Darren Bloch, Executive Director of the Mayor\u2019s Fund.\n\nNew York City is one of the first major cities in the country, following in the footsteps of San Francisco and Los Angeles, to expand health care access after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. Although it is not insurance, this program will expand access and coordination to health care, in the hopes of lowering health care costs and improving the health of the City.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Kings County Politics", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan yesterday that will make access to health care more readily available to the City\u2019s immigrant population.
