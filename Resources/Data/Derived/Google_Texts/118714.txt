The death of a Ventura woman found on railroad tracks in Massachusetts earlier this month was ruled an accident, according to local newspaper reports.

Pilar Logan, 57, was found on train tracks in Westfield, Massachusetts, on Aug. 1. Her death was eventually ruled an accident, according to The Republican, a newspaper in western Massachusetts.

An autopsy revealed she died of blunt-force injuries to the head, torso and extremities. But the circumstances behind her death remain unclear.

Logan and her husband were apparently in Massachusetts visiting family when the incident occurred.

The Republican reported the couple was traveling on an Albany to Boston line when Logan was reported missing. She was later found dead on the railroad tracks.

Penelope Barnds, of Ventura, said she heard about Logan's death through a friend and began trying to track down more information about it.

"I just think it's so bizarre," said Barnds, who knew Logan for 15 years.

"I think some kind of investigation needs to be done."

Barnds said she and Logan were part of the local Assistance League.

She said other friends are wondering what happened leading up to Logan's death.
