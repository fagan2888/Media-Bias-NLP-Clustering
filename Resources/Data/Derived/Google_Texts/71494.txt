Boo hoo hoo. Waaa.

Boo hoo hoo. Waaa.

A majority of Americans view House Speaker John Boehner’s (R-Ohio) lawsuit over President Obama’s delayed implementation of ObamaCare’s employer mandate as a “political stunt,” according to a new poll released Monday. The survey, commissioned by liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change, found that 51 percent of voters don’t believe the lawsuit is legitimate, versus just 41 percent who do. Moreover, 56 percent say the lawsuit is wasteful spending, with just 36 percent saying it is a good use of taxpayer dollars.

The survey found that a plurality of Americans — 46 percent — say the suit makes them less likely to vote for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. By contrast, three in 10 say the suit makes them more likely to vote for the GOP.

Some 58 percent of voters say the suit will not help improve the lives of people like them, and 63 percent say Congress should be more focused on taking action to create jobs.

If you think House Speaker John Boehner's pre-impeachment lawsuit against President Obama for failing to implement Obamacare quickly enough makes him look like an obstructionist jackass who is more interested in political stunts than doing the right thing for the country, you're not alone Here's the kicker:And why is that? Perhaps because of this:On the one hand, these results are heartening, because it's always good to know that a solid majority of the country hasn't gone completely bonkers. On the other hand: Who the hell are the 37 percent of morons who wouldn't rather see Congress focused on jobs instead of Boehner's pre-impeachment lawsuit?
