For Nicola Williams, triathlons are one of her passions.

"I'm a mother, and I work for a technology company during the day. And sometime around all of that, I manage to get in my training," Williams said. "I think we do about 13 hours a week, so whenever you can get the biking, swimming, and running in, you try to manage your schedule."

Williams and others made the drive from Austin, Texas to Panama City Beach for her second Ironman competition.

An experience, she called, the stamp to a journey 6 months in the making.

"The excitement in the air was just phenomenal," Williams said. "There's people that you meet on the bike. You have a little conversation getting to know them, knowing that we're all in this struggle together."

But while many crossed the finish line Saturday night to become an Ironman, local businesses say they too had a successful weekend.

"Very,very busy day yesterday (Saturday), and of course today (Sunday), they'd all been starving all week so they all came for breakfast at the same time," Pickle Patch Host Rocky Akins said. "We had a packed house this morning. I came in from church and couldn't find a seat. I had to sit on the waitress station this morning it was so full."

And for Williams, she said she'll be back hopefully to be called an Ironman once again.

"The volunteerism is phenomenal," Williams said. "Everyone's cheering and rooting you on, whether you're running, walking, or crying. They're just all there to support you."

According to Ironman officials, about 2,400 people took part in this year's competition.
