Ted Cruz (R-TX) kicked off his California campaign with a rally in Orange County at Hotel Irvine \u2014 the same venue where he met privately with his entire state of proposed delegates last month. \u201cThis is the birthplace of the Reagan Revolution,\u201d Cruz told the enthusiastic crowd, \u201cand let me tell you, there\u2019s a new revolution brewing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m elected president\u2013\u201d Cruz said, before being interrupted by a fan: \u201cWhen!\u201d He continued: \u201cIf, and when I\u2019m elected president, we are going to repeal every word of Obamacare.\u201d He continued through a familiar set of points outlining his domestic policies, including creating a flat tax, reining in the Environmental Protection Agency, and stopping amnesty for illegal aliens.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCruz also noted that after the recent passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, it was critical to elect a president who would appoint conservatives to the bench.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has been supporting liberal Democratic politicians for forty years,\u201d Cruz told the crowd, to boos. He attacked Trump for suggesting that Republicans needed to learn to added: \u201cI will not compromise away your religious liberty. And I will not compromise away your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\u201d\n\nHe went on to attack Trump for allegedly saying that he would be neutral between Israelis and Palestinians (though Trump had actually referred only to a negotiation process between the two).\n\nCruz then turned to foreign policy and national security: \u201cNo longer will our government and our military be governed by political correctness. We will have a president and a commander-in-chief who stands up and tells the world: \u2018We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019 We will have a president willing to utter the words, \u2018Radical Islamic terrorism.'\u201d He also criticized the rules of engagement that applied to the U.S. military in the fight against terror \u2014 a criticism also made, albeit more colorfully, by Trump.\n\nFinally, Cruz turned to political strategy. Warm-up speakers had noted Cruz\u2019s recent string of caucus victories, and the campaign\u2019s success in poaching delegates in places Donald Trump had won, thanks to superior organization. Former state Republican Party chair Mike Schroeder reminded the crowd that California had already elected a wealthy celebrity \u2014 i.e. former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 and it had not gone well.\n\nCruz picked up where Schroeder left off. \u201cIn the last three weeks, we have beaten Donald Trump in all eleven elections,\u201d he said, ticking off a string of big victories from Utah, to the Wisconsin primary, through last weekend\u2019s Colorado delegate contest (which was not, strictly speaking, an election).\n\nHe mocked Trump for arguing that \u201cwhen voters vote against him, they\u2019re stealing the election,\u201d noting that Trump had been \u201ccursing,\u201d tweeting and complaining.\n\nCruz added that Trump would be a disastrous general election candidate, and argued that several polls showed he himself could defeat Clinton in November, including polls of young voters.\n\nTicking off a string of endorsements, Cruz concluded: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the entire spectrum of the Republican Party coming together, united.\u201d\n\nHe told the cheering crowd that for the first time in half a century, \u201cCalifornia will decide the Republican nomination.\u201d He urged them to call friends, family and neighbors and recruit them to the cause. \u201cThe power of this campaign is the grass roots.\u201d\n\nIn eight weeks, Californians will know just how powerful \u2014 and with whom the grass roots stand.\n\nThe post has been updated.\n\nJoel B.
