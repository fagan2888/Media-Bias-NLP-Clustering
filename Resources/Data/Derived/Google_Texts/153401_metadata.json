(AP) - Bertony Faustin didn\u2019t set out to be Oregon\u2019s first black winemaker. He just wanted to make good wine. But the disbelief that often comes when customers realize a black man owns the winery has worn on him.\n\n\u201cPeople are always surprised. Everybody assumes that \u2026 I am not the winemaker,\u201d said the 43-year-old, who four years ago opened Abbey Creek Winery about 20 miles northwest of Portland. \u201cThe image of the winemaker is an old white guy. To see that it\u2019s a black man, it takes people aback.\u201d\n\nThe industry\u2019s stereotype, Faustin said, is one of status and racial homogeneity - photographs in wine publications feature manicured homes, expensive tasting rooms and white families touting well-bred pedigrees. Yet, more African-Americans and other minorities are increasingly making and drinking fine wine and wine-tasting clubs for African -Americans have proliferated. The shift, many experts say, is making the industry less elitist and attracting a diversity of customers, but comes with its own challenges.\n\nJust last month, the Napa Valley Wine Train in California kicked a book club composed mostly of black women off a tasting tour. The women said it was because of their race; the train spokesman said employees repeatedly asked the women to quiet down. The company later apologized and promised to train employees on cultural diversity and sensitivity.\n\nIn the hopes of debunking myths, Faustin is making a documentary film about breaking the racial barrier, with the goals of giving more visibility to African-American, Latino, Asian and gay vintners and empowering the next generation to drink and pursue wine-related jobs.\n\nFor generations, social class - and, hence, wealth and race - limited Americans\u2019 access to fine wine.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, we\u2019ve been kept out of the industry for a long time. Civil rights is just 50 years old and for us to even have opportunities to dine out at established restaurants is fairly new,\u201d said Marcia Jones, an African-American who hosts the syndicated weekly radio show \u201cWine Talk,\u201d on which she interviews blacks in the industry. \u201cTo share wine for generations to come, a comprehensive story needs to be told.\u201d\n\nDespite African-Americans\u2019 strong historical ties to farming - 14 percent of the nation\u2019s farmers in 1920 - they abandoned the work mostly due to the legacies of slavery and discriminatory policies. Today, just 1 percent of all farm operators are black, according to the 2012 U.S. Census of Agriculture.\n\nIn the wine industry, there are only a few dozen black vintners across the country, about 20 of them in Napa Valley. But their inroads into winemaking reflect the country\u2019s massive social changes and increasing economic mobility.\n\nTheodora Lee founded Theopolis Vineyards in 2003 in California\u2019s Mendocino County. The law partner and trial lawyer bottles and markets her wine and is on course to sell about 800 cases this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m returning to my family\u2019s farming roots,\u201d said Lee, whose grandfather was a sharecropper in Texas. \u201cThe only difference is, I own the land.\u201d\n\nJerry Bias, a Virginia vintner who grew up in inner-city Baltimore and later became a Wall Street trader, was inspired by a wealthy African-American businessman to \u201cto take the shackles off of my own thinking and do whatever my dreams call me to do.\u201d He planted vines in 2001 and runs Wisdom Oak Winery, a 153-acre estate and vineyard just south of Charlottesville. He produces about 2,500 cases a year, and says his focus is quality.\n\n\u201cExcellence is colorless,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Oregon Wine Board spokeswoman Michelle Kaufmann admits the images it promotes are of white winemakers, though she said the organization welcomes everyone and has seen a 40 percent growth after the recession that\u2019s more diverse. But of the state\u2019s nearly 700 wineries, the board knows of one African-American winemaker: Faustin.\n\nHe\u2019s a winemaker by accident. After moving from Brooklyn, New York, to Portland 15 years ago to be an anesthesia technician, he met his wife and the couple moved to the city\u2019s outskirts on her parents\u2019 property, which is planted in 12 acres of grapes.\n\nWith his in-laws\u2019 blessing, Faustin took over the vineyard in 2008, found a mentor and enrolled in a viticulture program. He honed his skills for five years as the tasting room supervisor at a sake brewery and made wine under his own label on the side.\n\nAbbey Creek Winery\u2019s tasting room opened in 2011. The work is hard: Faustin and his assistant, Ocean Yap Powell, do it all - planting and pruning, crushing grapes and bottling, tastings and sales. Faustin sells about 800 to 1,000 cases a year directly to customers and he\u2019s sold out of every vintage, he said.\n\nHis documentary, \u201cRed, White and Black,\u201d will feature several people of color and a lesbian couple; their stories, he says, prove that despite financial barriers and lack of vintner lineage - himself included - first-generation minority winemakers can succeed.\n\nHe also wants the movie to help the industry reflect the consumer population\u2019s shift. \u201cWe don\u2019t shun history, but we also need to shape the future of Oregon wine,\u201d Faustin said, \u201cso that Latinos, blacks and gay people can participate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bertony Faustin didn't set out to be Oregon's first black winemaker.
