The only reason they\u2019re now living apart is because they have no other way to ensure that Linda can get the medical care she needs for her epilepsy \u2014 thanks to their lawmakers\u2019 decision to resist implementing Obamacare.\n\nAs the Tennessean reports, the couple decided to separate this fall because their household income puts them above the threshold for Tennessee\u2019s public insurance program, called TennCare. Since Tennessee has refused to accept Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion, the Drains fall into what\u2019s known as the coverage gap: They make too much money to qualify for TennCare, but they make too little to receive federal subsidies to buy a plan on Obamacare\u2019s new private marketplace.\n\nLinda Drain\u2019s epilepsy causes her to suffer painful seizures and keeps her from holding down a steady job. Without insurance, she can\u2019t afford the medications she needs to help prevent those seizures. But, thanks to 62-year-old Larry\u2019s Social Security benefits, the couple began earning more than $1,102 each month in non-wage income \u2014 which is too much money to maintain Linda\u2019s access to health benefits through the state.\n\nSo Linda has gone to desperate lengths to remain eligible for TennCare. She split from her husband to avoid hitting the monthly household income limit and sometimes stays in a homeless shelter in Knoxville. Meanwhile, Larry continues to live in the apartment that they once shared together. The couple doesn\u2019t see each other every day anymore, and they miss each other\u2019s company. \u201cA thousand little things have been ripped away from us. Little things that people do,\u201d Larry told the Tennessean.\n\nLarry and Linda Drain CREDIT: Facebook\n\nA little over a month ago, Larry started writing a letter to Gov. Bill Haslam (R) every single day, imploring him to consider his wife\u2019s situation and agree to expand Medicaid. He posts all the letters on his blog. He\u2019s up to 44 letters by now, but he hasn\u2019t yet received a response from the governor\u2019s office. Now that the Tennessean has covered his story, Larry is hoping that Haslam may agree to meet.\n\n\u201cI want to sit down in a room with you. I want to be worth 15 or 20 minutes. That is it,\u201d Larry explained in the letter he wrote on July 5th. \u201cI want to know that you consider an ordinary voice important. It doesn\u2019t seem like such a big deal.\u201d\n\nTennessee isn\u2019t alone. Twenty four states are still blocking Medicaid expansion, a major provision in the health law that the Supreme Court ruled to be optional. That\u2019s denying coverage from some of the most vulnerable residents in the country. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly five million low-income Americans across the country fall into the coverage gap; other estimates put that figure closer to six million.\n\nIn order to pressure GOP lawmakers to expand Medicaid, supporters of the program have been highlighting the tragic stories of individuals like Larry and Linda Drain who are locked out of Obamacare altogether. A recent study conducted by Harvard researchers estimated that as many as 17,000 people will die directly as a result of their states refusing to expand Medicaid, which has led some protesters to bring coffins to their state capitols and accuse their lawmakers of supporting \u201cdeath panels.\u201d Faith leaders across the country have framed the policy as a moral issue.\n\nThe decision to reject Medicaid expansion has an impact beyond the people in the coverage gap, too. State lawmakers\u2019 resistance to this particular Obamacare provision is also preventing rural hospitals that serve low-income and uninsured patients from getting the funding they need. Without the extra income from newly insured Medicaid patients, rural hospitals in impoverished areas are being forced to close. This summer, a hospital in Brownville, Tennessee is meeting that fate.\n\nAlthough Medicaid opponents typically say that expanding the program is too expensive, there are actually significant financial benefits for states that reduce their population of uninsured residents. Thanks to the generous federal funding designated for states that expand Medicaid, implementing this policy could actually help Tennessee receive over $9.4 billion in revenue between 2014 and 2019 and create over 21,800 jobs in the health care sector.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Larry and Linda Drain have been married for more than 30 years, but they recently split up so Linda can have health insurance.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Larry and Linda Drain have been married for more than 30 years, but they recently split up so Linda can have health insurance.", "title": "Tennessee\u2019s Refusal To Expand Medicaid Forced This Couple To Get A Divorce", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/07/3456863/tennessee-medicaid-expansion-couple/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/expand-medicaid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Larry and Linda Drain have been married for more than 30 years, but they recently split up so Linda can have health insurance.", "title": "Tennessee\u2019s Refusal To Expand Medicaid Forced This Couple To Get A Divorce", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/expand-medicaid-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/expand-medicaid.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/expand-medicaid.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-07T12:24:27+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd227\"", "article_summary": "Health Tennessee\u2019s Refusal To Expand Medicaid Forced This Couple To Get A Divorce CREDIT: Medicaid proponents rally in Ohio (Credit: Columbus Dispatch)Larry and Linda Drain were happily married for more than 33 years.\nBill Haslam (R) every single day, imploring him to consider his wife\u2019s situation and agree to expand Medicaid.\nWithout the extra income from newly insured Medicaid patients, rural hospitals in impoverished areas are being forced to close.\nLarry and Linda Drain CREDIT: FacebookA little over a month ago, Larry started writing a letter to Gov.\nIn order to pressure GOP lawmakers to expand Medicaid, supporters of the program have been highlighting the tragic stories of individuals like Larry and Linda Drain who are locked out of Obamacare altogether."}
