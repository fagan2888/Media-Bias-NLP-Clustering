We know our son was murdered while he was at Lowndes High School. We do know that.\u201d\n\nAunt Anastasia Roe cited several initial inconsistencies that seemed to point to a more sinister cause of death for Kendrick Johnson, saying at the time:\n\n\u201cFirst we heard he was on the floor near the mat, then we hear he was wrapped in the mat. It\u2019s suspicious.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s family pushed for a second autopsy, and the findings after the exhumation directly contradicted the initial ruling \u2014 noting that the teenager died due to \u201cunexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma,\u201d entirely inconsistent with the original claim that there were \u201cno signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson\u2019s face or body\u201d and \u201cno significant injuries\u201d during the first autopsy. (Graphic images allegedly from Kendrick Johnson\u2019s autopsy have leaked to the internet following the controversy.)\n\nCNN reports that Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson commented on the possibility of a coroner\u2019s inquest into Kendrick Johnson\u2019s passing, saying:\n\n\u201cCoroner\u2019s inquests are not something you do every day. I cannot tell you the last time a coroner\u2019s inquest was done in this office\u2026 I want to do the right thing by the people and the county and all concerned; I\u2019m just not sure we have enough information. I\u2019m not about to refute anybody\u2019s findings because I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d\n\nThe second autopsy of Kendrick Johnson and the costs of exhumation were paid by his family. It\u2019s not currently clear what action if any law enforcement officials in Lowndes County will take in light of the findings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Kendrick Johnson was found dead in a rolled up gym mat in January, his death was ruled to be accidental despite the puzzling circumstances in which he was", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "When Kendrick Johnson was found dead in a rolled up gym mat in January, his death was ruled to be accidental despite the puzzling circumstances in which he was", "title": "Georgia Teen Kendrick Johnson\u2019s Death Ruled Not Accidental After Exhumation", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/936131/georgia-kendrick-johnsons-death-ruled-not-accidental-after-exhumation/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/kendrick-johnson-autopsy-photo.jpeg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-04T17:09:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-04T17:13:35+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/kendrick-johnson-autopsy-photo.jpeg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-09-04T17:09:28+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "kendrick johnson,kendrick johnson autopsy photo,kendrick johnson autopsy photo leaked,kendrick johnson blunt force trauma,kendrick johnson cause of death,kendrick johnson death,kendrick johnson murder,kendrick johnson second autopsy,who killed kendrick johnson,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/kendrick-johnson-autopsy-photo.jpeg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "When Kendrick Johnson was found dead in a rolled up gym mat in January, his death was ruled to be accidental despite the puzzling circumstances in which he was"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb66\"", "article_summary": "(Graphic images allegedly from Kendrick Johnson\u2019s autopsy have leaked to the internet following the controversy.)\nWhen Johnson\u2019s death was ruled accidental, dad Kenneth Johnson objected, telling a local news station:\u201cI want to express how did my son go missing during school hours in broad daylight?\nWhen Kendrick Johnson was found dead in a rolled up gym mat in January, his death was ruled to be accidental despite the puzzling circumstances in which he was discovered.\nI\u2019m not about to refute anybody\u2019s findings because I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201dThe second autopsy of Kendrick Johnson and the costs of exhumation were paid by his family.\nCNN reports that Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson commented on the possibility of a coroner\u2019s inquest into Kendrick Johnson\u2019s passing, saying:\u201cCoroner\u2019s inquests are not something you do every day."}
