Many locals and spring breakers are taking advantage of the warm weather by hitting the beach.

But even on cloudy days like Sunday, there's still a risk of getting burned.

The Gulf Coast glare is so strong, experts recommend limiting sun exposure, even when there's a cloud cover.

"Down hear I burn so easily, so I load up on sunscreen," Abby Siudak, a spring breaker from Illinois, said.

According to the National Weather Service, our area's UV index is already at a nine out of 12 this time of year. What that means, the average person may burn in about 25 minutes without sunscreen, even on a cloudy day.

The American Cancer Society says the risk of skin cancer increases with age, but melanoma is on the rise in young adults. In fact it's the most common cancer for people 25 to 29 years old. People in their late teens to late 30's are four to eight times more likely to develop skin cancer than they were a few decades ago.

The National Weather Service suggests covering up, seeking out the shade, and, "Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen." But not everyone's following that advice.

"I didn't use any sunscreen, no," one spring breaker said.

"It's in the back of my head, but for now, I think i'm okay with it," another spring breaker added.

"It's kind of scary, because a lot of young girls now, they want to be tan, and they want to be whatever, and I feel like it's kind of an addiction to be tan," Siudak said.

The Skin Cancer Foundation says early detection of skin cancer can sometimes make for routine removal, but melanoma survivors are nine times more likely to develop it again.

"I'd rather be pale than unhealthy," Siudak said.

The Panhandle's UV index will likely top the charts at 12 out of 12 in the next couple months.
