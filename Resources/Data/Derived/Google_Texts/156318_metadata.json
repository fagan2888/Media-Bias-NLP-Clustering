I\u2019m looking at what a lot of people think about that question, and my good friend Lacy Hunt\u2019s take on it has really added to the clarity of my own thinking. In today\u2019s Outside the Box, Lacy focuses first on the factors that made 2015 a disappointing year for the economy, and he points out that we were losing momentum as the year closed.\n\nAt this point we have to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why, after seven years of post-recession central bank stimulus, a doubling of US federal debt, and humongous stock-market gains, is the economy still limping along at stall speed? Well, it\u2019s about that stimulus, says Lacy:\n\nSince the introduction of unconventional and untested monetary policy operations like quantitative easing (QE) and forward guidance, an impressive amount of empirical evidence has emerged that casts considerable doubt on their efficacy. The historical facts regarding the grand experiment by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (Fed) are worth considering.\n\nIndeed. Lacy cites a study titled \u201cPersistent Overoptimism About Economic Growth,\u201d by Kevin J. Lansing and Benjamin Pyle of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, published in February 2015. The study systematically examines the Fed\u2019s forecasting record \u2013 a topic I\u2019ve been pounding away on for years, as you well know. Their conclusion:\n\nSince 2007, Federal Open Market Committee participants have been persistently too optimistic about future U.S. economic growth. Real GDP growth forecasts have typically started high, but then are revised down over time as the incoming data continue to disappoint.\n\nAnd the failure of QE, unrelenting forward guidance, and other radical (not to say desperate) central bank measures has not been limited to the efforts of the Federal Reserve \u2013 the central banks of Europe, Japan, and China have had no better results.\n\nBut again, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why haven\u2019t the best efforts of our earnest central bankers and their legions of computer-equipped economists turned the global economy around? A causal mechanism has been needed to explain their failure. And now we have it, Lacy tells us, in the form of a new book, Growing Global: Lessons for the New Enterprise, by Michael Spence (2001 recipient of the Nobel Prize in economics) and Kevin M. Warsh (former governor of the Federal Reserve), published in November 2015.\n\nHere is their causal argument:\n\nQE is unlike the normal conduct of monetary policy. It appears to be qualitatively and quantitatively different. In our judgment, QE may well redirect flows from the real economy to financial assets differently than the normal conduct of monetary policy\u2026. We believe the novel, long-term use of extraordinary monetary policy systematically biases decision-makers toward financial assets and away from real assets.\n\nFinancial assets, huh? Whoodathunkit? Lacy has much more to say on this, um, delicate subject \u2013 all of it worthwhile \u2013 but without stealing any more of his thunder, let me just mention that he will be one of the featured speakers at our upcoming Strategic Investment Conference, May 24\u201327 in Dallas. It\u2019s about time to hop on the bandwagon \u2013 if you register by January 31, you\u2019ll save $500 off the later rate.\n\nAnd have I mentioned that, in addition to all the fabulous speakers that are already on the program, Niall Ferguson and Jim Grant have both just committed to come to the conference and share their latest views? We\u2019ll be adding another half-dozen speakers in the next few weeks. We\u2019re still nailing down a few major names, but it looks like my goal of making sure the conference is better every year is very attainable.\n\nNow, without any further personal comments (as is my usual wont), let\u2019s jump into Lacy\u2019s latest and greatest. You have an excellent week!\n\nYour didn\u2019t know he could be this busy analyst,\n\nJoin John Mauldin in Dallas SIC 2016: Decade of Disruption Strategic Investment Conference May 24-27, 2016 | Hyatt Regency Dallas Register Now to Save $500\n\nHoisington Quarterly Review and Outlook \u2013 4Q2015\n\nA Weak Finish to a Disappointing Year\n\nThe economy was supposed to fire on all cylinders in 2015. Sufficient time had passed for the often-mentioned lags in monetary and scal policy to finally work their way through the system according to many pundits inside and outside the Fed. Surely the economy would be kick-started by: three rounds of quantitative easing and forward guidance; a record Federal Reserve balance sheet; and an unprecedented increase in federal debt from $9.99 trillion in 2008 to $18.63 trillion in 2015, a jump of 86%. Further, stock prices had gained sufficiently over the past several years, thus the so-called wealth effect would boost consumer spending.\n\nThe economic facts of 2015 displayed no impact from these massive government experiments. The broadest and most reliable measure of economic performance \u2013 nominal GDP \u2013 decelerated. The 3% estimated gain registered in 2015, measured by the year ending quarter, was down from 3.9% and 4.1%, respectively, in 2014 and 2013. In fact the gain in nominal GDP in 2015 was less than the gain for any year since the recession. The two components of nominal GDP also decelerated in 2015. Real GDP slowed to 2%, down from 2.5% in the prior two years, and the implicit price deflator rose by 1% compared with a 1.4% and 1.6% rise in 2014 and 2013, respectively. All of the above economic measures were expanding at, or near, their weakest yearly growth rates in the final quarter of 2015, indicating that the economy possessed little forward momentum moving into 2016.\n\nPersonal consumption, the largest category of nominal GDP, decelerated to an estimated 3% rise in the latest twelve months, down from 4% at year-end 2014, the smallest year end annual increase since immediately after the 2008-09 recession. The faltering consumer pattern occurred despite a significant lowering of credit standards that accelerated automotive lending. The percentage of total auto loans in the subprime category hit a ten-year pre-crisis high in the third quarter, according to the New York Fed. In addition, the Affordable Care Act has caused health outlays to surge. Excluding these two special circumstances, consumer spending was notably weak, providing additional confirmation that the so-called wealth effect remains elusive.\n\nOther important economic indicators reported outright contractions last year. Industrial production slumped 1.4% over the first eleven months of 2015, with a drop of 2% outside of the automotive sector. Only about 10% of private payroll employment is accounted for in the manufacturing sector. This fact distorts the true impact of this critical part on GDP. According to the Federal Reserve Statistical Release on Industrial Production, the industrial sector accounts for about one quarter of real GDP on a value added basis. The importance of this sector to corporate profits is considerably greater. Not surprisingly, corporate profits registered year-over-year declines in the latest two quarters available.
