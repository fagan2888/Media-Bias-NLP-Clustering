( Nate G via Google Maps )\n\nThe final countdown has begun for the last of three large state-run institutions that care for the severely disabled: In less than six years, almost all of their residents are likely to be transferred to other settings.\n\nIt\u2019s the end of a long era in providing care to people in large institutional settings\n\nThe public comment period ended last week on a plan to move 776 patients currently housed at the three development centers into smaller community-based homes. The state expects the move to save it roughly $250 million a year.\n\nThe average cost of caring for those patients \u2014 who have conditions such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, brain injuries and severe autism \u2014 is $500,000 a year per person, according to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office in Sacramento. Following previous closures of sister institutions and the transfer of their residents to smaller local facilities, the average cost fell to about $180,000 per patient.\n\nLast 3 Centers are in Sonoma, Costa Mesa and Porterville\n\nShutting down facilities in Sonoma and Costa Mesa, and partially closing a third site in Porterville, will not only save money on patient care, it also will open up some prime real estate opportunities for the state-owned sites. What the state will do with the land and the many large buildings that sit on it is still being publicly debated.\n\nThe Porterville site will move roughly half of its patients. The rest, 211 developmentally disabled felons in the center\u2019s secure treatment area, can\u2019t be moved into the community and will remain where they are.\n\nA much smaller state-run residential facility, Canyon Springs in Cathedral City \u2014 near Palm Springs \u2014 will continue to house its 55 residents.\n\nAlso up for debate in the Capitol next week will be the amount of money earmarked by the state to finance the closures and patient transitions. A legislative budget hearing on March 16 will examine the cost of doing so.\n\nConcerns of Insufficient Staffing\n\nA report released Friday by the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office raised concern about the potential loss of federal money during the roughly six years it will take to nearly empty the facilities.\n\nAccording to the LAO, federal officials have been worried about insufficient staffing and inadequate care at the centers, as well as their failure to follow up on cases of abuse and neglect.\n\nThe feds will be carefully monitoring the state to make sure it complies with all requirements for the health and safety of residents in the new, smaller community settings.\n\nThe state\u2019s final proposal will be presented to the legislature Apr. 1.\n\nThe plan is the latest \u2014 and last \u2014 move in California\u2019s shift away from providing care in large residential centers.\n\nOver the past two decades, the state has been slowly shuttering them and moving its developmentally disabled residents into smaller facilities. At the system\u2019s peak in 1968, 10 large developmental centers housed more than 13,000 patients.\n\nThe switch to community-based care in smaller group homes, along with the creation of 21 non-residential regional centers to coordinate that transition and provide other services across the state, has siphoned away most of the population at the larger centers.\n\nOver the past decade, the state shut down three other developmental centers \u2014 Agnews in Santa Clara, Lanterman in Pomona and Sierra Vista in Yuba City.\n\nOf the three big centers currently operating, Sonoma is expected to be closed by the end of 2018; the one in Costa Mesa and the non-secure area of Porterville, by the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cShift in Philosophy\u201d \u2014 With Some Criticism\n\nThe high cost of care is not the only reason for shutting down the centers, said John Doyle, chief deputy director of the state\u2019s Department of Developmental Services, which operates them and is coordinating the closures.\n\n\u201cEvery decision in government at some level is a monetary decision,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cBut this is more of a shift in philosophy.\u201d\n\nIn the newer model of care, he said, \u201cpeople can make their own decisions about their own life,\u201d rather than having their daily schedule dictated by an institution.\n\nThat thought is cold comfort for Christina Nielsen, whose son Tom has lived off and on for the past eight years at the Costa Mesa facility, known as the Fairview Developmental Center. He has severe autism and is called a \u201crunner.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom has a long history of wandering away and running,\u201d Nielsen said. A court order placed him in the Fairview center and he needs to stay there, she added.\n\nThe closure of the centers, Nielsen said, \u201cis a death sentence for my son, and others like him.\u201d\n\nNielsen said Tom has been moved three times already from Fairview\u2019s institutional setting to smaller \u201ccrisis centers\u201d \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t gone well.\n\n\u201cHe ran away from a caregiver and onto the 101 freeway and was hit by a car,\u201d she recounted. \u201cHe has been in three other crisis homes and failed [at] each of them.\u201d\n\nAs part of the closure plan, the state is creating half a dozen community crisis homes across the state, which have many clinical services built in for patients with complex physical issues. It is also creating homes that offer what officials call \u201cenhanced behavioral supports,\u201d such as medical staff members with special training.\n\n\u201cPeople will see it can work,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThere are people we serve already who have challenging behaviors who have never been institutionalized. So it definitely can work.\u201d\n\nDisability Rights California, a Sacramento-based advocacy group, has endorsed the decision to close the developmental centers.\n\n\u201cThis plan ensures that residents may safely and successfully transition into the community,\u201d said Jennifer Alfaro, a spokeswoman for the group. \u201cCalifornia has successfully closed other [developmental] centers, which demonstrates we know how to do this right.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Carolyn Davis of Huntington Beach, an 89-year-old mother of a longtime Fairview center patient.\n\n\u201cMy daughter moved out last May, and I was one of the ones who definitely did not want that to happen,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m not one to rant and rave about it, but they certainly knew how I felt about it.\u201d\n\nDavis said she\u2019s thrilled now, because her daughter is much happier and more engaged since she made the move to a smaller residential care facility in Long Beach.\n\n\u201cI spent sleepless nights worrying about whether or not she would be OK,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI really was not believing it could go as well as it did.\u201d\n\nBut, Davis added, she knows that won\u2019t be the case for all of the residents at Fairview.\n\n\u201cFor some people it almost is impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cOthers have not had it go so well.\u201d\n\nMaggie Flavia has big worries about the transfer of her 43-year-old son, Pete, who had viral encephalopathy as a youngster and now has the mental status of a 3-year-old, she said.\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s totally helpless, he\u2019s totally dependent, he cannot communicate,\u201d Flavia said. \u201cAnd I fear he\u2019s going to be in big trouble.\u201d\n\nDoyle said he understands that fear.\n\n\u201cFamily members are rightfully scared about their loved ones\u2019 well-being,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new community-based homes are \u201clike a mini-clinic,\u201d with ready access to physicians, well-trained staff members, and generators to run patients\u2019 life-sustaining machines for three days in case of a power outage, Doyle said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping some of these new models of homes will be an answer.\u201d\n\nFlavia remains unconvinced, but at the same time she knows hope is fading for the prospect of keeping Fairview open.\n\n\u201cWe have a big battle in front of us. So we have to fight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to do it. I\u2019m just a parent.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The plan is the latest \u2014 and last \u2014 move in California\u2019s shift away from providing care in large residential centers.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California's Last Institutions for Developmentally Disabled to be Closed\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/08\\/californias-last-institutions-for-developmentally-disabled-to-be-closed\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-08 10:31:08\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-08 11:45:20\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":157765,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Developmentally Disabled\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-08-at-10.27.58-AM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The plan is the latest \u2014 and last \u2014 move in California\u2019s shift away from providing care in large residential centers.", "title": "California\u2019s Last Institutions for Developmentally Disabled to be Closed", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/08/californias-last-institutions-for-developmentally-disabled-to-be-closed/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-08-at-10.27.58-AM.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "developmentally disabled,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So it definitely can work.\u201dDisability Rights California, a Sacramento-based advocacy group, has endorsed the decision to close the developmental centers.\nOver the past two decades, the state has been slowly shuttering them and moving its developmentally disabled residents into smaller facilities.\nAt the system\u2019s peak in 1968, 10 large developmental centers housed more than 13,000 patients.\nThe plan is the latest \u2014 and last \u2014 move in California\u2019s shift away from providing care in large residential centers.\nThe Sonoma Developmental Center is expected to close in 2018."}
