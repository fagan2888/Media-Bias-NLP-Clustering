The most recent installment of the survey, the first since the health law\u2019s major provisions kicked in, shows a reversal in that trend.\u201d Sanger-Katz adds \u201cThe survey also found that fewer people were avoiding doctors\u2019 visits because of concerns about cost.\u201d\n\nThe survey, by the Commonwealth Fund, is being cited by Sanger-Katz as a success story for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the increased \u201cfinancial security\u201d with regards to medical care was a \u201cmajor goal of the law.\u201d However, Sanger-Katz notes:\n\n[T]here is another trend cutting against those improving financial protections for individuals. Employers are increasingly asking their workers to pay deductibles and other fees when they seek health care, and several recent surveys have shown that the average size of those deductibles and fees is rising.\n\nIt\u2019s questionable to cite general \u201cincreased financial security\u201d as a means test for a law that requires major tax increases in order to function. Citing increased financial security as a success implies that the increase is pervasive, and as such, helps all who participate in the ACA.\n\nHowever, while some Americans are paying less, some are paying more. Much more.\n\nAccording to a NYT/CBS poll conducted in December, 33% of Americans say that they are paying substantially higher prices for their care \u201cover the last few years\u201d than they were previously.\n\nAdditionally, according to Fox News, the tax increases levied against Americans because of the ACA appear to have the effect of a transfer of wealth, rather than a net benefit. Fox breaks down the share of the ACA tax burden Americans will pay over the next ten years, according to their income bracket:\n\n\u201cIf you make under $15,000: it\u2019s just over $59.00. If you make between $50,000 and $100,000, it\u2019s $6,069.90. And if you make between $200,000 and $250,000, it\u2019s $38,200.66\u201d\n\nThe NYT article doesn\u2019t take into account the spectrum of \u201cincreased\u201d financial security. Some may be benefiting from the ACA because they are seeing reduced costs \u2014 driving down the number of \u201cfinancially distressed\u201d Americans \u2014 the increased burden on the middle, and upper class isn\u2019t being measured.\n\nWhile some lower-income Americans may be benefiting from the ACA, premiums are increasing for others. It\u2019s truly an exchange of wealth, and that exchange is resulting in fewer Americans \u201cexperiencing financial distress,\u201d according to the cited study.\n\nAlthough the reduction in \u201cfinancial distress\u201d for a small portion of individuals is certainly a piece of the puzzle in terms of measuring the success of the ACA, there are numerous other factors at play that have equal or greater weight, such as rising premiums and increased tax burdens.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"...the increased burden on the middle, and upper class isn't being measured.\"", "published_at": "2015-01-15T12:35:33+00:00", "tags": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"...the increased burden on the middle, and upper class isn't being measured.\"", "title": "New York Times Claims Obamacare Success With One Single Survey", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 621, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ObamacareNYT.jpg", "height": 380}, "updated_time": "2015-01-15T13:01:36-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/01/232979-new-york-times-claims-obamacare-success-one-deceptive-survey/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"...the increased burden on the middle, and upper class isn't being measured.\"", "creator": "@injo", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ObamacareNYT.jpg", "title": "New York Times Claims Obamacare Success With One Single Survey", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Frank Camp", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-15T12:35:33-04:00", "wp-categories": "579 14074 14075 14087 14077 482 1471", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/01/232979-new-york-times-claims-obamacare-success-one-deceptive-survey/", "wp-category-slugs": "business, companies-business, economy-business, health, markets-business, nation, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-01-15T12:35:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T13:01:36-04:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ObamacareNYT.jpg", "post_id": 232979, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe202c\"", "article_summary": "And if you make between $200,000 and $250,000, it\u2019s $38,200.66\u201dThe NYT article doesn\u2019t take into account the spectrum of \u201cincreased\u201d financial security.\nCiting increased financial security as a success implies that the increase is pervasive, and as such, helps all who participate in the ACA.\nIt\u2019s questionable to cite general \u201cincreased financial security\u201d as a means test for a law that requires major tax increases in order to function.\nIt\u2019s truly an exchange of wealth, and that exchange is resulting in fewer Americans \u201cexperiencing financial distress,\u201d according to the cited study.\nFox breaks down the share of the ACA tax burden Americans will pay over the next ten years, according to their income bracket:\u201cIf you make under $15,000: it\u2019s just over $59.00."}
