Two rooms will get a makeover and a brand new outdoor recreational area will be put together.\n\nFive Star Veterans Center is a nonprofit corporation that helps homeless vets get back on their feet by providing meals, transportation and helping them get a job.\n\nThis project is part of an effort by Home Depot to help and give back to U.S. military veterans and their families.\n\n\n\nSince 2011, The Home Depot Foundation has invested more than $110 million to provide safe housing to veterans, and along with the help of Team Depot volunteers, has transformed more than 25,000 homes for veterans across the country.\n\nTo learn more and see Team Depot, visit www.homedepot.com/teamdepot.
