(AP) - State environmental regulators are considering a rule that would allow oil companies to reuse water that\u2019s already flowed through drilling operations to help reduce the amount of freshwater the industry consumes.\n\nThe New Mexico Environment Department is working with the Oil Conservation Commission on the new regulation, agency Secretary David Martin told the Hobbs News-Sun this week (http://goo.gl/6dyY6f ).\n\n\u201cIt has been worked on for several months now,\u201d Martin said. \u201cOnce it is finalized, it will go to OCC, and we are expecting that will probably happen in October, no later than November.\u201d\n\nThe draft of the rule is expected this month. Currently, state rules don\u2019t allow water to be reused because of environmental concerns that it may contaminate freshwater supplies.\n\nThe changes New Mexico is looking to adopt are similar to those used in Texas, where water is already being reused in drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, operations, Martin said.\n\n\u201cI had a local producer in Hobbs tell me we need to get away from fresh water,\u201d Martin added. \u201cThe economics on reusing produced water is right in there with using fresh water. Historically, produced water has been viewed pretty much as waste, but we want to get away from disposing of it and instead making it an asset.\u201d\n\nJohn Tintera, president of the Texas Water Recycling Commission, said he met with New Mexico environmental regulators and industry representatives earlier this year to plan the rule.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico is in a very exciting time in its regulatory environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is poised for great things. With it comes the economic boom and the hurdles, one of those is water and there has been a great deal of attention in Texas because of the drought.\u201d\n\nState officials say oil and gas operations use only a fraction of the water consumed in the state - less than 1 percent - while agriculture and residential use dominate the largest shares.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State environmental regulators are considering a rule that would allow oil companies to reuse water that's already flowed through drilling operations to help reduce the amount of freshwater the industry consumes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/22/new-mexico-rule-changing-fracking-water-reuse-eyed/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "State environmental regulators are considering a rule that would allow oil companies to reuse water that\u2019s already flowed through drilling operations to help reduce the amount of freshwater the industry consumes.", "title": "New Mexico weighs allowing reuse of drilling water"}, "twitter": {"description": "State environmental regulators are considering a rule that would allow oil companies to reuse water that's already flowed through drilling operations to help reduce the amount of freshwater the indust", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "New Mexico weighs allowing reuse of drilling water"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7499\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI had a local producer in Hobbs tell me we need to get away from fresh water,\u201d Martin added.\nThe changes New Mexico is looking to adopt are similar to those used in Texas, where water is already being reused in drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, operations, Martin said.\nHOBBS, N.M.
