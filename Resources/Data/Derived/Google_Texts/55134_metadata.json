Officials told the boys' parents they could release the information whenever they were ready. Personal items, including a cellphone, were still on board when the boat was found.\n\nThe boat was originally found last summer just two days after the boys went missing, but it washed back out to sea before a crew could secure it.\n\nThe boys got lost at sea July 24 after severe weather hit the Florida coast. The search for Austin and Perry went on for about a week until the U.S. Coast Guard called it off. But the families aren't giving up.\n\nPerry's parents told Palm Beach Post, \"This is an open missing persons case, and we hope that FWC reopens their investigation and utilizes the expert resources of other government agencies as well as the private sector if necessary to extrapolate the data from the recovered iPhone.\"\n\nThe boat and its contents are expected to return to the U.S. in the middle of May.\n\nThis video includes images from Perry J.
