The McAuliffe campaign didn\u2019t directly dispute the claim initially, but tells us that McAuliffe supports existing Virginia laws on abortion that prohibit third-trimester abortions except to protect the life or health of the mother.\n\nAs for the claim that McAuliffe wants Virginia taxpayers to pay for on-demand abortion, that\u2019s thinly based on McAuliffe\u2019s support for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which includes language forbidding taxpayer dollars from being used to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\n\nWith polls showing McAuliffe performing well among women, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate has been attacking (and stretching the truth on) Republican opponent Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s opposition to abortion. The ad from Virginia Principles Fund turns the tables and attacks McAuliffe\u2019s support for abortion rights. It is part of a $300,000 TV ad campaign.\n\nIn the ad, the narrator states, \u201cTerry McAuliffe supports abortion on demand at any time for any reason \u2014 paid for by Virginia taxpayers.\u201d It\u2019s a claim that abortion foes and the Cuccinelli campaign have been making for months, without direct denials from the McAuliffe campaign.\n\n\u201cDespite being asked by reporters on multiple occasions if he disputes the characterization of his position as supporting \u2018abortion on demand at any time, for any reason, paid for by Virginia taxpayers,\u2019 he and his campaign have declined to do so,\u201d Sarah Huckabee, who heads Virginia Principles Fund, told us via email.\n\nHuckabee, daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, pointed to a March 19 story in the Washington Post in which Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, claimed that McAuliffe \u201csupports a platform of abortion on-demand at any time, for any reason, paid for by Virginia taxpayers.\u201d The Post article noted that \u201cMcAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin declined to say whether Dannenfelser had accurately represented McAuliffe\u2019s position on abortion.\u201d\n\nHuckabee also cited a July 29 story in Politico, which included this claim from Cuccinelli spokeswoman Anna Nix: \u201cTerry McAuliffe\u2019s support for taxpayer funded abortions, abortion up to the moment of birth and abortion for sex selection is an extreme position by any and every estimate.\u201d The article didn\u2019t include any response from the McAuliffe campaign about that characterization of his position.\n\nSo is silence the same thing as a position statement? It is not.\n\nWe reached out to the McAuliffe campaign and asked whether the ad accurately reflected McAuliffe\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a totally inaccurate attack,\u201d McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote to us in an email. \u201cHe [McAuliffe] supports keeping existing Virginia laws on when abortions are legal and trusts women to make their own health care decisions.\u201d\n\nVirginia law prohibits third-trimester abortions except to protect the life or health of the mother, according to a Sept. 1 review of state policies on late-term abortions by the Guttmacher Institute (see page 3).\n\nWe could not find that McAuliffe has made any public statements echoing Schwerin\u2019s, and we asked if the McAuliffe campaign could provide any public statement, position paper or questionnaire in which McAuliffe signaled his support for keeping intact current Virginia laws on when abortions are legal.\n\nSchwerin directed us to a Sept. 9 story in the Washington Post, which states, \u201cMcAuliffe campaign says he \u2018supports keeping existing Virginia laws on when abortions are legal.\u2019 The state currently prohibits third-trimester abortions except to protect the life of the mother.\u201d That\u2019s two weeks before the Virginia Principles Fund ad began airing.\n\nWe also found a Sept. 15 written position statement from the McAuliffe campaign submitted to the Daily Press in Newport News, Va., which states, \u201cAs governor, Terry will protect women\u2019s access to all health care options available under Virginia law, including preventive care, contraception and safe and legal abortion.\u201d\n\nGiven the statement by the McAuliffe campaign directly contradicting the ad\u2019s claim, the onus is on Virginia Principles Fund to back up its assertion. And a non-denial from the McAuliffe campaign doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nAs for the claim that McAuliffe wants abortions \u201cpaid for by Virginia taxpayers,\u201d according to backup material provided by Huckabee, that stems from McAuliffe\u2019s support for implementing the Affordable Care Act in Virginia. The law includes specific language forbidding taxpayer dollars from being used to pay for abortions. But as we have written in the past, that is an issue that abortion foes vehemently contest.\n\nFactCheck.org, Oct. 28, 2010: Strictly speaking, [the law] does not [use taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion], except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother\u2019s life, the same government restrictions that have applied to Medicaid recipients, federal workers and the military. The controversy stems from how the law aims to guarantee those rules are followed when the government provides subsidies to purchase insurance. The law says that those receiving subsidies to buy insurance through state-based exchanges must submit a separate payment to cover abortion services (if they choose a plan that covers abortions), and insurance providers must keep federal money separate from private payments to ensure the federal money does not go toward abortion coverage. President Obama also signed an executive order reaffirming the federal rules on only funding abortion in cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother\u2019s life. Does that go too far or not far enough? That depends on one\u2019s viewpoint, and we\u2019ll let readers be the judge.\n\nHuckabee passed along a story from Breitbart.com in which former Democratic congressman Bart Stupak, an abortion opponent who was pivotal in helping forge the compromise deal with Obama that led to the executive order, contended that Obama had violated the executive order when the Department of Health and Human Services later mandated that large employers provide insurance that covers certain types of contraception, including the so-called morning-after pill, or Plan B. The pill acts in a way that some consider the same as chemically induced abortions. However, it is not the same thing as the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d RU-486, the controversial medication that can induce abortion in women who are up to nine weeks pregnant.\n\nAs we explained when this issue arose during the Republican presidential primary: \u201cThe \u2018morning-after pill\u2019 can prevent pregnancy, but won\u2019t affect established pregnancies, if taken within a few days of unprotected sex. It is essentially a high dose of birth control pills. It delays ovulation and can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. It\u2019s true that some abortion opponents say the pill, along other forms of birth control, is an abortifacient, which is a drug that induces abortion. But it is not known as \u2018the abortion pill,\u2019 which is a much more controversial topic.\u201d\n\nWe could find no public statement in which McAuliffe expressed support for taxpayer-funded abortions. According to Huckabee, it\u2019s more in what McAuliffe has not said.\n\n\u201cOn his own campaign website, McAuliffe says, \u2018I strongly believe that women should be able to make their own healthcare decisions without interference from Washington or Richmond.\u2019 Nothing about restrictions for late-term abortions \u2013 simply no \u2018interference,\u2019 \u201d Huckabee said. \u201cNothing in his record or public statements suggests McAuliffe\u2019s position is anything other than support for \u2018abortion on demand at any time, for any reason, paid for by Virginia taxpayers.'\u201d\n\nBut again, the non-denial of a claim made by political opponents isn\u2019t the same thing as assent. Particularly not when McAuliffe\u2019s campaign says he supports current Virginia law, which prohibits abortions after the third trimester.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9e8\"", "article_summary": "The ad from Virginia Principles Fund turns the tables and attacks McAuliffe\u2019s support for abortion rights.\nWe reached out to the McAuliffe campaign and asked whether the ad accurately reflected McAuliffe\u2019s position.\nParticularly not when McAuliffe\u2019s campaign says he supports current Virginia law, which prohibits abortions after the third trimester.\n\u201cNothing in his record or public statements suggests McAuliffe\u2019s position is anything other than support for \u2018abortion on demand at any time, for any reason, paid for by Virginia taxpayers.\nAnd a non-denial from the McAuliffe campaign doesn\u2019t cut it."}
