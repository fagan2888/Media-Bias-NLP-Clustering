On Thursday night at Montreal’s “Just for Laughs” festival, Michael Che was in the mood to try new things. One of the latest additions to “The Daily Show w/ Jon Stewart,” Che is a stand-up comedian five years into his career.

He’s written for “Saturday Night Live” and has been hailed by Rolling Stone and Variety as a major new talent. But at his 10:30pm show at the Theatre Sainte-Catherine, Che wasn’t going for the kill. He sauntered onto stage with a beer in hand and spent most of the show feeling out concepts and interacting with the crowd.

“I was really just trying to find new premises, new ideas,” he said the next day. “Sometimes I’ll throw ideas out just to see how the crowd reacts. Are they even interested in this subject? Like a chemist, you’re just putting things together and seeing what happens.”

Che’s onstage cadence is like an upright bass solo: Laid back and a little soft, but punctuated with the occasional rattling note to emphasize an idea. On Thursday he pondered what makes a couple truly intimate (Hint: It involves the toilet) and why it was that the people of Middle East haven’t offered to help relieve the current crisis in inner-city Chicago.

In this video clip, Che explains why tries to find jokes out of unfunny subject matter.
