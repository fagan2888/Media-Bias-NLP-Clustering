Wednesday is the last day to pay the first month's premium.\n\nBecause of delays in processing applications, insurance companies agreed to extend coverage back to Jan. 1st as long as they received the first payment by Jan. 15th.\n\nBut many customers have reported delays in receiving their first bill. Because of that, insurers will be willing to work with people who miss the payment deadline but can prove they made a \"good faith effort\" to pay on time, according to Nicole Evans, spokeswoman for the California Association of Health Plans.\n\nWednesday's second deadline is for people who have not yet signed up for coverage. It's the last day to sign up for a plan that begins on Feb. 1st. If you sign up between Jan. 16th and Feb. 15th, your plan won't take effect until March 1st.\n\nThe same formula will apply through the end of open enrollment on March 31st. Sign up by March 15th, and your coverage will start on April 1st. Sign up between March 16th and March 31st, and it won\u2019t begin until May 1st.\n\nExcept for those who qualify for an exemption, people who fail to buy health insurance will face a tax penalty.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Wednesday is the last day to pay the first month's premium for Jan. 1 coverage.
