But Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for the Second Amendment and his embrace of a 15 percent corporate tax, ObamaCare repeal, health savings accounts, waterboarding and securing the southern \u201cborder\u201d demonstrate that he\u2019s quite conservative \u2014 if not every time, then many times.\n\nClinton, however, is not a consistent conservative. She is not even an occasional conservative. She is an anti-conservative. Nowhere is Hillary to the right of Lincoln . . . Chaffee. She favors devolving power and tax dollars to the states . . . never.\n\nThis is the verdict that 10,924,682 GOP primary voters have reached: On one side, an inconsistent conservative who will stand with the right \u2014 not always, but at least sometimes, and perhaps often.\n\nOn the other side, either a self-avowed socialist from Vermont (who wins primaries but gets swamped by undemocratic superdelegates) or, more likely, a stealth socialist who is nearly as far-left, but also deeply, irretrievably corrupt.\n\nOne of today\u2019s enduring mysteries is why Hillary isn\u2019t already wearing a prison-striped pantsuit after abusing 2,115 classified emails, the Wall Street Journal calculates, and benefiting from the bribes-for-favors pump called the Clinton Foundation. She\u2019s under active investigation by \u201cfewer than 50\u201d FBI agents, the Washington Post reports.\n\nBut, phantasmagorically, this bothers the left about as much as if she acquired 49 new Facebook friends.\n\nAnd remember the Supreme Court seat so unexpectedly vacated by the late Antonin Scalia? Assuming that vacuum persists, Trump might fill it with federal appellate Judge Janice Rogers Brown, Arizona Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick or US Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\n\nThere is zero chance Hillary even would glance at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of these committed constitutionalists. The best-case scenario is that she would nominate former Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz to the Supremes. Conversely, she could reward Obama for keeping her unindicted by tapping him to occupy Scalia\u2019s chair \u2014 for life.\n\nThus, on Election Day, I will pull the lever for my fifth choice for president: Donald J. Trump. He\u2019s the only thing standing between America and the woman who would turn our exceptional country into Christina Kirchner\u2019s Argentina, if we\u2019re lucky, or Hugo Chavez\u2019s Venezuela, if we aren\u2019t.\n\n\n\nDeroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor and a contributing editor with National Review Online.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "I\u2019m sorry, I tried.\nIn print, on air, online and in person, I urged GOP primary voters to send to the White House \u2014 chronologically \u2014 Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.
