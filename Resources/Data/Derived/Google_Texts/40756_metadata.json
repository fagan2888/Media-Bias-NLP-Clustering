Well, now you have a chance to experience it \u2014 through a body suit known as the R70i. Though it looks like an astronaut suit with a jetpack, it\u2019s built to impair your physical movements, eyesight, and overall ability to do things. You know, just like an old person.\n\nThe suit was financed by Genworth Financial \u2014 a company that sells long-term care insurance and has a particular interest in educating people about aging. The suit simulates the effects of physical decline on your body \u2014 creating extra weight for you to carry around, making it hard to lift your arms due to \u201carthritis\u201d pressure on joints, and recreating what it feels like to gain that extra weight when you\u2019re older. But it also recreates cognitive, sight, and hearing problems \u2014 complete with a helmet that uses augmented reality to give you the impression of glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye disorders. Microphones make it harder for you to hear and recreate tinnitus in your ears.\n\nNew super suit simulates aging for millennials: http://t.co/d6wYk4uAFM #r70i pic.twitter.com/4XK7lo7t4V \u2014 Gogo Lidz (@gogolidz) July 10, 2015\n\nSound awful? Probably because it is. But Genworth\u2019s ultimate goal is to make people realize how much aging really affects you, and to stress the importance of taking care of your mind and body while you still have youth and energy.\n\n\u201cHaving \u2018the talk\u2019 about long-term care with loved ones can be an awkward conversation because of the sensitive subject matter,\u201d Tom McInerney, president and CEO of Genworth, said in a 2014 press release (when the original R70 came out). \u201cFurthermore, many young adults often feel invincible to the physical changes and challenges that aging can present.\u201d\n\nIs the ridiculous suit a brilliant way to get people interested in long-term care insurance? Probably. But can it also teach us something really important? Absolutely.\n\nIndeed, consistent exercise, mental challenges, and maintaining a healthy weight all play a role in how quickly you age. Exercise has been linked to a decrease in the shortening of telomeres, which impact cellular aging and the decline of your health. And to add a cherry on top, focus on healthy foods that have been linked to cognitive protection \u2014 such as fish, nuts, and blueberries. If you protect yourself, getting older may not be so bad after all.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "r70i, suit, forces, people, face, perils, aging, what, it, feels, age, 30, years", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ever wondered what it will be like when you\u2019re dragging around extra weight, can\u2019t see too far ahead of you, and can barely lift your arms over your head?", "title": "This Is What It Feels Like To Age 30 Years [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/r70i-suit-forces-people-face-perils-aging-what-it-feels-age-30-years-343960", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/21/r70i-suit-forces-people-face-perils-aging-what-it-feels-age-30-years.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ever wondered what it will be like when you\u2019re dragging around extra weight, can\u2019t see too far ahead of you, and can barely lift your arms over your head?", "title": "This Is What It Feels Like To Age 30 Years [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/r70i-suit-forces-people-face-perils-aging-what-it-feels-age-30-years-343960", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/21/r70i-suit-forces-people-face-perils-aging-what-it-feels-age-30-years.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/21/r70i-suit-forces-people-face-perils-aging-what-it-feels-age-30-years.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-07-21T12:02:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-21T12:02:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ever wondered what it will be like when you\u2019re dragging around extra weight, can\u2019t see too far ahead of you, and can barely lift your arms over your head?"}, "article_summary": "New super suit simulates aging for millennials: http://t.co/d6wYk4uAFM #r70i pic.twitter.com/4XK7lo7t4V \u2014 Gogo Lidz (@gogolidz) July 10, 2015Sound awful?\nWell, now you have a chance to experience it \u2014 through a body suit known as the R70i.\nThe suit was financed by Genworth Financial \u2014 a company that sells long-term care insurance and has a particular interest in educating people about aging.\n\u201cFurthermore, many young adults often feel invincible to the physical changes and challenges that aging can present.\u201dIs the ridiculous suit a brilliant way to get people interested in long-term care insurance?\nThough it looks like an astronaut suit with a jetpack, it\u2019s built to impair your physical movements, eyesight, and overall ability to do things."}
