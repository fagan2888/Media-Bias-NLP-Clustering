Nuggets guard Will Barton on Saturday gave back to his hometown.

Barton held the free Elite Basketball Camp at St. Francis Academy in Baltimore.

“We’re providing good coaching, good guidance and the importance of a positive attitude,” Barton said.

Saturday’s camp was the third that Barton has sponsored, but the need for positive activities was magnified this year by the civil unrest that has hit the area. Thirty students attended.

Barton made it a hands-on day, participating in the drills and instruction.
