Guests include philosophers, economists, other Cato scholars. Rather than focusing on current public policy issues, we try to take a deeper look at how libertarians see the world.\n\nNick Gillespie and Matt Welch joined us for this week\u2019s episode, and Jason Kuznicki filled in for Aaron. We discuss whether there is a growing movement of independents that is a cause for optimism among libertarians. Are we in for a better, more libertarian era than ever before? Or should we be skeptical of this kind of optimism, given the growth of the federal government in recent years?\n\nYou can also subscribe to the iTunes feed or the RSS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On this episode of Free Thoughts, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch discuss the past and future of libertarianism.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "On this episode of Free Thoughts, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch discuss the past and future of libertarianism.", "title": "Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch on the New Episode of \"Free Thoughts,\" the Libertarianism.org Podcast", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/nick-gillespie-matt-welch-new-episode-libertarianismorg-podcast", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/nick-gillespie-matt-welch-new-episode-libertarianismorg-podcast", "title": "Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch on the New Episode of \"Free Thoughts,\" the Libertarianism.org Podcast", "description": "On this episode of Free Thoughts, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch discuss the past and future of libertarianism.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2014/2/18", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-18T15:54:01-05:00"}, "publication_date": "2014/2/18", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Libertarianism, Nick Gillespie, Matt Welch"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcceeb\"", "article_summary": "Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch joined us for this week\u2019s episode, and Jason Kuznicki filled in for Aaron.\nOn Free Thoughts, the newish podcast from Libertarianism.org, Aaron Ross Powell, myself, and our guests explore the deep questions in libertarian thought.\nWe discuss whether there is a growing movement of independents that is a cause for optimism among libertarians.\nRather than focusing on current public policy issues, we try to take a deeper look at how libertarians see the world.\nOr should we be skeptical of this kind of optimism, given the growth of the federal government in recent years?"}
