Its first actions are attempts to water down the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act, and repealing Obamacare -- which will pass the risks of financial meltdowns and medical catastrophes back to us, the taxpayers.\n\nIn economic parlance, it is socializing the costs of doing business in order to maximize the profits of business. The attempts to weaken financial regulations are \"Kicking Dodd-Frank In the Teeth,\" said Gretchen Morgensen in her most recent New York Times Sunday Oped.\n\nThe 114th Congress has been at work for less than a week, but a goal for many of its members is already evident: a further rollback of regulations put in place to keep markets and Main Street safe from reckless Wall Street practices.\n\nThe story of Republicans' opposition to Obamacare is no different. By attempting to roll back the eligibility of millions of uninsured Americans with the Repubs various challenges to the federal health exchange, Republicans will return the cost of maintaining health care once again to taxpayers, by putting those sickest Americans back in hospital emergency rooms, or on government welfare rolls, thus maximizing health costs (which have been declining since Obamacare kicked in). This is even though medical bankruptcies outnumber all other bankruptcies.\n\nWhy don't Republicans get that this flies in the face of their own ideals of self-sufficiency? Even more egregious for working Americans are their attempts to lower wages and salaries by weakening unions and the collective bargaining of government employees in states like Wisconsin. The result of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's efforts has been slower growth, a larger budget deficit, and less incentives for government employees to increase productivity.\n\nEven California Republican Ron Unz knew this with his initiative to raise the California minimum wage to $12 per hour, which would take many minimum wage-earners off the welfare rolls, yet California Republicans have even opposed that!\n\nIt is socialism in a big way that Republicans have always accused Democrats of -- putting the cost of running the U.S. on government, rather than individuals and private industry.\n\nIt's something President Roosevelt voiced during the Great Depression.\n\nThe test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.\n\nAnd until Republicans understand this, they will continue to be the minority party.\n\nFollow Harlan Green on Twitter: www.twitter.com/HarlanGreen", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new Republican Congress is exposing ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-01-14 13:33:20 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The new Republican Congress is exposing ...", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harlan-green/republicans-are-the-real-_b_6456360.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "The new Republican Congress is exposing ...", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "HarlanGreen"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-13 13:33:20 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6456360", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "wisconsin governor scott walker,obamacare,Dodd-Frank Act,John Boehner,House Republicans,President Roosevelt,fdr,Great Depression,Gretchen Morgensen", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "wisconsin governor scott walker,obamacare,Dodd-Frank Act,John Boehner,House Republicans,President Roosevelt,fdr,Great Depression,Gretchen Morgensen", "published_time": "2015-01-13 13:33:20 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-03-15 05:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0640\"", "article_summary": "Even California Republican Ron Unz knew this with his initiative to raise the California minimum wage to $12 per hour, which would take many minimum wage-earners off the welfare rolls, yet California Republicans have even opposed that!\nWhy don't Republicans get that this flies in the face of their own ideals of self-sufficiency?\nThe story of Republicans' opposition to Obamacare is no different.\nAnd until Republicans understand this, they will continue to be the minority party.\nIn economic parlance, it is socializing the costs of doing business in order to maximize the profits of business."}
