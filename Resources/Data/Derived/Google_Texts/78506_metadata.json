(Stock photo)\n\nThe idea that government should run like a business has been repeated to the point of becoming a clich\u00e9, but the need for efficiency and improved customer service is real. And like any good business, agencies must understand their customers in order to succeed, and they are increasingly looking to technology to better manage those relationships.\n\nCustomer relationship management refers to the interaction between producer and consumer. The hallmark image of CRM in action is a call center that customers contact to complain, compliment or inquire. The organization uses data about those calls to not only help customers but also to inform and refine its broader business operations.\n\nAlthough an office full of employees wearing headsets to communicate with customers is a familiar concept, it is a woefully outdated image for today's CRM. Strategy and services that combine social media, big data and personalized Web accounts are becoming more prevalent throughout the federal government. In fact, the widespread use of social media has given way to a new type of CRM known as social relationship management. Agencies can monitor the social discourse on government-related topics rather than waiting for individuals to contact them.\n\nAnd cloud computing has opened the door for vendors such as Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Deltek to offer CRM services to agencies at a lower cost.\n\nFederal CRM efforts are as varied as the agencies deploying them. The Department of Veterans Affairs uses Blue Button to enable veterans to access their health records electronically, and VA also has a \"veterans relationship management\" system called 21st Century-One Vet. The Justice Department manages \"customers\" currently in litigation, while Citizenship and Immigration Services is using Microsoft Dynamics CRM platform to enhance the E-Verify program. And CRM is a central topic on the agenda for the Defense Information Systems Agency's Enterprise Service Management Framework Forum and Consortium, scheduled for Nov. 19-20.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe White House's Executive Order 13571 \u2014 Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service \u2014 states that \"with advances in technology and service delivery systems in other sectors, the public's expectations of the government have continued to rise. The government must keep pace with and even exceed those expectations.\"\n\nThe 2011 order references a 1993 measure that called for agencies to establish service standards and methods of measuring performance. Since then, new cloud computing options, expanded website and mobile capabilities, and improved identity management have expanded what's possible.\n\n5 steps to better CRM Pierre Hulsebus, manager of the customer relationship management practice at Echelbarger, Himebaugh, Tamm and Co., shared these tips on the firm's blog. 1. Establish a sensible vision for the future. Customer relationship management is about more than implementing a technology. It should be seen as a means for making customer service more efficient. 2. Let the management team lead the way. Managers and leaders should be at the forefront of implementing and using new CRM methods. 3. Be open to customer feedback. And don't assume you know what the customer wants before he or she tells you. 4. Get the big picture. Imagine the steps your customers have to go through and identify possible inefficiencies. 5. Have a road map but stay flexible. \"Realize that improving your customer relationships is not a destination \u2014 it is a journey,\" Hulsebus wrote. \"As customer needs change, so should your CRM strategic map.\" .\n\n\"Government managers must learn from what is working in the private sector and apply these best practices to deliver services better, faster and at lower cost,\" the order states. \"Such best practices include increasingly popular lower-cost, self-service options accessed by the Internet or mobile phone and improved processes that deliver services faster and more responsively, reducing the overall need for customer inquiries and complaints.\"\n\nWhether the executive order is the proverbial chicken or egg is unclear, however. Wayne Bobby, vice president of industry solutions at Oracle, said people already expect to be a click or tweet away from the government.\n\nThey want to \"know what the government's doing in any step along the way as it relates to information that impacts a citizen, cases that may impact a citizen,\" Bobby said. \"So you've got an increased level of demand for transparency from citizens with their government.\"\n\nThe fundamentals\n\n\"The classic definition of CRM...is that it was an application that allowed an organization, like the federal government or a business, to really manage all aspects of their interactions with their customers,\" said Dan Burton, a senior vice president at Saleforce.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "customer relationship management, crm, salesforce", "og": {"url": "https://fcw.com/articles/2013/09/09/exectech-crm-citizen.aspx", "image": "https://fcw.com/~/media/GIG/FCWNow/Topics/Concepts/call_center.png", "site_name": "FCW", "description": "The image of an office full of call-center employees wearing headsets to communicate with customers is a common association for customer relationship management, but it is woefully outdated.
