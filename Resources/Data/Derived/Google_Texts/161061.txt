A string of recent vehicle thefts in southwest Oklahoma City is hitting the victims hard in their pocketbooks.

The bad guys aren't stealing cars, trucks or SUVs, they're taking the tires and wheels off of them. Police say it's happened eight times in the past month.

Bryan Nies is one of at least two people who had the tires and wheels stolen off their vehicles early Tuesday morning.

"It's just kind of scary to think somebody was that close to my house, my kids. And I didn't hear em, you know," Nies said.

Nies says while he does have insurance, he's still on the hook for the $500 deductible.

"It's an intrusion definitely, " he said.

David Stanley Chevrolet Parts Salesman Kelly Elam says if you can't keep your vehicles in your garage at night, make sure your driveway is well-lit. He says spending $40 on a set of wheel locks is also a good way to "slow the bad guys down."
