The reason is that the games help people learn, even those who aren\u2019t regular players.\n\n\u201cPeople who play action video games get better much faster,\u201d said Bavelier, who has a joint appointment at the University of Geneva in Switzerland.\n\nThe skills are seemingly unrelated to each other and hard to practice, she said.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, explains the diverse benefits that stem from faster learning.\n\nThe insights from the study may be used to improve education or to help people with strokes or other brain injuries.\n\nPlayers were better able to predict what was coming next, even when they were asked to identify patterns that had nothing to do with the game.\n\nNon-gamers also improved after researchers assigned them to play a game like \u201cCall of Duty\u201d for as long as two hours a day, five times a week for two months. The benefits lasted as long as a year.\n\n\u201cI can show that playing the video game itself improves their performance,\u201d said Bavelier. \u201cBut all video games don\u2019t lead to improvement.\u201d\n\nA comparison group of people was asked to play social games like Electronic Arts Inc.\u2019s \u201cThe Sims 2,\u201d which don\u2019t feature rapid action. Those players didn\u2019t reap any benefits, the study found.\n\nThe fast-paced games \u2014 generally first- or third-person shooting video games \u2014 created better learners. An examination of how their brains were wired showed that the connectivity adapted as the games progressed, Bavelier said. \u201cThe brain has not just one neuron, but networks of neurons talking to each other,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the task, they were changing their connectivity on the fly to match the task at hand. They knew what was important to pay attention to and what was noise and distraction, and they could suppress distractions.\u201d\n\nThe researchers are now examining the details of each game to try to tease out which elements are critical for improved learning, she said. They are designing a nonviolent game that includes the elements they believe are important for learning, aimed at children ages 8 to 12.\n\nFor children, teenagers and young adults who do play video games, the findings aren\u2019t an excuse to spend hours a day in front of a screen, she said.\n\nWhile learning improves, other measures of brain function may worsen.\n\n\u201cThis is no excuse for binging,\u201d Bavelier said. \u201cWe know that kids who spend a lot of time on computers do less well at school. If you spend too much time on this new media, you spend less time on homework and you will do less well.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Michelle Fay Cortez, Bloomberg News", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/games-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbbf\"", "article_summary": "The fast-paced games \u2014 generally first- or third-person shooting video games \u2014 created better learners.\nA: Blowing away enemy soldiers and aliens may be good for the brain, as researchers have found that fast-paced action video games improve a player\u2019s learning ability.\n.Q: Are there any health benefits to playing violent video games?\n\u201cBut all video games don\u2019t lead to improvement.\u201dA comparison group of people was asked to play social games like Electronic Arts Inc.\u2019s \u201cThe Sims 2,\u201d which don\u2019t feature rapid action.\n\u201cPeople who play action video games get better much faster,\u201d said Bavelier, who has a joint appointment at the University of Geneva in Switzerland."}
