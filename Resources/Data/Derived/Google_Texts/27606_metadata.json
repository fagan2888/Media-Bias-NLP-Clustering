Some 659,000 women will not receive mammograms and 3.1 million will not get necessary gynecological checkups like pap smears.\n\nThe lack of early intervention and preventative care means that patients will only seek medical help when they reach the acute phase of illness, when treatment options are fewer and negative outcomes more likely.\n\n\u201cLow-income adults in states that have opted out of Medicaid expansion will forego gains in access to care, financial well-being, physical and mental health, and longevity that would be expected with expanded Medicaid coverage,\u201d said the study.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 25 states and the District of Columbia are expanding their Medicaid programs and 23 states are not. Pennsylvania and Indiana plan to expand Medicaid in 2014, but their plans have not been finalized.\n\n[image of doctors and nurses at patient bedside via Shutterstock.com]\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Docs-and-nurses-at-patient-bedside-via-Shutterstock-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Harvard study says lack of Medicaid expansion in red states will kill thousands"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d47\"", "article_summary": "Talking Points Memo reported that as many as 17,000 people will die because they cannot afford to access health care.\nPennsylvania and Indiana plan to expand Medicaid in 2014, but their plans have not been finalized.\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 25 states and the District of Columbia are expanding their Medicaid programs and 23 states are not.\nThousands of Americans will die as a result of red state governors\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid and extend health coverage to their states\u2019 neediest citizens, according to a study by researchers at Harvard University and the City University of New York.\n\u201cLow-income adults in states that have opted out of Medicaid expansion will forego gains in access to care, financial well-being, physical and mental health, and longevity that would be expected with expanded Medicaid coverage,\u201d said the study."}
