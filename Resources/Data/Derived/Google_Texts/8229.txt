BOULDER — Speaking Wednesday following a morning practice, Colorado wide receivers coach Troy Walters said the Buffs will do some “different things” this season to give nimble playmakers more opportunities.

“We’re going to move guys around and do some different things,” Walters said.

Several new players have provided an infusion of speed and quickness to the CU offense. Those include redshirt freshman running back Phillip Lindsay and true freshman receivers Shay Fields, Donovan Lee and Jay MacIntyre.

“Some young guys have come in ready to play,” Lindsay said. “That’s how it goes with an offense. You evolve over time.”

The Aug. 29 season opener against Colorado State at Sports Authority Field at Mile High is less than 10 days away.

“I can’t wait,” Lindsay said.
