Let\u2019s give her a chance. It\u2019s a State House Special Election, let\u2019s pull off another State Rep. Keisha Waites [who ran approximately ten times before finally winning in a State House Special].\n\nMetze filed her questionnaire after the deadline after saying she needed time to research the questions. She said the same thing several times in response to questions at the QLS forum.\n\nTo be sure, she did file a beautiful questionnaire, but ideally, House candidates will be knowledgeable of issues that have come up in previous Legislative Sessions. On the other hand, someone who is progressive but less knowledgeable is preferable over someone who is knowledgeable but lacks progressive values.\n\nAs for Tyrone Brooks Jr., we think he should continue to branch out in his work as an advocate in the community. He is not as experienced as Robertson or Metze, although he did provide Atlanta Progressive News with a list of his public service record that did show more experience than was originally described on his website.\n\nThere are also serious questions about his residency that have yet to be decided by the Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nDEKALB DISTRICT 5: MANGHAM ENDORSED; TURNER QUALIFIED\n\nOut of ten candidates, we received five questionnaire responses, from Gina Mangham, George Turner, Harmel Codi, Jerome Edmondson, and Gregory Adams. These are the only five who were thus eligible for consideration for an endorsement.\n\nMeanwhile, we ain\u2019t stuttin Mereda Johnson, who failed to even return a voicemail, and whose apparent qualifications are being Hank Johnson\u2019s wife and working on his campaign payroll.\n\nIn terms of public service experience, we felt that three candidates\u2013Mangham, Turner, and Codi\u2013stood out.\n\nGina Mangham won our hearts with her story about advocating for the Atlanta public housing residents who were evicted from Techwood Homes, and were promised the right to return to the replacement housing at Centennial Homes. Mangham sued on their behalf and won.\n\nOn the other hand, George Turner has been highly involved in neighborhood associations, and Codi has experience as a former Finance officer in DeKalb County that makes her familiar with how to spot and address ethics and transparency issues.\n\nMangham and Turner both demonstrated serious concerns about LaVista Hills cityhood, although they said they supported residents\u2019 rights to choose in the upcoming referendum.\n\nWe decided to go with Mangham mainly because of her demonstrated commitment on behalf of the least of these and her expertise in affordable housing, which is desperately needed in DeKalb County.\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5b5\"", "article_summary": "DEKALB DISTRICT 5: MANGHAM ENDORSED; TURNER QUALIFIEDOut of ten candidates, we received five questionnaire responses, from Gina Mangham, George Turner, Harmel Codi, Jerome Edmondson, and Gregory Adams.\nWe felt that of all seven candidates, only two had extensive records of public service: Robertson and Metze.\nIn DeKalb District 5, we have endorsed Gina Mangham, and we are rating George Turner as a qualified second choice.\nIn terms of public service experience, we felt that three candidates\u2013Mangham, Turner, and Codi\u2013stood out.\nIn HD 55, we have endorsed Shelitha Robertson, who we have endorsed three times previously, and we are rating Marie Metze as a qualified second choice."}
