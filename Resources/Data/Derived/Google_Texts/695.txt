Alarm systems are being added to irrigation pivots that farmers use to water crops.

The irrigation systems are usually left unattended, which made them a target for thieves.

Jason Wood of 96 Agri Sales says the alarm systems provide real-time alerts when thieves target an irrigation system.

"It is going to be tougher for them to steal it," Wood said, referring to parts on the irrigation systems.

The alarm systems can be added onto existing systems Wood sells for an estimated $300 to $500.

Theses systems do require a subscription, as they use cell phone signal to send alerts.

The alarm system also allows farmers to remotely control their irrigation pivots.
