But its members are all too human, and the floors of its deliberative chambers offer exceptionally fertile ground for hatching all manner of prophecies, often of the frightening variety. They aren\u2019t usually as specific as Marian Keech. Nor are many willing to espouse such dystopian apocalyptic visions.\n\nBut when Congress debated and passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, opponents were nearly unified in offering grim Keech-like predictions. With Obamacare now in full effect, and the economy on a decided upswing, the dour prognostications are starting to look like Keech's flying saucers. At least if you believe the data. A look at Festinger's theories, though, can explain why that won't matter, and why Americans can expect a continued drumbeat of doom, even as the prophecies fail.\n\nSome of the soothsayings are a little hard to quantify, or perhaps might have to be graded on a scale -- warnings such as Obamacare bringing about the destruction of America or at least the beginning of tyrannical socialism.\n\nBut some of the doom foretold then and more recently is easier to evaluate. Perhaps the most common prediction was that Obamacare would be an economy-crushing \u201cjob killer.\u201d\n\nSome members were quite specific. Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) was among a cadre of crystal-ball gazers who said in November 2009 that \u201can estimated 5.5 million jobs could be lost.\u201d\n\nEven later, with some elements of the law starting to take hold, many members insisted the nation\u2019s jobs would be imperiled. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a freshman elected in 2010, in part to repeal Obamacare, was among the many who forecast during a 2011 repeal bid that the health law would be a fiscal grim reaper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s job-killing to the tune of hundreds of thousands of jobs a year,\u201d Kinzinger said.\n\nThat does not appear to be what happened. In 2014, with most aspects of the law in operation and companies preparing for this year\u2019s \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d the nation saw its best year for employment growth since 1999, with about 3 million jobs created. The trend has accelerated in 2015.\n\nIt would seem to most casual observers that if the economy is taking flight as Obamacare takes full effect, then the health care law is not, in fact, a job-killer. Indeed, that\u2019s how it seems to economists.\n\n\u201cIt certainly has not had the baleful effects the critics were predicting,\u201d said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who supports the law, but never thought it would have much economic impact. \u201cOn balance it may be a modest plus, to the extent that it has contributed to the slowdown of growth in health care costs.\u201d\n\nBut that's not how Capitol Hill\u2019s gloomsday cult sees it. Indeed, try getting any of them to admit the Affordable Care Act jobs slaughter has not happened, and they sound like the punchline to the old joke where a spouse gets caught in the act cheating: \u201cWho are you going to believe -- me, or your lying eyes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean it hasn\u2019t happened?\u201d said Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the new chairman of the House Budget Committee. \u201cHave you talked to any businesses out there?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe predictions were correct in that it\u2019s been one of the one of the slowest recoveries in history,\u201d said Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.). \u201cIt\u2019s done a lot of damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a job-killer,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a conservative noted for being especially reasonable and clear-eyed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reminded every day that Obamacare is a catastrophe, and a job-killer,\u201d said Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who became infamous for shouting \u201cYou lie!\u201d at President Barack Obama from the House floor during the president\u2019s health care address to Congress in 2009.\n\nIt might be tempting to accuse politicians of lying when they deny what appears to be obvious statistical data -- which is certainly a possibility.\n\n\"With politicians, you can\u2019t be sure that what comes out of their mouths is really what\u2019s in their head,\" said Elliot Aronson, one of Festinger\u2019s former students who is regarded as the foremost expert on cognitive dissonance alive today. \"When it comes to politics, we have to really look closely.\"\n\nBut if you give them the benefit of the doubt, Aronson said, it\u2019s probably more accurate to say politicians simply don\u2019t believe their lying eyes.\n\nThe way cognitive dissonance works is that when people are confronted with information that contradicts either their beliefs or actions, they feel discomfort. To feel better, they either have to modify their beliefs and actions, or find some way to discount the disconfirming information. And the more effort someone invests in a particular action or idea, the greater the lengths they will go in crafting justifications to ease their discomfort.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really the way the human mind works, even outside of Washington,\u201d Aronson told HuffPost.\n\nAronson and co-author Carol Tavris looked closely at that phenomenon in their 2007 book, Mistakes Were Made (but not by me). Among the examples are prosecutors who insist that people cleared by DNA evidence are still guilty; scientists who insist results that agree with funders\u2019 interests could not have been swayed, and people who like an idea from their political party, but dislike the same idea if told it came from the opposition party.\n\nIndeed, committing to a specific ideology can make it much harder to see facts clearly, let alone acknowledge them. Aronson noted that it\u2019s especially hard for people who spent the last five years opposing a specific policy. \u201cThese guys are so committed to the belief that Obama can\u2019t do anything right, and that Obamacare is socialism, that it would be very, very difficult for them to examine the data objectively,\" he said. \"I think that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with politics, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with ideology, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with politics that are ideologically driven.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just a Republican problem.\n\n\u201cThe pattern is, of course, bipartisan,\u201d said Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth University political scientist who has studied health care policy and dissonance. He pointed to the Iraq war. While there was massive dissonance when no weapons of mass destruction were found in a conflict that was justified by WMD claims, Democrats who opposed President George W. Bush\u2019s Iraq troop surge found themselves in an awkward position when the tactic worked.\n\n\u201cYou can argue that it was a temporary tactical victory, but at the time there was a similar dynamic. Attacks on coalition forces went down dramatically during and after the troop surge,\u201d Nyhan said. \u201cA lot of critics of the war didn\u2019t want to credit that policy with seemingly having a positive outcome.\n\n\u201cIt is very threatening to admit you\u2019re wrong, and we\u2019re all terrible about it as human beings, so it\u2019s not surprising that people didn\u2019t change their minds,\u201d Nyhan added. \u201cIt\u2019s especially hard for politicians to change their minds or admit they might be wrong.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the politics around Obamacare and the economy, the problem of cognitive dissonance is complicated by, well, complexity.\n\nThere are numerous aspects of the economy and health care that opponents can point to in order to maintain their position, especially through anecdotes, even if they are contradicted by broader economic data.\n\nNyhan noted that in order to prove Republicans wrong about Obamacare killing millions of jobs, you\u2019d have to be able say how much better the economy should be without Obamacare than it is. The economy added 3 million jobs last year, but would it have added 4 million if the Affordable Care Act did not exist?\n\n\u201cOne could create some line of argument that the economy would be much, much stronger without the ACA, but that really seems to be a stretch,\u201d said Van de Water, the economist. \u201cWe have a very large economy. Even as important as the Affordable Care Act is, it\u2019s working on a major sector of the economy, but only at the margins. Even in advance, one would have thought it wasn\u2019t going to have a huge effect.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to say precisely what would have been, Van de Water noted several grim predictions that have not been borne out: that Medicare Advantage plans would go belly up, that medical device manufacturers would be crushed, that the health insurance industry would suffer, and that hospitals would fail.\n\n\u201cNot only are the broad claims about killing jobs not turning out to be correct, the narrower claims related to a large possible effect on specific industries are also turning out to be incorrect,\u201d Van de Water said.\n\nYet House Republicans have held more than 50 votes to repeal or damage the law. And opponents are fighting in the Supreme Court to hamstring the legislation, with the very real possibility of undoing a law that has not wreaked the havoc they predicted.\n\nNyhan said he expects the issue will fade with time, starting as soon as the 2016 elections. Aronson said he also thinks the issue will fade, but slowly and only as new politicians who were not enmeshed in the fight emerge.\n\n\u201cOne would hope that our politicians would be open-minded. One would hope that a senator from West Virginia or Arkansas, or wherever they do a lot of coal mining, would have just as objective a view of climate change as someone from Massachusetts, but that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Aronson said.\n\nAs far as how long it might take for Obamacare's elected prophets of doom to recant their predictions, Aronson offered one of his own.\n\n\u201cAbout as long as it takes for hell to freeze over, with global warming,\u201d he said.\n\nJesse Rifkin and Maxwell Tani contributed reporting.\n\nMichael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.

Supporters of the bill, like the National Federation of Independent Business, argue that it would help relieve pressure on small business owners. Opponents of the bill, like the Obama administration, contend that it would impose unnecessary requirements on agencies and could hinder their abilities to do their jobs.
