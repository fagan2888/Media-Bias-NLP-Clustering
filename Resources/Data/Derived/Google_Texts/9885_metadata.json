HKS has set a goal of raising $500 million. Although its graduates do not rank, as a group, among Harvard\u2019s most prosperous\u2014given how many work in government, for nonprofits, and in other public-service positions around the world\u2014its campaign is off to a fine start. On the evening of the first day, a spokesperson announced that the school had already raised $336 million toward the goal.\n\nHKS numbers no fewer than 14 current or former heads of state among its graduates, and two took the stage at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum for the opening plenary session. The president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, M.P.A. \u201971, LL.D. \u201911, and Felipe Calder\u00f3n, M.P.A. \u201900, K \u201903, president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, discussed leadership with two current HKS students. Asked what prepares a leader for coping with difficult decisions, Sirleaf replied, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that prepares you other than your inner will to make a decision. That is difficult. You find out what you have within you.\u201d Calder\u00f3n noted that \u201conce a decision arrives on your desk, it is there because it is a difficult one. Often, your choice is between the lesser of two evils.\u201d\n\nSirleaf said that as president, the first challenge \u201cis the team you put together, and how to balance that team. The team needs to reflect the population\u2014and Liberia is, for example, a very young country.\u201d Calder\u00f3n addressed the problems organized crime presents, which was one of the central challenges of his presidency. He observed that in some places, in Mexico and elsewhere, criminals are taking over towns, including the police forces, mayors, and even higher officials. \u201cIf you allow criminals to erode society,\u201d he declared, \u201cyou are losing the basis for economic prosperity.\u201d On a lighter note, he later said that while he doesn\u2019t dispute the possibility that cannabis could have medical benefits, citizens should keep their skepticism intact. \u201cWe might compare them to the medical benefits of tequila,\u201d he said, getting a big laugh. \u201cTequila can cure any kind of cold. You will forget the cold.\u201d\n\nPresident Drew Faust followed the heads of state with praise for HKS and for Ellwood, Harvard\u2019s longest-serving current dean. (He was appointed in 2004.) She noted that HKS is the University\u2019s \u201cfirst truly global school,\u201d adding that it had also been on the cutting edge of interdisciplinary and interfaculty work: \u201cThe Kennedy School embodied \u2018one Harvard\u2019 before it was \u2018cool.\u2019\u201d Phrases coined at the school, like \u201csoft power\u201d and \u201cbowling alone,\u201d she pointed out, have entered the lexicon.\n\nIn an interview before the IDEASpHERE launch events\u2014which drew 700 participants\u2014Ellwood himself discussed the current challenges of governance in the context of a disillusioned public. \u201cThe American people have never been enamored with government, but what\u2019s unique about this moment is that we face a series of quite troubling public challenges,\u201d he said, citing middle-class stagnation, climate change, and even threats to democracy itself. Ellwood stressed that HKS students are \u201cpeople who\u2019ve really been in the world of practice. If we don\u2019t focus on big questions like making democracy work, how will we harness the forces that are really shaping our world?\u201d\n\nDuring his IDEASpHERE keynote, Ellwood elaborated on these thoughts with examples, after admitting that, as a teenager, his ambition wasn\u2019t to become a rock star, but \u201cassistant secretary of planning and evaluation for the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\u201d (a goal he eventually reached in the Clinton administration). He introduced from the audience Joseph Curtatone, M.P.P. \u201911, mayor of Somerville, Massachusetts, who faced daunting fiscal challenges on taking office. So Curtatone worked with Linda Bilmes, Moynihan senior lecturer in public policy, who was teaching a course on \u201cperformance-based budgeting,\u201d a system that \u201cfocuses on outcomes more than input,\u201d Ellwood explained. Fifty-five students in the course went to Somerville on nights and weekends, giving the city the equivalent of thousands of dollars in free consulting. Some years later, with Curtatone still mayor, The Boston Globe Magazine called Somerville the best-run city in Massachusetts. In the process, \u201cour students got a priceless real-world experience,\u201d said Ellwood. HKS students are now working with six other cities, with 35 more on a waiting list.\n\nEllwood also hailed audience members Debbie Aung Din Taylor and Jim Taylor, both M.P.A. \u201990, who have been helping farmers in Myanmar for years with devices like an inexpensive water pump, as described in Harvard Magazine. In his interview, Ellwood had touched on a theme he also raised in his keynote speech: lowering the cost of education by means of financial aid to ensure that the school can attract the very best leaders as students. \u201cIf students graduate with a lot of debt, they\u2019re going to have to make a career choice based not on where they will be most effective, but where they can make the most money,\u201d he said. \u201cDebt interferes with opportunity at all educational institutions, but at the Kennedy School it kills dreams.\u201d\n\nDavid Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of The Carlyle Group, chairs the campaign, which has set four priorities for the school\u2019s future; Ellwood noted them in his keynote address. First is \u201creaching the very best leaders,\u201d which involves developing the financial-aid resources (as Ellwood mentioned in the interview) to keep the cost of education manageable. Second is \u201ctransforming the educational experience,\u201d referring in part to multidisciplinary and experiential learning, flexible classrooms, and teaching and learning technologies. Third is \u201cgenerating powerful ideas,\u201d a rubric focused on three areas: \u201cmaking democracy work; creating shared, sustainable prosperity; harnessing the forces reshaping our world.\u201d The fourth is \u201ccreating a campus that amplifies our mission.\u201d This involves the creation of new spaces, including a new building and the reworking of existing spaces to support \u201cactive, engaged learning, and group work,\u201d Ellwood explained in the interview.\n\nThe IDEASpHERE offered 100 speakers and 48 sessions, including many smaller sessions led by faculty members. In one on \u201cOpportunity and Inequality,\u201d for example, Malkin professor of public policy Robert Putnam, Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, and Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, director of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House, agreed that restoring equality of opportunity is one of the most pressing social challenges of our time. Of his home state of Ohio, Putnam remarked, \u201cThis is not a Rust Belt story, this is an American story.\u201d His research indicates that the class divide in parental investment in their children's emotional and cognitive development is rising, leading to different educational and economic outcomes. According to Mu\u00f1oz, restoring equal opportunity is not only about asking \u201cwhat the government can be doing about this,\u201d but also about investing in local communities and inspiring conversations in neighborhood associations.\n\nIn \u201cShould We Fear a Cyber Pearl Harbor or 9/11?\u201d former HKS dean Joseph Nye, now Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor, and Alexander Klimburg, research fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, teamed to probe the ambiguities and puzzles of cyber-warfare. \u201cDue to low barriers and low costs, these things can be done not only by nations but by non-state actors,\u201d Nye explained. He believes it unlikely that the United States could be hit unawares, as at Pearl Harbor, but also warned that the Cold War principle of deterrence doesn\u2019t work well in the cyber world, where it isn\u2019t always possible to attribute the attack to a specific, known source. \u201cIf you can\u2019t attribute,\u201d he asked, \u201chow do you deter?\u201d Klimburg elucidated some of the complexities, noting that there are at least 20 different modes of cyber-attack, and more than 150 million strains of malware\u201420 percent of which were created in 2013 alone. \u201cThe most important weapon in defense is intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cDefense is complex, but it is still outmatched by offense.\u201d\n\nAt a plenary session on IDEASpHERE\u2019s second day, the economics editor of The Economist, Zanny Minton Beddoes, M.P.A. \u201992, interviewed former Harvard president Lawrence H. Summers, now the Eliot University Professor. (A video of their conversation is here.) Summers saw some bright spots in the economic picture, in areas such as energy independence (\u201cWith the right level of investment, we could be Saudi Arabia six years from now\u201d), healthcare costs (because of the Affordable Care Act), and the financial industry. Yet he pointed to \u201cstructural changes that raise the propensity to save, and reduce it for investing, which carries growth.\u201d He asked the audience to recall the era when AT&T and General Motors were borrowing money to invest, and compare that to the present, \u201cwhen Apple and Google are awash in cash, and don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d He pointed out that there is a \u201cdifference between shipping things from the \u2018cloud\u2019 and building shopping malls,\u201d in terms of the investment involved, and that less investment correlates with a demand problem.\n\nSummers at one point sketched the robust economic conditions after World War II, including pent-up consumer demand from wartime restrictions, building suburbia and furnishing those homes, and constructing the interstate highway system. \u201cToday, we\u2019re going the other way on infrastructure, housing, and pessimism versus optimism,\u201d he said. \u201cI have concerns about this, I do. Confidence is the cheapest form of stimulus.\u201d\n\nDuring the IDEASpHERE convocation, banners hung in high places around the school trumpeted words from HKS\u2019 s namesake, John F. Kennedy \u201940, LL.D. \u201956: \u201cAsk What You Can Do.\u201d At the end of his keynote speech, Ellwood noted that those words from JFK\u2019s inaugural address had been preceded by another inspiring sentence: \u201cThe energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it\u2014and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.\u201d The dean finished by telling his listeners, \u201cNow is our time. Let\u2019s light the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four goals outlined as school seeks $500 million", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Magazine", "description": "Four goals outlined as school seeks $500 million", "title": "With IDEASpHERE, Kennedy School Launches Capital Campaign", "url": "http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/05/kennedy-school-capital-campaign", "image": "http://harvardmagazine.com/sites/default/files/img/article/0514/KSG_5.15.14Ideasphere336.jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-05-21T12:09:31-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/05/kennedy-school-capital-campaign", "description": "Four goals outlined as school seeks $500 million", "card": "summary", "title": "With IDEASpHERE, Kennedy School Launches Capital Campaign"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T15:30:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-21T12:09:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=990"}, "article_summary": "With a two-day event styled \u201cIDEASpHERE,\u201d the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) launched its part of the University-wide $6.5-billion capital campaign on May 15 and 16.\n\u201900, K \u201903, president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, discussed leadership with two current HKS students.\nHKS students are now working with six other cities, with 35 more on a waiting list.\nOn the evening of the first day, a spokesperson announced that the school had already raised $336 million toward the goal.\nEllwood stressed that HKS students are \u201cpeople who\u2019ve really been in the world of practice."}
