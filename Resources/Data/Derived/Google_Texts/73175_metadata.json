But hospital operators and critics of the study say there\u2019s a big difference between what hospitals charge and what they are paid.\n\nThe study published this month in Health Affairs singled out these 50 hospitals for charging significantly more than the national average of 3.4 times the charge to Medicare. All but one is for-profit, and most are run by major systems like Tenet and Healthcare Corp. of America.\n\nStory continues below map\n\nBut HCA, which has 14 hospitals on the list, said the amount patients pay for hospital services has more to do with the type of coverage they have than the prices listed in the hospital chargemaster. The chargemaster is a list of the hospital\u2019s prices for every procedure and supply item used during a procedure. The rates are established by individual hospitals.\n\nSociety of Actuaries Health Research Actuary Rebecca Owen did not comment directly about the study, but said overall, neither Medicare nor commercial plans are going to pay 100 percent of the billed charge.\n\n\u201cFor a long time it hasn\u2019t been clear that billed charges and the actual cost of billed services are aligned,\u201d she said.\n\nOverhead costs that are included in most business billing, differ by hospital, according to Owen.\n\nMeanwhile, 25 hospitals on the list are owned by Community Health Systems, including the one in the top slot, North Okaloosa Medical Center in Florida.\n\n[Also: High deductibles affecting revenue cycle]\n\nThe 110-bed North Okaloosa charges uninsured patients 12.6 times the actual cost of patient care, according to the study.\n\nCHS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe study is meant to call attention to patients without insurance and other payers that do not have the clout to negotiate for a lower rate, according to study co-author Ge Bai, an assistant professor in accounting at Washington and Lee University.\n\nThis includes the uninsured, those on workers compensation and casualty insurance and patients taken to hospitals out of network for emergency reasons, she said.\n\nHospitals do not need competitive pricing, as consumers find it difficult enough to understand their cost of care to shop around, she said.\n\n[Also: See 2013 inpatient payment levels for top 100 diagnosis-related groups]\n\nOnly two states, Maryland and West Virginia, have regulations over what may be charged, she said, adding that without the force of the free market or regulation, hospitals charge higher prices because they can, she said.\n\n\u201cNobody tells them they should not charge high prices,\u201d Bai said.\n\nHCA spokesman Ed Fishbough said the study does not include the amount of charity care or discounts hospitals provide to uninsured patients.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we were one of the first providers to make detailed pricing information publicly available; we have been providing this information on hospital web sites since 2007,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Federation of American Hospitals said the listed hospitals provided nearly $450 million in uncompensated care in 2012, and offered significant discounts.\n\nFAH Hospital policy blogger Chip Kahn accused the study\u2019s co-authors of having a \u201cmyopic focus\u201d that misses the mark. \u201cIndeed, had the authors instead compared the actual payment-to-cost ratio of these hospitals compared to the national average, they would have discovered virtually no difference between the two groups \u2013 1.3 for the 50 hospitals and 1.2 for the national average,\u201d Kahn wrote on June 8.\n\n\u201cEven patients not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance are almost never expected to pay full charges,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTwenty of the hospitals on the list are in Florida, which has an environment friendly to for-profit hospitals, according to Bai.\n\nSeven of the hospitals are located in Pennsylvania; five in Texas; five in Alabama; three in California; three in Tennessee; and one each in Oklahoma, Virginia, Arkansas, Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina and New Jersey.\n\nForty-six of the hospitals are owned by a hospital system.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nAll but Crozer Chester Medical Center in Pennsylvania is a for-profit hospital.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act promises transparency, but it does not apply to for-profit hospitals, Bai said.\n\n\u201cThe ACA says not-for-profit hospitals should provide these accounts to uninsured patients,\u201d she said.\n\nIn determining the size of markup, researchers Bai and John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor Gerard F. Anderson used as a benchmark what Medicare allows for the cost of care. They reported the 50 hospitals with the highest charge-to-cost ratios in 2012.\n\n\u201cThis idea was sparked when I received my hospital bill five years ago, after my son was born,\u201d said Bai. \u201cI\u2019m a CPA, I didn\u2019t understand the bill.\u201d\n\nShe has insurance, but said she wondered about those who didn\u2019t and the price paid by all when premiums rise.\n\n\u201cWe want to raise public awareness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt affects every single patient, all of us. Patients have limited power against the hospitals. Consumers need protection from the legislators. There are watchdogs like us.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/50-hospitals-flagged-sky-high-charges-say-report-doesnt-show-whats-actually-paid", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/mapfeat_0.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "These hospitals charge the uninsured and certain other payers more than 10 times the amount they charge Medicare, but critics say there's a big difference between what hospitals charge and what they are paid.", "title": "50 hospitals flagged for sky-high charges say report doesn't show what's actually paid"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/mapfeat_0.jpg"}, "description": "These hospitals charge the uninsured and certain other payers more than 10 times the amount they charge Medicare, but critics say there's a big difference between what hospitals charge and what they are paid.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "50 hospitals flagged for sky-high charges say report doesn't show what's actually paid"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Researchers who compiled new list that shows 50 hospitals that charge the uninsured and certain other payers more than 10 times the amount they charge Medicare hope the report could lead to more state and federal regulations of healthcare costs.
