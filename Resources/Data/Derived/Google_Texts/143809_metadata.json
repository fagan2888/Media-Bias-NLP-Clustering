I admit to being affected by the academic robes I pull out for commencement, not to mention the students I\u2019ve taught for the past four years, who are finally ready to make the leap into the \u201creal\u201d world.\n\nThis spring was a bit different. It marked the 30th anniversary of my own graduation from college. And as I headed east for my reunion, I thought about how my daughter (a sophomore) and the rest of her millennial cohort have inherited a radically different academic world than the one I toasted with my friends from the Class of 1984. The changes \u2014 and they were dramatic \u2014 occurred on my generation\u2019s watch, and were not just a series of unrelated misfortunes. On the contrary, the new world is the end product of a fiendishly successful conspiracy.\n\nDuring my first semester of college, John Lennon was assassinated 40 blocks south of my freshman dorm, and Ronald Reagan, the former governor of California, was elected president of the United States. I was devastated by both of these events. At the time, I had no idea that the Great Communicator had cut his teeth on campus protests during the 1960s, using long-haired Berkeley students as perfect foils. Reagan assailed the Free Speech and antiwar movements, promising the taxpayers that if elected, he\u2019d get college kids off picket lines and back in class. With comments like, \u201cThey are spoiled and don\u2019t deserve the education they are getting\u201d and that the state \u201cshould not subsidize intellectual curiosity,\u201d he won in a landslide. Fourteen years later, Reagan was elected president, running against a host of mythical foes from \u201cwelfare queens\u201d to an omnipotent \u201cEvil Empire,\u201d but he and his administration never shed their antipathy toward \u201celitist\u201d campuses and the young people who dared question the system.\n\nThe students Reagan loathed were the beneficiaries of a consensus that paired the GI Bill with the post-Sputnik explosion of higher education to offer no- to low-cost access to public institutions, and aid to those who needed it to make private college possible. Students were not expected to shoulder the burden of their educations alone, and this freed them to explore who they wanted to be and the kind of America in which they wanted to live. There were many adults, of course, who despised them for just this freedom, and powerful forces terrified of the changes they saw coming.\n\nBy the time Reagan was elected to the nation\u2019s highest office a decade and a half later, these powers had devised perfect tools to make sure the spirit of 1960s protest would never again erupt on campus. During Reagan\u2019s two terms as president, dedicated funding for outright grants-in-aid decreased, federal guidelines pushed individual loans, and private bill collectors were brought in to ensure that the hardest kind of debt to escape was whatever you took on for your education. Even more important was the shift in tone and expectation. Public goods became private services, and by the end of the 1980s, the anti-tax, infra-structure-starving, neoliberal Weltanschauung meant that as states cut their budgets, support for higher education was thrown into a cage match with every other necessary public good.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dramatic, awful changes occurred on my generation's watch -- and it amounts to a fiendishly successful conspiracy", "title": "Ronald Reagan stuck it to millennials: A college debt history lesson no one tells", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Dramatic, awful changes occurred on my generation's watch -- and it amounts to a fiendishly successful conspiracy", "title": "Ronald Reagan stuck it to millennials: A college debt history lesson no one tells", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/05/ronald_reagan_stuck_it_to_millennials_a_college_debt_history_lesson_no_one_tells/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/ronald_reagan_graduates.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dramatic, awful changes occurred on my generation's watch -- and it amounts to a fiendishly successful conspiracy", "title": "Ronald Reagan stuck it to millennials: A college debt history lesson no one tells", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/ronald_reagan_graduates.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Peter Lunenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, College, commencement, Debt, Editor's Picks, graduates, Graduation, Higher education, millennials, Ronald Reagan, student loans, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: College, commencement, Debt, Editor's Picks, graduates, Graduation, Higher education, millennials, Ronald Reagan, student loans, The Right, Politics NewsThat nostalgic time of year for newly minted college grads and their professors has now concluded.\nDuring my first semester of college, John Lennon was assassinated 40 blocks south of my freshman dorm, and Ronald Reagan, the former governor of California, was elected president of the United States.\nReagan assailed the Free Speech and antiwar movements, promising the taxpayers that if elected, he\u2019d get college kids off picket lines and back in class.\nThe changes \u2014 and they were dramatic \u2014 occurred on my generation\u2019s watch, and were not just a series of unrelated misfortunes.\nIt marked the 30th anniversary of my own graduation from college."}
