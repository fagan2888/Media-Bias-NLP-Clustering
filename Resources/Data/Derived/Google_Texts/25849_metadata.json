Froman, the trade representative, is known to prowl the tunnels underneath the Capitol to buttonhole skeptical Democrats. He has also lobbied them at dinner parties, at the airport and even on a crowded bus in India during a presidential visit there.\n\nMr. Obama, who normally eschews legislative schmoozing, has made his case in dozens of telephone calls and one-on-one or group meetings with lawmakers.\n\nHe has also become increasingly aggressive in taking on critics in his own party, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a popular figure among the liberal base who has denounced the trade deal as a sellout to corporate interests. Mr. Obama has suggested that they are either intentionally misrepresenting the issue or being duped by misinformation about it. That has put the president in the uncomfortable position of feuding openly with activists who have usually revered him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very active making the case that this is a different-in-kind trade agreement, the most progressive trade agreement,\u201d said Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of Mr. Obama\u2019s National Economic Council.\n\nLate last month, in a meeting with the House\u2019s moderate New Democrats coalition, the president offered to personally campaign for any member who provokes a primary challenge by supporting him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said, \u2018We will not do anything for anyone if you support these trade bills,\u2019 \u201d said Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York, who was at the two-hour meeting in the Cabinet Room. \u201cFolks are concerned if they don\u2019t have the support and enthusiasm they usually have, they\u2019re going to need some help.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has enlisted the architects of his presidential campaigns, both inside and outside the White House, to allay those worries. They are armed with polling data that indicates that most Democratic voters \u2014 particularly the fast-growing coalition of women, minorities and lower-income people \u2014 favor free trade and would be more likely to vote for a candidate who shared that view.\n\nMitch Stewart, a veteran field organizer for Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, has started a group called the Progressive Coalition for American Jobs to counter the well-funded opposition by labor, environmental and human rights organizations that reject the president\u2019s stance on trade.\n\nMr. Stewart will not reveal any of his group\u2019s financial backers. With public opinion data from Pete Brodnitz \u2014 partner of Joel Benenson, Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign pollster \u2014 Mr. Stewart is trying to help the president persuade Democrats that this trade agreement, unlike previous pacts, would deliver benefits to American workers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s frankly learned from previous attempts at this,\u201d Mr. Stewart said.\n\nTrade votes have always posed difficulties for presidents because of their technical and regional complexity and the potential impact on jobs. But this one has proved a particularly heavy lift for Mr. Obama, who campaigned for president railing against trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nBut a president\u2019s priorities are not the same as a legislator\u2019s, said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has gone from free-trade enthusiast to skeptic since Nafta\u2019s passage in 1993.\n\nWith Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge to \u201cpivot\u201d foreign policy toward Asia, his priorities have diverged from his party\u2019s. To the president, the Trans-Pacific Partnership would counter the economic weight of China and set rules on labor, the environment, intellectual property and investor protections for the growing economies of the Pacific Rim. For members of Congress, it is about jobs.\n\n\u201cI understand the president\u2019s desire to pull these countries away from China\u2019s orb here, but I feel middle-class income decline is the greatest problem Americans face, and trade agreements exacerbate that decline,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose tensions have pushed the administration to seek votes one by one. Representative Ami Bera, Democrat of California, narrowly won his swing district in 2012, then ran for re-election in 2014 on a pledge to oppose trade promotion authority. After two rides on Air Force One and a trip to India with the president, Mr. Bera came around.\n\n\u201cThe president has asked for my support to negotiate the deal based on the parameters outlined by Congress in T.P.A.,\u201d he said in a statement, using an acronym for trade promotion authority. \u201cI made it clear, however, that my support to give the president the authority to negotiate a trade deal is not the same as giving him my vote or support for the final Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d\n\nRepresentative John Delaney, Democrat of Maryland, also got personal presidential attention \u2014 and a promise by Mr. Obama to campaign for him if he sticks with the White House on trade.\n\n\u201cSure it\u2019s great to have the president\u2019s support,\u201d Mr. Delaney said, although he said that his decision to support the trade agreement was not based on the president\u2019s pledge to campaign for him.\n\nThe White House also made sure that the guest list for the April 28 state dinner for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was loaded with supporters of the president\u2019s trade push, from Republicans like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah to Democrats like Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Ron Kind of Wisconsin. Representative Earl Blumenauer, a fast-track supporter, brought as his guest a fellow Oregon Democrat, Representative Suzanne Bonamici. A week later, with the president in her district, she declared her support.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Obama traveled to Nike\u2019s headquarters, in Oregon, to highlight the company\u2019s pledge to create 10,000 jobs in the United States if the trade accord is passed. But one senator who is undeclared on the matter, Angus King, an independent from Maine, was not impressed.\n\nNike has sent virtually all of its manufacturing to Asia, including Vietnam, a party to the trade deal. In contrast, a competitor, New Balance, has kept its production in the United States, including in Maine.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly an influence,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to those New Balance factories. I\u2019ve looked those people in the eye.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150510070730, "twitter": {"description": "Legislation that is scheduled for action Tuesday would allow President Obama to avoid amendments or a filibuster after a Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Pacific Trade Push Faces a Senate Vote This Week", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/us/politics/obama-pushing-skeptical-legislators-hard-on-pacific-trade-deal.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003673609"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/us/11TRADE/11TRADE-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/us/politics/obama-pushing-skeptical-legislators-hard-on-pacific-trade-deal.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003673609", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/us/politics/obama-pushing-skeptical-legislators-hard-on-pacific-trade-deal.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 10, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Trans-Pacific Partnership,International Trade and World Market,United States Politics and Government,Senate,American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Jonathan Weisman", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS and JONATHAN WEISMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Legislation that is scheduled for action Tuesday would allow President Obama to avoid amendments or a filibuster after a Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/us/11TRADE/11TRADE-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Legislation that is scheduled for action Tuesday would allow President Obama to avoid amendments or a filibuster after a Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 10, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/jonathan_weisman/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-05-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations", "published": "2015-05-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "11trade", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150511155628, "hdl_p": "Obama\u2019s Push for a Pacific Trade Pact Faces a Senate Vote This Week", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/us/politics/obama-pushing-skeptical-legislators-hard-on-pacific-trade-deal.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/us/11TRADE/11TRADE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Legislation that is scheduled for action Tuesday would allow President Obama to avoid amendments or a filibuster after a Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Pacific Trade Push Faces a Senate Vote This Week"}, "pdate": 20150510, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000003673609, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Obama\u2019s Pacific Trade Push Faces a Senate Vote This Week", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/us/11TRADE/11TRADE-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c54\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Obama has suggested that they are either intentionally misrepresenting the issue or being duped by misinformation about it.\nAfter two rides on Air Force One and a trip to India with the president, Mr. Bera came around.\nMr. Obama, who normally eschews legislative schmoozing, has made his case in dozens of telephone calls and one-on-one or group meetings with lawmakers.\nRepresentative Earl Blumenauer, a fast-track supporter, brought as his guest a fellow Oregon Democrat, Representative Suzanne Bonamici.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck approach,\u201d she said, \u201cand sometimes it\u2019s in the hallway.\u201dMichael B.
