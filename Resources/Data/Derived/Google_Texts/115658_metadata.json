KSTP-TV political reporter Tom Hauser posed the questions.\n\nThe interview segment starts at about 3 minutes into the video and runs about 16 minutes. Advance the play head until the video timer on the left will show about 20 minutes remaining in the video and that should be the start of the interview.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see a one hour debate in St. Cloud between the three candidates you can find video and transcript by clicking here.\n\nQuestions and summary of candidate responses\n\nQuestion: what is the single most important issue in the sixth congressional district?\n\nPerske: most important issues are jobs and transportation. Says in the legislature Emmer voted against transportation bills.\n\nDenney: the main problem is legalized bribery in government. Campaign finance reform is needed.\n\nEmmer: transportation is part of the issue, but jobs and the economy is part of it. Highway improvements are needed.\n\nQuestion:Extending Northstar Commuter rail to St. Cloud\u2026 Tom Emmer why are you opposed?\n\nEmmer: We\u2019re only getting 73 to 75 cents back from Washington for every dollar we send there. Highway trust fund can\u2019t be used for other transit. Take care of roads and bridges first.\n\nDenney: Roads and bridges more important. we need a long term transportation bill and it hasn\u2019t been done because the gridlock between the parties.\n\nPerske: I support extending the North Star to St. Cloud. We could have done this for much less years ago. People in St. Cloud need to get to their jobs in the Twin Cities.\n\nQuestion: What policies would you support to increase jobs in the sixth district?\n\nDenney: we need to fix the gridlock first. I support a flat tax.\n\nEmmer: Lower the overall tax burden on families. Eliminate regulations.\n\nPerske: Fair trade- too many jobs are leaving the country. Government does not oppress business.\n\nCommercial break\n\nQuestion: Affordable care act is unpopular according to our polling, would you repeal it?\n\n\n\nDenney: It\u2019s offensive to me because younger people are being asked to pay for older people\u2019s healthcare. But I wouldn\u2019t repeal it.\n\nPerske: We can\u2019t repeal it. We can\u2019t go back to preexisting conditions not being covered. Put polarizing politics aside and find something that works.\n\nEmmer: We need to look at what\u2019s doable. I don\u2019t think the ACA can work. Instead allow small employers to pool healthcare and promote health savings accounts .\n\nHow do you deal with the threat posed by ISIS? Would you allow ground troops to go in?\n\nPerske: We need to take of this in real time. Multinational forces, airstrikes are OK. Avoid putting troops on the ground at all costs.\n\nDenney: I\u2019m not privy to the information I need to make a decision. My opponents have not laid out their solutions.\n\nEmmer: You don\u2019t tell your enemies what you\u2019re not willing to do. The last thing you\u2019d want to do is put our young people in peril, but I would if I needed to.\n\nQuestion: How will you differ from the sixth districts current Representative, Michele Bachmann?\n\nEmmer: Customer service\n\nDenney: Get rid of corruption in congress\n\nPerske: Bachmann was polarizing. Emmer will be worse. Look at how polarizing he was in the legislature.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://theuptake.org/2014/10/27/congressional-candidates-emmer-perske-denney-answer-questions-on-kstp-tv/", "dcterms.title": "The UpTake - Congressional Candidates Emmer, Perske, Denney Answer Questions On KSTP-TV", "geo.position": "44.9687958;-93.2073517", "og": {"site_name": "The UpTake", "description": "Joe Perske (DFL), John Denney (I) and Tom Emmer (R) answered six questions each in a short joint appearance on KSTP-TV's \"At Issue\" program on October 26, 2014.", "title": "Congressional Candidates Emmer, Perske, Denney Answer Questions On KSTP-TV", "url": "http://theuptake.org/2014/10/27/congressional-candidates-emmer-perske-denney-answer-questions-on-kstp-tv/", "image": "http://theuptake.org/core/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EmmerPerskeDenney.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@theuptake", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mmcintee"}, "syndication-source": "http://theuptake.org/2014/10/27/congressional-candidates-emmer-perske-denney-answer-questions-on-kstp-tv/", "ICBM": "44.9687958, -93.2073517", "original-source": "http://theuptake.org/2014/10/27/congressional-candidates-emmer-perske-denney-answer-questions-on-kstp-tv/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "CD6, Minnesota, Joe Perske, John Denney, Tom Emmer"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8f3\"", "article_summary": "Joe Perske (DFL), John Denney (I) and Tom Emmer (R) answered six questions each in a short joint appearance on KSTP-TV\u2019s \u201cAt Issue\u201d program on October 26, 2014.\nQuestion:Extending Northstar Commuter rail to St. Cloud\u2026 Tom Emmer why are you opposed?\nEmmer: transportation is part of the issue, but jobs and the economy is part of it.\nQuestions and summary of candidate responsesQuestion: what is the single most important issue in the sixth congressional district?\nCloud need to get to their jobs in the Twin Cities."}
