Neither agency has publicly detailed what the \u201cperformance issues\u201d involved.Meanwhile, state auditors in Hawaii in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for years of delay on a computer system for the state tax department. The project had been marred by slow response time and numerous system failures, the Post reported.More recently, three of the new state health-care exchanges that CGI Technologies and Solutions helped develop \u2014 in Hawaii, Vermont, and Colorado \u2014 have also encountered major glitches and delays. Asked about the problems, CGI officials said all three exchanges are now up and running.\u201cThese should all have been red flags for contract officers,\u201d Daniel Gordon, who was in charge of government procurement policy earlier in the Obama administration and is now associate dean for government procurement studies at George Washington University Law School, told the Post.Administration officials have faulted CGI Federal\u2019s performance on the health-care initiative. CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner, for instance, told a congressional committee the firm sometimes missed deadlines.The government also grew frustrated with CGI Federal because the firm said on repeated occasions that features of the exchange were ready when they were not , several officials have said.In response to questions about CGI\u2019s record, CMS spokeswoman Tasha Bradley said: \u201cUnfortunately, the experience on HealthCare.gov has been frustrating for many Americans. HealthCare.gov can and will be fixed, and we have called in additional technical help from across the country to solve some of the more complex technical issues.\u201dA CGI spokesman declined to comment on the company\u2019s work on HealthCare.gov.\u201cWhat\u2019s important now,\u2019\u2019 he said, is that CGI is \u201cfully committed to being part of the solution.\u2019\u2019CGI officials rejected any comparison with AMS\u2019s earlier failures.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cgi,obamacare,ams,mishandled", "pubdate": "2013-11-15T23:13:02", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The lead contractor on the dysfunctional Obamacare website is filled with executives from a company that mishandled at least 20 other government IT projects - including a costly and troubled effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers, The...", "title": "Obamacare Contractor Linked to 20 Troubled Government Projects", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/cgi-obamacare-ams-mishandled/2013/11/15/id/536988/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/cgi-obamacare-ams-mishandled/2013/11/15/id/536988/", "title": "Obamacare Contractor Linked to 20 Troubled Government Projects", "description": "The lead contractor on the dysfunctional Obamacare website is filled with executives from a company that mishandled at least 20 other government IT projects - including a costly and troubled effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers, The...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1384557182, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "cgi,obamacare,ams,mishandled", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2013-11-15T23:13:02"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/cgi-obamacare-ams-mishandled/2013/11/15/id/536988/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The lead contractor on the dysfunctional Obamacare website is filled with executives from a company that mishandled at least 20 other government IT projects - including a costly and troubled effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers, The..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3be4\"", "article_summary": "Neither agency has publicly detailed what the \u201cperformance issues\u201d involved.Meanwhile, state auditors in Hawaii in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for years of delay on a computer system for the state tax department.\nThe project had been marred by slow response time and numerous system failures, the Post reported.More recently, three of the new state health-care exchanges that CGI Technologies and Solutions helped develop \u2014 in Hawaii, Vermont, and Colorado \u2014 have also encountered major glitches and delays.\nAsked about the problems, CGI officials said all three exchanges are now up and running.\u201cThese should all have been red flags for contract officers,\u201d Daniel Gordon, who was in charge of government procurement policy earlier in the Obama administration and is now associate dean for government procurement studies at George Washington University Law School, told the Post.Administration officials have faulted CGI Federal\u2019s performance on the health-care initiative.\nCMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner, for instance, told a congressional committee the firm sometimes missed deadlines.The government also grew frustrated with CGI Federal because the firm said on repeated occasions that features of the exchange were ready when they were not , several officials have said.In response to questions about CGI\u2019s record, CMS spokeswoman Tasha Bradley said: \u201cUnfortunately, the experience on HealthCare.gov has been frustrating for many Americans.\nHealthCare.gov can and will be fixed, and we have called in additional technical help from across the country to solve some of the more complex technical issues.\u201dA CGI spokesman declined to comment on the company\u2019s work on HealthCare.gov.\u201cWhat\u2019s important now,\u2019\u2019 he said, is that CGI is \u201cfully committed to being part of the solution.\u2019\u2019CGI officials rejected any comparison with AMS\u2019s earlier failures."}
