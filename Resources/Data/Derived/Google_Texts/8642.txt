Almost 30 percent of the 11,990 practicing urologists in the United States are holding off on retirement until at least age 71. That's compared to 22.7 percent a year ago according to the American Urological Association's 2015 Annual Census. In numbers, that means more than 3,400 urologists plan to fully retire after age 70, up from 2,500 who said the same in the previous survey.

The findings of the survey add more weight to existing data that illustrates increasing demand, and potential impact, on the overall urology workforce inflicted by the country's aging population.

The results are based on responses from the 2,057 practicing U.S. urologists who completed the census instrument.

In other key findings, perhaps thanks to lengthy careers, the study showed many urologists are themselves part of the aging population with more than half of practicing urologists being over age 55, and 28 percent older than 65.

Only 1,000 of the total 11, 990 practicing urologists in America are women, and nearly 30 percent of the whole group have been practicing for more than three decades.

Roughly 41 percent of urology practices have trouble filling vacancies, which is not a surprise given that census data revealed a national urologist-to-patient ratio of 3.7 per 100,000 people. That can vary depending on where you live. And if that happens to be in California, Florida, New York or Texas, you're in luck. The census showed those state have the most practicing urologists, while Wyoming has the fewest.

But there are gaps in service nationwide, and those gaps are increasing. Data showed the total number of U.S. counties with no practicing urologists has increased, from 62.2 percent in 2014 to 63.6 percent in 2015.

The country's aging population, which urologists point to as a prime factor in their choice not to retire before 70, had been dominated up until recently by the Baby Boomer generation, those Americans born between 1946, the end of World War II, and 1964, and had been the largest generation of Americans born in U.S. history. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in June 2015 that the nation's 65-and-older population grew from 44.7 million in 2013 to 46.2 million in 2014. This group contains the oldest four years of the baby boom generation. However, they are now outnumbered by Millennials, or Americans born between 1982 and 2000. Millennials now number 83.1 million and represent more than one quarter of the nation's population.
