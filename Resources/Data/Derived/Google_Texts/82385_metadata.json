These protocols involve everything from securing the motorcade route and hotel rooms to doing security walkthroughs.\n\nWorld leaders, thousands of South Africans to honor Mandela\n\nPresident Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama departed Monday morning for Johannesburg and were scheduled to arrive there early Tuesday. Former President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Attorney General Eric Holder accompanied the Obamas on Air Force One.\n\nFormer Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, along with Chelsea Clinton, were also planning to attend the memorial service at a 94,000-seat soccer stadium in Soweto on Tuesday. They'll be joining more than 90 heads of state at what will be the one of the biggest mass memorial events in recent memory. The sheer number of leaders appearing in the same place at one time raises numerous logistical and security challenges, but the White House expressed confidence in the South African government's ability to handle the event.\n\n\"We have not heard any concerns,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"Number one \u2013 the South Africans hosted the World Cup, so they have experience hosting significant crowds and managing events like this. Although clearly this is really a unique event in world history given the number of leaders coming to pay their respects, as well as the people of South Africa.\"\n\nThe Secret Service spokesman noted that while the agency's preference is to bring their own metal detectors to such events, they do not have authority over local law enforcement in foreign countries and would be working with South African officials on security matters. The spokesman could not offer specific details on efforts to secure the stadium.\n\nNearly two dozen members of Congress, including Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose praise for Mandela last week prompted backlash from some of his supporters, will attend the memorial\n\nThe President, whose very first political action was an anti-apartheid protest in college, is expected to speak at the memorial service, according to the White House. Rhodes said the President worked on his remarks over the weekend and would continue that work on the flight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington (CNN) -- With President Obama departing for South Africa just four days after learning of the death of Nelson Mandela, security and logistical preparations that would usually take months were crammed into less than a week. \"We've done things in less time,\" said a Secret Service spokesman.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Secret Service prepares for Obama", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/09/secret-service-prepares-for-obamas-last-minute-trip-to-south-africa/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131209121735-obama-air-force-one-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Washington (CNN) -- With President Obama departing for South Africa just four days after learning of the death of Nelson Mandela, security and logistical preparations that would usually take months were crammed into less than a week. \"We've done things in less time,\" said a Secret Service spokesman.", "title": "Secret Service prepares for Obama's last-minute trip to South Africa"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "nelson mandela, president obama, secret service, south africa, cnn correspondent athena jones", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfefb\"", "article_summary": "\"We've done things in less time,\" said a Secret Service spokesman.\nFormer Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, along with Chelsea Clinton, were also planning to attend the memorial service at a 94,000-seat soccer stadium in Soweto on Tuesday.\n\"It's a compressed timeline, but there are certain protocols we must have in place for any trip,\" the spokesman said.\n\"Number one \u2013 the South Africans hosted the World Cup, so they have experience hosting significant crowds and managing events like this.\n2 years agoWashington (CNN) - With President Obama departing for South Africa just four days after learning of the death of Nelson Mandela, security and logistical preparations that would usually take months were crammed into less than a week."}
