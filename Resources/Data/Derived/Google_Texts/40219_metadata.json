I\u2019d rather run for mayor than keep writing novels,\u201d he quipped.\n\nYpsilanti mayoral candidate Tyrone Bridges shared an example of his daughter\u2019s artwork with forum attendees.\n\nFavorite public art named by the candidates included the mosaic adorning the Fourth and Washington parking structure, as well as the half-mile of daffodils planted in The Arb.\n\nAnd Ann Arbor Ward 5 incumbent Chuck Warpehoski delivered his opening statement in the form of a rap.\n\nIn her remarks at the end of the forum, Arts Alliance executive director Deb Polich urged candidates and elected officials to tap into the experts who know the creative sector. She encouraged candidates to touch base with ArtServe Michigan and the Arts Alliance to get accurate information. Ann Arbor is losing ground to other communities like Grand Rapids and Detroit, she said, and that\u2019s why public funding and investment in the arts is important. \u201cPrivate funding is absolutely here in this county, but it\u2019s not enough \u2013 there\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just about funding, however. Polich stressed the importance of public policy to make the city a fertile ground for the creative sector.\n\nPolich reported that the Arts Alliance will be holding a statewide conference called Creative Convergence on March 19, 2015. Thought leaders from across the country, state and Washtenaw County will be coming to speak about these issues, she said.\n\nThis report focuses on state and local candidates, including the Ann Arbor mayoral and city council races, Washtenaw County commissioners, and state legislators. It also includes responses to a candidate survey distributed by the Arts Alliance prior to the forum. Not included here are statements by the two Congressional candidates who attended the forum: Democrat Debbie Dingell, who\u2019s running in the primary against Raymond Mullins of Ypsilanti for the District 12 seat in the U.S. House of Representatives; and Republican Douglas Radcliffe North, who\u2019s running against incumbent Republican Tim Walberg for the District 7 seat in the U.S. House.\n\nThe outcomes of many of the local races will be determined in the Aug. 5, 2014 Democratic primary elections, if no Republicans or independent candidates are running. More information about candidates can be found on the Washtenaw County elections division website. Check the Michigan Votes website to find out your polling location and view a sample ballot.\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor\n\nThree of the four Democrats running for Ann Arbor mayor attended the July 23 forum: Sabra Briere, Sally Petersen and Christopher Taylor. Not attending the 8:30 a.m. event was Stephen Kunselman. All candidates completed the Arts Alliance survey. [.pdf of Briere survey response] [.pdf of Kunselman survey response] [.pdf of Petersen survey response] [.pdf of Taylor survey response]\n\nThere are no Republicans in this race. In November, one independent candidate \u2013 Bryan Kelly \u2013 will face the winner of the Democratic primary. Kelly attended the Arts Alliance forum, but did not complete the survey.\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor: Opening Statement \u2013 Sabra Briere\n\nSabra Briere said it had been interesting to sit in the audience and listen to what other candidates had to say, as well as being \u201cpart of the show.\u201d\n\nArt is both passive and active, she said. One person can create a score, a play or a piece of visual art. Some people can work with that one person \u2013 as a crew, as a band, as a cast \u2013 to create something bigger. But many people enjoy art in a passive way, by going to a lecture or a gallery. She\u2019d like to see more people in the second type of group, rather than the passive group.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that public art, private art and creativity all create an opportunity for economic development, and that\u2019s important, she said. But what\u2019s more important to her is community development. \u201cI want to see people engaged in creativity, because the more people who are engaged in this, the greater the opportunity they have to enrich their lives.\u201d Being a passive audience is good, but being a participant in art is better, she said.\n\nA decade ago, an artist envisioned a bright yellow line across an uneven surface, Briere recalled. And dozens of community members showed up at The Arb to plant over 10,000 daffodils. It was work, and it was wet, she said. \u201cBut it was an act of anticipation.\u201d There wasn\u2019t immediate gratification \u2013 you had to spend months waiting for those daffodils to bloom. She\u2019d bet that many of the people who planted those daffodils go back every year to see how that line has changed. They go back to see where it\u2019s gotten fuzzy, because the daffodils have spread, and where it\u2019s nearly disappeared because it was too shady. \u201cThis is what I want to see happen in our community \u2013 more community building, strengthening our relationships with each other.\u201d\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor: Opening Statement \u2013 Bryan Kelly\n\nBryan Kelly told the audience that this was the first time he\u2019s addressed an audience as a mayoral candidate. He\u2019s a novelist, having studied writing at the University of Michigan.\n\n\u201cI can say firsthand that being an artist is the toughest damn job in the world. I\u2019d rather run for mayor than keep writing novels.\u201d He joked that he might drop out of the race and move to Ypsilanti to vote for Tyrone Bridges, because he liked everything that Bridges had to say. [Bridges, an Ypsilanti mayoral candidate, spoke earlier in the event.]\n\nKelly liked the idea of an art auction, saying that\u2019s a reasonable application of what the city government can do. There\u2019s a long history of scholarship that calls into question whether the public sector should support the arts, he said, based on the idea that the public would be subsidizing one artist over another.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not always the case that politicians are the best determiners of what is good art,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the public is, and the people are.\u201d He said he might have some uncomfortable responses to questions that were posed at this forum.\n\nHe said that \u201cart begins with the individual and not with funding. You can have all the funding in the world, but if you don\u2019t have artists, you don\u2019t have art.\u201d\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor: Opening Statement \u2013 Sally Petersen\n\nSally Petersen began by talking about her family\u2019s commitment to art. She and her husband, Tim Petersen, have supported FestiFools since it started, she said \u2013 \u201cMark Tucker had us at \u2018hello.\u2019\u201d Her husband is a board member of the University Musical Society, and she\u2019s a past board member of the Ann Arbor Art Center, and she\u2019s about to begin her third term on the board of the Neutral Zone, a nonprofit for teens.\n\nPetersen had three points. The first related to economic development. When she started on city council, she quickly learned that even though the council had made economic development a budget priority, the city has no economic development staff and only makes a $75,000 allocation to Ann Arbor SPARK for job creation.\n\nAnd SPARK is very focused on technology jobs, she noted. As mayor, Petersen would focus on job creation in all sectors that do well in Ann Arbor, including arts and culture. She reported that the Americans for the Arts have said that nationally, 4.4% of the companies in the country are in the arts and creative sector. In Washtenaw County, that number is higher \u2013 at 5.3%, she said. But nationally, 2.1% of jobs are in that sector, compared to only 1.8% in Washtenaw County. So there\u2019s room to grow here in terms of jobs in the arts sector, she said.\n\nHer second point related to public-private partnerships. Grand Rapids has ArtPrize. So Ann Arbor gets compared to Grand Rapids all the time, she noted, but it\u2019s important to remember that ArtPrize is privately funded. She spent the first five years of her business career in Columbus, Indiana, working for Cummins Engine, which made significant investments in public art in that community. [As one example of public art in that southern Indiana city of about 45,000 people is the sculpture by Henry Moore that stands in front of the public library, which was designed by I.M. Pei.] In Ann Arbor, there\u2019s Sonic Lunch that\u2019s supported by the Bank of Ann Arbor, she said. Neutral Zone\u2019s annual Live on Washington event has lots of private-sector donations. \u201cTo me, it feels like the appetite for public expression of art through private donations is pretty healthy in Ann Arbor. We just need to leverage that more as the economy improves.\u201d\n\nFinally, Petersen said it\u2019s important to keep a pulse on the public attitude toward art. The city\u2019s Percent for Art program didn\u2019t resonate with the majority of citizens in Ann Arbor, she said, \u201cand we saw that in 2012 when the public art millage failed.\u201d She said she had supported that millage. As the economy improves, if the city leverages public-private partnerships and creates more jobs in the arts, \u201cwe can change the public attitudes towards art so that perhaps in the future, a millage will actually work.\u201d\n\nPetersen concluded by reminding the audience of Ann Arbor Art Center\u2019s motto: \u201cWhere creativity and community meet.\u201d This inclusive nature about art is what she\u2019d promote as mayor, Petersen said.\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor: Opening Statement \u2013 Christopher Taylor\n\nArt and the arts are important to him as an individual, Christopher Taylor said. Ever since his seventh grade teacher realized that he could carry a tune, arts have been a part of his daily life. He attended the University of Michigan on a music scholarship, and he has a degree in vocal performance. \u201cAnd like of course many aspiring opera singers, I\u2019m now a lawyer,\u201d he joked. He works at the law firm of Hooper Hathaway on Main Street in Ann Arbor.\n\nHe noted that the arts play an important role in economic development, as others have mentioned. Several candidates have also mentioned the importance of the arts to children, and it\u2019s true that the arts couldn\u2019t be more effective in \u201chelping raise good little people.\u201d But he said he wanted to expand on something that Briere had mentioned \u2013 the role of arts in the community. The creation of art by the people of Ann Arbor is important to people\u2019s quality of life and sense of being and place, he said, and to their engagement with one another.\n\nWith \u201call profound respect\u201d to the city\u2019s professional arts organizations like the Arts Alliance, Michigan Theater and UMS, Taylor said, people\u2019s day-to-day lives are most profoundly affected by things like the Water Hill Music Fest, the Burns Park Players and Thurston Community Players. These are events where people come together with common purpose to create something that\u2019s meaningful and personal, that creates connections among neighbors, Taylor said.\n\nThey create lifelong friendships, and a \u201cthird place\u201d where people can come when they\u2019re not at work or home. As mayor, he\u2019d love to help propagate and expand these kinds of things. If he were mayor, people in the arts would know that they had a true friend and ally and advocate in the mayor\u2019s office, he said. \u201cWhat you needed, what you could dream of, what you can imagine a mayor could do \u2013 ask, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to get it done.\u201d\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor Q&A: What is your position on public art in Ann Arbor? What elements are necessary to make a public art program successful?\n\nBryan Kelly: Public art in Ann Arbor could be better, he said. Some of it makes him scratch his head. As a novelist, \u201cI don\u2019t understand physical art\u2026.it needs to have words on it.\u201d But if a painting or other type of physical art has words on it, he added, \u201cit usually undermines its purpose.\u201d\n\nSabra Briere: Briere said she supports public art in Ann Arbor in a lot of different ways. She supports art that\u2019s a physical manifestation \u2013 a sculpture or fountain \u2013 but she also supports public art that\u2019s a performance. That includes band performances, plays in The Arb and West Park, and \u201cthe mimes that occasionally show up at my table.\u201d Art challenges her and makes her think, \u201cand thinking is always a wonderful thing.\u201d\n\nA successful public art program comes from a combination of resources at the governmental level, and creativity bubbling up from the people, Briere said. She supports opening city hall to temporary exhibits of art, and opening up the city parks to temporary exhibits of art. Other ideas include holding a plein air painting contest for amateurs in the park, or closing Main Street for a play to be performed. \u201cI think you can do lots of creative things with art in public, without it becoming something where the public feels bad art is forced on them.\u201d As mayor, she\u2019d do her best to make sure many of these things happen, and she\u2019s open to other creative ideas that include a small amount of financial or staff support, opening up the creative world to a large number of people. She noted that there\u2019s never been a single piece of art displayed in public that someone doesn\u2019t think is bad.\n\nChristopher Taylor: \u201cI support public art \u2013 full stop.\u201d It\u2019s important for the city to invest in and advocate for the arts, he said. Public art programs are most successful when residents believe \u2013 and when it is factually true \u2013 that their other needs are being addressed, he added. \u201cBeing satisfied? Who\u2019s ever satisfied? But when the city is making an earnest and consistent effort, that is appreciated and understood by the residents.\u201d This is what allows a public art program to thrive in a political culture and political environment, he said.\n\nThe city failed in its initial effort to support public art through the Percent for Art program, Taylor said. It was insufficiently resourced from the staff side, and the public art commission was given a set of tasks with insufficient tools, he said, so it didn\u2019t work out. Integrating public art design into city capital projects on a project-by-project basis is the best way to move forward. If elected mayor, his votes will reflect the fact that he believes public art to be a value. If a new play structure in a park will cost X without art and enhanced design, but will cost X plus Y \u2013 \u201cwhere Y is reasonable\u201d \u2013 with art or expanded design, then he\u2019d support that.\n\nSally Petersen: Regarding her attitude toward public art, it\u2019s really about priorities, Petersen said. \u201cI\u2019m still kind of shrugging my shoulders over a discussion we had at the council table on Monday night.\u201d The council voted 8-2 to inquire about acquiring two more pieces of property for the parks system. She reported that she and mayor John Hieftje were on the losing side. There are 158 parks \u2013 does the city need two more? She characterized one property as swampland, and the other parcel as unbuildable. So the question is about priorities.\n\nThe city has only $57,000 allocated for community events, and she\u2019d rather double that budget so that the city could support events like FestiFools. The economic development allocation is only for $75,000 \u2013 and that\u2019s for technology jobs, she noted. [That amount is for the contract the city has with Ann Arbor SPARK.] She\u2019d like to double that as well, so that the city could support job creation in other sectors, including the creative sector. \u201cSo again, it\u2019s a matter of priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor Q&A: What\u2019s your favorite public art in Ann Arbor?\n\nBryan Kelly: There\u2019s some decent graffiti in town \u2013 under the train bridge at Argo Pond, for example.\n\nSabra Briere: Her favorite piece of public art is the sculpture in Hanover Square, at the corner of Packard and Division. It\u2019s a set of cascading books. [The piece by Ronald Bauer is titled \"Arbor Sapientiae.\"] Briere said she likes it when it\u2019s wet \u2013 it makes noise when it\u2019s raining, and it\u2019s fascinating to see what the artist did. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t get it, but being a book person, I like it.\u201d Her second favorite piece of public art is on the University of Michigan campus \u2013 a fountain at the Kellogg Eye Center that was locally designed.\n\nChristopher Taylor: He works on Main Street and has affection for the artwork on the Fourth & Washington parking structure. [The structure includes \"Urban Configurations\" by Irina Koukhanova and untitled stoneware panels by Barron Naegel and Yiu-Keung Lee.] Taylor said he loves the \u201cbig sculpture with the swing\u201d in front of the UM Museum of Art. [Mark di Suvero's \"Shang.\"] His kids love the sound of it and love interacting with it.\n\nSally Petersen: Her definition of art is broad, and she\u2019s a huge fan of FestiFools. \u201cIt is where community and creativity meet,\u201d she said, so that\u2019s her favorite expression of art in Ann Arbor. She values its inclusive nature. Petersen said she also likes art that\u2019s functional, like the mosaic tile on the Fourth & Washington parking structure [a mural by Michael Hall]. She also spends a lot of time running through Gallup Park, and there\u2019s a playground with a climbing structure in the shape of a frog. Art that\u2019s functional makes a lot of sense to her, Petersen said.\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor Q&A: Comment on the notion that Ann Arbor is being surpassed by other Michigan communities as a creative destination in Michigan.\n\nSally Petersen: Grand Rapids is probably one of those communities that has surpassed Ann Arbor, Petersen said. They have a lot of private funding for the arts. That city also has a city income tax, she noted. In Ann Arbor, about 68,000 people come into the city each day for work, she said, so the population of Ann Arbor increases by a third during the workweek. If Ann Arbor had an income tax, the state sets the level, she said \u2013 a half percent for out-of-towners, and one percent for people who live and work here. For Ann Arbor residents, the current city operations millage would be eliminated, she noted.\n\nWhen the city looked at a possible income tax in 2009, the net gain was $12 million. Petersen thought the first priority would be repairing the roads, but it might free up other areas of the budget to invest in the arts. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a crazy thing to say \u2013 I\u2019m running for mayor, and I want to consider a city income tax? What a crazy thing to run on! But at the same time, it lessens the tax burden for all of Ann Arbor.\u201d It would shift part of the tax burden onto people who are coming from out of town, who are also using the city\u2019s resources, she said.\n\nSabra Briere: Ann Arbor is best known for performance art \u2013 music and vocal art \u2013 and is less known for visual art, she said. In the past five years, a lot of people have asked why the city needs to put money into visual art, she added, because the university does that already. As a mechanism for becoming economically healthier, other communities are turning to art and to the expression of the human soul \u2013 while Ann Arbor is getting just a little bit more pragmatic and saying \u201cJust fix the roads.\u201d In order to be healthy, to be a growing, vibrant, exciting community, Ann Arbor needs to do both, Briere said. We need to figure out what an expression of the city\u2019s artistic soul may be, she added, and she\u2019d like to see that expression as a community that works together to create art.\n\nChristopher Taylor: Taylor said he didn\u2019t think it was necessarily true that other communities are surpassing Ann Arbor. Grand Rapids receives a great deal of notoriety for ArtPrize. \u201cIf any of the local billionaires in the audience are interested helping out in this regard, I think we could certainly move the bar a little bit on that one,\u201d he joked. But it\u2019s true that there\u2019s a competitive environment, he said, and Ann Arbor needs to move forward and be better at what it does, and to advocate for the creative sector.\n\nHe\u2019d like to see the community propagate and support organizations that want to put on events throughout the city, whether it\u2019s in neighborhoods or downtown. The city has a role there. Also, the city owns a lot of land, including some land that city officials are considering selling. Taylor said he\u2019d be interested in entertaining the possibility of workspace for artists, where appropriate, if a practical proposal is brought forward. It\u2019s a community value, and would help move any misconception about Ann Arbor\u2019s friendliness for arts to the side, he said.\n\nBryan Kelly: \u201cThis is easy,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cOver my dead body. I\u2019d dare any city to be more artistic.\u201d Being more artistic comes down to the individuals that a city attracts, and he takes very seriously the part of the city charter that defines the mayor as the ceremonial head of the city. That\u2019s part of the reason why he was attracted to run for mayor. He intends to be symbolic, as a candidate \u201cwho has not found success in their creative life,\u201d but who is able to apply his talents to running for mayor and share a commonality with the artistic experience. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to Grand Rapids to buy any art,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI\u2019ll buy from a neighbor first.\u201d\n\nAnn Arbor Mayor Q&A: It sounds as if candidates don\u2019t see a significant role for city government funding for the arts via the city\u2019s general fund. Why is that?\n\nBryan Kelly: The public arts millage wasn\u2019t approved by voters, he noted. And as Briere had pointed out, there will always be people who hate a public presentation of art. So what the city is dealing with is the fallout from the millage. Personally, Kelly said, he\u2019s dealing with the question of whether the public sphere should take the primary role in supporting the arts \u2013 or should it be individuals and the private sector.\n\nChristopher Taylor: Taylor said he\u2019s very much in favor of public support of art. At the council table, he said, he\u2019s been a strong supporter for funding public art, and he\u2019s supporting the new public art program that integrates art into enhanced design of city capital projects. The city needs to expand its support of community events, and many of those events are arts-based. The city provides support to the original Street Art Fair, he said, through a direct subsidy. The city also supports the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, Taylor said. He didn\u2019t know whether the city has a role at this point in directly supporting performing arts organizations. The city needs to continue to support the infrastructure and underlying environment where these programs can prosper, he said.\n\nSabra Briere: Briere noted that she, Petersen and Taylor had all helped rewrite the public art ordinance and removed the Percent for Art concept. Now, the ordinance includes the concept of \u201cbaking in\u201d art into capital improvement projects. That allows the city to designate some types of capital improvement to be enhanced by more architectural design, or including art in the design of the project from the beginning \u2013 not slapped on as an afterthought. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear a dedication to spending money on public art, it\u2019s not that we aren\u2019t dedicated,\u201d she said. It\u2019s something they might not talk about explicitly because they\u2019ve already thought about it and committed to supporting public art. \u201cWe give money to cultural events, though not enough. But we all care about public art.\u201d\n\nSally Petersen: Petersen addressed the issue of why the city\u2019s general fund doesn\u2019t have a larger line item for public art. \u201cI think it comes back to the current appetite for public dollars for public art.\u201d For a variety of reasons, the Percent for Art approach didn\u2019t work in Ann Arbor, she said. The councilmembers who are running for mayor worked on a task force to transition the program to become part of capital improvements, and to crowdfund public art projects as well, she noted. She thinks there\u2019s an appetite for crowdfunding from the private sector for public art. \u201cI think we need to see some examples of positive art \u2013 positive public art that\u2019s privately funded.\u201d If the private sector gets on board, that might \u201cwater the soil\u201d for the public coming forward. She\u2019d like to see another try at a public art millage. The time might not be now, but it might be four years from now, she said. \u201cIf we can rely on private-sector partners first, maybe we can sow the seeds for that in the future.\u201d\n\nAnn Arbor City Council\n\nFour candidates for Ann Arbor city council attended the July 23 forum: Don Adams, Kirk Westphal, Julie Grand and Chuck Warpehoski.\n\nAnn Arbor City Council: Opening Statements \u2013 Don Adams\n\nDon Adams is running for a seat in Ward 1 currently held by Sumi Kailasapathy, who is seeking re-election. Both are Democrats. Kailasapathy did not attend the forum, but did complete the candidate survey. [.pdf of Kailasapathy survey response] Adams did not turn in the survey.\n\nAdams said that if elected, he\u2019d like to see the council work with the creative sector more to improve art. Art is something that\u2019s close to his heart. The council can help attract and retain talent to the city. Artists can bring a vibrant community together. Some people say it would attract young talent, but Adams noted that older people love art as well. He pointed out that Debbie Dingell, in her remarks earlier in the forum, had mentioned the STEM (science technology engineering math) approach to education. At Northside Elementary, which his two daughters attend, the program is STEAM \u2013 adding art into the mix.\n\nAdams also talked about how art can work with rehab. He\u2019s on the board of directors at the Eisenhower Center, where they work with people who have traumatic brain injuries, including veterans. There\u2019s a music therapist who works with the patients and gets good results, he said. They had an art therapist student too, but she recently finished her degree and moved on. At their Manchester campus, there\u2019s an art therapy program with ceramics, drawing and painting, and a woodshop. Art and rehab is something he holds dear to his heart.\n\nIn conclusion, Adams noted that his seven-year-old daughter\u2019s artwork was hung at the Ann Arbor District Library. \u201cSo she is now officially a published artist.\u201d\n\nAnn Arbor City Council: Opening Statements \u2013 Kirk Westphal\n\nKirk Westphal is running against Nancy Kaplan in Ward 2. There\u2019s no incumbent in this race. Both candidates are Democrats, and no Republicans are running this year. Kaplan did not attend the forum, but both candidates completed the Arts Alliance survey. [.pdf of Westphal survey response] [.pdf of Kaplan survey response]\n\nWhen his family talks about the arts, Westphal said, his wife literally and figuratively steals the show \u2013 she was a Broadway music director who\u2019s now a professor with the University of Michigan musical theater department. He encouraged people to attend the department\u2019s productions, saying \u201cit\u2019s the best value ticket in town.\u201d\n\nWestphal told the audience that he\u2019s an urban planner. His job includes creating educational documentaries about cities and different aspects of urban life. His latest one is based in Ann Arbor, called \u201cRide \u2018Round A2.\u201d It focuses on bus and bike commuting.\n\nThe role of the creative sector in this community is absolutely about art objects and entertainment venues, Westphal said. But in the bigger picture, it has to do with creative problem-solving and creativity in different industries. It\u2019s a core competency in today\u2019s economy \u2013 whether you\u2019re an artist or an engineer or an architect, creative problem-solving is important, and the arts play a major role in that.\n\nLast year, the Knight Foundation completed a major study, interviewing more than 40,000 people over a three-year period in small to mid-sized cities nationwide. The purpose was to find out what the drivers are for growing people\u2019s affection for their community, he said \u2013 what makes people love a city and stay there. The three major drivers were the city\u2019s aesthetics, its social offerings, and its openness. \u201cNow if the creative industry can\u2019t tackle these items, I don\u2019t know who can.\u201d\n\nSo how can Ann Arbor leverage and strengthen the talent and organizations that the city has now? First, the city needs an arts and culture master plan, Westphal said. Unless the community can describe what it wants and where \u2013 and come up with something that can be measured, documented, and inventoried \u2013 it\u2019s much less likely to happen. Creating a master plan would be a great opportunity to talk about what the community values. Another strategy is to empower people to make creativity happen now, he said. There are tens of thousands of people in this community who voted to tax themselves to make public art happen, he noted. [This was a reference to those who voted for the unsuccessful 2012 millage proposal.] \u201cSo where are they now, and where\u2019s their money?\u201d Let them envision where they\u2019d like to invest and then let them build it, he said.\n\nThis is a conversation that needs to keep happening \u2013 and not just during an election, Westphal said. As a city councilmember, he\u2019d help facilitate an ongoing dialogue with the community and artists.\n\n[Regarding the master plan, five years ago the Arts Alliance had developed a cultural master plan for Washtenaw County, with customized \"working plans\" for several local population centers, including Ann Arbor. Deb Polich, the Arts Alliance executive director, reported that \"we're ready to dust it off\" and refresh it next spring.]\n\nAnn Arbor City Council: Opening Statements \u2013 Julie Grand\n\nJulie Grand is one of three Democrats running for Ward 3 city council. There is no incumbent for this seat. Other candidates are Samuel McMullen and Bob Dascola, who did not attend the forum or complete the Arts Alliance survey. [.pdf of Grand survey response]\n\nAs a parent, Grand sees how her own kids get out their emotions through art \u2013 \u201ceven if it\u2019s sometimes an X over my face when they don\u2019t like what they hear.\u201d She shared a personal anecdote that she said reflected the community\u2019s relationship with art. She was a dancer from kindergarten through college, and taught dance in high school. Her last performances were in Philadelphia. When she came to Ann Arbor for grad school, she thought she\u2019d keep dancing. She went to the dance department and was told that she wasn\u2019t in the right kind of shape. \u201cSo since I was too fat to dance, I stopped.\u201d Grand said she wasn\u2019t trying to engender sympathy, but wanted to point out that it takes a lot of courage to participate in the creative sector. \u201cYou have to be willing to put yourself out there to an often anonymous and unkind public.\u201d It\u2019s really easy to abandon a focus on the arts and turn to other priorities, she said.\n\nSimilarly, it takes a lot of courage to stand up for public funding of the arts, Grand said. There\u2019s that unkind and anonymous public out there, who would rather see the city spend its money elsewhere. It\u2019s really easy to use the small amount of funding that\u2019s spent on arts as a scapegoat, instead of coming up with real solutions to things like roads and sewers, \u201cwhich have nothing to do with the arts.\u201d\n\nGrand said she didn\u2019t want to preach to the choir, but from her perspective, the city council can take several actions to help bring the community back to an appreciation and support of the arts. Residents want projects that are smaller in scale, she said, so that\u2019s important. The city also needs to have projects that are unrestricted in theme. \u201cThe site should dictate the art, not the funding source.\u201d Residents also really want to support local artists, Grand said. The city needs to do a better job of reaching out to the creative sector. She\u2019d also like to see more opportunities for temporary art that can provide exposure for lots of local artists. The city should promote and provide funding for festivals so that everyone in the community can get exposure to the arts. It contributes to the unique character of this community. Ann Arborites also want to see projects that are accessible, Grand said \u2013 not just in the downtown, but in parks, libraries, along the Huron River and elsewhere. The city needs to think about public-private partnerships, as well as partnerships with educational institutions and nonprofits.\n\nGrand pointed out that John Kotarski, vice chair of the city\u2019s public art commission, was in the audience. He has lots of wonderful ideas, she said. Six months was not enough time for the art commission to \u201cturn that process around,\u201d and she\u2019d like to see it reversed. [Responding to a follow-up query from The Chronicle, Grand said she was referring to the defunding of public art and lack of staff support for the public art commission.]\n\nAnn Arbor City Council: Opening Statements \u2013 Chuck Warpehoski\n\nDemocrat Chuck Warpehoski is running for a second term representing Ward 5. [.pdf of Warpehoski survey response] Leon Bryson will appear on the Ward 5 Democratic primary ballot, but is not campaigning and announced his intent to withdraw from that race.\n\nWarpehoski delivered his statement in verse:\n\nI\u2019m a politician I\u2019m not a poet And here with the Arts Alliance I don\u2019t wanna blow it When I think of about the role of arts Here in our city It\u2019s about more than just trying to make things pretty While we wring our hands talking about economic health the creative sector's a source of true community wealth As we rebuild this great Great Lakes state we can't do the old things we have to innovate And create places where people want to be sounds like a job for the arts if you ask me Nobody chooses a city about our sewer drains Or the miles and miles of new water mains Those are important we have to get them right but curb and gutter work doesn\u2019t bring anybody delight And the kids, man, the kids Tyrone said it \u2013 the kids corporate culture has them tuning out watching YouTube vids Better to nurture Their creative expression that's a much more healthy fulfilling lifelong obsession You don\u2019t just have to receive and passively watch You can create \u2013 to do so is our most fundamental human trait The arts here in town They have some challenges That\u2019s no lie Studio rents are too damn high Maybe you wait tables and do art on the side I want Ann Arbor to be a place where you can reside So whether you sculpt or dance or sing We need more and affordable workforce housing So what can you expect If I'm re-elected? Funding for the arts will be protected From Top of the Park to FoolMoon in the dark or that great new mural Down in Allmendinger Park But there\u2019s a limit To what the government can do That\u2019s why to succeed We need all of you You keep creating We\u2019ll keep debating Let\u2019s hope the outcome invigorating Hey, I\u2019m a politician I\u2019m not a poet But Ann Arbor is art town I want you to know it.\n\n-\n\nAnn Arbor City Council Q&A: The public art commission is taking a hiatus as the program goes through some restructuring. What message do you have for the art commission and the broader arts community in terms of next steps for the program?\n\nChuck Warpehoski: There was a fight to get funding to hire an arts administrator to help move to the next stage, he said. The city had put a lot of responsibility on the public art commission without giving them the support they need.\n\nNow, the city has lined up funds to get a professional arts coordinator to provide that support. \u201cWhere that\u2019s gonna go? I don\u2019t know \u2013 we\u2019re still figuring that out.\u201d But having institutional support will be vital, he said.\n\nThe public art commission has done great work, but if residents want this to be a priority for the city, they need to be involved, and encourage their friends and neighbors to get involved too. That\u2019s important to build support for the arts, he noted, \u201cbecause the fight to get the funding for the arts administrator was a real fight, and without your support, it\u2019s going to get harder and harder.\u201d\n\nKirk Westphal: Westphal said he\u2019d echo Warpehoski\u2019s sentiments. \u201cThis is a bottom-up fight for culture in our community. We cannot just offload it onto our politicians and our commissioners.\u201d People need to communicate with their elected leaders about what they want. People love Ann Arbor for the culture it has, and \u201cwe have to keep infusing it with more.\u201d It takes being proactive action from the bottom up \u2013 from citizens asking for it. We need to support the existing institutions and public art commissioners, \u201cand we need more people under the tent.\u201d There are a lot of different tastes in town, and different tolerances for how the city spends money \u2013 \u201cso let\u2019s get those ideas together, and expand the people in charge of this process.\u201d\n\nJulie Grand: With due respect to the councilmembers who worked on restructuring the Percent for Art program, Grand said, the public art commission had some really innovative ideas and she was profoundly disappointed when their funding and staff support was taken away. This process can\u2019t happen in six months, she said. The commission was looking to incorporate best practices, and to go through a stronger community input process \u2013 which she supports whenever the city is dealing with complex issues. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect that private donors are just going to fall out of the sky,\u201d she said. It takes time to build those relationships. She\u2019d be in favor of allowing the public art commission to do its work, and would like to be supportive of their recommendations.\n\nDon Adams: Adams agreed with the other candidates, telling the creative sector that \u201cyou\u2019ll always have a seat at my table.\u201d He\u2019s willing to work with the arts community to see how they can make things better. It won\u2019t happy overnight, he said, but he\u2019s willing to work on it.\n\nYpsilanti Mayor\n\nTyrone Bridges was the only Democratic mayoral candidate for the city of Ypsilanti who attended the July 23 forum. The other candidates are Amanda Edmonds and Peter Murdock. None of the candidates filled out the Arts Alliance survey. There are no Republicans in this race.\n\nYpsilanti Mayor: Opening Statement\n\nTyrone Bridges told the audience that he\u2019s a 45-year-old single parent who\u2019s been an artist for many years.\n\nIt started in the late 1970s when he was a breakdance artist. He joked that if there was more room, \u201cI\u2019d cut a little rug for you.\u201d As an African American growing up in a home with abuse, he used art to escape. \u201cArt was the closest thing that I had as a friend,\u201d he said. Most people didn\u2019t think he had artistic abilities, \u201cbut I can pretty much draw anything I can see.\u201d God gives us artist ability and energy, he said.\n\nAs a single parent with a 15-year-old child, Bridges said he taught his son how to draw. His son was selected out of a group of 40 students to present his art to the public for an auction, he reported.\n\nHe\u2019d brought the drawing to the July 23 forum, and showed it to the audience \u2013 a colorful Celtic knot. \u201cMy son took colors and made beauty.\u201d This is what makes Washtenaw County powerful, he said \u2013 our colorful community, and our ability to share beauty. \u201cWe are some beautiful people created by God,\u201d he said. He thanked God for giving him the ability to show his child how to be creative instead of being destructive.\n\nAs mayor of Ypsilanti, he\u2019d work with the Arts Alliance on a countywide art competition for all students.\n\nYpsilanti Mayor Q&A: What\u2019s your favorite piece of public art in Ypsilanti?\n\nBridges said he didn\u2019t have a favorite piece of public art, but he always creates art in his spare time. God is always reaching down for you when you fall, just like parents picking up their children when they fall, he said. \u201cOur communities should reach down and pick up our youth.\u201d As mayor, Bridges said he would inspire more youth to be creative instead of destructive.\n\nYpsilanti Mayor Q&A: What would be your top public policy change as mayor, to support the creative sector?\n\nBridges said he didn\u2019t know much about the policies in Ypsilanti, but as mayor, he\u2019d have leverage to do some things. He\u2019d love to bring all artists in the county together. In Ypsilanti, he\u2019d like to do an art challenge for students. The city could do fundraisers and find matching grants, he said. Elected officials need to eliminate the word \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d from their vocabulary.\n\nWashtenaw County Board of Commissioners\n\nFive candidates for the Washtenaw County board of commissioners attended the July 23 forum: Felicia Brabec, Wilma Gold-Jones, Ruth Ann Jamnick, Andy LaBarre and Yousef Rabhi.\n\nWashtenaw County Commissioners: Opening Statements \u2013 Felicia Brabec\n\nFelicia Brabec, a Democrat from Pittsfield Township, is the incumbent representing District 4 on the county board. She is unchallenged in the primary, and faces Republican Stanley Watson on Nov. 4. [.pdf of Brabec survey response] Watson did not attend the forum or complete the Arts Alliance survey.\n\nBrabec said she\u2019s lucky that she grew up as an arts lover because of her parents. Her mom was an educator, and during many summers there was always one day a week when her family would go on excursions \u2013 to places like museums or concerts. Brabec and her husband try to encourage an appreciation of arts in their own children. She brought her son to the forum, and on the way over he asked what she planned to talk about. She reminded him of how they look for Sluggo and Philomena \u2013 characters by chalk artist David Zinn. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our family culture,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the county, there are some opportunities to support arts and culture. They can hang work by local artists and children in the county buildings, she said. The county also runs camps for kids, and being able to support arts education is a way to make a difference. It\u2019s an important connection to make between arts and the community. Brabec also mentioned the revenue raised by levying a countywide Act 88 millage \u2013 a portion of that is used to invest in cultural preservation. She would continue to support that endeavor. The county also partners with local municipalities, she noted. District 4 includes Pittsfield Township, which recently installed its first public art piece at the township hall. She encouraged people to come out and see it.\n\nBrabec concluded by reading a quote attributed to John F. Kennedy: \u201cIf arts is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him.\u201d Her hope is to support all local artists, to see where our community can go.\n\nWashtenaw County Commissioners: Opening Statements \u2013 Wilma Gold-Jones\n\nWilma Gold-Jones is one of four Democrats running for District 5, which covers Augusta Township and part of Ypsilanti Township south of I-94.\n\nOther Democratic candidates are Ruth Ann Jamnick, Victor Dobrin and Keith Jason. The winner of the primary will face Republican Timothy King in November. The current commissioner from that district, Democrat Rolland Sizemore Jr., is not seeking re-election. Gold-Jones did not complete the Arts Alliance survey.\n\nArt is an educational tool, Gold-Jones said. Kids learn their creativity in school and are energized when they\u2019re allowed to express themselves \u2013 through poetry, dance, music or other artistic ways. When she was a child, as an African American, she learned about her rich cultural heritage.\n\nLearning about other cultures helps to dissipate fears and teaches people to appreciate each other. She said she\u2019s not an artist, but she loves to dance.\n\nMusic is her way of expressing herself. She also likes to go to festivals and other arts and cultural events.\n\nWashtenaw County Commissioners: Opening Statements \u2013 Ruth Ann Jamnick\n\nRuth Ann Jamnick is another Democrat running for the District 5 seat. [.pdf of Jamnick survey response]\n\nJamnick began by saying she was born and raised in Ypsilanti, but graduated from St. Thomas school in Ann Arbor. In Ypsilanti Township, there\u2019s a company called Sensitile that asked for a tax abatement to refurbish an old building. They do unique lighting for businesses and homes, she said. The township gave them a tax abatement, she reported.\n\nSo that\u2019s one way that government can support businesses that are oriented \u201cin a little bit of a different nuance than what most people think is art.\u201d\n\nJamnick said she was probably the least \u201cartist-type person\u201d in the room. \u201cMy doodles are squares.\u201d She\u2019s been a volunteer for various organizations over the years, including the Heritage Festival and the Festival of Lights.\n\nShe would work with leaders in other communities to preserve historic buildings. In Augusta Township, for example, there are two hamlets that could be helped, she said. Funding is still tight, but she\u2019s heartened that the state might be bringing back some deductions for the state income tax.\n\nWashtenaw County Commissioners: Opening Statements \u2013 Andy LaBarre\n\nIncumbent Democrat Andy LaBarre is running for a second two-year term to represent District 7 in Ann Arbor. [.pdf of LaBarre survey response] He\u2019s unopposed in the primary, and faces Republican Joe Miriani in November. Miriani did not attend the forum or complete the Arts Alliance survey.\n\nLaBarre reported that on Monday night he was weeding his garden, and his mom came over to help. \u201cAs moms are wont to do, she was telling me a lot of things.\u201d One of those things was a report that friends are coming to visit from London. His mom is meeting them in Chicago and on their way back to Ann Arbor, they\u2019ll be stopping in Grand Rapids for an art festival. She told him that periodic interaction with the arts \u201crecharges my soul.\u201d And it does, he said. Brabec had done a good job in describing some of the ways that the county can support the arts, and he agrees with those. Sometimes people describe art as frivolous or not a basic function of government. \u201cMy pledge is that you\u2019re not going to hear that from me.\u201d\n\nThere are times when public money has to be spent on other things, but art itself is never a frivolous use of money or a waste of money. It connects you to who you are as a community, he said. To be honest, he added, the most he can do is to be open and receptive to ideas on how to expand the access to arts, and \u201chow we can recharge souls.\u201d That\u2019s the job \u2013 don\u2019t denigrate art, and try to promote it when they can, and be receptive to ways in which the arts affect people\u2019s lives.\n\nWashtenaw County Commissioners: Opening Statements \u2013 Yousef Rabhi\n\nYousef Rabhi is the incumbent Democrat in District 8, who current serves as chair of the county board of commissioners. The Ann Arbor resident is unopposed in the primary, and faces Republican Jeffrey Gallatin in November. Neither Rabhi nor Gallatin completed the Arts Alliance survey.\n\nRabhi said that for him, the definition of art is \u201cthe organic expression of the human spirit.\u201d He feels that it\u2019s essential to who we are as humans, and to who we are as a community. The founding of this country included the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, he noted. \u201cWhat is the pursuit of happiness if you don\u2019t have art?\u201d So as a fundamental value for government, for communities and for our very being, he said, the importance of art should go without saying. He agreed with the things that Brabec and LaBarre had highlighted, but he wanted to highlight a couple of things that deserve \u201ca little bit more watering of the roots.\u201d\n\nThe county invests in the Washtenaw Area Teens for Tomorrow and other youth alliances, he said, to facilitate artistic expression like music, painting and sculpture. Every year, there\u2019s a showcase of youth art and it\u2019s a phenomenal event, he said. Access to art is an important thing, and investment is needed. Art shouldn\u2019t be just for the wealthy \u2013 it should be for everyone. That\u2019s why the investments on the east side of the county are important, Rabhi said.\n\nEveryone should be able to be an artist, if that\u2019s their calling. Part of this is a public campaign, he added, to convince the public that art is important. People should be reminded that everyone is an artist, and the role of government should be to create a community canvas where everyone can paint their expression of the human spirit.\n\nWashtenaw County Commissioners Q&A: What are the advantages and disadvantages of a countywide arts millage. Would you support it?\n\nYousef Rabhi: Rabhi joked that he always likes to talk about taxes. More revenue for art is a good thing. However, when thinking about a millage, it\u2019s something the community has to support. A lot of effort and money would be spent on getting it passed, and that\u2019s a challenge. \u201cBut if an arts millage is the way we want to go, then fine. I think that being strategic is important.\u201d Rabhi said he\u2019d advocate more strongly for finding new ways of funding local government in general, including art. \u201cWe\u2019re being pinched at every corner.\u201d It\u2019s ridiculous that property taxes are the only way to fund local government in Michigan, and it\u2019s limiting the ability to provide even basic services. Options might be a local sales tax, or a tax on special events \u2013 but those changes would need to happen at the state level, he noted. It\u2019s important that state legislators understand that local government can\u2019t continue by relying solely on millages.\n\nAndy LaBarre: He wouldn\u2019t support putting a countywide public art millage on the ballot in the next two to four years. He didn\u2019t think it would pass, and it would be detrimental to efforts to pass possible millages for public safety or human services. But if it were on the ballot, \u201cI\u2019d vote for it,\u201d he said. If the community wants to fund art locally, they need to look at what other tools exist or ask for new tools. He wished he would say that he absolutely supports a public arts millage, \u201cbut I think the \u2018No\u2019 crowd and the anti-government crowd is still strong.\u201d\n\nRuth Ann Jamnick: She\u2019d support a public arts millage, with the caveat that there should be a very clear distribution of funds. The county would need to tell people in each community how they\u2019d get a share, and how it could be spent. Every community would want to know what\u2019s going to come to their community, in terms of funding to enhance their quality of life. Ann Arbor is obviously the cultural center of Washtenaw County, she said, but outside of that, people would want to know what their community would get. So they\u2019d need to be very careful about that.\n\nWilma Gold-Jones: She agreed with LaBarre about the need to convince the public that an arts millage would be for the greater good, when funding in general is very tight. Most creative energy comes through the schools, and through grants that leverage county funds. With that approach, it spills over into the community, she said. Gold-Jones agreed with Jamnick that each community would want to know what its share would be, and what it could fund. It\u2019s important to look at this possibility and do their homework ahead of time, to make sure such a millage would provide the community with the best bang for their buck.\n\nFelicia Brabec: Theoretically, she\u2019d be in favor of an arts millage. However, she\u2019d balance that with the reality of the county\u2019s situation now. Other issues are on the table, including public safety and human services. It was helpful to hear some of the data in ArtServe\u2019s Creative State report, Brabec said, but there are some other pressing needs. She\u2019d try to balance those and ask constituents what they want. But in general, she agreed with Rabhi that more funding tools are needed.\n\nDexter Township Supervisor\n\nOnly one candidate from the townships attended the Arts Alliance forum \u2013 Democrat Michael Kundak-Cowall, who\u2019s running for Dexter Township supervisor. [.pdf of Kundak-Cowall survey response] He is unchallenged in the primary, and in November will face the winner of the Republican primary \u2013 either Mark Wojno or Harley Rider. They did not attend the forum or complete the Arts Alliance survey.\n\nDexter Township Supervisor: Opening Statement\n\nMichael Kundak-Cowall described Dexter Township \u201csolidly rural,\u201d located between Chelsea and Dexter but not including the village of Dexter.\n\nIt has a population of about 6,000. The township budget currently has no money appropriated for the arts, he said. However, the township is home to a significant number of artists. Why? \u201cFirst off, it\u2019s just plain beautiful out there.\u201d The township is at the edge of the Pinckney State Recreation Area, and there are several parks in the area. The infrastructure includes broadband access through Charter Communications, he noted. His neighbor is an oil painter, and the vocal music director for the Chelsea School District lives nearby.\n\nTo bring in more people, the township needs to improve its quality of life, Kundak-Cowall said. The township is on the edge of Detroit Edison\u2019s energy grid, he said, so when power goes out, the township is usually among the last to get its power back. The vast majority of roads are unpaved, so whenever it rains there\u2019s massive erosion and flooding, which sometimes makes the dirt roads impassable. A new substation is being built, which hopefully will improve the reliability of power, he said. The township is also doing what it can to help improve the roads, so you won\u2019t have to renavigate the back roads when \u201cpart of the road is just kind of mysteriously washed away.\u201d\n\nSo by spending less time taking care of your generator and less time trying to make sure the wheels of your car haven\u2019t fallen off because of hitting a pothole, Kundak-Cowall said, you have more time to do what you want to do \u2013 whether it\u2019s making art, or spending time with local artists.\n\nDexter Township Supervisor Q&A: As supervisor, are there concrete ways to support the local artists living in Dexter Township?\n\nThe township is currently running a budget surplus of about $200,000, Kundak-Cowall said. Some of that could be used for appropriations and grants, if the rest of the board agrees. That would be the most direct form. Right now the township hall is being renovated, and he\u2019d appreciate art contributions for that. Most galleries in the area are in Dexter and Chelsea, outside of the township. The township appreciates all artists who contribute to the community, he said.\n\nState Level Candidates\n\nThree candidates at the state level attended the July 23 forum: Shari Pollesch, Gretchen Driskell and Jeff Irwin.\n\nState Level Candidates: Opening Statement \u2013 Shari Pollesch\n\nDemocrat Shari Pollesch is running for a state Senate seat in District 22. The Livingston County resident is unchallenged in the August primary, and faces incumbent Republican Joe Hune on Nov. 4. Hune did not attend the July 23 forum.\n\nThe district covers Livingston County and western Washtenaw County, including the townships of Lyndon, Dexter, Webster, Northfield, Sylvan, Lima, Scio, Sharon, Freedom, Lodi, Manchester, Bridgewater, and Saline, as well as the villages of Dexter and Manchester, and the city of Chelsea. [.pdf of Pollesch survey responses] [.pdf of Hune survey responses]\n\nPollesch said she\u2019s a strong believer in the arts in terms of education. Especially for at-risk kids, it\u2019s one of the ways to keep them energized and interested in their education. She serves on the board of the Livingston County Concert Band, and they\u2019ve talked about whether millages should be levied to help with the arts.\n\nAny community that\u2019s thriving is doing so in part because it has a thriving arts culture, she said. It\u2019s the hallmark for quality of life. If elected, Pollesch said she\u2019d support the arts and will continue to participate in the arts. \u201cI\u2019m much better at enjoying the arts than participation,\u201d she joked, \u201cbut they let me play every week anyway.\u201d\n\nState Level Candidates: Opening Statement \u2013 Gretchen Driskell\n\nGretchen Driskell, a Saline resident, is the incumbent Democrat state Representative for District 52. She is unopposed in the Aug. 5 primary, and faces Republican John Hochstetler of Manchester in November.\n\nHochstetler did not attend the Arts Alliance forum or complete the candidate survey. District 52 covers the northern and western portions of Washtenaw County, including: the townships of Bridgewater, Dexter, Freedom, Lima, Lodi, Lyndon, Manchester, Northfield, Salem, Saline, Sharon, Sylvan and Webster; the cities of Chelsea and Saline; and portions of the city of Ann Arbor, Pittsfield Township and Scio Township. [.pdf of Driskell survey responses]\n\nDriskell noted that she\u2019s a freshman legislator and a former mayor of Saline. While serving as mayor, she started an arts & culture committee. She\u2019s lived in this area for 26 years, and has served on various board and commissions that recognize the importance of arts and culture, including the economic importance. The creative sector attracts and retains people, she said. In the state legislature, she\u2019s been working on two initiatives related to the arts. One is a bipartisan talent task force, and ArtServe had spoken to the group. It\u2019s important to educate legislature about the importance of arts and culture. \u201cThere seems to be a huge disconnect,\u201d she said, so that\u2019s one thing she\u2019s been working on.\n\nThe other effort Driskell cited is to increase investment in public education. Several school systems in District 52 are struggling, she noted, so more funding is needed. \u201cBecause as we all know, when education gets cut, they cut the things that they think are the soft things, which I strongly disagree with.\u201d\n\nState Level Candidates: Opening Statement \u2013 Jeff Irwin\n\nDemocrat Jeff Irwin is the incumbent state Representative for District 53, which covers the city of Ann Arbor. He is unopposed in the primary and will run against John Spisak in November. Neither Irwin or Spisak completed the Arts Alliance candidate survey.\n\nIrwin focused on three priorities: money, marketing and education. He said that Driskell had done a good job identifying pressures on the education system. Ann Arbor has felt its fair share of those cuts, though the situation isn\u2019t as bad here as elsewhere. The Lansing public schools cut all of their elementary school art teachers, he said, due to a lack of funding. The state needs to do a better job so that schools can focus on things like arts and culture that inspire kids to learn.\n\nThe second piece is marketing. The state spends a lot of money marketing economic development, Irwin said, but very little money marketing the economic development opportunities around the creative sector. If the Michigan Economic Development Corp. spent 10% of what they spent on marketing golf, and instead used that to market theaters and galleries, \u201cI think our citizens would know a lot more about the excellent cultural offerings we have here in Michigan, and I think we\u2019d get more bang for our buck.\u201d\n\nThe final priority is money. At the end of former Gov. Jennifer Granholm\u2019s administration and the depths of Michigan\u2019s economic recession in 2008-2009, funding for the Michigan Council for the Arts was \u201cbeaten down to zero,\u201d Irwin said. There\u2019s been more support for the council in the past couple of state budgets, and if that trend continues, the funding will return to its former level and hopefully beyond, he said.\n\nState Level Candidates Q&A: How would you make an argument for resources to support arts and culture, given that there are so many other pressing needs \u2013 from roads to education to social services?\n\nShari Pollesch: Arts and a thriving cultural community is the hallmark of our lifestyle, Pollesch said. \u201cWe can improve the roads \u2013 and god knows we need to improve the roads,\u201d she added, \u201cbut people want more than roads.\u201d We need to find a way to fund roads and education and the arts \u2013 it\u2019s all one equation. \u201cI would argue to find funding for all of it.\u201d A millage might be one approach. She noted that other candidates \u2013 including Debbie Dingell and Jeff Irwin \u2013 touched on the fact that we don\u2019t do a good job of promoting the arts as the reason why we\u2019re living here, she said. \u201cIf we do a better job of selling these great amenities in our communities, people would be willing to fund it, if they know that the funding is being used responsibly.\u201d\n\nGretchen Driskell: Part of attracting and retaining talent is quality of life, Driskell said, and that includes arts and culture at the top of the list. It\u2019s important to educate state legislators about what quality of life means and how Michigan compares to other states, and why it\u2019s an important investment at the state level. A recent report came out by Michigan Future Inc. that\u2019s focused on prosperity, and compares Michigan to Minnesota. It specifically examines state policies, Driskell reported, and is very enlightening. The report looks at how investments are made for the public good \u2013 and arts and culture is a public good, she said. It\u2019s an investment in quality of life, and helps attract and retain talent.\n\nJeff Irwin: When he advocates for these things in Lansing, he focuses mostly on what Driskell described \u2013 partially because that\u2019s what Gov. Rick Snyder is saying and it\u2019s an opportunity to work together and get something done. The argument for talent and economic development is a strong one. Irwin said he also makes arguments based on leveraging and proportionality. These types of investments bring a lot of bang for your buck. It\u2019s something that people love and want to support in their community, so sometimes just a little public investment can be the foundation that private giving and volunteering can be built on. The argument of proportionality relates to spending in other areas, like education and roads. The state spends $15 billion each year on schools, and a little over $3 billion a year on roads \u2013 while the Michigan Council for the Arts struggles to reach $10 million in funding. Even if that funding were to increase by 50% or 100% to arts and cultural organizations, \u201cit still would be pushing even a percent of what we\u2019re putting into some of these bigger priorities.\u201d\n\nThe Chronicle could not survive without regular voluntary subscriptions to support our coverage of local elections.
