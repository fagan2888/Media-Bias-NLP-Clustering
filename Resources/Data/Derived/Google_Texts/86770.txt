Tell us what you really think, James.

Actor James Woods has been quite vocal with his criticism of President Barack Obama in the wake of the government slimdown, and the “Too Big to Fail” star said, as a result, he now expects to struggle to find work in Hollywood.

Woods has been busy tweeting about the slimdown and the President, focusing in particular on the fact that veterans have been unable to visit war memorials in Washington D.C.

“This President is a true abomination. To have barricaded the WW2 vets, but allow illegal aliens privilege...” Woods tweeted on Oct. 8.

But Woods, 66, was just warming up. The actor also called Obama “just vile. A small, small man.”

That prompted one of his followers to ask if the actor was concerned his political views would affect his ability to find gainful employment in Hollywood.

“Dude, aren't u worried about...u know..ever working again??” the Twitter user asked him.

Woods replied: “I don’t expect to work again. I think Barack Obama is a threat to the integrity and future of the Republic. My country first.”

But Woods didn't stop with the situation at the memorials. Some of his other tweets also criticized ObamaCare and Democrats. Here is a sampling:

"If you like your doctor, you'll be able..." Oh, sorry. Never mind. — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) October 2, 2013

Sixteen tears of machine Democrats shredding the fabric of this Republic will toss the greatest democracy on the trash heap of world history — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) October 7, 2013

Woods is not, however, completely alone in Hollywood on this one. The actor tweeted that Gary Sinise, a longtime supporter of veterans' causes, has his back.
