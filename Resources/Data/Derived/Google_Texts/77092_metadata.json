And while most people have grown tired of all of it, some are taking advantage of it, using it to craft large-scale messages for patients stuck in hospitals.\n\nSince Monday, patients and medical professionals in two hospitals have seen messages of peace and love \u2014 literally \u2014 appear in the snow outside of their buildings. At St. Cloud Hospital in Minnesota, Nurse Mary Habiger saw a man and woman stamping out a peace sign and the word \u201clove\u201d with their snowshoes in the snow on the frozen Mississippi River outside of the hospital. It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve been there either, and new messages appear every time it snows. Although, no one knows who they are, they\u2019ve been much appreciated. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see someone doing something positive for other people\u2026 a pretty selfless deed,\u201d Nate Labine, whose newborn son\u2019s hospital room oversaw the messages, told CBS.\n\nMeanwhile, at Chicago\u2019s Rush University Medical Center, Nurse Angela Washek witnessed a group of men running around on the roof of a parking lot outside. Soon enough, their footsteps produced the message \u201cHI MOM, GOD BLESS U\u201d with a smiley face inside the first \u201cO.\u201d The message was intended for Sharon Hart, a leukemia patient at the hospital. It was later discovered that the men had tried to write \u201cGOD BLESS YOU ALL,\u201d but ran out of space. \u201cThey wanted to make everyone feel good, and to let everyone else at the hospital know they were thinking of them,\u201d Deb Song, a hospital spokeswoman, told CNN. She said that the message had inspired both patients and doctors. \u201cIt reminds us to fight for their families, as well as our patients.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "messages of hope, love, peace, snow messages, messages of love, hopeful snow messages, hospitals in midwest, st. cloud hospital, rush university medical center", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Patients and doctors in two Midwest hospitals have been inspired by messages of hope that have appeared outside their windows.", "title": "Messages Of Love Appear In Snow Outside Hospital Windows [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/snow-messages-love-and-hope-appear-outside-hospitals-midwest-269187", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/12/shutterstock146132597.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patients and doctors in two Midwest hospitals have been inspired by messages of hope that have appeared outside their windows.", "title": "Messages Of Love Appear In Snow Outside Hospital Windows [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/snow-messages-love-and-hope-appear-outside-hospitals-midwest-269187", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/12/shutterstock146132597.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/12/shutterstock146132597.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-12T17:39:58-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-12T17:39:57-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Patients and doctors in two Midwest hospitals have been inspired by messages of hope that have appeared outside their windows."}, "article_summary": "Since Monday, patients and medical professionals in two hospitals have seen messages of peace and love \u2014 literally \u2014 appear in the snow outside of their buildings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see someone doing something positive for other people\u2026 a pretty selfless deed,\u201d Nate Labine, whose newborn son\u2019s hospital room oversaw the messages, told CBS.\nAnd while most people have grown tired of all of it, some are taking advantage of it, using it to craft large-scale messages for patients stuck in hospitals.\nIt\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve been there either, and new messages appear every time it snows.\nMeanwhile, at Chicago\u2019s Rush University Medical Center, Nurse Angela Washek witnessed a group of men running around on the roof of a parking lot outside."}
