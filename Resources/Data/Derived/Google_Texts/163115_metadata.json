Ted Cruz, R-Texas, argues a point as Ohio Gov. John Kasich listens during a Republican presidential primary debate at Fox Theatre, Thursday, March 3, 2016, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 On taxes, trade and drug prices, viewers of the latest Republican debate didn\u2019t get a straight story. And Donald Trump spun fiction about 9/11.\n\nA look at some of the claims Thursday night and how they compare with the facts:\n\n___\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Families of the 9/11 hijackers were allowed to leave the U.S. around the time of the attacks, even though \u201cthey knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening. They left two days early \u2026 and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: No relatives of the hijackers were known to be in the U.S. before or after the attacks.\n\nTrump appears to be confusing relatives of the hijackers with relatives of Osama bin Laden who were in the U.S. at the time. They left the U.S. nine days after the attacks, not two days before.\n\nAfter bin Laden became the prime suspect in the attacks, Saudi Arabia organized the evacuation of more than 20 members of his family \u2014 mostly nieces and nephews \u2014 from the United States because some feared reprisals from Americans. The Bush administration came under harsh criticism for the action.\n\n___\n\nTED CRUZ on his proposal to abolish the IRS: \u201cNow, at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Cruz dodged the question of how the tax system will be enforced if he abolishes the IRS and has people pay taxes on simple postcard-like forms. No matter how simple taxes might become, the government still has to make sure people are paying their share, and that takes a large workforce. It\u2019s not just a matter of receiving postcards.\n\nCruz\u2019s flat tax would consolidate seven tax brackets into one at 10 percent. It\u2019s almost certain that this level would give the wealthy huge tax breaks and cause budget deficits to soar.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cBecause of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: This relates to Trump\u2019s unachievable promise to save $300 billion by allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. That\u2019s impossible because the entire country \u2014 Medicare, private insurance, individuals and other government programs \u2014 spends about $300 billion on drugs ($297.7 billion in 2014).\n\nTrump\u2019s promise could only be fulfilled, in essence, if drugs were free.\n\nSavings estimates from Medicare-negotiated drug prices have not been nearly as huge as Trump supposes.\n\nA study last year by the advocacy group Public Citizen and a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa estimated that Medicare\u2019s prescription program would save $15.2 billion to $16 billion a year if it were able to get the same discounted prices for brand name drugs that state Medicaid programs and the Veterans Health Administration receive.\n\nThat\u2019s far from a $300 billion savings.\n\n___\n\nMARCO RUBIO dismissed Trump\u2019s business record, saying he \u201cinherited over $100 million.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s hard to pin down. Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump, died in 1999, and left behind an estate publicly estimated at between $200 million to $250 million. But no firm numbers are available \u2014 and the estate was to be split among Trump and two of his siblings.\n\nIf Rubio\u2019s estimate is high, however, Trump\u2019s insistence that he only received a \u201csmall loan\u201d from his father is even harder to justify. Fred Trump not only gave his son an initial stake, but also guaranteed loans on the Grand Hyatt project that first made Trump\u2019s name. Fred Trump also let his son borrow against his future inheritance \u2014 and, in 1991, one of Trump\u2019s casinos admitted it had broken New Jersey law by accepting an illicit $3.5 million loan from Fred Trump.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe are getting absolutely crushed on trade\u2026. With China we\u2019re going to lose $505 billion in terms of trades. You just can\u2019t do it. Mexico, $58 billion. Japan, probably about, they don\u2019t know it yet, but about $109 billion.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is way off on the U.S. merchandise trade deficit with China. It was $365.7 billion in 2015 \u2014 indeed, a record and the largest deficit the United States had with any country.\n\nBut the U.S. deficit with all countries last year was $531.5 billion, up from $508.3 billion in 2014, close to the $505 billion deficit that Trump assigned just to one country, China. Trump did get the deficit with Mexico correct.\n\nBut not Japan. His estimate of a $109 billion trade deficit with Japan compares with the actual deficit of $68.6 billion last year.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: Repeating his advocacy of harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects, \u201cWe should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. That\u2019s my opinion.\u201d Asked what he\u2019d do if the military refuses to go along with the order because it\u2019s against U.S. law, \u201cThey don\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not going to refuse me. Believe me.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Members of the military are obligated to refuse to follow an order that is illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. If they follow unlawful ones, they risk punishment.\n\n___\n\nCRUZ: Obamacare is \u201cthe biggest job killer in America.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That evergreen assertion flies in the face of an unemployment rate that has fallen to 4.9 percent from 9.9 percent in March 2010, when President Barack Obama signed the health care law.\n\nThe economy has added more than 13.4 million jobs during that period.\n\nWhile the health care law doesn\u2019t seem to have had a major impact on jobs, some lesser consequences are likely. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the availability of government subsidized health insurance will prompt some people to drop out of the labor market, since they can get coverage without holding down a job.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI beat Hillary Clinton in many polls. The Pew poll just came out. I beat Hillary Clinton in a recent Fox poll, I beat Hillary Clinton in USA Today, I beat her today in a poll in Ohio. I beat \u2014 I\u2019m the only one that beats Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually the latest Fox poll finds Clinton besting him, while a USA Today poll has him on top.\n\nIn a sea of polling since May \u2014 some with sound methodology and others without \u2014 Clinton is far more often found to be the likely winner over Trump in a hypothetical matchup. But even scientifically solid polling during the primary season is a poor measure of what\u2019s likely to happen when the two parties have two nominees running against each other in the fall.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Jeff Horwitz and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE _ A look at political claims that take shortcuts with the facts or don\u2019t tell the full story", "article_metadata": {"description": "On taxes, trade and drug prices, viewers of the latest Republican debate didn't get a straight story.
