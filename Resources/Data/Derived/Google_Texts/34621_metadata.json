The trust fund pays for hospital visits, nursing care and related services for Medicare\u2019s 52 million beneficiaries. Its assets fell $7.1 billion in 2013 to $281 billion, less than one-third the reduction of a year earlier, according to a report released today by the program\u2019s trustees.\n\nMedicare\u2019s finances are a flash-point in health-policy debates between Republicans, who have proposed converting the program into private insurance subsidized by the U.S., and President Barack Obama. Unusually slow growth in the program\u2019s spending, payment cuts under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and debt-reduction legislation have extended the life of the fund, called Part A.\n\n\u201cMedicare is considerably stronger than it was just four years ago,\u201d Sylvia Mathews Burwell, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and a trustee for the program, said today at a news conference. \u201cCost growth is down. The quality of the care our parents and grandparents are receiving is improving.\u201d\n\nSpending Unchanged\n\nMedicare spending per beneficiary, including outpatient services and prescription drugs that are paid for from separate trust funds that can\u2019t be exhausted, was unchanged from 2012 to 2013. Spending per beneficiary under Part A -- for hospital care and related services -- fell for the second year in a row.\n\nGrowth in Medicare Advantage plans, offered by private insurers including Humana Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc., accelerated. About 1.3 million people joined the plans in 2013, raising enrollment to 14.8 million, or 28 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. About a third of Medicare beneficiaries are projected to be in the private plans by 2023.\n\nMedicare\u2019s actuaries, who compile the report, said that fewer people than they expected sought hospital care in 2013 and that those patients used less expensive services when they did. It remains unclear whether that is due to economic pressure on patients or to changing practices by doctors and hospitals, who have been encouraged under the Affordable Care Act to better coordinate their care and avoid unnecessary readmissions to the hospital.\n\nCost Questions\n\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s yet out as to whether we can really count on the pace of cost growth being reduced,\u201d Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, an advocacy group that has opposed Obamacare, and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, said in a phone interview. \u201cMy concern is this will take pressure off the Congress and the administration to deal with the real problem and we run the risk of a very bad surprise down the road.\u201d\n\nSocial Security\u2019s trust funds, used to make disability and retirement payments, will be exhausted in 2033, the same projection as last year, a second report said.\n\nThe program\u2019s trustees, who include the secretaries of the Treasury and Labor departments in addition to Burwell, said payment reductions and productivity improvements under the Affordable Care Act can be sustained.\n\n\u201cThe trustees are hopeful that U.S. health-care practices are in the process of becoming more efficient as providers anticipate a future in which the rapid cost growth rates of previous decades, in both the public and private sectors, do not return,\u201d they said in the annual report.\n\nRepeal Scenarios\n\nMedicare spending would grow much faster if provisions of the Affordable Care Act that control cost growth were repealed, the trustees said. Under one \u201cillustrative scenario\u201d that included repeals of several provisions of the law, Medicare spending would consume more than 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2080, compared with just more than 6 percent under current law.\n\nObama has sought to keep the current structure of Medicare largely intact and allow changes wrought by his health-care law to take effect. In April, the Congressional Budget Office said the program would cost $1,000 less per patient than it had projected in 2010, the year the law was passed. Republicans have also lobbied to raise Medicare\u2019s eligibility age to 67, a proposal Obama hasn\u2019t ruled out as part of a larger budget deal that would include tax increases. Republicans have rejected any budget agreement increasing taxes.\n\n\u201cThe president is ready to work with Congress on enacting responsible reforms, and he is prepared to make tough choices,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said at the news conference. \u201cThe president will not support any proposal that hurts Americans who depend on these programs today and he will not support any proposal that slashes benefits for future retirees.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne and Kasia Klimasinska", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/medicare-s-financial-condition-improves-on-reduced-costs", "description": "The main trust fund behind Medicare, the $583 billion U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled, will be exhausted in 2030, four years later than projected last year, the government reported.", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Helps Add Life to Medicare as Shortfall Delayed"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne and Kasia Klimasinska", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Trust Fund", "news_keywords": "Health,Trust Fund", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/medicare-s-financial-condition-improves-on-reduced-costs", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Helps Add Life to Medicare as Shortfall Delayed", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-28T18:56:53.091Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The main trust fund behind Medicare, the $583 billion U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled, will be exhausted in 2030, four years later than projected last year, the government reported.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Trust Fund,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-07-28T18:56:53.091Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/medicare-s-financial-condition-improves-on-reduced-costs", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "description": "The main trust fund behind Medicare, the $583 billion U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled, will be exhausted in 2030, four years later than projected last year, the government reported.", "title": "Obamacare Helps Add Life to Medicare as Shortfall Delayed"}, "fb": {"status": "The main trust fund behind Medicare, the $583 billion U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled, will be exhausted in 2030, four years later than projected last year, the government reported."}, "parsely-post-id": "N9ADC16JTSEQ01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4f3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCost growth is down.\nGrowth in Medicare Advantage plans, offered by private insurers including Humana Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc., accelerated.\nRepeal ScenariosMedicare spending would grow much faster if provisions of the Affordable Care Act that control cost growth were repealed, the trustees said.\nUnusually slow growth in the program\u2019s spending, payment cuts under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and debt-reduction legislation have extended the life of the fund, called Part A.\nThe trust fund pays for hospital visits, nursing care and related services for Medicare\u2019s 52 million beneficiaries."}
