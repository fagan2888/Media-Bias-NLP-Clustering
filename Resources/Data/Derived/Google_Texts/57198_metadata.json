In 2014, the company is doubling what it invested in 2013, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAbout $40 million of the investment money is going into Renaissance Learning Inc., a Wisconsin-based education software company.\n\nAccording to the company website, Renaissance Learning focuses on \u201caccelerating K12 learning \u2013 plain and simple.\u201d The company was founded in 1986 by Judi and Terry Paul in the basement of their home in Wisconsin Rapids. It has since grown to six locations in the United States, as well as subsidiaries in Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe company was bought by Permira in 2011.\n\nGoogle\u2019s investment is good news for those interested in online learning. Google\u2019s investment shows that some of the sharpest minds in technology think that they future lies in the use of technology to improve classroom learning.\n\nRenaissance focuses on products that allow teachers and students \u2013 via the Internet or mobile devises \u2013 to exchange information and ideas as well as improve reading and math skills.\n\nRenaissance focuses on several key guidelines in developing every product.

The reading software encourages kids to read more \u2013 and better \u2013 books. Other products include Renaissance Professional Development, which trains educators, and the STAR Reading computer reading test. The latter is designed to give teachers a fast and reliable method to test the reading levels of their students. The company has since released STAR Math, which provides the same type of assessment for students in mathematics.\n\nIn 2004, the company developed a Web site that allows educator to group together all of the assessment data for students in one central database.\n\nThe company now offers, through a web app, access to Accelerated Reading quizzes online that can be accessed via iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone.
