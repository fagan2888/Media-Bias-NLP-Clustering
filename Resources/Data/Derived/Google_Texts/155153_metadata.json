Marco Rubio notched his second win of the Republican presidential primary on Sunday with a dominant performance in Puerto Rico, where he took upwards of 70 percent of the vote to trip a winner-take-all rule that delivered him all 23 of the US territory\u2019s delegates to the Republican nominating convention.\n\nThe victory was a nice ending to an otherwise brutal weekend for Rubio. In the so-called \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d slate of primaries and caucuses, he failed to finish better than third in any of the states that awarded delegates.\n\nRelated: Cruz Gleefully Agrees with trump: It\u2019s Time for Rubio to Quit\n\nBut other than generating a feel-good moment for his struggling campaign, it\u2019s hard to see just how much Rubio\u2019s presidential ambitions are really bolstered by his performance on the Caribbean island.\n\nIn fact, Rubio\u2019s victory in Puerto Rico has the whiff of a participation trophy. Until his win there yesterday, the only \u201cW\u201d in Rubio\u2019s column was, however improbably, Minnesota.\n\nThis is not to denigrate the delegates from the territory. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and the delegates they select count in the GOP primary as much as delegates from any state. It is just to note that the demographics in Puerto Rico aren\u2019t even close to being representative of any U.S. state.\n\nAnd the preferences of the relatively small percentage of Republicans in Puerto Rico, while they may reflect the feelings of mainland Republicans with a similar background, probably aren\u2019t indicative of a GOP landslide toward Rubio \u2026 pretty much anywhere, other than a few Congressional districts in Florida.\n\nRelated: Norquist Accuses Trump Naysayers of \u2018Whining, not Working\u2019\n\nEven the Florida electorate, while it has a large and growing percentage of Puerto Ricans who have fled the economic troubles at home, isn\u2019t anything like Puerto Rico taken as a whole.\n\nIn addition, in Puerto Rico, Rubio was running against a Republican frontrunner who has, seemingly, done everything he possibly could to alienate Hispanic voters by railing against Hispanic immigrants. And the party\u2019s number two candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, has been so rabidly anti-immigrant in his campaign that he is seen among many immigrant activist groups as something close to a traitor.\n\nAgain, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth, but not all of them who come to the U.S. necessarily feel that they are embraced as such, and listening to a major party candidate who suggests immigrants are all rapists and drug dealers probably generates a bit of a negative vibe toward Trump.\n\nRubio, despite some desperate backtracking in the past year, was actually one of the authors of a major bipartisan immigration compromise that passed the Senate in 2015 but failed in the House. In a Republican primary in Puerto Rico, that may be the thin reed that GOP-leaning voters need to latch on to.\n\nRelated: At CPAC, Derision and Disappointment as Trump Bails Out\n\nDonald Trump, after he won Kentucky and Louisiana on Saturday night, called on Rubio to leave the race. The suggestion was happily echoed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who won Kansas and Maine Saturday night and came away from the evening with more delegates than Trump, though he still trails in total delegates.\n\nThe results in Puerto Rico may indicate some sort of movement in Rubio\u2019s direction, but it seems pretty likely that the electoral equivalent of just showing up was all he needed to win there, and that the result won\u2019t translate into future wins.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Florida Sen.", "title": "Rubio Wins a Participation Trophy in Puerto Rico", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/07/Rubio-Wins-Participation-Trophy-Puerto-Rico", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-electons-rubio_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/07/Rubio-Wins-Participation-Trophy-Puerto-Rico", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-electons-rubio_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Florida Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In fact, Rubio\u2019s victory in Puerto Rico has the whiff of a participation trophy.\nIt is just to note that the demographics in Puerto Rico aren\u2019t even close to being representative of any U.S. state.\nIn a Republican primary in Puerto Rico, that may be the thin reed that GOP-leaning voters need to latch on to.\nIn addition, in Puerto Rico, Rubio was running against a Republican frontrunner who has, seemingly, done everything he possibly could to alienate Hispanic voters by railing against Hispanic immigrants.\nPuerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and the delegates they select count in the GOP primary as much as delegates from any state."}
