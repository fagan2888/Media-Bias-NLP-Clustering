Between them, they have covered the Clinton White House and the fall of the Soviet Union (Ms. Shipman), anchors BBC World News America (Ms. Kay) and learned to kiteboard at nearly 40 (Ms. Kay again). And yet both say they have had to work to overcome fears of inadequacy, tendencies to defer to male colleagues and \u201ctortured cycles of useless self-recrimination.\u201d In \u201cThe Confidence Code,\u201d to be published on Tuesday, they lay out a path for women to become more self-assured. In phone conversations and at a lunch date (served by Sidra Forman, a Washington chef), Ms. Kay and Ms. Shipman discussed how to swat away creeping negative thoughts and what they are really thinking when they\u2019re on television. (This interview has been edited and condensed.)\n\nQ. LET\u2019S START WITH A STRATEGIC QUESTION: IF YOU\u2019RE ASKED SOMETHING ON TELEVISION, AND YOU\u2019RE NOT SURE OF THE ANSWER, WHAT DO YOU SAY?\n\nKK: Television is an X-ray. If you try to be something you\u2019re not, television will pick it up.\n\nARE YOU COMFORTABLE SAYING \u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW\u201d?\n\nKK: I have become comfortable.\n\nCS: Early on, when I started, I certainly did not feel comfortable with that. When I started to cover the White House, I felt I had to know everything, and you do to some extent. They\u2019ll ask you about foreign policy, the budget. You\u2019re a woman, a perfectionist, and you want to get everything right. Over time, you learn that it\u2019s O.K. to say, \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting on that.\u201d\n\nDO EITHER OF YOU STILL GET NERVOUS ON AIR?\n\nKK: Some shows, yes. I still get nervous on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s the big set. And I\u2019m the only woman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPLUS, IN THE BOOK, YOU CONVINCINGLY DEMONSTRATE THERE\u2019S A PENALTY FOR WOMEN WHO TALK TOO MUCH. ON TELEVISION, IS IT BETTER TO PICK YOUR MOMENTS OR JUMP IN WHENEVER YOU WANT?\n\nCS: The penalty for talking too much is a corporate statistic. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true on television. You\u2019re always given the thumbs-up for talking. I\u2019ve done a lot of the Sunday shows, been on a lot of panels with men. I\u2019ve noticed a pattern of saying what I felt I was qualified to say and stopping, and then I\u2019d notice that the men would just go on and on and on about things that they shouldn\u2019t have been talking about. It wasn\u2019t what was asked, it was taking the conversation in an entirely different direction. And I\u2019d think, wow. At one point I\u2019d look at transcripts and I\u2019d have talked half as much.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140411180246, "twitter": {"description": "The newswomen Katty Kay and Claire Shipman\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Confidence Code,\u201d aims to make women more self-assured.", "title": "Katty Kay and Claire Shipman: Learning to Dispense With the Negative", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/fashion/katty-kat-claire-shipman-new-book.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002820571"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jodikantor", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/13/fashion/13STYLESQA1/13STYLESQA1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/fashion/katty-kat-claire-shipman-new-book.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002820571", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/fashion/katty-kat-claire-shipman-new-book.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "fashion", "hdl_p": "Learning to Dispense With the Negative", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 11, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "ttl": "Confidence Code, The (Book)", "keywords": "Women and Girls,News and News Media,Books and Literature,The Confidence Code (Book),Kay  Katty,Shipman  Claire,Confidence Code  The (Book)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jodi Kantor", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/13/fashion/13STYLESQA1/13STYLESQA1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Shipman, Claire", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JODI KANTOR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The newswomen Katty Kay and Claire Shipman\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Confidence Code,\u201d aims to make women more self-assured.", "tom": "Question", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/13/fashion/13STYLESQA1/13STYLESQA1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The newswomen Katty Kay and Claire Shipman\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Confidence Code,\u201d aims to make women more self-assured.", "CG": "fashion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 11, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Question", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/jodi_kantor/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/fashion/index.html", "section": "Fashion & Style", "modified": "2014-04-28", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Confidence Code, The (Book)", "published": "2014-04-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "B3DFBD82-F298-43B3-9458-219B4F6AA2A5"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "13STYLESQA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140428140613, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/fashion/katty-kat-claire-shipman-new-book.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/13/fashion/13STYLESQA1/13STYLESQA1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The newswomen Katty Kay and Claire Shipman\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Confidence Code,\u201d aims to make women more self-assured.", "title": "Katty Kay and Claire Shipman: Learning to Dispense With the Negative"}, "pdate": 20140411, "des": "Books and Literature", "articleid": 100000002820571, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Katty Kay and Claire Shipman: Learning to Dispense With the Negative", "col": "Styles Q + A", "PST": "Question"}, "article_summary": "Between them, they have covered the Clinton White House and the fall of the Soviet Union (Ms. Shipman), anchors BBC World News America (Ms. Kay) and learned to kiteboard at nearly 40 (Ms. Kay again).\nIn phone conversations and at a lunch date (served by Sidra Forman, a Washington chef), Ms. Kay and Ms. Shipman discussed how to swat away creeping negative thoughts and what they are really thinking when they\u2019re on television.\nPhotoKatty Kay and Claire Shipman hardly seem like victims of self-doubt.\nQ.
