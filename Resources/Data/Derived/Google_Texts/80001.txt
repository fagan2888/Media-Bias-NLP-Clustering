Sarah Palin lionized conservative activists with her speech rounding out this year's CPAC conference.

The former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee went after "establishment" Republicans while bolstering her conservative acolytes, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

And she delivered plenty of zingers against President Obama, too. She drew a page out of Cruz's playbook by reading a version of "Green Eggs and Ham" by Dr. Seuss (which Cruz read over television during his anti-Affordable Care Act filibuster last fall).

Palin rewrote the singsongy story as such:

I do not like this Uncle Sam, I do not like his health care scam.

I do not like these dirty crooks, or how they lie and cook the books.

I do not like when Congress steals, I do not like their crony deals.

I do not like this spying, man, I do not like this, 'Yes we can.'

I do not like this spending spree, we're smart; we know there's nothing free.

I do not like reporters' smug replies, when I complain about their lies.

I do not like this kind of 'hope,' and we won't take it — nope, nope, nope.

Palin appeared less as a prospective political candidate — though she received cheers of "Run, Sarah, Run!" — than as a conservative agitator before a crowd hungry for political red meat.

To the cheers urging Palin to seek the presidency, she replied: "I should, I didn't get to run this morning. Did some hot yoga; didn't get a run."
