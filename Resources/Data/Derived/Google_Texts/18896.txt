As sweater-clad Dudes and jumpsuit-donning Jesuses made their way to the 14th annual Lebowski Fest, the celebration's founder left the scene in cuffs.

About 5 p.m. Saturday, Will Russell — owner of two WHY Louisville stores and the recently reopened Funtown Mountain — was arrested at Executive Strike & Spare on charges of possession of marijuana, resisting arrest and menacing.

According to a report from the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections, Russell had been smoking marijuana in the bowling alley's parking lot at 911 Phillips Lane when police approached him.

Police reported Russell took a challenging stance with clenched fists, leading them to believe he may be capable of causing physical injury. As he was arrested, the report stated Russell "apologized for acting like a savage."

Russell was taken to Metro Corrections and has since been released.

On his public Facebook page, he wrote, "Don't worry. Be happy for me."
