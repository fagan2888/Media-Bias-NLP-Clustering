Ackman holds nearly 10% of Allergan shares and is aggressively promoting the idea of a merger with Valeant.\n\nAckman went on to say he is concerned about \u201cgovernance failures at the company and is writing an open letter so these issues can be address in a transparent manner.\u201d\n\nThe letter points out that Allergan has been unreceptive to the idea of a merger, and charges Pyott with putting up the company\u2019s defenses out of fear of losing his job. The letter goes on to express disappointment that Gallagher, who has spoken with Ackman by phone with Pyott and the company\u2019s general counsel on the line, has refused to meet with Ackman without Pyott present.\n\nPyott apparently has met with a number of Allergan shareholders, who Ackman says have been misled about Valeant.\n\n\u201cDuring these meetings, Mr. Pyott, we are told, has denigrated Valeant, including making false and/or misleading statements about Valeant\u2019s business model, [research and development] strategy, accounting practices, financial performance, and operating approach,\u201d Ackman\u2019s letter states.\n\nBloomberg Bill Ackman\n\nAllergan officials issued a prepared statement that said: \u201cAllergan maintains an open line of communication with stockholders and welcomes their feedback. However, as a co-bidder with Valeant Pharmaceuticals, we believe that Mr. Ackman\u2019s views and interests are not aligned with those of other Allergan stockholders. We note that Mr. Ackman\u2019s rhetoric focuses on, among other things, the benefits he sees in a transaction with Valeant.\u201d\n\nValeant, a generic drug specialist, is seeking to buy Botox maker Allergan in what would be a $46 billion unsolicited offer. Valeant made its offer April 22 and was rebuffed by Allergan a few weeks later. Allergan said at the time that the deal \u201csubstantially undervalues\u201d the company.\n\nAckman is calling for a shareholder vote on the deal, which would value the company around $155 a share. Allergan was trading slightly lower in Monday\u2019s action to $159.68.\n\nMore from MarketWatch\n\nSidestepping Obamacare, Indiana finds new way to close coverage\n\nAstraZeneca rejects higher \u2018final\u2019 offer from Pfizer\n\nPfizer \u2018the creep at the bar\u2019 after another AstraZeneca rejection", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-05-19T11:21:26-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Activist investor Bill Ackman is calling on Allergan's lead director to meet with Valeant on the prospects of a merger.", "title": "Bill Ackman ratchets up pressure on Allergan with open letter to director", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/05/19/bill-ackman-ratchets-up-pressure-on-allergan-with-open-letter-to-director/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CA332_allerg_MG_20140422105510.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Allergan Inc.,Bill Ackman,mergers and acquisitions,open letter,Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc.", "article.headline": "Bill Ackman ratchets up pressure on Allergan with open letter to director", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Allergan Inc.,Bill Ackman,mergers and acquisitions,open letter,Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Activist investor Bill Ackman is calling on Allergan's lead director to meet with Valeant on the prospects of a merger.", "article.published": "2014-05-19T11:21:26-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/05/19/bill-ackman-ratchets-up-pressure-on-allergan-with-open-letter-to-director/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Activist investor Bill Ackman is calling on Allergan's lead director to meet with Valeant on the prospects of a merger.", "title": "Bill Ackman ratchets up pressure on Allergan with open letter to director", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/05/19/bill-ackman-ratchets-up-pressure-on-allergan-with-open-letter-to-director/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CA332_allerg_MG_20140422105510.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2565", "article.updated": "2014-05-19T11:22:57-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Ackman holds nearly 10% of Allergan shares and is aggressively promoting the idea of a merger with Valeant.\nHowever, as a co-bidder with Valeant Pharmaceuticals, we believe that Mr. Ackman\u2019s views and interests are not aligned with those of other Allergan stockholders.\nAckman sent a letter on Monday to Allergan /quotes/zigman/217110/delayed /quotes/nls/agn AGN director Michael Gallagher, saying that Chairman and Chief Executive David Pyott has a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d on the merger issue.\nPyott apparently has met with a number of Allergan shareholders, who Ackman says have been misled about Valeant.\nBloomberg Bill AckmanAllergan officials issued a prepared statement that said: \u201cAllergan maintains an open line of communication with stockholders and welcomes their feedback."}
