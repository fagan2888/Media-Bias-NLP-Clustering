But at the center of both shows lies a charismatic, proud leading man who squanders his talent and moneymaking potential to wind up teaching in the classroom. Rather than lick their wounds, these characters set out to right this perceived wrong \u2014 even if, by doing so, they alienate the people they love the most.\n\nWhen Breaking Bad\u2019s leading man finally admitted to his wife, Skyler \u2014 and, more importantly, to the viewers\u2014that he built his meth-making empire to fulfill his own ego, it was among the show\u2019s most powerful moments. \u201cI did it for me,\u201d he said. (How long had we waited to hear Walter White say those words?) Of course, we had long figured out that Walt was lying when he said it was all for the family.\n\nThe fourth and final season of Eastbound and Down sets itself up much like a comedic counterpart to Breaking Bad. Instead of the major league pitcher he\u2019s always aspired to be, by the start of the fourth season of Eastbound and Down, Kenny Powers has settled down with his wife, April, and Toby, the son he was left to reluctantly care for last season. Kenny\u2019s a family man now; in the first episode of the new season, much is made of the fact that, while April\u2019s working to become a top-selling real estate agent, loyal and caring Kenny\u2019s the model husband and father. And yet, surprisingly, April hasn\u2019t been relegated to the disapproving shrew\u2014a stock character with which we\u2019re all too familiar on television (many sitcom wives, like That 70s Show\u2019s Kitty or even Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s Cheryl, fit the bill, and this syndrome also extends to cartoons; Family Guy\u2019s Lois and Marge from The Simpsons have screechy voices to boot). Unlike these other, unbalanced TV marriages, Kenny and April\u2019s is a more equal partnership than we\u2019ve come to expect from the show\u2019s leading man, who tends to lord over his friends and family rather than engage with them.\n\nBut here\u2019s where the Power of Television \u2014 with its acid-like ability to eat right through our good sense and moral righteousness \u2014 comes into play: We actually feel bad for Kenny. I did, anyway, watching him sit through a dinner party in the season four opener with April, who goes on about what a wonderfully supportive partner he\u2019s been\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re like a nice, big bra,\u201d one guest offers. But, like circa-2010 Miley Cyrus, Kenny can\u2019t be tamed. Powerful when he\u2019s pissed off (and as a self-proclaimed Messiah figure), Kenny\u2019s never more pissed off than when he feels belittled. In the show\u2019s first season, when Kenny returns from Seattle to his hometown of Shelby, North Carolina, after washing out as a pitcher in the major leagues, and takes a job as a high-school gym teacher, his fall from the top bruises his ego, setting him off on a rampaging quest for stardom. He all but destroys his relationship with his brother, who makes the mistake of opening his home and subjecting his wife and kids to Kenny\u2014who repays his brother by smashing his furniture and DVD player in a self-loathing rage. Playing professional baseball is the only thing that gives Kenny a sense of self-worth. As he says in the pilot, \u201cAll of my successes depend on me. I\u2019m the man who has the ball; I\u2019m the man who can throw it faster than fuck.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nTeachers have long been derided as \u201cthose who can\u2019t do,\u201d but it\u2019s relevant that teaching\u2014which, of course, Walt also falls back on when he fails to become a hotshot chemist\u2014is typically a predominantly female occupation. By rejecting this vocation for pursuits that project an image of machismo\u2014Walt dabbles in drugs, Kenny in the less hazardous game of baseball\u2014both men enact a particular fantasy of male power. Breaking Bad and Eastbound and Down premiered, respectively, in 2008 and 2009, at a time of financial crisis during which the effects of the five or six million manufacturing jobs lost in the first decade of the 2000s\u2014real, manly jobs dominated by real, manly men\u2014were ripe for fictional exploration.\n\nShows like Breaking Bad and Eastbound and Down fixate on caricatures of male ego. Walt\u2019s pride is so badly damaged that he\u2019s willing to literally risk everything for a taste of something more, and Kenny is constantly casting himself in a mythical light, comparing himself to a god of the sea or Luke Skywalker. We may know in our hearts that these characters are ultimately self-serving, yet\u2014to get back to that devious Power of Television\u2014we cheer them on anyway. Towards the end of Breaking Bad\u2019s five-season run, the Internet was full of hand-wringing over the fact that lots of fans were actually rooting for Walt, despite all the death and destruction we know he is responsible for. Part of that cheerleading can be chalked up to the viewer\u2019s identification with a show\u2019s central figure. But there\u2019s something more complex in viewers\u2019 reaction to characters like Kenny Powers and Walter White. As these characters attempt to fulfill the American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness at all costs, they take on that burden for those of us sitting at home, watching, who don\u2019t have the balls to do it ourselves. And look at what they turn to in order to fulfill that dream: meth and baseball. Doesn\u2019t get much more American than that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Eastbound and Down\" centers on an angry white man who's wasted his talent and earning potential.
