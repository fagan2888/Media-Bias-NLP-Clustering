The statue is of Tom Watson, a fiery populist who in the late 19th and early 20th centuries served in Georgia\u2019s legislature and both houses of Congress. He was also a publisher, essayist and vice-presidential candidate.\n\nAt first, Watson was a progressive agrarian populist, winning the support of rural blacks and whites alike. He came to abandon those ideals, writing vicious diatribes in his magazine against blacks (\u201can inferior being\u2026not any more our brother than the apes are\u201d), Jews (\u201cthick-lipped rakes [who] glut their eyes upon handsome Gentile women\u201d) and Catholics (he referred to the Pope as \u201ca fat old Dago\u201d). He whipped up sentiment against Leo Frank, a Jewish factory worker lynched in 1913 after having been convicted, on flimsy evidence, of killing a 13-year-old Christian girl.\n\nOn November 29th, the day after Thanksgiving, when Georgia\u2019s government offices were closed and traffic was light, workers wrapped Watson\u2019s statue in plastic and moved it, plinth and all, from the capitol grounds to a park across the road. There it will stay. Nathan Deal, the governor, signed an order authorising the statue\u2019s removal in October; he said it was to allow the renovation of the capitol\u2019s dilapidated front steps, and that moving the statue back would be much too expensive.\n\nNot everyone believes him. Michael Hill, who heads the League of the South, a secessionist organisation, condemned Mr Deal for \u201ccaving in to political correctness\u201d. Tommy Benton, also a state representative, introduced a bill that strongly hinders government officials from moving or hiding any historical monument or statue. He worries that \u201cif you start taking down every monument because you find one or two things you don\u2019t particularly like about that person, there won\u2019t be any monuments left.\u201d But Tyrone Brooks, the president of the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials and a 17-term member of the Georgia House of Representatives, praised Mr Deal for deciding to \u201cmove some of these old racist artefacts\u201d from \u201cthe people\u2019s house\u201d.\n\nSimilar battles over symbols have occurred across the South. They can be costly: many believe that Georgia\u2019s last Democratic governor, Roy Barnes, lost his bid for re-election in 2002 largely because he championed the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the state flag.\n\nBill Haslam, Tennessee\u2019s governor, signed into law a measure similar to the one Mr Benton proposed earlier this year, except that it also forbids the renaming of parks named after any \u201chistorical military figure\u201d. The bill was introduced as the city of Memphis, which has a black majority, was debating renaming three city parks: Confederate Park; Jefferson Davis Park, named after the president of the Confederacy; and Nathan Bedford Forrest Park, named after a Confederate general and brilliant military strategist who made his fortune in slaves. Forrest was accused of massacring black Union troops after they had surrendered, and later was an early member of the Ku Klux Klan. Memphis got its changes in under the wire; today the parks are called Memphis Park, Mississippi River Park and Health Sciences Park.\n\nIn Selma, Alabama a bust of Forrest was stolen in 2012; it has never been recovered. Schools named after Forrest used to dot the South; today few remain, and one (in Jacksonville, Florida) is in the process of changing its name. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Brady Street commemorates Wyatt Tate Brady, one of Tulsa\u2019s founders and a Klansman; earlier this year Tulsa\u2019s city council voted to keep the street\u2019s name but changed its namesake to Mathew Brady, a renowned civil-war photographer.\n\nSome, such as Mr Hill, see in these changes \u201ca campaign against southerners, a campaign against whites\u2026[and] an attempt to culturally cleanse the South of any old, white, conservative, Confederate influence.\u201d Such concern seems twinned with deeper anxiety over changes coming to the region, which has long been rural and relatively homogeneous. Of the ten American states whose Hispanic population grew fastest between 2000 and 2011, eight are in the south\u2014nine if you include Maryland. Among the top ten states with the fastest-growing foreign-born population between 2000 and 2011, six are southern, with Tennessee leading the country. Mr Hill\u2019s group has staged street demonstrations against what they call \u201csouthern demographic displacement\u201d (and others call \u201cimmigration\u201d) around the region.\n\nTo others these changes are long overdue. Lee Harris, a Memphis city councilman who supported changing the parks\u2019 names, distinguishes recognising Confederate history from celebrating it. He notes that the parks were named decades after the American civil war\u2014Jefferson Davis Park did not get its statue of the former president until 1964.\n\nSimilarly, Georgia\u2019s flag incorporated the Confederate battle flag in 1956\u2014the same decade in which Jacksonville named a high school after Forrest and Montgomery, Alabama added the phrase \u201cCradle of the Confederacy\u201d to its city seal. That also happened to be the decade in which the Supreme Court ordered schools to be desegregated, Rosa Parks refused to stand in the bus, and Jim Crow laws (the civil war\u2019s long tail) came under sustained and ultimately fatal attack\u2014suggesting that these symbols were less about honouring the Confederate dead than about insulting the advancing forces of racial equality.\n\nThose symbols remained peaceably in place as long as black southerners lacked political power. Once removed, however brutal the fight, life seems to proceed as before. Despite the promises of Sonny Perdue, Mr Barnes\u2019s successor as governor, Georgia's state flag remains free of the popular Confederate symbol. And notwithstanding a lawsuit from the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Mr Harris says most Memphians simply use the parks as they did before, indifferent to the change of name. He adds that such symbols \u201ccelebrate a part of our history that just a small minority think is honourable. That small minority is not going to be able to win at the end of the day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20131207_USP003_1.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Southern history", "description": "Authoritative weekly newspaper focusing on international politics and business news and opinion.", "pubdate": 20131207, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "A battle over bronze and over memory", "title": "Not even past", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21591208-battle-over-bronze-and-over-memory-not-even-past", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131207_USP003_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "A battle over bronze and over memory", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-06 12:27:28", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131207_USP003_1.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131207_USP003_1.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "United States", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20131207_USP003_1.jpg", "articleid": 21591208, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20131207_USP003_1.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Southern history", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2013-12-07 00:00:00", "news_keywords": "Southern history"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e79\"", "article_summary": "Memphis got its changes in under the wire; today the parks are called Memphis Park, Mississippi River Park and Health Sciences Park.\nDespite the promises of Sonny Perdue, Mr Barnes\u2019s successor as governor, Georgia's state flag remains free of the popular Confederate symbol.\nLee Harris, a Memphis city councilman who supported changing the parks\u2019 names, distinguishes recognising Confederate history from celebrating it.\nHe adds that such symbols \u201ccelebrate a part of our history that just a small minority think is honourable.\nMichael Hill, who heads the League of the South, a secessionist organisation, condemned Mr Deal for \u201ccaving in to political correctness\u201d."}
