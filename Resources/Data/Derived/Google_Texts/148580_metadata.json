After ABC\u2019s introduction, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s \u201cthe first woman to ever represent the state in Congress,\u201d who \u201ccatapulted to political stardom with an ad about castrating hogs, making \u2018Let\u2019s make \u2019em squeal\u2019 a hallmark of her campaign.\u201d And that she \u201ctouted herself as a Harley-riding Sunday school teacher, who also serves as a lieutenant colonel and battalion commander in the Iowa Army National Guard.\u201d\n\nBut can we learn a little more about her? Who is Joni Ernst? Well, a CNN report (1/20/15) promises to explain just that: Turns out \u201cshe\u2019s an Iraq war combat vet, and the first woman elected to Congress from Iowa.\u201d And \u201cher castrating hogs campaign ad made her the standout star in the last election.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s still not very much to go on. How about the Christian Science Monitor (1/20/15), which declared her a \u201cGood Choice to Rebut State of the Union\u201d\u2013so it must know something about her, right? Turns out she\u2019s a:\n\nGOP political unknown who broke through a crowded field of primary candidates and then trounced the \u201cshoo-in\u201d Democrat in November \u2013 all launched by her ad featuring hogs, her down-on-the-farm castrating skills, and a promise to cut pork and \u201cmake \u2019em squeal\u201d in Washington.\n\nAnything else?\n\nShe\u2019s also Iowa\u2019s first female senator, and the first woman senator with combat experience. Ernst ran convoys from Kuwait into southern Iraq when she was serving with the Iowa Army National Guard in 2003.\n\nYou really don\u2019t learn too much else about Ernst from profiles like these, nor do you get the impression that corporate media think you need to know much. The only thing ABC tells you about her politics is that she plans to \u201chost an event called \u2018Hogs and Harleys\u2019 for Republican presidential hopefuls in June.\u201d\n\nCNN offered just a tiny bit more, saying that \u201cshe was a tea party favorite for her positions on everything from abortion to the federal minimum wage\u201d \u2013 on the latter, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t believe in a \u2018one-size-fits-all approach'\u201d; her position on abortion, and on everything else, went undescribed.\n\nThe Monitor, which bills its profile as a \u201cDC Decoder,\u201d tells us she\u2019s a \u201cconservative trailblazer\u201d who favors \u201clower taxes, less regulation, and repeal of Obamacare.\u201d It reports she wants to eliminate the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, and spells out her position on abortion: \u201cthat life begins at the point of conception, which has all kinds of restrictive implications for abortion rights.\u201d And her Iraq experience \u201cgives her authority to speak on foreign issues.\u201d\n\nIf you need any more decoding of DC, though, you\u2019re on your own \u2013 the Monitor\u2018s Francine Kiefer seems less interested in what Ernst is likely to say than in how she\u2019s going to say it. Kiefer pumps drama into the \u201cchallenge\u201d of \u201cspeak[ing] to a faceless camera for minutes on end\u201d: Will she look at the wrong camera? Reach awkwardly for water? But Kiefer concludes that Ernst may be up to the task:\n\nOn the campaign trail and in her ads, Ernst appeared to be near pitch-perfect. She exudes a contagious positive energy. She leans forward, and speaks plainly and clearly, expressing a sort of down-home-ness that connects with people.\n\nSimilarly, CNN\u2019s Dana Bash stressed Ernst\u2019s personability:\n\nShe seems nice. Not New Jersey nice or California nice, but Iowa nice, which anyone who has ever stepped foot in Iowa knows is really, really nice.\n\n(Bash described this as \u201canother trait that drives Democrats crazy,\u201d because, as everyone knows, Democrats hate niceness.)\n\nErnst\u2019s down-home niceness was clearly seen as more relevant to these profiles than some of her not-so-nice policy positions (FAIR Blog, 11/4/14) \u2013 like saying that Obama had \u201cbecome a dictator\u201d (Yahoo News, 7/8/14), a stance that would seem germane to Ernst being picked to rebut the president\u2019s speech. Or her endorsement of legislation that would \u201cauthorize state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement\u201d the Affordable Care Act (Talking Points Memo, 10/3/14). Or that she carries a \u201cbeautiful little Smith & Wesson, 9 millimeter,\u201d in her purse in part to protect her \u201cfrom the government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important\u201d (Huffington Post, 10/22/14).\n\nThis is aside from her conspiracy theory (Mother Jones, 9/25/14) that the United Nations is planning on\n\nmoving people off of their agricultural land and consolidating them into city centers, and then telling them that you don\u2019t have property rights anymore. These are all things that the UN is behind, and it\u2019s bad for the United States and bad for families here in the state of Iowa.\n\nThese are the sort of things you would tell people if you thought it was important to know the worldview of the person picked by the Republican Party to provide an opposing view to the president. But corporate media\u2019s interest in the content of her rebuttal doesn\u2019t go much beyond whether she \u201ccomes up with another witty \u2018Make \u2019em squeal\u2019 line.\u201d\n\nThe views expressed in this post are the author\u2019s alone, and presented here to offer a variety of perspectives to our readers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You don't learn too much else about Joni Ernst, picked to rebut the State of the Union address, from media profiles \u2014 nor do you get the impression that corporate media think you need to know much.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "You don't learn too much else about Joni Ernst, picked to rebut the State of the Union address, from media profiles \u2014 nor do you get the impression that corporate media think you need to know much.", "title": "What Corporate Media Don't Want You to Know About Joni Ernst | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP849347874513.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2015/01/26/corporate-media-dont-want-know-joni-ernst/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "You don't learn too much else about Joni Ernst, picked to rebut the State of the Union address, from media profiles \u2014 nor do you get the impression that corporate media think you need to know much.", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP849347874513.jpg", "title": "What Corporate Media Don't Want You to Know About Joni Ernst | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Perspectives", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2015-01-26T13:26:14-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20150126, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Not New Jersey nice or California nice, but Iowa nice, which anyone who has ever stepped foot in Iowa knows is really, really nice.\nYou really don\u2019t learn too much else about Ernst from profiles like these, nor do you get the impression that corporate media think you need to know much.\n\u201cMeet Joni Ernst, The Republican Senator Responding to Obama\u2019s State of the Union Address,\u201d offered ABC News(1/20/15).\nErnst ran convoys from Kuwait into southern Iraq when she was serving with the Iowa Army National Guard in 2003.\nBut Kiefer concludes that Ernst may be up to the task:On the campaign trail and in her ads, Ernst appeared to be near pitch-perfect."}
