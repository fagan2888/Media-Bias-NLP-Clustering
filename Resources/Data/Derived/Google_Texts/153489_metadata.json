There's the cost of turning your home office into a nursery, the cost of baby-proofing, of buying strollers and high chairs and car seats and stocking up on diapers and formula and adorable onesies with sassy phrases stitched on the front.\n\nAll this adds up to one very stressed mommy, who could use a little break from the spending spree required to successfully grow, birth and raise a human child. Luckily, there are a lot of companies offering free stuff for new and expecting mothers. From diaper bags to baby clothes, if you know where to look, you can spend less time worrying about money, and more time taking care of yourself and your baby. We decided to make things even easier and compiled a list of all the freebies and discounts we could for new and expecting moms!\n\nBaby Registry Freebies\n\nA baby registry is a way for the friends and family of an expectant mom to help her stockpile the things she'll need once the baby arrives. Because a baby registry can bring in hundreds or even thousands of dollars to a store, a lot of retailers offer freebies baskets and bonus deals for moms who register with them. Here are the stores we found with the best baby registry incentives:\n\nRecommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz.\n\nAmazon -- Amazon sends Prime members who create and complete a baby registry online a baby \"Welcome Box\" after at least $10 of registry gifts have been purchased from their wishlist. The box is valued at $35, and recent recipients said it included baby food samples, a nursing bottle, a pacifier, breast pads, water wipes, baby lotion, shampoo, conditioner and more! This is just one of the many, many reasons why we here at Brad's Deals are obsessed with our Amazon Prime memberships.\n\nBuy Buy Baby -- Register and add items to your baby registry in-store at Buy Buy Baby, and you'll get a goody bag filled with product samples and coupons. Buy Buy Baby doesn't publish exactly what's in the goody bag, but some covert mommy forum sleuthing found that previous recipients have gotten a copy of American Baby magazine, formula, baby food samples, a pacifier and more!\n\nBabies \"R\" Us -- Babies \"R\" Us also offers a registry gift bag, which is reusable. Inside, you'll likely find things like samples of formula, nursing pads, breast milk storage bags, cloth diapers, and baby wipes.\n\nTarget -- Register in person for a Target baby registry and you'll get a gift bag at Guest Services filled with $50 in goodies. Freebies include coupons for brands like Pampers and Starbucks, and according to one blogger, the samples include things like Aquaphor diaper rash cream, Olly prenatal multivitamins, a MAM pacifier, some Lansinoh breastfeeding storage bags, The Honest Company diapers and wipes, Pampers wipes and a Philips Avent natural bottle.\n\nFormula Freebies\n\nEnfamil -- Sign up for the Enfamil Family Beginnings program to receive up to $250 worth of free gifts for you and your baby.

One popular one is the Johnson & Johnson Baby Relief Kit, which typically goes for around $30. Johnson & Johnson is NOT giving this away for free, and any site that claims this is probably trying to scam you. Another one we came upon in our research for this list is the Gerber Baby Bathtime Set. Again, this IS a real product, but it's not being given away for free. Don't enter any personal information on a site that claims it will send this to you. Spoiler alert: you're not gonna get it.\n\nIf you want to learn how to spot fake coupons on Facebook, check out our recent article on this topic and save yourself a headache in the future.\n\nThis article first appeared in Brad's Deals.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "3fdff469339124aa0cd0b48b33c9e4eb", "sailthru.author": "Caroline Thompson", "description": "From diaper bags to baby clothes, if you know where to look, you can spend less time worrying about money, and more time taking care of yourself and your baby.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/03/970907_1_0317-baby_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "From diaper bags to baby clothes, if you know where to look, you can spend less time worrying about money, and more time taking care of yourself and your baby.", "title": "Twenty-five freebies and discounts for new and expectant moms", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2016/0319/Twenty-five-freebies-and-discounts-for-new-and-expectant-moms", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/03/970907_1_0317-baby_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@csmonitor", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/03/970907_1_0317-baby_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "From diaper bags to baby clothes, if you know where to look, you can spend less time worrying about money, and more time taking care of yourself and your baby.", "card": "summary", "title": "Twenty-five freebies and discounts for new and expectant moms"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-19", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-19T10:00:02-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/Business/Saving-Money/2016/0319/Twenty-five-freebies-and-discounts-for-new-and-expectant-moms", "sailthru.tags": "section-saving-money,section-business,class-blog-post,storysource-guest-blogger", "article": {"section": "Saving Money", "published_time": "2016-03-19T10:00-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Austin Bachand/Daily News-Record/AP"}, "article_summary": "Baby Registry FreebiesA baby registry is a way for the friends and family of an expectant mom to help her stockpile the things she'll need once the baby arrives.\nHere are the stores we found with the best baby registry incentives:Recommended: Are you a smart shopper?\nWe decided to make things even easier and compiled a list of all the freebies and discounts we could for new and expecting moms!\nPampers -- Create a Pampers account and get free samples, coupons and offers from both Pampers AND their partner companies (Charmin, Bounty, Always, Tide and Dreft).\nBecause a baby registry can bring in hundreds or even thousands of dollars to a store, a lot of retailers offer freebies baskets and bonus deals for moms who register with them."}
