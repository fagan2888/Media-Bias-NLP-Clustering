But the four liberal justices warned against the precedent of opening up the floodgates to new religious objections to laws. \u201cHow will we ever have a government that functions?\u201d asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor. They also indicated the accommodation struck the right balance between religious liberty and allowing employees to have important access to contraception. \u2026 A 4-4 split would let stand lower court rulings, eight of which have favored the Obama administration. But in the states governed by the Eighth Circuit, the accommodation would be struck down.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision to obstruct President Obama Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, is already harming the country. Critical questions of law may not be resolved because McConnell has decided to make up his own rules as he goes along in order to justify partisan political obstruction.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s obstruction could mean that in the case of Zubik v. Burwell, no legal precedent may be set. Instead of a national decision, Republicans could create chaos with differing lower court rulings establishing contradictory rulings in different parts of the country.\n\nBy obstructing Merrick Garland, Senate Republicans have imposed the same gridlock that has made Congress dysfunctional to the Supreme Court. The main Republican talking point that deadlocked court wouldn\u2019t be damaging to the nation\u2019s legal system has already been disproven.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s big strategy is backfiring. The latest Obamacare case was the conservative movement\u2019s last gasp attack on Obamacare, but thanks to Mitch McConnell\u2019s obstruction, conservatives may be destined for a deadlocked defeat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest Republican Supreme Court assault on Obamacare could be destined for defeat, thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's plan to obstruct President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The latest Republican Supreme Court assault on Obamacare could be destined for defeat, thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's plan to obstruct President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.", "title": "Obama Obstruction Backfires On GOP As Supreme Court Faces Deadlock On Obamacare Case", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/03/23/obama-obstruction-backfires-gop-supreme-court-faces-deadlock-obamcare-case.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mcconnell-obama.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-23T19:23:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,deadlocked Supreme Court,McConnell Obama Supreme Court Obstruction,Mitch McConnell obstructs Merrick Garland,Zubik v.
