The Washington Post reported this week on renewed interest in legislation on mental health.\n\nHouse Republican leaders said this week that they are determined to pass reforms to federal mental health laws, potentially delivering a jolt to legislation that has been mired in partisan disputes for nearly three years. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) endorsed a long-simmering mental health overhaul at a Tuesday morning news conference immediately after offering his condolences to the victims of Friday\u2019s shootings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado.\n\nThe Republican leader said \u201cone common denominator in these tragedies is mental illness,\u201d which is why he\u2019s throwing his support behind a reform bill authored by Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), which has not yet cleared committee.\n\nAccording to the Post \u2019s piece, the legislation would \u201ccreate a new assistant secretary of Health and Human Services to oversee substance abuse and mental health, overhauling the oft-maligned Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. It would also put a new emphasis on evidence-based treatments, and encourage court-ordered \u2018assisted outpatient treatment\u2019 programs for those who are mentally ill but who are not eligible for involuntary commitment.\u201d\n\nBut Congress being Congress, passing relatively straightforward reforms won\u2019t be easy. In the upper chamber, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) has a related bill \u2013 provisions of which could be included in a comprehensive package \u2013 which would \u201cboost the federal background check system to prevent guns from getting into the hands of those with serious mental illness.\u201d\n\nAnd while some parts of Cornyn\u2019s bill have drawn bipartisan praise, the trouble, as we discussed in August, is that this same bill, which enjoys the NRA\u2019s backing, would let \u201csome people discharged from involuntary psychiatric treatment, who currently need court approval to buy firearms, immediately purchase guns.\u201d\n\nThe AP report over the summer quoted Arkadi Gerney, a gun policy expert for the liberal Center for American Progress, saying, \u201cSenator Cornyn would make it easier, not harder for seriously mentally ill people to access guns.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say the Republican approach to the issue has a few kinks that still need to be worked out.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s also not forget that the Affordable Care Act can and should be an important piece to the puzzle. University of Chicago professor Harold Pollack explained in October that the ACA \u201cremains the single most important measure to expand access to mental health and addiction treatment, serving severely vulnerable populations such as the homeless, addressing the complicated medical and psychiatric difficulties of many young men cycling through our jails and prisons.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) released a report endorsing Medicaid expansion. The report argued that \u201cStates that decline to expand Medicaid will miss as good an opportunity as they may ever have to address this shameful void in access to mental health treatment.\u201d Addressing the connection between mental illness and violence, NAMI concluded: \u201cIn the aftermath of Newtown, many politicians and policy makers have promised to take steps to fix America\u2019s broken mental health system. Expanding Medicaid in all states would represent a significant step towards keeping those promises.\u201d\n\nPollack concluded, \u201cIf any other politician suggests that mental health rather than gun policy is central to reducing mass homicides, ask where they stand on Medicaid expansion. Their answer will be clarifying.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "To put it mildly, the Republican approach to the issue has a few kinks that still need to be worked out.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congress-eyes-mental-health-overhaul-following-mass-shootings", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "To put it mildly, the Republican approach to the issue has a few kinks that still need to be worked out.", "title": "Congress eyes mental-health overhaul following mass shootings", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congress-eyes-mental-health-overhaul-following-mass-shootings", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/rtr3piju_0_0.jpg?itok=XF4q1hWa", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congress-eyes-mental-health-overhaul-following-mass-shootings", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/rtr3piju_0_0.jpg?itok=79dN0nHQ", "height": 553}, "title": "Congress eyes mental-health overhaul following mass shootings", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "To put it mildly, the Republican approach to the issue has a few kinks that still need to be worked out."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-03T08:40:14-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Congress eyes mental-health overhaul following mass shootings", "tags": "gun-policy,guns,john-cornyn,mental-health,paul-ryan,society,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "12/03/2015 08:40:14 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congress-eyes-mental-health-overhaul-following-mass-shootings"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "To put it mildly, the Republican approach to the issue has a few kinks that still need to be worked out.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Society, Guns, Gun Policy, John Cornyn, Mental Health, Paul Ryan"}, "article_summary": "The Washington Post reported this week on renewed interest in legislation on mental health.\nHouse Speaker Paul D.
