Updated at 2pm with comment from Cruz adviser and IAFF spokesman.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Turns out, union firefighters may not be core supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nOne applause line after another \u2013 when he\u2019s addressing a friendly group of conservatives \u2013 drew dead silence Tuesday morning at the International Association of Firefighters Legislative Conference and Presidential Forum.\n\nRepeal \u201cexecutive amnesty.\u201d The joke about the Texas definition of gun control (\u201chitting what you aim at\u201d). Silence.\n\nAbolish the IRS? Crickets. Though the follow-up\u2013 a joke about sending all those IRS agents to the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 drew scattered chuckles.\n\nWith a friendly audience like the one Cruz enjoyed at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this month, those lines are surefire winners.\n\nThe senator\u2019s effort to tailor his broadside on Obamacare for the union audience \u2013 IAFF is part of the AFL-CIO \u2014 didn\u2019t pay off, either.\n\n\u201cI know that unions across this country are hurting under Obamacare. The Cadillac tax is coming. It was sold to you and everybody else in this country under false pretenses,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cFive years ago reasonable minds could have differed on whether this was a good idea. But today, seeing millions of American who\u2019ve lost their jobs, who\u2019ve been forced into part time work, who\u2019ve lost their heatlh care, who\u2019ve lost their doctor \u2013 it is the essence of reasonableness, it is essence of pragmatism to acknowledge this thing isn\u2019t working. We need to repeal it and start over.\u201d\n\nThis too, left the audience unmoved.\n\n\u201cAlthough we can\u2019t agree on a lot of what he said, he\u2019s certainly entitled to his point of view,\u201d Guy Turner of Abilene, president of the Texas State Association of Fire Fighters, said afterward. \u201cIt is time to focus your efforts on another argument, not the Affordable Care Act. The American people are going to pay for healthcare one way or another. Either through the Affordable Care Act or for those individuals who go uninsured and still receive treatment and don\u2019t pay anything.\u201d\n\nCruz did get a polite reception, and applause at the start and end of his half-hour appearance.\n\nCruz adviser Rick Tyler said the senator deserves credit for appearing before a labor union. And he asserted that the IAFF opposed the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhether they reacted or not, Ted Cruz and the firefighters are in sync\u201d on that issue, he said.\n\nIAFF officials took issue with that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d said spokesman Scott Treibitz. \u201cWe did support the legislation. We had some issues with the legislation, continue to have some issues with the law. But in general we did support it.\u201d\n\nThe IAFF objects to the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d that Cruz mentioned, which hits union members with high-end insurance, and has been working to get that changed. \u201cBut the whole idea of repealing the entire program is not something this organization supports,\u201d Treibitz said.\n\nLike other speakers, Cruz paid homage to firefighters. He cited the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Boston Marathon bombing, and the fertilizer explosion in West, Texas, that killed a dozen first responders.\n\nHe keeps a West fire helmet in his office, he said, \u201cto remind me of the incredible bravery shown every day. Every day in a crisis situation, the men and women here risk everything.\u201d\n\nHe blamed budget problems in fire departments across the country on six years of economic stagnation and anemic growth, which he blamed on federal policies that have hurt small business.\n\nCruz made no mention of the recently settled impasse over Department of Homeland Security funding. Democratic speakers, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, derided Republicans for delaying a DHS budget to protest President Obama\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nRep. Peter King, R-N.Y. \u2014 a frequent Cruz critic \u2013 alluded to him and other potential 2016 contenders on that issue: \u201cI find it really hypocritical to have people come before you, say, \u2018I stand with the firefighters, We have to be with you,\u2019 and then they don\u2019t vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d King said.\n\nSteve Moody of the San Antonio Professional Fire Fighters Association agreed with Cruz\u2019s views on border security and not much else.\n\n\u201cHe had a hard audience,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMy9maXJlZmlnaHRlcnMtdW5tb3ZlZC1ieS10ZWQtY3J1ei1icm9hZHNpZGUtb24tb2JhbWFjYXJlLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
