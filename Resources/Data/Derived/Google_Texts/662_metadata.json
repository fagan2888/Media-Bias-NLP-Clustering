The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was an issue in last year\u2019s election, and the candidate who called for repeal lost.\"\n\nObama said the still-fragile economy is only threatened by the GOP's threats to potentially allow a government shutdown if Obamacare is funded and to not raise the debt ceiling if it doesn't include more spending cuts. Both battles are set to occur in the coming weeks.\n\n\"In case there\u2019s any confusion, I will not negotiate over whether or not America keeps its word and meets its obligations; I will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States,\" Obama said. \"Let's stop the threats, stop the political posturing.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew has said for months that there would be no negotiations over the debt ceiling and that Republicans need to send Obama a clean bill.\n\nBut while Obama said that he won't negotiate on the debt ceiling, he said he will listen to ways to make the government run more efficiently during the budget debate.\n\nSome Republicans have threatened to hold up the funding of the government if Obamacare is funded as a part of it. Other Republicans disagree with that strategy, worrying about the consequences of a potential government shutdown.\n\nObama said Republicans are effectively holding the government hostage by threatening to defund Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos when it doesn\u2019t get everything it wants,\" he said.\n\nObama said he agrees that government can be made more efficient, but he said Republicans have deserted that message in favor of using the budget to try and undercut his signature health care law.\n\n\"It\u2019s time for those Republicans to step up, and they\u2019ve got to decide what they want to prioritize,\" Obama said. \"Originally, they said they wanted deficit reduction. As I said before, our deficits are falling fast.\"\n\nObama also pointed to economic progress being made and the decreasing deficits, suggesting things are on the right track.\n\nBut he said the continued struggles have exacerbated the already growing gap between rich and poor.\n\n\u201cThose trends have been made worse by the recession,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be focused on. That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIn case there\u2019s any confusion: I will not negotiate over whether America keeps its word,\" Obama said.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\u201cIn case there\u2019s any confusion: I will not negotiate over whether America keeps its word,\" Obama said.", "title": "Obama: I will not negotiate on the debt ceiling", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/09/16/obama-i-will-not-negotiate-on-the-debt-ceiling/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aaronblake"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/09/16/obama-i-will-not-negotiate-on-the-debt-ceiling/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "debt ceiling, washington post politics, debt limit, obama debt limit, obama budget,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "debt ceiling, washington post politics, debt limit, obama debt limit, obama budget,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c4f\"", "article_summary": "But while Obama said that he won't negotiate on the debt ceiling, he said he will listen to ways to make the government run more efficiently during the budget debate.\nPresident Obama on Monday reiterated that he will not negotiate with Republicans over the debt ceiling and called on them to cede the battle over Obamacare and pass a new budget.\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew has said for months that there would be no negotiations over the debt ceiling and that Republicans need to send Obama a clean bill.\n\"Let's stop the threats, stop the political posturing.\"\nObama said the still-fragile economy is only threatened by the GOP's threats to potentially allow a government shutdown if Obamacare is funded and to not raise the debt ceiling if it doesn't include more spending cuts."}
