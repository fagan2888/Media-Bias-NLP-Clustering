Many Republican legislators have said reform of the state\u2019s low-income health care program must happen before they accept federal dollars to expand it.\n\nAPRN\u2019s Alexandra Gutierrez joins us to talk about what\u2019s in the bill and what it means for the program\u2019s future.\n\nTalk of a Medicaid reform bill coming out of the Senate picked up earlier this month. Today, Sen. Pete Kelly, a Fairbanks Republican, finally introduced it. What are his goals with the bill?\n\nAn a meeting with reporters this afternoon, Kelly said his objective was to rein in waste that exists with the state\u2019s Medicaid program. He sees unnecessary spending happening in four areas:\n\nKELLY: Travel, ER, prescription drugs, self-referral to more expensive specialists.\n\n\n\nThe bill he introduced Friday addresses those areas generally. There\u2019s a section on emergency services, setting up a program tracking frequent ER visits. There\u2019s language that setting up a prescription monitoring program and requires guidelines for prescribing narcotics to Medicaid patients. There\u2019s also a section directing the Department of Health and Social Services to look into the pros and cons of privatizing services at the Alaska Psychiatric Institute and the state\u2019s pioneer homes for senior citizens.\n\nBut it is not Kelly\u2019s goal to expand Medicaid. He\u2019s been firm about that, saying he does not want to add more people to a \u201cbroken system.\u201d There is no language accepting $145 million in federal money to bring people near the poverty line into the program, and he\u2019s not in favor of such language being added.\n\nRight now, the state\u2019s Medicaid program mostly covers low-income children and pregnant women. With expansion, adults who make up to 138 percent of the poverty level could get government health care \u2014 that\u2019s about $20,000 a year for a single person. What does this bill do for people who don\u2019t receive Medicaid now, but would through expansion?\n\nThis bill really does not apply to them. There\u2019s a section that sets up a managed care pilot program of sorts, and it only applies to those already enrolled in the state\u2019s Medicaid program. There\u2019s also a section establishing a health savings account by taking 10 percent of a recipient\u2019s Permanent Fund dividend that\u2019s voluntary, but again, that only applies to people who are eligible for state Medicaid now.\n\nNow, as it goes through the committee process, there are changes that could be made that could affect them. The legislation is just seven pages, and it\u2019s written in pretty broad strokes. Health care policy is complicated and wonky, and by comparison, the Affordable Care Act was more than 1,000 pages.\n\nYou mentioned the creation of a Health Savings Account through people\u2019s PFD. Tell us more about that.\n\nThe idea is that if you\u2019re eligible for Medicaid because you\u2019re a child or a pregnant woman near the poverty line, a chunk of your PFD could be diverted for medical expenses. Traditionally, the big benefit of health savings accounts is that money can go into them tax-free. However, most people who are eligible for Medicaid don\u2019t really have a big tax bill anyway.\n\nKelly stressed that enrollment in the health savings account is voluntary \u2014 nobody in this category is going to see their PFD automatically used for their medical bills. But he also said he\u2019s not yet sure how the health savings account is going to work.\n\nKELLY: I can\u2019t tell you why people would choose it. We\u2019ll figure that out. But we\u2019re going to get it started.\n\n\n\nAt any rate, he said there are other parts of the bill \u2014 like the push to a managed care system \u2014 that were more important for reform.\n\nKELLY: It\u2019s very possible that this portion of this bill will not have a lot of teeth in it, will not have a lot of impact in the short term.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s one other interesting \u2014 if kind of inside baseball \u2014 thing to note about the PFD section. Because of it, the beginning of the bill title is \u201cAn act relating to Permanent Fund Dividends.\u201d Bill titles basically dictate what changes and additions you can make to a bill. So, a bill with phrasing that vague leaves an opening for other policies dealing with the Permanent Fund to be added in. Because that could be such a Pandora\u2019s box, Kelly\u2019s office says they\u2019re planning to tighten that up.\n\nWhat\u2019s the financial impact of this bill?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear. Kelly says there could be savings in the long term, but there would also be start-up costs to some of the programs established by this bill. The Legislature will have a better sense of the price tag after a fiscal note is drafted.\n\nSo, what does this bill mean for Medicaid expansion, if anything?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say. Kelly says he has been working with Gov. Bill Walker and his administration on Medicaid reform, and that things have been nothing but cordial between them. But Medicaid expansion has been such a priority for the Walker administration, that this bill isn\u2019t guaranteed to get the governor\u2019s support.\n\nWhile the bill does not currently expand Medicaid, legislators could add expansion language in, if they so choose, as the bill goes through the committee process. For passage, the bill will have to go through the Senate, and then go over to the House for review. It is expected to be referred to the House Health and Social Services Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Paul Seaton, a Homer Republican who has been open to the idea of Medicaid expansion. It would also likely go to the House Finance Committee, where there are also a few friendly members.\n\nBut even if expansion language does get added to this bill, the legislation would still have to go back to the Senate for approval and potentially for a conference committee. Kelly is not optimistic about that going over well in his body.\n\nKELLY: If I were to look into a crystal ball, I would say that would die in the Senate.\n\n\n\nFor their part, officials at the Department of Health and Social Services, who have been pushing for expansion, say they have not had time to review the bill.\n\nIt\u2019s Day 53 at the Capitol. We\u2019re more than halfway done with the 90-day session. Can all this happen in time for adjournment?\n\nIf it does, it would have to be on a tight schedule. It\u2019s a pretty complicated subject to jump into so late in the game. But then again, and some people might throttle me for saying this: There\u2019s always the option of a special session.\n\nRelated articles\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health,Recent News,State Government", "description": "A Medicaid reform bill has been filed in the Alaska Senate.
