Newsmaker of the Year 2014 Gene Michalski CEO, Beaumont Health System, Royal Oak

Beaumont Health System CEOs generally don't generate as much publicity as Gene Michalski has in his three years as head of the nonprofit system.



As only the fifth Beaumont CEO in its 60-year history, Michalski, a 36-year veteran of Beaumont, has been involved in many high-profile news events.



Under his tenure, he has presided over a months-long financial contract dispute with Blue Care Network, restructured six clinical service lines, nixed a joint venture with a for-profit oncology company and nearly merged Beaumont with five-hospital Henry Ford Health System of Detroit.
