The tide seems unstoppable.\n\nIn 2004, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote a book subtitled \u201cWhy Liberals Will Win the Battle for America.\u201d He argued that the populace is more compassionate than the tone set by conservatives who dominate government. He said most Americans have \u201ca bedrock sense of public, or common, morality\u201d which sympathizes with ordinary folks, not the privileged elite favored by conservatives.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have posed the deepest moral question of any society: whether we're in it together,\u201d Reich wrote. \u201cTheir answer is we're not.\u201d But Reich said conscientious people \u201cshould proclaim, loudly and clearly, we are.\u201d\n\nThis month, Boston University religion professor Stephen Prothero will release a book titled \u201cWhy Liberals Win the Culture Wars (Even When They Lose Elections).\u201d He says conservatives often feel society around them shifting away from their cherished privileges and prejudices. For example, they feel \u201canxiety about the demise of the patriarchal family or Anglo-American dominance or \u2018Christian America.'\u201d Too late, they raise an outcry and fight a furious resistance, but the trend can't be stopped.\n\n\u201cIn almost every case since the founding of the republic,\u201d he wrote, \u201cconservatives have fired the first shots in our culture wars. Equally often, liberals have won. A liberal win becomes part of the new status quo and eventually fades from our collective memory. No conservative today wants to disenfranchise Mormons or outlaw five o'clock cocktails. So these victories no longer even appear to be \u2018liberal.' They are simply part of what it means to be an American.\u201d\n\nThe current culture war rose as a backlash against the tumultuous 1960s, when young Americans loosed the sexual revolution and war-denouncing counterculture. Racial desegregation, women's right to choose abortion, and banning of government-led school prayer further outraged right-wingers. Conservatives \u201csaw American society drifting away from them, erasing forms of culture they held dear,\u201d Prothero says.\n\nAs a counterattack, the \u201creligious right\u201d Moral Majority rose, and white evangelicals put conservative Ronald Reagan in the White House. White-only \u201csegregation academies\u201d were started so conservative families could avoid mixed-race schools. \u201cFamily values\u201d became a slogan for hating gays. Pro-life murder occurred when a few zealots killed doctors and nurses at abortion clinics. Claims flared that America is an exceptional \u201cChristian nation.\u201d\n\nBut slowly, step by step, liberals carried the day. Gays won a nationwide right to marry. President Barack Obama's health care expansion made medicine available to millions of families.\n\n\u201cConservatives lost the contemporary culture wars and they lost them badly,\u201d professor Prothero says. \u201cAs the counterculture mainstreamed, American society continued to drift left.\u201d\n\nMost Americans have accepted liberal victories, but tea party hard-liners still sound right-wing trumpets. Will culture wars continue forever? Will progressives keep pushing for more personal freedoms? Prothero concludes:\n\n\u201cLiberals can take comfort in the fact that they almost always win our cultural battles -- that the arc of American cultural politics bends toward more liberty, not less.\u201d\n\nJames A.
