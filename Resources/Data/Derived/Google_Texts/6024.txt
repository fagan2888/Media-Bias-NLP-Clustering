President Obama is at the University of Chicago, where he’s discussing the Supreme Court and our larger judicial system. So far, the president noted how partisanship, and the political games surrounding judicial nominations, have always been around, but entered a new phase of intensity under his administration. Again, it’s interesting that he continues to talk about how some politicians want to “gum” up the works, while he tried to filibuster Samuel Alito’s nomination to the Court under President Bush.
