[KWQC-TV]\n\nA BNSF Railway train loaded with crude oil derailed and caught fire on Thursday afternoon in a rural area south of Galena, Illinois, according to local officials and the company.\n\nThe incident marks the latest in a series of derailments in North America and the third in three weeks involving trains hauling crude oil, which has put a heightened focus on rail safety.\n\nDark smoke was seen for miles around the crash site, and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency told local WREX.com that two of the cars were potentially on fire. Images posted online by Dubuque Scanner showed flames several hundred feet high, while aerial footage showed the wreck spread across two sets of track.\n\nThe train with 105 loaded cars \u2014 103 of them carrying crude oil \u2014 derailed around 1:20 p.m. CST (1920 GMT), according to a BNSF statement. The incident occurred on what appears to be a major rail line alongside the Mississippi River that handles as many as 50 oil-trains a week, one official said.\n\n\u201cThe sky is pretty dark down there, the smoke is pretty black,\u201d said Kevin Doyle, whose property borders the tracks. \u201cIf you\u2019re standing on the tracks you can throw a rock in the water.\u201d\n\nBNSF said there were no reported injuries and no evacuations. The Berkshire Hathaway Inc unit did not know what had caused the derailment, which occurred about 3 miles outside Galena, a town of just over 3,000 on the border with Wisconsin.\n\nEight cars derailed, according to Galena City Administrator Mark Moran, six of which had tumbled onto their side. He said emergency responders were called back to Galena as a precaution, and BNSF responders had taken over control of the site. It was not clear if oil had spilled from the tank cars.\n\nIt was also not immediately clear where the train originated or where it was heading. Chicago, which is 160 miles east, is a major rail hub for shipments from both North Dakota and Canada\u2019s oil sands. It was unclear if the train\u2019s tank cars were older models widely criticized for being prone to puncture during accidents.\n\nAbout 40 to 50 oil trains come through the area each week, Jo Daviess County Emergency Manager Charles Pedersen said. He had said earlier that there was no explosion or fire at the site.\n\nThe accident is just the latest involving oil trains in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 2013, 47 people were killed in the Quebec town of Lac-M\u00e9gantic after a train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded. The last incident was just three weeks ago.\n\nLast month, a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train derailment in nearby Dubuque, Iowa, spilled ethanol fuel into the water and set three cars on fire. Dubuque, which is 14 miles to the north west of Galena, has almost 60,000 inhabitants.\n\nA National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said the federal agency was not investigating the incident.\n\n(Reporting by Edward McAllister and Catherine Ngai; editing by Chris Reese, G Crosse, Christian Plumb and Diane Craft)\n\nWatch a report on the derailment, as aired on KWQC-TV on Thursday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Aerial-footage-of-a-fire-caused-by-a-crude-oil-train-derailment-on-March-5-2015.-KQWC-TV-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Crude oil train derails, catches fire while traveling through Illinois"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf176\"", "article_summary": "Aerial footage of a fire caused by a crude oil train derailment on March 5, 2015.\nIn 2013, 47 people were killed in the Quebec town of Lac-M\u00e9gantic after a train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded.\nThe train with 105 loaded cars \u2014 103 of them carrying crude oil \u2014 derailed around 1:20 p.m. CST (1920 GMT), according to a BNSF statement.\nAbout 40 to 50 oil trains come through the area each week, Jo Daviess County Emergency Manager Charles Pedersen said.\n[KWQC-TV]A BNSF Railway train loaded with crude oil derailed and caught fire on Thursday afternoon in a rural area south of Galena, Illinois, according to local officials and the company."}
