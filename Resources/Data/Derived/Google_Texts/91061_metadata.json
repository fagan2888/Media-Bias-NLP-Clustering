Security had dominated the bilateral agenda since 2001, and the new administration sought to give economic ties the leading role.\n\nNow beginning his third year in office, Pe\u00f1a Nieto will be back in Washington tomorrow for his second White House meeting amid renewed security concerns. While his bold structural reform program has impressed foreign investors and the international media, public anger over the September disappearance of 43 students in Guerrero state, compounded by a series of corruption allegations, threatens the administration\u2019s economic message. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s meeting with President Barack Obama could not come at a more critical time.\n\nThe Obama administration should seize this opportunity to review security cooperation and refocus on important joint efforts to strengthen the rule of law and confront drug-related violence. It would be a mistake, however, to allow the pendulum of the bilateral relationship to swing completely in this direction. Both dimensions \u2014 economics and security \u2014 require attention at the highest levels of government.\n\n\n\n[SEE: 2014: The Year in Cartoons]\n\nAt a minimum, rebalancing in favor of economic opportunities has succeeded in positively changing the tone of the bilateral relationship in ways that tough security and migration challenges could not. As Obama acknowledged during a press conference prior to visiting Mexico in May 2013, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes I think we forget this is a massive trading partner responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border.\u201d\n\nBoth the U.S. and Mexican private sectors know the value of this relationship \u2014 not only trading products, but also designing and producing them together. More than $1 billion dollars\u2019 worth of goods crosses the border every single day. The United States sells more to Mexico than it does to Brazil, Russia, India, and China combined. Moreover, it is estimated that 40 percent of the value of final goods imported from Mexico consists of U.S. content, a much higher proportion than any other trading partner.\n\nOver the last two years, a veritable conveyor belt of cabinet secretaries between the two capitals has demonstrated the degree of interest in the trade and investment agenda. As the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration pushed through landmark domestic reforms, from energy to telecommunications, the two governments established or reinforced existing bilateral mechanisms to provide strategic direction to joint economic-competitiveness initiatives.\n\nU.S. Vice President Biden launched the U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue in September 2013 and will host the second iteration of the annual meeting tomorrow. Attended by several cabinet secretaries from both countries, the dialogue created a space for an ongoing conversation around three pillars: promoting competitiveness, boosting economic growth and innovation, and fostering cooperation at the regional and global levels. Other new bilateral dialogues focus on educational exchange and entrepreneurship promotion.\n\n\n\n[GALLERY: Barack Obama Cartoons]\n\nMexico has also elevated economics on the trilateral agenda with Canada. At the most recent North American Leaders Summit hosted by Mexico one year ago and at subsequent ministerial gatherings, the three governments have made substantial progress in areas such as commerce and energy. Most importantly, Mexico and Canada have been party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations since 2012, following intense lobbying by the pro-trade Mexican government. Once concluded, the Trans-Pacific Partnership will offer the best vehicle to upgrade the North American Free Trade Agreement, now more than 20 years old.\n\nSuch summits, meetings and negotiations amount to more than an overdose of acronyms. They are tackling nitty-gritty obstacles to the cross-border business that undergirds North American prosperity.\n\nIt is this economic reality that lends importance to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s trip to Washington, the first foreign visit to the White House in the new year. As Mexico works to implement its reforms in 2015, the United States has a strategic opportunity to capitalize on the two countries\u2019 increasingly unified and competitive economic space. Fortunately, the bilateral mechanisms created over the last two years have laid the foundation for continued cooperation on the massive trade and investment agenda, though progress will require sustained senior-level attention and close engagement with the private sector and civil society.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "World Report [Opinion]", "title": "Pena Nieto-Obama Meeting Key for U.S.-Mexico Relations", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Mexican president is coming to Washington for a key meeting on economic and security concerns.", "title": "The Business That Builds North American Prosperity", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2015/01/05/pena-nieto-obama-meeting-key-for-us-mexico-relations", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/29/17/0dd434914a60ba45ee5f87b27233/150105-mexico-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Pena Nieto-Obama Meeting Key for U.S.-Mexico Relations", "description": "The Mexican president is coming to Washington for a key meeting on economic and security concerns.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Jan. 5, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kezia McKeague,Mexico,NAFTA,trade,picks,World Report [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Mexican president is coming to Washington for a key meeting on economic and security concerns."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf379\"", "article_summary": "It would be a mistake, however, to allow the pendulum of the bilateral relationship to swing completely in this direction.\nSecurity had dominated the bilateral agenda since 2001, and the new administration sought to give economic ties the leading role.\nPe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s meeting with President Barack Obama could not come at a more critical time.\nNow beginning his third year in office, Pe\u00f1a Nieto will be back in Washington tomorrow for his second White House meeting amid renewed security concerns.\nWhen Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto first visited the White House as president-elect in November 2012, he was determined to reframe the U.S.-Mexico relationship."}
