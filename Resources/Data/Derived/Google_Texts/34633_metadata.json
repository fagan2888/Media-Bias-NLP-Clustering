Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan was quoted at the weekend as saying Turkey was under threat.\n\nDamascus says it wants to take back full control of Aleppo, Syria's largest city before the civil war erupted five years ago. It would be a huge strategic prize for Assad's government in a conflict that has killed at least 250,000 people across the country and driven 11 million from their homes.\n\nAfter around a week of heavy Russian air strikes, Syrian government troops and their allies broke through rebel defenses to reach two Shi'ite towns in northern Aleppo province on Wednesday, choking opposition supply lines from Turkey.\n\nSUPPLY LINE\n\nThe Syrian army's success in opening a route to the Shi'ite towns of Nubul and Zahraa enabled it to cut a main highway that linked rebel held areas in the northern countryside of Aleppo with the eastern part of Aleppo held by insurgents since 2012.\n\nThe latest gains by the Syrian government brings it to the closest point to the Turkish border area since August 2013, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nThe capture of the towns of Mayer and then Kafin, just north of Nubul and Zahraa, in the past 24 hrs have opened the road toward Tal Rifaat, the next focus of the army assault. The capture of that would leave only the town of Azaz before the Turkish border itself.\n\nThe prospect of the loss of Azaz, just a few miles from the Bab al Salama border crossing, would virtually wipe out the insurgents from their main stronghold in northwest Syria.\n\nRussian bombing has for weeks targeted rebel routes to the main border crossing that was once a major gateway from Europe and Turkey to the Gulf and Iraq.\n\nSince it fell to insurgents, the crossing has been both a major commercial lifeline and arms supply route for rebel-held areas in Idlib and Aleppo provinces.\n\nThe army's advance has also been indirectly helped by Kurdish-led YPG militias who control the city of Afrin, south west of Azaz. They have seized a string of villages including Ziyara and Khreiybeh in the last few days, rebels said.\n\nThe Observatory also said they had secured the villages of Deir Jamal and Maranaz from Islamist insurgents.\n\nFour months of Russian air strikes have tipped the momentum of the war Assad's way. With Moscow's help and allies including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iranian fighters, the Syrian army is regaining areas on key fronts in the west.\n\n(Reporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; editing by Philippa Fletcher)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army advanced toward the Turkish border on Monday in a m", "title": "Russian firepower helps Syrian forces edge toward Turkey border", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/08/Russian-firepower-helps-Syrian-forces-edge-toward-Turkey-border", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/08/Russian-firepower-helps-Syrian-forces-edge-toward-Turkey-border", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army advanced toward the Turkish border on Monday in a m", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The capture of that would leave only the town of Azaz before the Turkish border itself.\nThe latest gains by the Syrian government brings it to the closest point to the Turkish border area since August 2013, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\nWith Moscow's help and allies including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iranian fighters, the Syrian army is regaining areas on key fronts in the west.\nRussian bombing has for weeks targeted rebel routes to the main border crossing that was once a major gateway from Europe and Turkey to the Gulf and Iraq.\nAfter around a week of heavy Russian air strikes, Syrian government troops and their allies broke through rebel defenses to reach two Shi'ite towns in northern Aleppo province on Wednesday, choking opposition supply lines from Turkey."}
