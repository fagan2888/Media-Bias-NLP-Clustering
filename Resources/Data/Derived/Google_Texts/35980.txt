Robert “Curly” Culberth was an Army veteran who served overseas during World War II.

After serving his country Curly and his 51-year-old wife Darlene dedicated much of their lives to serving the needs of the Veterans of Foreign Wars club.

Curly, 70, had served in regional and national positions and he and his wife had often volunteered at VFW clubs wherever they lived. When they lived in Chaffee County, they had volunteered at the Buena Vista VFW.

After working as a mechanic most of his adult life in the mountains, Curly retired in 1989 and the couple moved back to the Eastern Plains where they both grew up.

On Aug. 1, 1991, the couple was where they often had been, at the Lamar VFW club.

They had volunteered to work there like countless other times.

This time it was because the manager resigned about a month earlier. The Culberths were filling in until a new manager was assigned.

The couple arrived shortly after 1 p.m. that Thursday afternoon.

At 1:41 p.m., the alarm system at the VFW was disabled.
