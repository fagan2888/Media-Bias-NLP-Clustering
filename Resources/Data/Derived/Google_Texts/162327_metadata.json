Lanier seems to think that gun-control laws don\u2019t apply to the liberal elite. The police chief helped Sen. Dianne Feinstein acquire \u201cassault weapons,\u201d which are illegal to possess in the District, for a news conference early this year to promote a ban on these firearms, then tried to cover up the police involvement.\n\nNow, a response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request reveals Chief Lanier\u2019s shocking willingness to bend the rules for partisan and ideological purposes.\n\nFeinstein wants guns\n\nSEE ALSO: MILLER: Female, off-duty D.C. cop shoots assailant, but the rest of us are sitting ducks\n\nLobbyist Chuck DeWitt emailed Chief Lanier on Christmas Eve last year. \u201cSen. Feinstein has asked us to bring examples of assault weapons used in the worst incidents over the past few years.\u201d The CEO of the Lafayette Group told the chief that the guns would be put on display at a media event and asked, \u201cCould you put me in touch with your person who would have any of these weapons?\u201d\n\nChief Lanier\u2019s response was not turned over.\n\nHowever, a week after Mr. DeWitt\u2019s request, Mrs. Feinstein\u2019s press secretary, Tom Mentzer, asked the commander of the police department\u2019s Crime Scene Investigation Division, Keith Williams, for 10 specific firearm models used in high-profile mass shootings, including a Bushmaster XM-15, Tec-9 handgun, Smith & Wesson M&P15 and a Glock 19 with a \u201chigh-capacity magazine.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: VIDEO: Emily Miller on MSNBC \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 and her book \u2018Emily Gets Her Gun\u2019\n\nSince Cmdr. Williams did not have all the firearms the senator sought, Mr. DeWitt asked Philadelphia police to provide the missing ones, which meant bringing \u201cthe P15 and the Glock extended magazine\u201d to Washington.\n\nAll of these firearms are illegal in the city \u2014 even on federal property \u2014 owing to the District\u2019s law banning rifles with a detachable magazine and such features as a pistol grip or folding stock and all firearms with a magazines capacity of more than 10 rounds.\n\nLanier\u2019s coverup\n\nChief Lanier wanted to help Mrs. Feinstein, but didn\u2019t want the media to know.\n\nCmdr. Williams emailed Mr. Mentzer to put a \u201cbug\u201d in his ear that the police would \u201cprefer that no mention of the fact that the weapons came from D.C. or were recovered by MPDC in the official language or speeches.\u201d Mr. Mentzer replied, \u201cBy not mentioning where the weapons came from, we open ourselves up to the same charge against David Gregory.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the anchor of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d who knowingly procured an illegal 30-round magazine in the District as a stunt for his TV show, but was not charged.\n\nThe office of Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance W. Gainer coordinated bringing the illegal weapons onto Capitol Hill for Mrs. Feinstein\u2019s dramatic Jan. 24 news conference introducing her new \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban.\n\nKathryn Stillman, the campus-access coordinator for Mr. Gainer, emailed Cmdr. Williams and Mrs. Feinstein\u2019s staff to recommend the firearms be mounted on a board with zip ties so that Mrs. Feinstein could \u201cpoint or even touch, but no need for any particular handling.\u201d This was to ensure that it could be argued later that the senator never had \u201cpossession\u201d of the illegal guns.\n\nCoverup unravels\n\nAfter seeing the weapons on display at the press event, I asked Mr. Gainer\u2019s office about the legality and was told that the firearms were the property of the D.C. and Philadelphia police departments. A spokesman for Mrs. Feinstein, Brian Weiss, told me that his office \u201dcoordinated\u201d with the police and that \u201cthe weapons were under Washington MPD possession the entire time.\u201d\n\nBut when I asked Chief Lanier\u2019s spokesman, Gwendolyn Crump, about the guns, she refused to confirm they belonged to MPD. I followed up the next day with several more questions to Ms. Crump.\n\nFrom the FOIA documents, I now know that she sent my second email to Chief Lanier, who then forwarded it to three people with notes.\n\nChief Lanier wrote to Philadelphia Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey, \u201cI am really disappointed in Terry [Gainer]. This is exactly why I didn\u2019t want to participate.\u201d She said to Mr. Gainer, \u201cThis is completely contrary to our agreement to participate in this event. We will not participate again.\u201d\n\nThe chief wrote to lobbyist Mr. DeWitt, \u201cSo much for our agreement.\u201d Mr. DeWitt replied: \u201cWell, Ramsey and Feinstein followed our script, but who would have guessed that [Gainer] would burn us.\u201d He drafted a response for the police to send to me and added in a note, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you put up with people like Emily \u2026 .\u201d Chief\n\nLanier replied, \u201cThanks, Chuck, unfortunately this will be the next tail wagging our dog for weeks.\u201d\n\nNo special favors for Republicans\n\nA week after Mrs. Feinstein\u2019s publicity stunt, Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were refused permission to bring a hunting rifle and an AR-style rifle to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Mrs. Feinstein\u2019s \u201cassault weapon\u201d ban.\n\nThe Republican senators sent a letter of complaint to committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, but were still forced to use just a photo of a standard wooden hunting rifle with a plastic pistol grip at the hearing in order to demonstrate that simply adding the ergonomic feature transformed the gun into one that would be illegal under her ban.\n\nMrs. Feinstein\u2019s staff gloated: \u201cI was gratified to hear Sens. Cruz and Graham complaining that getting weapons into their hearing today was \u2018unworkable,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mentzer emailed Cmdr. Williams and another officer with a news story about the Republicans not being able bring in even a legal rifle. \u201cI find you guys ENTIRELY practical, for the record.\u201d\n\nThe police have yet to turn over a majority of the documents I requested. The FOIA officer wrote that she was \u201cstill searching\u201d and \u201cwill release them, if any are located.\u201d\n\nThe police stonewalling and cover-up are so that the public doesn\u2019t find out that Chief Lanier enforces laws differently in the District, depending on whether you are a powerful liberal who opposes Second Amendment rights, like Mr. Gregory and Mrs. Feinstein, or an average American.\n\nEmily Miller is a senior editor of opinion for The Washington Times and author of \u201cEmily Gets Her Gun\u201d (Regnery, 2013).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police Chief Cathy L.
