Cruz brings some heat to public's remarks at Funspot in Laconia



— Texas Sen. Ted Cruz delighted a group of supporters in Weirs Beach Saturday with his plans to derail “the Washington cartel” and the claimed successes of the Obama administration if he wins the GOP nomination and the general election.

..

As a group of about 100 people cheered, many saying “amen” after he spoke, Cruz, who ranks highly in polls of South Carolina and Iowa polls but is near the bottom of many New Hampshire voter surveys, ripped President Obama's “illegal and unconstitutional” executive orders and said he would repeal them.

..

After his 45-minute speech at Funspot, Cruz, a staunch supporter of gun owners' rights who has been endorsed by the Gun Owners of American, was asked by a Sunday News reporter about Obama's passionate comments in favor of stronger gun control laws in the wake of the mass shootings Thursday in Oregon that left 9 dead.

..

“I think it was,” he said, pausing with a troubled sigh, “it was really sad to see the President trying to politicize a tragedy and try to advance his political agenda.”



Cruz said he would repeal all of Obama's executive orders, and would instruct the Department of Justice “to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and these horrible videos.”

..

“The administration of justice should be blind to party and ideology,” he said.



He said he would “take on” the Environmental Protection Agency and abolish the Internal Revenue Service and establish a flat tax “so that every American can fill out his or her taxes on a postcard.”

..

He said he would instruct the Department of Justice, the IRS, “and every other federal agency, that the persecution of religious liberty ends today.”



“That means that every service man and woman has the right to seek out and worship God with your heart and mind and souls, and your superior officer has nothing to say about it,” he said. “That means that Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic charity being persecuted by the Obama administration, will find the case against them has been dismissed.”

..

As his wife and children played video games in the large arcade, Cruz said he will “rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.”



“The single greatest threat to the United States of America is the threat of a nuclear Iran,” he said.

..

He said he would repeal “every word of Obamacare.” And, saying the Department of Education should be abolished, he said as President he would “instruct the Department of Education that Common Core ends today.”
