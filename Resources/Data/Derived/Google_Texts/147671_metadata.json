The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommends that dogs under 18 months avoid sustained jogging and points out that breeds with short or flat noses can have trouble breathing when exercised vigorously.\n\n\u201cOur approach was humorous, and some people didn\u2019t see it that way,\u201d Geoff Shaffer, global marketing director at Pearl Izumi, told NBC News.\n\nThe company issued an apology and later pulled the print ad, along with its accompanying video off of YouTube, although the dead-dog-free portions of the Project eMotion campaign will remain. Pearl Izumi also made a $10,000 donation to the Humane Society in Boulder Valley, Colo., near where the U.S. branch of the company is based.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "advertising, dogs, heart attacks, pearl izumi, dummies", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\u201cThese types of images will inherently be upsetting to people,\u201d said one communications expert in response to the sneaker company Pearl Izumi\u2019s dead dog advertisement.", "title": "Is This Dead Dog Ad, By Sneaker Company Pearl Izumi, The Worst Ever?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dead-dog-ad-sneaker-company-pearl-izumi-worst-ever-255880", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/pearl-izumi-dead-dog-adsmall.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cThese types of images will inherently be upsetting to people,\u201d said one communications expert in response to the sneaker company Pearl Izumi\u2019s dead dog advertisement.", "title": "Is This Dead Dog Ad, By Sneaker Company Pearl Izumi, The Worst Ever?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dead-dog-ad-sneaker-company-pearl-izumi-worst-ever-255880", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/pearl-izumi-dead-dog-adsmall.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/pearl-izumi-dead-dog-adsmall.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-06T16:07:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-06T19:01:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\u201cThese types of images will inherently be upsetting to people,\u201d said one communications expert in response to the sneaker company Pearl Izumi\u2019s dead dog advertisement."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf11f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur approach was humorous, and some people didn\u2019t see it that way,\u201d Geoff Shaffer, global marketing director at Pearl Izumi, told NBC News.\n\u201cThese types of images will inherently be upsetting to people,\u201d said one communications expert in response to the sneaker company Pearl Izumi\u2019s dead dog advertisement.\nPearl Izumi also made a $10,000 donation to the Humane Society in Boulder Valley, Colo., near where the U.S. branch of the company is based.\nThe answer is clearly not Japanese shoemaker Pearl Izumi, who earned the collective derision of animal lovers and communications experts after releasing the controversial campaign this week.\nMany people, however, were unimpressed the concept that Pearl Izumi\u2019s sneakers are \"so fast they will kill your dog.\""}
