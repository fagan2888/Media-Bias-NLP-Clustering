The Simi Valley Police Traffic Unit and the California Highway Patrol Commercial Enforcement Unit took five vehicles out of service after conducting commercial vehicle inspections Wednesday in Simi Valley.

Others vehicles were cited for dangerous conditions.

Police said the operation was conducted in response to complaints by community members related to the trucks and construction at Madera Road and Los Angeles Avenue.

Police officers inspected vehicles for licensing and safety-related issues. One truck and two trailers were towed because the driver did not have a proper commercial license.

Other violations included improper emergency safety cables, improper tire tread, improperly adjusted brakes, and malfunctioning brake lights.
