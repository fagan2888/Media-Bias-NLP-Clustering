His rating improved in April to 49 percent, where it held in May as well, Gallup said.But in June, when reports of the National Security Agency spy program surfaced, based on documents leaked from ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, Obama's approval took another hit, averaging 47 percent and then sinking a point per month, hitting 44 percent in September, the poll showed.October's government shutdown and the disastrous rollout of Obamacare pushed the ratings slide further, Gallup said; in late October \"Obama brushed up against his own record-low approval rating of 38 percent\" from 2011, Gallup noted. He ended the month with a 43 percent average.Gallup noted a historical precedent for further decline after years of ratings drops; President George W.
