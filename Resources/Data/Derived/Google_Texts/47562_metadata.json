Almost $200 of that goes to the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the National Education Association.\n\nShe isn\u2019t required to join the union, but because of Ohio public employee law \u2014 and because Ohio isn\u2019t a right-to-work state \u2014 OEA can take mandatory \u201cfair share\u201d fees from Thompson and other teachers.\n\nAs one of 1,370 fair share payers in schools in which OEA takes mandatory fees from nonmembers, Thompson would have to pay $800 per year if she failed to take advantage of a brief mid-December to mid-January period when fair share payers can request a partial refund.\n\nThe teachers union must refund the cost of its political spending to fair share payers who formally object, but the union itself determines what spending is \u2014 or isn\u2019t \u2014 political.\n\nJust last year, OEA settled a lawsuit filed by fair share payers who disputed the way OEA and its affiliates calculated refunds for political spending.\n\nOn top of that, OEA is \u201cvery sneaky\u201d about notifying nonmembers of their rights, Thompson said. Teachers have only a month to respond to a notification easily overlooked during the holidays, and they must submit a new objection letter every year.\n\nCalling the union \u201c100 percent political\u201d and complaining that OEA\u2019s politics skew sharply left, Thompson told Ohio Watchdog many of the groups OEA funds \u201chave nothing to do with education.\u201d\n\nShe believes pressure exerted by union leaders keeps many of her peers from opting out of OEA membership. OEA had 120,255 members as of Aug. 31.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to just kind of look the other way\u201d instead of leaving the union, Thompson said. She speaks from experience.\n\n\u201cThe consequences at school are that once people figure out you are not a union person, they try to freeze you out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey try to act like you don\u2019t belong; they don\u2019t talk to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me it became personal because I realized I was paying for them to slander my husband,\u201d Thompson said. Her husband, State Rep. Andy Thompson, is one of the Ohio General Assembly\u2019s more conservative Republicans.\n\nYear in and year out, OEA is a top donor to the Ohio Democratic Party and its candidates. Direct campaign contributions are only the beginning of OEA political spending and activism.\n\nDuring the union\u2019s 2015 fiscal year ending Aug. 31, OEA donated $112,000 to leftist think tank Innovation Ohio and $20,000 to leftist think tank Policy Matters Ohio \u2014 two nonprofits that fight for higher taxes, more government spending and less school choice.\n\nThe union gave $47,000 to left-wing activist group ProgressOhio, $35,000 to tax-hike consulting group Support Ohio Schools, $10,000 to union coalition One Ohio Now and $6,500 to Plunderbund, a left-wing political blog.\n\nRELATED: Here\u2019s why union bosses hate California teacher Rebecca Friedrichs\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of conservative teachers, but OEA doesn\u2019t seem to represent conservative teachers,\u201d said Thompson, expressing particular concern over OEA\u2019s support for Planned Parenthood and its promotion of abortion as \u201creproductive rights.\u201d\n\nThompson doesn\u2019t mind paying for the local Marietta Education Association\u2019s representation in contract negotiations, but she resents the steep cost of OEA\u2019s forced fees.\n\n\u201cDoes it cost $600 per teacher to collectively bargain? That\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re fair share or a full member \u2014 they\u2019re very creative about their accounting.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the union\u2019s Ohio Schools magazine as one example of politics veiled as \u201cmember communications.\u201d Ohio Schools election guides tell teachers who to vote for, and the magazine routinely features glossy cover stories about Democratic politicians.\n\nWhen the union began sending campaign mailers attacking her husband, \u201cthat\u2019s when I got mad,\u201d Thompson explained. As a result, she became a fair share payer and joined the non-union Association of American Educators for professional development and extra liability insurance.\n\n\u201cAAE really came to my rescue and gave me moral support,\u201d she told Ohio Watchdog. And she\u2019s happy with the price tag \u2014$200 a year for membership she chose, compared to the $600 yearly tribute she\u2019s forced to pay OEA.\n\nContacted for comment, OEA failed to respond to questions about its spending.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For Jade Thompson and thousands of other Ohio educators, a narrow window for avoiding certain teachers union fees opens this month.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "For Jade Thompson and thousands of other Ohio educators, a narrow window for avoiding certain teachers union fees opens this month.", "title": "Ohio law forces teachers to fund left-wing union politics - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/oea-ohio-schools-2008-10.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-10T14:35:23+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/251584/ohio-teachers-union-politics/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "For Jade Thompson and thousands of other Ohio educators, a narrow window for avoiding certain teachers union fees opens this month.", "title": "Ohio law forces teachers to fund left-wing union politics - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/oea-ohio-schools-2008-10.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-12-17T04:00:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-10T14:35:23+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "ohio teachers, ohio education association, oea, forced unionism, forced union dues, fair share, right to work"}, "article_summary": "The union gave $47,000 to left-wing activist group ProgressOhio, $35,000 to tax-hike consulting group Support Ohio Schools, $10,000 to union coalition One Ohio Now and $6,500 to Plunderbund, a left-wing political blog.\nThe teachers union must refund the cost of its political spending to fair share payers who formally object, but the union itself determines what spending is \u2014 or isn\u2019t \u2014 political.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to just kind of look the other way\u201d instead of leaving the union, Thompson said.\nDirect campaign contributions are only the beginning of OEA political spending and activism.\nShe isn\u2019t required to join the union, but because of Ohio public employee law \u2014 and because Ohio isn\u2019t a right-to-work state \u2014 OEA can take mandatory \u201cfair share\u201d fees from Thompson and other teachers."}
