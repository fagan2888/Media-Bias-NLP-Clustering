Monday’s raw weather could bring withdrawal pains for residents who basked in summertime temperatures over the weekend.

The temperature in Denver, 50 degrees at about 1:45 p.m., comes after temperature of 79 degrees on Sunday, 80 on Saturday, and 82 on Friday.

“We have got some rain showers around, little puffs of snow making it to the ground in the heavier showers, for the most part it’s rain,” said Chad Gimmestad, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder.

A little after 3 p.m., there was sleet sighted in Castle Rock.

Temperatures are expected to drop slightly below freezing overnight in the metro area, and into the 20s on the Eastern Plains.

Northeast Colorado and much of the metro area are under a freeze warning from midnight Tuesday until 8 a.m.

“This will be the first freeze of the year for a lot of places and it is getting a little late for that,” Gimmestad said.

Temperatures are expected to climb later in the week, with highs in the 60s and on Saturday it could reach into the 70s again.

“Then we will have another weather system come through and it could be cooler on Sunday and Monday,” Gimmestad said.
