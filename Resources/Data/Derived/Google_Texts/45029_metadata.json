It won't always be measured in the number of trips I make, although I do keep coming back.\"\n\nThe American leader said effective security in Asia must be based on alliances and international law - not \"spheres of influence\" or big nations bullying the small.\n\nHe said the only real source of legitimacy is a democracy and the consent of the people.\n\nObama also announced that the United States is contributing $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to\"help developing nations deal with climate change.\"\n\nThe president said the fund will help pay for such necessities as early warning systems and stronger defenses against storm surges. It will also help farmers plant more durable crops and aid developing economies in cutting carbon emissions and investing in clean energy.\n\nThe president said it is not just governments that can fight climate change. He called on citizens, especially young people, to raise their voices, saying they deserve to live in a cleaner and healthier world.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, Asia, Economy, Science & Technology, Australia, Asia, Obama, Brisbane, U.S., global warming, G20, green climate fund, developing nations, $3 billion fund", "Author": "VOA News", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "At University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia - host city of this year's summit of Group of 20 world economic powers - president vows Washington will remain focused on the Asia-Pacific region", "title": "Obama Says America has Unique Responsibility to Lead World", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/obama-says-us-pledges-three-billion-dollars-to-developing-nations-for-global-warming-fund/2521299.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/F8D6180F-F530-4011-B2F9-E2F8DF2E3498_cx0_cy6_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/F8D6180F-F530-4011-B2F9-E2F8DF2E3498_cx0_cy6_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Obama Says America has Unique Responsibility to Lead World", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
