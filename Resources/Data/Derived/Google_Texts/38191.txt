Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) is seriously considering a White House bid â€” and the preacher's son is trying to figure out whether he feels a calling to do so.

"I spend a lot of time not just talking with people, but praying about, thinking about with my family as well whether or not eventually that might be a call to run for the presidency," WalkerThe Associated Press.

"I think you shouldn't run, unless you feel you're called to do it."

Walker recently said he wasn't interested in chairing the Republican Governors Association, a move that seems to indicate he's instead focused on a potential presidential bid.

He says he's focused on Wisconsin right now. Walker has suggested pushing through a state budget earlier than normal, another signal he might be gearing up for another campaign after winning three races in four years in swing-state Wisconsin.

"You've got to look at what are my important responsibilities because, unlike someone in any other position, unlike someone in the Congress or the Senate or any other elected position or former elected position out there, my leadership in the state is both a strength and potentially a liability," Walker said.

"If I continue to do good things, people will continue to talk about me for other offices. If somehow things aren't working for the state of Wisconsin that diminishes my ability to consider anything else."
