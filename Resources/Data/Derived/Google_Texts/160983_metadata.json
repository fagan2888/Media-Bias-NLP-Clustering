We kick off September carrying the baggage that we picked up last month \u2013 that of economic fears ignited by China. Overnight PMI numbers from the world\u2019s largest energy consumer (and second largest economy) has done little (well, nothing) to dissuade this notion. The official PMI manufacturing print came in line with consensus but showed contraction for the first time since March. Meanwhile, the Chinese manufacturing number from Caixin was just above consensus, but at a six-year low nonetheless.\n\nConcerns about China\u2019s economy has been further stoked by a huge drop in exports out of South Korea. August exports showed their sharpest fall in six years as shipments to China slumped by 8.8% on the prior year; China is its largest export destination, accounting for a quarter of South Korea\u2019s exports.\n\nRelated: Why Oil\u2019s Big Bounce Won\u2019t Last\n\nWeaker imports into China are a theme we are well aware of here at the good ship Clipper; August Chinese oil imports have dropped off considerably after being strong year-over-year for much of 2015:\n\nMoving from Asia to Europe, manufacturing data came in below consensus for both Italy and France, dragging the Eurozone print on the aggregate below expectations \u2013 despite the best efforts of Germany and a decent print from them.\n\nA bulletin from OPEC yesterday was seemingly misinterpreted by the market.

According to Reuter\u2019s John Kemp, \u2018money managers held short futures and options positions in the main U.S. crude equivalent to 157 million barrels of oil at the end of trading on Tuesday, August 25, two days before the rally\u2018.
