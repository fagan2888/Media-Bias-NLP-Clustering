But first: It's shaping up to be another rough morning for the co-op program.\n\nGOP TO USE NEW DATA TO JUMP-START OLD CO-OP ATTACKS \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee's 10 a.m. hearing today centers on Healthcare.gov, but expect Republicans to return to a previous point of attack: CMS's troubled co-op program.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA GAO report being released this morning finds that more than 500,000 Americans received coverage through co-ops that have since been discontinued. Meanwhile, four of the 11 remaining co-ops had not hit a program benchmark of enrolling at least 25,000 members. Most remain in financial trouble.\n\n\u2014 Hatch raises concerns: \"With nearly half of the co-ops now closed, the failed experiment has wasted taxpayer dollars and forced patients and families to scramble for new insurance,\" committee chair Orrin Hatch plans to say in his opening statement today. \"With so many co-ops now in financial jeopardy, I believe that CMS should work with, not against states, to safeguard taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nSCOOPLET: MAINE WARNS OF DIRE FINANCIAL STATE OF CO-OP \u2014 Maine's Bureau of Insurance warned CMS in a letter this week that local co-op Maine Community Health Options is at risk of going insolvent, Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn reports. In 2014, Maine was seemingly the strongest co-op in the country but in hindsight, it wasn't rosy. Its 2015 rates turned out to be inadequate. The bureau warned that while the co-op is trying to improve its financial status, anything could happen. The letter: http://politico.pro/1QYVihe\n\n\u2014 And Maine's insurance bureau isn't happy with CMS. The state's officials warn that there is no way for Maine to absorb the losses if the insurer were to become insolvent \u2014 the costs would be borne by providers and patients. The insurance bureau wants to place the co-op in receivership and cancel a random selection of the co-op's plans in order to reduce its costs.\n\nBut the insurance superintendent writes that CMS told him three weeks ago that doing so would violate federal law and could create a \"loophole\" that undermines the guaranteed renewability of QHPs. \"With decisions comes responsibility,\" he writes, \"because CMS's decision has precluded my ability to act as proposed, CMS now must share responsibility for the risk of an outcome we all very much hope to avoid.\"\n\n\u2014 CMS responds: Spokesman Ben Wakana tells PULSE that CMS works with state agencies to ensure the co-ops are well run. \"With respect to Maine, we proposed and supported several approaches to solving the state\u2019s concerns, but do not believe it wise for the state to take actions that would have led to 20,000 people unnecessarily losing coverage,\" he said.\n\nAND SPEAKING OF CO-OPs: LAWSUIT CENTERS ON BROKEN PROMISES \u2014 The CEO of Health Republic, the failed Oregon co-op suing the federal, government, argues that the feds broke their commitment to make sure the risk corridors would be fully funded, Adam Cancryn writes at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"[Officials] changed the rules of the game big time, and now we can't play that game anymore,\" Dawn Bonder says. \"That game we never would've entered.\"\n\nALSO BACK IN CONGRESS TODAY: TURING EXECS \u2014 Turing and Retrophin, two drug companies formerly led by Martin Shkreli, will be the focus of the Senate Aging Committee's second hearing on drug pricing. Expect some fireworks, but less media attention: Shkreli won't be testifying this time, although health care's most controversial figure has been known to tweet his thoughts from time to time. Sarah Karlin-Smith's story for Pros: http://politico.pro/2556M94\n\nOUT TODAY: COMMONWEALTH FUND REPORT ON COST-SHARING \u2014 The study confirms that the ACA's cost-sharing reductions have helped lower exchange shoppers' health costs, although the effects vary widely by market. Commonwealth's report: http://bit.ly/1ROSgZl\n\nThe sample effect \u2014 Commonwealth offers a hypothetical example of how cost-sharing reductions would reduce the median out-of-pocket costs for a 40-year-old man, which the researchers calculate would be $6,500 for a high utilizer. But because of the extra assistance, those costs would fall to\n\n\u2014 $4,949 for a man earning $25,000\n\n\u2014 $650 for a man earning $17,000\n\nTHIS IS THURSDAY PULSE \u2014 Where after Super Tuesday and Supreme Wednesday, we're settling in for a Mad Thursday.

Garland does have a slightly more extensive history ruling on issues affecting hospitals and HHS, Lisa Schencker observes at Modern Healthcare; one expert notes that Garland often sides with government agencies.\n\nDO PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES WORK? \u2014 The National Committee for Quality Assurance's Michael Barr thinks so: He points to a new Annals of Internal Medicine study that found a New York PCMH lowered hospitalizations and other utilization measures.\n\nTo be clear, the effects were modest, and Barr concedes that \"performance on the quality measures was not very impressive,\" but he argues that the practices were aiming for the utilization metrics laid out by the project organizers.\n\n\"This is a good example of what is possible from well-organized, comprehensive primary care practices when given enough time for the transformation, ongoing technical assistance, and appropriate financial incentives,\" Barr concludes.\n\n\u2014 See the study: http://bit.ly/1VdKeyF\n\n\u2014 Read NCQA's blog post: http://bit.ly/1QZ72iy\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

And in a new piece for POLITICO magazine, Darren Samuelsohn and Helena Bottemiller Evich found a still-evolving legacy that dovetails \u2014 by design \u2014 with the president\u2019s far more controversial accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act. Read the story: politico.pro/1QZJrzL\n\nMERGER FOES BRIEF HILL STAFFERS \u2014 Opponents of two pending blockbuster insurance mergers made their case on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Pro's Paul Demko reports.\n\nThe Coalition to Protect Patient Choice wants the Obama administration to block Anthem\u2019s acquisition of Cigna and Aetna\u2019s takeover of Humana. Their primary arguments: mergers are irreversible, they will decrease competition permanently, and past consolidation has led to higher prices for consumers. Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, argued that one justification insurers give for why they need to get bigger \u2014 to level the playing field with hospitals \u2014 doesn\u2019t hold water. \u201cBargaining is not a good substitute for competition,\u201d Moss said.\n\n\u2014 Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the Center for American Progress, pointed out that Aetna and Humana now directly compete for Medicare customers in more than 500 counties. That\u2019s up from just 82 counties where they competed three years earlier. That means the chief tool DOJ has utilized to preserve competition in past deals \u2014 forcing plans to sell off blocks of business \u2014 would need to be done on an unprecedented scale. \u201cComparatively it\u2019s off the charts,\u201d Spiro said. \u201cThese divestitures are really unlikely to work.\u201d\n\nMAP: ZIKA IS COMING \u2014 New research in PLOS Current Outbreaks projects the relative risk of a Zika outbreak in 50 U.S. cities, based on factors like climate and travel. In short: Bad news, Miami. Good news, Minneapolis.\n\n\u2014 Read the study: http://bit.ly/1pvC0X0\n\n\u2014 See the map of Zika risks by city: http://bit.ly/1Mos9GY\n\nWHO AMERICANS BLAME FOR THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC: OPIOID USERS AND DOCTORS \u2014 That's according to a new Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health-STAT News poll out today, where 37 percent of Americans tell pollsters that opioid users are to blame for the opioid epidemic. In contrast, 34 percent of respondents pinned the blame on doctors, 10 percent blamed pharma companies and just 7 percent blamed the FDA. http://bit.ly/255KQdZ\n\nWHICH STATES ARE SIGNING UP THE MOST OBAMACARE ELIGIBLES? \u2014 The District of Columbia has enrolled the highest percentage of people believed to be eligible for coverage on the exchanges, according to an updated analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation that includes data from 2016 open enrollment.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., 74 percent of the potential exchange population selected a plan. Florida and Maine closely follow the District, having signed up 66 percent and 65 percent, respectively. Iowa sits at the bottom of the pack, with only 22 percent signing up. Other states to see low sign-up rates include Minnesota, South Dakota, New York and Arkansas.

Diana DeGette said in a statement. Cures passed the House months ago, but the Senate has moved much more slowly on a smaller set of bills.\n\nNEW WHITE PAPER ON CHRONIC DISEASE \u2014 Out today: Recommendations from the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease on how to improve access to care, systemic innovation and more. http://bit.ly/21wovBK\n\nMAKING MOVES \u2014 Gretchen Young, senior vice president for health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, is retiring in May after six years at the organization. Joining in Young's place: James Gelfand, who has been serving as director of federal affairs at the March of Dimes, and previous worked at the Chamber of Commerce and served as counsel to Senators Olympia Snowe and Tom Coburn.\n\nTRUMP'S JOURNALISTIC MALPRACTICE? \u2014 Two different presidential candidates recently authored an op-ed with this sentence: \"Medical care in the American territories and commonwealths has historically lagged far behind the continental states, and Obamacare has only made the situation worse.\"\n\nSo who wrote it \u2014 Donald Trump or Ben Carson? Both! The Daily Caller flags how Carson's two-week-old op-ed was repackaged under Trump's name. (H/t Jason Millman)\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING by Paul Demko\n\nDoctors are increasingly finding themselves in the uncomfortable role of enforcing restrictions on opioid prescriptions for patients with chronic pain, reports the New York Times. http://nyti.ms/1Uh77Su\n\nAmericans spent $168 million on bug spray last year. That\u2019s expected to double or triple this year. The reason? Fear of Zika virus, explains the Wall Street Journal. http://on.wsj.com/1poZxbm\n\nMore than a year has passed since Liberia\u2019s Ebola outbreak began tapering off. But the stress it caused the country\u2019s health care system is allowing other diseases to flourish, STAT reports. http://bit.ly/1QZljMk\n\nStates are rewriting laws to make a drug that can be used to stop someone from dying of a heroin overdose easier to obtain, explains Stateline\u2019s Christine Vestal. http://bit.ly/1QXqEov\n\nConservative health policy analyst John Goodman explains why Republicans haven\u2019t offered a credible alternative to Obamacare in an interview with the Cato Institute\u2019s Michael Cannon. http://onforb.es/1PcZEvP\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
