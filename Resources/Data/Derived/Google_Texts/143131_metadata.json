The Defense Department\u2019s inspector general just withdrew the first successful audit of the Marine Corps. Why? The IG discovered the branch was keeping transactions in a separate suspended account that was never brought to the auditors\u2019 attention \u2013 until now.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Marine Corps became the first military branch ever to be successfully audited by the DOD\u2019s inspector general. It was an impressive feat that appeared to crack the Pentagon\u2019s decades-long failure to balance their books.\n\nRelated: With $8.5 Trillion Unaccounted for, Why Should Congress Increase Defense Budget?\n\nChuck Hagel, then Secretary of Defense, congratulated the Marines and touted them as an example of the Pentagon\u2019s commitment to fiscal discipline by the 2017 goal. \u201cThis development marks an important milestone on the path to achieving greater accountability \u2026 and more effective management of the defense enterprise writ large,\u201d Hagel said in a statement back then.\n\nAuditors, however, have obtained new information about separate U.S. Treasury accounts with Marine Corps transactions that were not included earlier.\n\nAuditors said these accounts temporarily hold transactions that aren\u2019t counted against appropriations. When the IG first did its review, it didn\u2019t know the Marine Corps had transactions suspended in these accounts. Now the IG said it \u201crecently obtained evidence\u201d suggesting otherwise. It\u2019s unclear why auditors were not made aware of these accounts during their initial investigation.\n\nRelated: Congress Wants to Teach Defense How to Buy Weapons\n\nThe deputy inspector general for auditing, Daniel Blair, has promised a revised audit based on the new information.\n\nDOD is still hanging onto its goal of being successfully audited by 2017.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Talk about embarrassing.", "title": "The Dirty Truth About the Marines\u2019 Clean Audit", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/24/Dirty-Truth-About-Marines-Clean-Audit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09262013_US_Marines_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/24/Dirty-Truth-About-Marines-Clean-Audit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09262013_US_Marines_0.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Talk about embarrassing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Defense Department\u2019s inspector general just withdrew the first successful audit of the Marine Corps.\nAuditors, however, have obtained new information about separate U.S. Treasury accounts with Marine Corps transactions that were not included earlier.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Marine Corps became the first military branch ever to be successfully audited by the DOD\u2019s inspector general.\nWhen the IG first did its review, it didn\u2019t know the Marine Corps had transactions suspended in these accounts.\nRelated: Congress Wants to Teach Defense How to Buy WeaponsThe deputy inspector general for auditing, Daniel Blair, has promised a revised audit based on the new information."}
