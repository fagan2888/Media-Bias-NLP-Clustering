Thad Cochran and state Sen. Chris McDaniel. After McDaniel\u2019s fervent supporters paced him to a narrow win in the primary, Cochran took a narrow victory in a runoff with the help of Democrats and cruised to an easy victory in the general election.\n\nThe race showed a stark divide between the state\u2019s GOP power base and the insurgent tea party.\n\nFrank Corder, editor of the political blog Y\u2019all Politics and a former Pascagoula city councilman, told Mississippi Watchdog via email he thinks this election cycle won\u2019t be as rancorous. With the GOP holding a 31-20 advantage in the state Senate and a 65-57 majority in the state House, the potential to gain seats will be predicated on the party healing its wounds.\n\n\u201cThe vitriol we saw this year isn\u2019t likely to roll over into 2015 with the same fervor as was propagated in 2014 in large part because the out-of-state interests will not be as prevalent and the questionable antics from those in state have been largely discredited and disavowed,\u201d Corder said. \u201cAdd in the positive, conservative record of Legislative Republicans and the \u2018Cochran-ing\u2019 (running to the right of an incumbent) of most just will not find any real traction.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s election is crucial. Voters will cast ballots for the entire Legislature, the governor and other crucial statewide offices. One ballot initiative \u2014 to fully fund the complex school funding equation known as the Mississippi Adequate Education Program \u2014 is likely to be on the ballot and give state Democrats a ready-made issue. While the GOP has increased K-12 spending in the past three budget cycles and passed a teacher pay increase last year, the increase isn\u2019t enough to quell the critics.\n\nCorder has some ideas on where the GOP-led Legislature should get to work when the session starts in January that will provide a positive springboard to campaign season. One of the biggest is reforming the flawed MAEP formula, which was passed in 1997 and is also the subject of a lawsuit by school districts, led by former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove.\n\n\u201cAddressing PERS (Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Mississippi) and giving taxpayers a break should be on the agenda,\u201d Corder said. \u201cSchool choice is another area where Republicans have excelled. Providing parents with educational options is worth commending. I do hope they go further and require all school boards to be elected and all superintendents to be appointed. I\u2019m also of the opinion that the MAEP formula needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\nAnother potential issue for the 2015 state elections is Medicaid expansion. Gov. Phil Bryant has stressed that he does not support Medicaid expansion because the threat of the U.S. Congress doing away with the Affordable Care Act or altering it could possibly leave the state with the bill for thousands of new patients on Medicaid.\n\nCosts are already increasing for the state. Bryant asked for a 14.7 percent increase over last year\u2019s allocation for Medicaid, the first time in the state\u2019s history that particular budget outlay exceeded $1 billion.\n\nDemocrats have argued the governor is passing up free money from the federal government, which already provides more than 40 percent of the state\u2019s budget. The issue might be one of the key battlegrounds on which control of the Legislature pivots.\n\n\u201cA great deal of time and effort has gone into fighting the expansion of a broken Medicaid system that will further reduce access to health care services, especially in rural areas of our state,\u201d Keith Plunkett, a Republican political and policy consultant and a communication strategist in Mississippi, said in an email to Mississippi Watchdog. \u201cThat fight will continue again in 2015. But it\u2019s one that we need to have.\n\n\u201cHealth care in Mississippi is only as good as the ability of doctors to treat patients. I hope that officials in 2015 will begin talking about the root causes of that crisis instead of looking at it as purely a financial consideration for hospital administrations.\u201d\n\nGet regular updates on Mississippi through our Facebook or Twitter accounts", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Mississippi Republicans will face several key issues going into statewide elections in 2015.", "title": "Mississippi Republicans face key issues in 2015 statewide elections - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/Trifecta-photo-illustration.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-10T07:37:36+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/184996/mississippi-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "published_time": "2014-11-28T04:00:58+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mississippi.watchdog", "section": "Budget and Spending", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T07:37:36+00:00", "tag": "Budget + Tax,Chris McDaniel,Democrats,GOP,Legislature,Mississippi,Mississippi legislature,PERS,phil bryant,Thad Cochran"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Mississippi Republicans will face several key issues going into statewide elections in 2015.", "title": "Mississippi Republicans face key issues in 2015 statewide elections - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/Trifecta-photo-illustration.jpg"}, "creator": "@Gulfcoastsage", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Mississippi Republicans will face several key issues going into statewide elections in 2015."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b9d\"", "article_summary": "By Steve Wilson | Mississippi WatchdogSince 2012, Mississippi Republicans have been in charge of both houses of the Legislature and the governor\u2019s seat.\nThe race showed a stark divide between the state\u2019s GOP power base and the insurgent tea party.\nI\u2019m also of the opinion that the MAEP formula needs to be addressed.\u201dAnother potential issue for the 2015 state elections is Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cAddressing PERS (Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Mississippi) and giving taxpayers a break should be on the agenda,\u201d Corder said.\n\u201cHealth care in Mississippi is only as good as the ability of doctors to treat patients."}
