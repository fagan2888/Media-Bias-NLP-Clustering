A group of moms openly carrying babies and petitions, or a rally of men and women openly carrying loaded semiautomatic rifles? According to Target, it\u2019s the moms. Our volunteers in San Antonio were supposedly asked to leave because Target provides a \u2018distraction free\u2019 shopping environment. I don\u2019t know about you, but I think the open carry of loaded semiautomatic rifles in Target stores and parking lots is pretty distracting when I\u2019m out shopping with my kids.
