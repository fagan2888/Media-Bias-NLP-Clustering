On Friday, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sent a letter to young woman, urging her to \u201creflect\u201d on the attack and stop hunting.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be a good opportunity to put yourself in the place of the individuals you and the rest of your hunting party were trying to kill,\u201d the letter read. \u201cAs terrifying as it must have been to be attacked by a bear, please consider the frightening and painful experiences that hunters set out to impose upon animals.\u201d\n\nAlicia Woempner, a PETA special projects division manager and the author of the letter, wished Bomboy a quick recovery before explaining that animals form strong bonds with their offspring. She also pointed out that sometimes animals aren\u2019t killed outright by hunters, but must suffer long, painful deaths.\n\n\u201cNow that you\u2019ve experienced the horror of an attack \u2014 although this one was in self-defense \u2014 we hope you will choose to enjoy nature in only nonviolent ways,\u201d the letter closed.\n\nThe bear attacked Bomboy on her family\u2019s farm. The 18-year-old almost lost an ear and suffered bites to her arms and shoulders before her stepfather was able to fire his rifle and scare the animal off. Bomboy has no intention of giving up hunting.\n\n(h/t The Blaze)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "There are tactful responses to tragedy \u2014 and then there's the letter PETA sent to a Pennsylvania hunter who got mauled by a bear.", "title": "PETA instructs hunter mauled by bear to \"enjoy nature in only...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/12/15/peta-instructs-hunter-mauled-by-bear-to-enjoy-nature-in-only-nonviolent-ways-in-the-future/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "young-girl-attacked-by-bear", "published_time": "2013-12-15T21:10:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-15T21:13:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "There are tactful responses to tragedy \u2014 and then there\u2019s the letter PETA sent to a Pennsylvania hunter who got mauled by a bear.\nThe bear attacked Bomboy on her family\u2019s farm.\nOn Friday, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sent a letter to young woman, urging her to \u201creflect\u201d on the attack and stop hunting.\nCamille Bomboy, 18, recently survived being attacked by a mother bear last Monday while she was out hunting with her stepdad, according to local news station WTAJ.\n\u201cNow that you\u2019ve experienced the horror of an attack \u2014 although this one was in self-defense \u2014 we hope you will choose to enjoy nature in only nonviolent ways,\u201d the letter closed."}
