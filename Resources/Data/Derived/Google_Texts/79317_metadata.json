REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n4946744\n\nRepublican congressional leadership introduced a bill Thursday aimed at blocking a proposed overtime rule that could cause unnecessary stress on businesses.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has sought to change federal regulations so more workers can qualify for overtime. The Department of Labor (DOL) has put forth a proposal to expand overtime, but opponents argue it disregards how much stress it will cause businesses. Republicans have introduced legislation that would require the department to rewrite its proposal with businesses in mind.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s decision to drastically redefine overtime will hurt our workforce and our employers,\u201d Republican Sen. Tim Scott said in a statement. \u201cIt will lead to reduced hours, confusion for job creators, and will limit growth opportunities for employees.\u201d\n\nThe rule change would essentially increase the salary threshold so people can qualify for overtime. For example, managers cannot get overtime if they make $23,660 annually, but the proposed rule would raise the threshold to $52,000. The change could make an additional five million workers eligible for overtime. Labor unions assert the change is a much needed update to federal law.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama recognizes that the current rules are out of date and too weak to protect working men and women, so we are pleased that these improvements are moving forward,\u201d AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. \u201cThese worker protections have been decades in the making. It\u2019s time to push these rules over the finish line.\u201d\n\nCritics claim the rule will cause a lot of unintended consequences due to the added costs of labor it puts on businesses \u2014 employers could be forced to reduce worker hours or limit salaried positions. The Partnership to Protect Workplace Opportunity (PPWO) notes a lot of the problems could have been avoided if the department did a better job considering concerns from the business community.\n\n\u201cThe department did convene a number of listening sessions where businesses could express their concerns,\u201d PPWO Spokeswoman Lisa Horn told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cHowever, none of the concerns that were presented during the listening sessions made it into the proposal.\u201d\n\nHorn adds she is unaware of any nonprofits that were given the opportunity to express concerns. The president signed a memo March 2014 compelling the DOL to increase the exemption threshold. The department released its proposed rule change June 30 but provided businesses and lawmakers only sixty days to comment.\n\nRepublicans also issued a stern letter to federal labor officials Feb. 9 expressing their concerns. The letter was signed by 112 Republicans, while Democratic Representatives Collin Peterson and Brad Ashford also signed. Lawmakers have also hosted numerous hearings so businesses and experts could actually express their views.\n\nThe DOL did not respond to a request for comment by TheDCNF.\n\nFollow Connor on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
