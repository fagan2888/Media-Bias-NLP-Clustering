Median overall survival in the Onconova intent-to-treat group was 8.2 months, compared to 5.8 months in the best supportive care arm. Because of an extremely high p-value (0.27), there's a strong possibility that chance rather than medical benefit from rigosertib was involved in these results, making this 2.4 month difference not statistically significant.\n\nIf there was a bit of sunshine on this cloudy day, it's that a post-hoc analysis showed that a smaller subset of patients who had not responded to HMAs demonstrated a median overall survival of 8.5 months versus 4.7 months in the BSC arm. These results were statistically significant with a low p-value and a hazard ratio of 0.67, implying a 33% reduction in death risk while taking rigosertib.\n\nNow what: There's certainly not a lot of positives that can be taken from yesterday's phase 3 results. The saving grace here might be that post-hoc analysis which is unlikely to result in rigosertib being scrapped in its entirety for high-risk MDS. However, Onconova can kiss a larger indication for secondary treatment to MDS goodbye for higher-risk patients. There's still a chance rigosertib performs better in low-risk patients, for which midstage studies are ongoing, but I wouldn't hold your breath. The real concern here is that if rigosertib proves to be a wash, Onconova has only two other ongoing early stage clinical studies. The remainder of its pipeline is preclinical in nature, meaning the company could still have additional downside left in its share price.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:01", "date": "2014-02-20T18:01:00Z", "description": "Onconova Therapeutics reported disappointing phase 3 results for high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome drug rigosertib.
