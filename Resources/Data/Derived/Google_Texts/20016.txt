Family members of a badly burned 13-year-old from Burleson told reporting partner KXAS-TV (NBC5) that the boy has suffered a major setback.

“He was alert, he was awake, talking a little bit, eating and everything – and then, he went into cardiac arrest,” said Donna Russell, aunt of Cameron Russell.

Cameron was one of four boys, including his older brother, burned on the evening before Thanksgiving. Investigators say they were playing with gasoline in a backyard.
