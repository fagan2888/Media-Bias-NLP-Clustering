(Open Road Integrated Media via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Rick Moody is finally letting \u201cThe Ice Storm\u201d and some of his other previous works come out as e-books.\n\nElectronic editions of four of Moody\u2019s books went on sale Tuesday, released by digital publisher Open Road Integrated Media. Besides \u201cThe Ice Storm,\u201d the other books include the novel \u201cPurple America,\u201d the memoir \u201cThe Black Veil\u201d and the short fiction collection \u201cThe Ring of Brightest Angels Around Heaven.\u201d In a recent email, Moody told The Associated Press he had been reluctant to grant electronic rights because most publishers treated the e-editions as \u201can ancillary part of the lives of my books.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never comfortable, in the past, with how people were talking about the e-books of my backlist, and thus my delay,\u201d Moody wrote.\n\nOpen Road was co-founded in 2009 by former HarperCollins CEO Jane Friedman and now has some 10,000 electronic books in its catalog, from Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d to Pat Conroy\u2019s \u201cThe Prince of Tides.\u201d\n\nMoody declined to discuss financial details, although Open Road is known for offering 50 percent royalties on e-book sales, double what traditional publishers usually offer.\n\n\u201cTheir approach is very much about writers and writing, and they are unencumbered by traditional thinking about how to connect readers with literature,\u201d Moody told the AP. \u201cBest of all, their list is remarkable. It would be hard to think of another publisher that has been as aggressive and forward-thinking about literature in the digital age, and with such great taste.\u201d\n\nMoody, 54, is best known for \u201cThe Ice Storm,\u201d the 1994 novel about a pair of troubled suburban families in 1970s Connecticut that became a feature film starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. The book is part of Open Road\u2019s \u201cIconics\u201d series, which includes \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d Erica Jong\u2019s \u201cFear of Flying\u201d and dozens of other notable works.\n\nTuesday was also the release date for Moody\u2019s new novel, \u201cHotels of North America,\u201d published by Little, Brown and Co.\n\n\u2014 Written by Hillel Italie\n\n___\n\nOnline: http://www.openroadmedia.com/\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/12/e-edition-out-for-rick-moodys-the-ice-storm/", "article_author_name": "Associated Press", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Books-Rick-Moody_Jank-e1453999892895.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Connecticut, e-books, Rick Moody, The Ice Storm"}, "description": "Rick Moody is finally letting \"The Ice Storm\" and some of his other previous works come out as e-books.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Books-Rick-Moody_Jank-e1453999892895.jpg"}, "keywords": "the ice storm,rick moody,connecticut,e-books", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "E-edition out for Rick Moody\u2019s \u2018The Ice Storm\u2019Printed from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/12/e-edition-out-for-rick-moodys-the-ice-storm/This photo provided by Open Road Integrated Media shows the cover of the book, \"The Ice Storm,\" by author Rick Moody.\n(Open Road Integrated Media via AP)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Rick Moody is finally letting \u201cThe Ice Storm\u201d and some of his other previous works come out as e-books.\nElectronic editions of four of Moody\u2019s books went on sale Tuesday, released by digital publisher Open Road Integrated Media.\nElectronic editions of four of Moody\u2019s books went on sale Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, released by the digital publisher Open Road Integrated Media.\nThe book is part of Open Road\u2019s \u201cIconics\u201d series, which includes \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d Erica Jong\u2019s \u201cFear of Flying\u201d and dozens of other notable works."}
