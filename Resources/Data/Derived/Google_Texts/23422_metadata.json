Mark Penn,\u201d by Annie Karni: \u201cThe controversial consigliere of Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign, ... who also served as Bill Clinton\u2019s longtime pollster, ... is teaching a graduate course at George Washington University, \u2018Interpreting and Strategizing with Polls,\u2019 where he currently has his students crafting polls and memos addressing the question of how Clinton should position herself in what so far is shaping up to be an outsider\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cWith his class, Penn is testing a few hypotheses -- first, that the country is not only ready but willing to elect a president who emphasizes women\u2019s rights. It\u2019s a premise that runs counter to how he ran Clinton\u2019s 2008 race, where he pushed for presenting her as a strong leader and downplaying any focus on gender. The class is also polling the idea that despite the current state of the race ... voters still want a leader with experience. \u2018You want to play into the fact that's she's not an outsider,\u2019 Penn advised.\n\n\u201cStanding at the head of the class, he scrolled through two more hypotheses lit up on an overhead projector in front of the room: \u2018Hillary\u2019s greatest weakness is lack of compassion and reliability, she has less warmth, but has competency and experience,\u2019 he read off the screen, and \u2018though the email scandal has damaged trustworthiness, her perceived ability to do the job remains intact.\u2019 ...\n\n\u201cPenn so far has refrained from weighing in on the 2016 race. ... But Penn has maintained the trust of the Clintons, who still value his advice and have a decades-long relationship with him -- a contrast to Clinton\u2019s current pollster Joel Benenson, who came to the campaign from President Obama\u2019s orbit. Penn has even popped up in Clinton\u2019s released emails, dispensing advice she appears to listen to and pass on to aides.\u201d http://politi.co/1jX1YzD\n\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX\n\nINSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- \u201cRand Paul\u2019s all-too-familiar campaign: The Kentucky senator was supposed to create a new GOP coalition. Instead, he\u2019s running a campaign that looks a lot like his father\u2019s,\u201d by Daniel Strauss: \u201cPaul\u2019s campaign is buried in the polls, unable to break single digits, and subject to calls that it\u2019s time for him to leave the race. While he\u2019s raking in dollars from small donors, he\u2019s not raising nearly enough to compete with the top tier candidates. What\u2019s worse, Paul\u2019s map is contracting, not expanding \u2013 his best prospects for victory appear to be in low-turnout caucus states where a small core of committed supporters can carry the day.\u201d http://politi.co/1PnYMc4\n\nJACK SHAFER, \u201cBernie Sanders vs. the Lamestream Media: The 2016 candidate\u2019s criticism of the press is central to the way the socialist sees the world\u201d: \u201cTuesday\u2019s first-of-the-season Democratic debate is unlikely to be what Bernie Sanders thinks it should be ... [T]hat\u2019s because the media is running the debate\u2014and the media\u2019s chief goal, he believes, is to create a \u2018nation of morons.\u2019 ... In his view, the media tends to trivialize the important issues if it covers them at all. It wants to cover campaign fights, not campaign debates. It over-relies on entertaining soundbites. Its news agenda is about generating profits, not producing quality journalism that will \u2018educate\u2019 the voters.\u201d http://politi.co/1PnYYIw\n\nREVISE AND EXTEND: Lanny Davis phones with \u201can apology and an explanation\u201d for his remarks on 2016 Dems that were overhead on Amtrak by The Daily Beast\u2019s Betsy Woodruff and quoted in Playbook: \u201cThis was a private conversation, with snippets taken out of context. I was very chagrined, and am in agony because of this. I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders, and he\u2019s entitled to change his positions. I say on TV all that time that I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders.\n\n\u201cI would never criticize someone for changing their positions: God knows we all have changed positions. I didn\u2019t call him \u2018a flip-flopper\u2019 \u2013 I may have said that\u2019s a term people use when you change positions.\n\n\u201cI never called Vice President Biden \u2018a buffoon\u2019 \u2013 I may have said other people sometimes say that, because of his gaffes. What I said has nothing to do with the Hillary campaign. I\u2019m just a friend. Please say I emphasized that: I\u2019m a friend, not part of the campaign. I\u2019m completely on my own as a supporter and longtime friend.\u201d\n\nBREAKING \u2013 \u201cIran says verdict reached on Washington Post correspondent,\u201d by WashPost\u2019s Carol Morello: \u201cAn Iranian judiciary spokesman said Sunday that a verdict has been reached in the espionage case of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, though he offered no details and it was uncertain what the verdict is and whether there is a sentence. ... His closed-door trial on espionage and related charges ended two months ago.\u201d http://wapo.st/1VM2UaZ\n\nLATE-NIGHT BEST: \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cold open takes on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Debbie Wasserman Schultz http://bit.ly/1LdMJsA\n\nMOOD MUSIC -- AP\u2019s Stephen Ohlemacher, for Monday papers: \u201cFor just the third time in 40 years, millions of Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees can expect no increase in benefits next year, unwelcome news for more than one-fifth of the nation\u2019s population. They can blame low gas prices, which are dragging down inflation, the measurement used for the cost-of-living adjustment.\u201d http://bit.ly/1WUX44a\n\n** Presented by Chevron: Doers in Washington, D.C., help make this nation great -- and all of that doing deserves distinction.

Whites without college experience include disproportionate numbers of nonvoters whose abstention in 2012 ... produced Obama\u2019s Electoral College victory.\n\n\u201cThe Cruz campaign\u2019s substantial investment in data scientists serves what [Cruz chief strategist Jason] Johnson calls \u2018behavioral micro-targeting,\u2019 changing behavior as well as gathering opinions. If a person drives a Ford F-150 and subscribes to Guns & Ammo, he probably is conservative. The challenge is to make him a voter by directing to him a package of three- or four-issue appeals tailored to him.\u201d http://wapo.st/1LAeOcY\n\n--WashPost A5, \u201cAs Paul struggles in polls, Cruz moves to pick up libertarians: But for some, the Texan\u2019s religious zeal is cause for caution,\u201d by Katie Zezima in Nashua, N.H.: \u201cCruz tailored his speech ... in New Hampshire [libertarian] voters. He took a less hawkish tone when discussing foreign policy ... Cruz praised the liberty movement as an \u2018amazing thing\u2019 and ... promoted a bill he co-sponsored to end the bulk collection of phone metadata ...\n\n\u201cPaul gave an animated speech here and appeared to be in his comfort zone, ... labeling a just-passed bill that temporarily funds the government \u2018a bunch of crap\u2019 and the body itself \u2018impotent and inconsequential.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m embarrassed that I\u2019m even a part of it,\u2019 said Paul, sporting a bright-blue belt with the University of Kentucky\u2019s logo on it. Paul played down the threat from Cruz. \u2018Both here and Iowa, we know where our support is and where my dad\u2019s support was, and we feel comfortable that the overwhelming majority of it is with us.\u2019\u201d http://wapo.st/1R5w8e6\n\n2016 PLAYERS: Nathaniel Meyersohn starts Thursday as South Carolina deputy comms director for Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign.

On Friday, ... he held his 29th town-hall ... in New Hampshire. The town halls are among the best shows in New Hampshire this fall ... He is ... blunt, humorous and often windy ... answers are long, discursive and sometimes repetitive. The town-hall meetings can last up to two hours.

One might call this boring or robotic, but the Rubio team sees it as consistent and disciplined.
