At 68, the longtime family doctor still maintains his license to practice in 13 states and is itching to continue doing what he loves.\n\n\u201cI have my interests, but the point is many of us \u2026 still have the skills and expertise and enjoy the practice of medicine,\u201d Herzberg said.\n\nIt is Herzberg and medical professionals like him that a San Francisco physician named Laurie Green had in mind when she conceived and co-founded the Maven Project. Her goal was to harness the energy and talent of volunteer physicians, particularly those who are retired, to help solve some of health care\u2019s most vexing issues: the lack of access to both primary and specialty medical care in under-served areas and a growing need for health services, spurred in part by having more people covered under the federal health law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we can create a community to try to replace what you lose when you step back from practice or academia,\u201d said Green, a gynecologist.\n\nThe Maven Project is an acronym for the aptly named Medical Alumni Volunteer Expert Network. It relies on medical school alumni groups to recruit a national network of experts to lend their expertise, using telemedicine technology, to doctors and their patients in remote areas of the nation that lack that expert knowledge. Essentially, the technology would put these experts into the room.\n\nGreen, former president of the Harvard Medical School Alumni Association, came up with the idea after realizing that many of this country\u2019s retired and semiretired physicians \u2014 about 250,000 in total \u2014 want to stay active without the hassle of running their own practices.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to go to Guatemala or Africa to volunteer if you\u2019re over 60,\u201d said Green, who serves as Maven\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cMeanwhile, there\u2019s a massive need here in America.\u201d\n\nGrowing needs\n\nThe medical needs of an aging Baby Boom generation, population growth in general and the federal Affordable Care Act that expanded health coverage to more Americans have combined to increase demand for health services while, at the same time, the number of doctors is dwindling mostly because of retirement. Nurses and other health professionals can help but not replace the expertise of physicians.\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges predicts doctor shortfalls of up to 31,100 primary care doctors and 63,700 specialists by 2025. Meanwhile, 31 percent of practicing U.S physicians are age 60 or older, according to a study published this year in the Journal of Medical Regulation.\n\nThe Maven Project is not the first effort to tap into the underutilized potential of retired physicians. Individual health centers and organizations such as Volunteers in Medicine, a South Carolina nonprofit that has opened more than 100 free clinics in 29 states during the past 18 years, draw on both active and retired health professionals to staff local centers.\n\nAmy Hamlin, Volunteers in Medicine\u2019s executive director, said a national network based on the use of telemedicine could fulfill many unmet health needs. \u201cLeave it to California to come up with the idea \u2014 the technology megacenter of the world,\u201d Hamlin said.\n\nPhysician recruitment for the Maven Project is well under way and the group plans to start a pilot project at three clinics next month, two in Massachusetts and one in Yuba City (Sutter County). The Massachusetts clinics have received a donated telemedicine software program and Yuba City\u2019s Ampla Health will use its existing system.\n\n\u201cWe have the clinics. We have volunteers now. We need to make sure everything with the volunteers goes smoothly \u2026 and we\u2019re working out logistics on the technology side,\u201d said Lisa Carron Shmerling, Maven Project executive director.\n\nHundreds of potential volunteers from Harvard, Stanford, Tufts, UCSF and other medical schools and training programs have expressed interest in Maven\u2019s program.\n\nPlenty of interest\n\nDr. Ken Bermudez, president of the alumni association at UCSF and a practicing reconstructive and cosmetic plastic surgeon in San Francisco, said he\u2019s had no trouble generating interest among his colleagues. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a negative response,\u201d he said.\n\nThe project helps provide affordable medical malpractice insurance and works with doctors to ensure they meet the proper licensing requirements in their states, Shmerling said. Some states even offer a special license for retired physicians.\n\nActive physicians, not just those who have retired, can volunteer their time and expertise to help colleagues in areas that lack specialists.\n\nAt 45, Dr. Rick Loftus, a UCSF Medical School alumnus, wants to offer his experience as an HIV specialist even if he doesn\u2019t have many hours to give.\n\nLoftus, director of the internal medicine residency program at Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Springs, also works at a free clinic in the Coachella Valley. \u201cIt's not just a job for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take an oath and recognize we have a role in society.\u201d\n\nFor Herzberg, who practiced for 33 years in Sonoma County, the project offers him the opportunity to combine his growing interest in telemedicine with his love of working in the safety-net clinics.\n\n\u201cAs a volunteer, you have a lot of freedom and the motivation is internal, not external,\u201d he said. \u201cI am anxious to do some work and I\u2019m anxious to do this kind of work.\u201d\n\nVictoria Colliver is\n\na San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
