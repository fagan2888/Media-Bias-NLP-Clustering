Kimberly Bay.\n\nBay said the driver of a 1997 Ford F-150 was eastbound on East 32nd Street, where he had a stop sign at Harrison. He emerged from his stop and began to cross Harrison, and Thorpe, who had no stop sign, collided with the truck. He was transported to Banner University Medical Center with life-threatening injuries and died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Next of kin have been notified.\n\nThe driver of the truck remained at the scene and was cited for \"failure to yield from a stop sign\" and \"collision causing death by a moving violation.\"\n\nInvestigators said speed and alcohol do not appear to be factors in the collision, according to Bay.\n\nCopyright 2015.
