1. A split Senate panel backs a Syria strike

The Senate on Wednesday took the first step toward approving a military strike to punish Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons.

The full Senate is expected to vote next week. A similar proposal faces stiff opposition in the House. [New York Times]

9. Studies explore ObamaCare health premiums

Two independent studies released this week give an early look at how much Americans will pay for health care under the Affordable Care Act.

10. Yahoo gives its logo a makeover

Yahoo unveiled a new logo intended to reflect the internet pioneer's new image under CEO Marissa Mayer. Mayer herself helped design the new logo, and described the process in a post — titled "Geeking out on the new logo" — on Yahoo's newly acquired Tumblr site.
