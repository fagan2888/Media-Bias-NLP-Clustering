Bush, said the administration does not have the power to spend money on \"cost sharing reduction payments\" to insurers without an appropriation from Congress.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt issue are billions of dollars paid to insurance companies participating in ObamaCare so they can reduce customers' out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles for low-income people.\n\nCollyer's decision doesn't immediately go into effect, however, so that the administration can appeal it.\n\nThe House GOP argued that the administration was unconstitutionally spending money on these payments without Congress's approval.\n\nBut the administration said it did not need an appropriation from Congress because the funds were already guaranteed by the healthcare reform law in the same section as its better-known tax credits that help people pay for coverage.\n\nCollyer ruled that the section only appropriated funds for tax credits and said the cost sharing reductions require a separate congressional appropriation, which the administration does not currently have.\n\n\u201cSuch an appropriation cannot be inferred,\u201d Collyer wrote. \u201cNone of Secretaries\u2019 extra-textual arguments \u2014 whether based on economics, \u2018unintended\u2019 results, or legislative history \u2014 is persuasive. The Court will enter judgment in favor of the House of Representatives and enjoin the use of unappropriated monies to fund reimbursements due to insurers under Section 1402.\u201d\n\nUnlike previous ObamaCare lawsuits, this one is not expected to deal a crippling blow to the law if Republicans ultimately prevail.\n\nstudy from the Urban Institute found that a GOP victory would force insurers to make a major adjustment and hike premiums, but government subsidies would increase to help make up the difference and the system would likely not face major negative consequences.\n\nStill, the case adds a major element of uncertainty to a healthcare system trying to adapt to ObamaCare.\n\n\"This is not the first time that we've seen opponents of the Affordable Care Act go through the motions to try to win this political fight in the court system,\" said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. Earnest said Republicans are trying to \"refight a political fight that they keep losing. They've been losing this fight for six years, and they'll lose it again.\"\n\nHe added the lawsuit is unprecedented in terms of its effect on the constitutional separation of powers.\n\n\"This suit represents the first time in our nation's history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute,\" he said.\n\nThe challenge arose out of a broader focus on Republicans\u2019 objections to President Obama\u2019s use of executive power in 2014 and amid talk of impeaching the president.\n\nMany experts doubted it would go forward, given that it could be dismissed if a judge decided the House had no legal standing to sue.\n\nBut Collyer ruled that the House was directly affected by the administration\u2019s actions and could proceed.\n\nThe standing issue could still come up in a higher court when the case is appealed.\n\nJordan Fabian contributed.\n\nUpdated at 2:56 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The judge ruled against the Obama administration.", "description": "The judge ruled against the Obama administration.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The judge ruled against the Obama administration.", "title": "Judge rules for House GOP in ObamaCare suit", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/279695-judge-rules-for-house-gop-in-obamacare-suit", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamacare101615_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-12T14:57:22-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-12T14:57-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/279695-judge-rules-for-house-gop-in-obamacare-suit", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-12T12:21-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama,Paul Ryan,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-12T12:21:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-12T14:57:22-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/279695-judge-rules-for-house-gop-in-obamacare-suit", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The judge ruled against the Obama administration.", "card": "summary", "title": "Judge rules for House GOP in ObamaCare suit"}, "dcterms.title": "Judge rules for House GOP in ObamaCare suit"}, "article_summary": "A federal judge on Thursday ruled in favor of House Republicans in their lawsuit against the Obama administration over ObamaCare.\nThe House GOP argued that the administration was unconstitutionally spending money on these payments without Congress's approval.\nMany experts doubted it would go forward, given that it could be dismissed if a judge decided the House had no legal standing to sue.\nStill, the case adds a major element of uncertainty to a healthcare system trying to adapt to ObamaCare.\nBut Collyer ruled that the House was directly affected by the administration\u2019s actions and could proceed."}
