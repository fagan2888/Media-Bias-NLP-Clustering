No one is more deserving of the distinction than Harriet Tubman. Yet why was Andrew Jackson depicted our $20 in the first place? How did average Americans perceive him? Why was he relevant?\n\nOne-time New York Mayor Phillip Hone called Jackson \u201cthe most popular man we have ever known.\u201d Famed 19th century biographer James Parton confirmed Jackson was once the most famous man in America:\n\n\u201cHis faults were such as a majority of Americans could easily forgive. His virtues were such as a majority of Americans could warmly admire. It is this fact that renders him historically interesting. Columbus sailed. Franklin lived. Washington fought. Jefferson wrote. Fifty years passed, the population of the country quadrupled, and the result was that the people of the U.S. arrived at the capacity of honoring Andrew Jackson before all other men.\u201d\n\nIn recent comparison, Jackson\u2019s celebrity would be like mixing John Kennedy with Ronald Reagan, and adding Dwight Eisenhower because he was a world-famous war hero. Jackson saved America in one of its most desperate hours: the Battle of New Orleans, ending the War of 1812, was the last time our country was invaded by a foreign army. Jackson was an icon. Americans never worshiped Alexander Hamilton like they worshiped Jackson. He was our first American idol.\n\nA young New York senator, Martin Van Buren, saw potential in Jackson\u2019s political capital: \u201cHis election as the result of his military services \u2026 would be one thing. His election as the result of a combined political party \u2026 might be another, far different thing.\u201d Van Buren was the producer who nudged Jackson onto the stage. Thus the Democratic Party was born. Our political traditions, our two-party system, our contested primaries, caucuses and conventions, were unwittingly created.\n\nNothing we are witnessing in this 2016 election is new. It seems new to us, but it\u2019s not new to our country. Our lives are just too short, too hectic to notice this eerie, repeating pattern. Life is cyclical. The same characters and scenarios keep reappearing on our political stage as our nation evolves. In 200 years, technology has changed; human nature has not.\n\nAmid this $20 debate, Tubman and Jackson have become rallying symbols for liberals and conservatives alike. These two people have been reduced to labels, their stories spun for today\u2019s political arguments.\n\nJackson is labeled a villainous monster, an evil slave owner, and a cruel, inhumane Indian killer. In 1833, attorney Philo Goodwin published a biography of Jackson saying that \u201cno man\u2019s character\u201d has been more misunderstood. \u201cMany, on becoming acquainted with him, have admitted their previous opinions\u201d of Jackson were a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nJackson owned some 150 slaves. Yet George Washington owned approximately 318 slaves, Thomas Jefferson over 600, James Monroe between 30 and 40, and James Madison nearly 100. Even Hamilton\u2019s ledgers show slave purchase records \u201cfor himself and others.\u201d Does owning one slave or 600 make slavery any more or less a sin?\n\nNative American removal is one of the most dreadful, despicable stains on America\u2019s story. Jackson\u2019s name is on the Indian Removal Act, but it was not his idea. Van Buren helped execute the law. Presidents John Tyler and James K. Polk voted for the bill while in Congress, and although James Buchanan abstained, he did not vote against the bill.\n\nIndian removal is the fault of multiple generations, our own forefathers and foremothers. While president, Thomas Jefferson actually wrote Jackson in 1803 about Indian removal, saying the Louisiana Purchase \u201cwill open an asylum for these unhappy people (the Indians), in a country which may suit their habits of life better than what they now occupy, which perhaps they will be willing to exchange with us.\u201d\n\nMost Americans, at that time, wanted the Indians removed. This does not make the Indian Removal Act excusable to us today, but it is the awful truth. That was America 1830; it\u2019s not America 2016. In fact, Jackson was reelected in 1832, after the Indian Removal Act, by a greater percentage of the popular vote than Barack Obama was reelected in 2012 after the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJackson\u2019s story, and the struggle of his generation, is relevant, because featuring both Tubman and Jackson on our $20 bill is a step toward social justice, toward the promise of fulfilling our national belief \u201cthat all men are created equal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is long overdue that a woman and person of color be honored our nation\u2019s banknotes.", "author": "By Ryan Vallo", "og": {"url": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/opinion/andrew-jackson-got-bumped-but-is-he-still-relevant/nrDG8/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/2e/93/MY_DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "It is long overdue that a woman and person of color be honored our nation\u2019s banknotes.", "title": "Andrew Jackson got bumped \u2014 but is he still relevant?"}, "twitter": {"description": "It is long overdue that a woman and person of color be honored our nation\u2019s banknotes.
