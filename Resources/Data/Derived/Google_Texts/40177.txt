Game wardens are training on how to deal with an active shooter while the wardens are on a boat.

The training exercises took place on Saturday at Cheney Lake.

Organizers say that it is difficult to fire a weapon properly from a boat because it is constantly moving with the water.

"We always are taught and we learn to train to survive a situation." said Major Dan Hesket of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks & Tourism.

Officers and game wardens from across the country came to the lake for training.

Major Hesket says that it is difficult to set up the training because of liability issues; he says they are using live ammunition and they had to close a section of the lake to do the training.

The training exercises is a joint effort of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks & Tourism and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol Marine Enforcement.

A trooper with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol says that if the wardens and officers are not trained to deal with a certain situation, they most likely would not be able to perform at their best.

Major Hesket says there have been issues with people, guns and boats around Kansas lakes and continued to say that the training was necessary to ensure officers can remain safe is dangerous situations.
