The first payments are due in mid- to late January.\n\nThe disclosure added to an atmosphere of uncertainty that has engulfed President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement since HealthCare.gov crashed soon after its October 1 launch.\n\nThe absence of the back-end technology behind healthcare marketplaces that have sprung up in all 50 states and the District of Columbia does not prevent consumers from enrolling for coverage through market portals such as HealthCare.gov.\n\nAdministration officials said the technology was set aside in the run-up to Obamacare's October 1 rollout, so that CMS could concentrate on the consumer features of the troubled federal website, HealthCare.gov.\n\nObama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be at least enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty.\n\nCMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille told reporters that technology for those functions would not be needed until January.\n\n\"The back-end financial management systems are something that we do not believe are essential until 2014 and we'll roll those out in those timeframes,\" Bataille said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nBut a program needed to confirm the identities, subsidy levels and coverage choices of individual plan enrollees would have to be in place in December, if coverage is to begin on time on January 1, said an insurance industry official who asked not to be named.\n\nA CMS official warned as early as July that the financial management project was short staffed, weeks behind schedule and the target of a bureaucratic tug-of-war over resources and priorities, according to internal CMS emails.\n\n\"The upshot is that the (financial management) build appears to be way off track and getting worse,\" said a July 8 email from Jeffrey Grant of the CMS unit, Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight.\n\nThe document, provided by Republican investigators in Congress, said staff had been transferred to other projects leaving only one highly skilled developer.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Sandra Maler, Fred Barbash and Lisa Shumaker)\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obamacare Haters Obamacare Haters\n\n1 of 7 McDonald's Peter Bensen, McDonald's chief financial officer , said on a conference call last year that Obamacare will cost the company and its franchisees $140 million to $420 million per year.
