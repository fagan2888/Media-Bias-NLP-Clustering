BATON ROUGE â€” Two of Louisiana's prominent Republican politicians were targets Sunday in Gov. John Bel Edwards' speech to open the special legislative session.

The Democratic governor never named former Gov. Bobby Jindal and state Treasurer John Kennedy directly. But he took digs at Jindal as helping to create the state's financial troubles and at Kennedy for suggestions those troubles could be fixed without tax hikes.

Edwards is asking lawmakers to raise taxes to help close budget gaps, during the 25-day session. The state faces a shortfall ranging from $850 million to $950 million that must be addressed before the fiscal year ends June 30, and another $2 billion gap in the next year.

The governor criticized his predecessor's administration for its budgeting maneuvers, saying they "exacerbated" Louisiana's financial problems.

Edwards promised to work with lawmakers, saying he wouldn't be in another state "pursuing some other position." The words were a strike at Jindal, who was heavily criticized by both Republicans and Democrats as making decisions with an eye toward his unsuccessful bid for the White House.

"Real leadership is required, leadership that will be present, not absent, leadership that will be involved, not detached," Edwards said.

The governor also took a swipe at Kennedy, who is running for the U.S. Senate and who has been one of the most vocal opponents to Edwards' tax plans.

Kennedy has said cuts could address the budget gaps. He says Louisiana has too many consulting contracts, too many protected funds, too many middle managers and too much Medicaid misspending. He says Edwards' tax proposals would wreck Louisiana's economy.

Republican lawmakers have repeated many of Kennedy's suggestions.

Edwards, who asked the House and Senate to set aside party labels, urged them to "ignore the self-serving voices of candidates running for higher office."

"After all, that's what got us in this mess," he added, in another hit on Jindal.
