Karimi, 27, considers makeup to be one of the things she loves most \u2014 so she used it to distract herself from the pain of childbirth.\n\nKarimi gave birth to her daughter over a month ago, but she only recently posted the photos to her Instagram. The photos depict her lying in a hospital bed with her eyeshadow palette laid out in front of her, meticulously putting on primer, lipstick, and eyeshadow between contractions. What would normally take about 45 minutes ended up requiring about three hours, but it was her way of staying relaxed during labor.\n\n\u201cI did my makeup in between my contractions,\u201d Karimi told ABC News. \u201cI had to keep pausing whenever I\u2019d get a contraction, and I had to catch my breath. But, honestly, doing something I loved helped the time go by so much faster and made everything so much easier.\u201d\n\nHello beautiful people, first off, thank you for the love on my latest instagram posts that featured me doing my makeup during labor. As promised, below is a FULL list of makeup details! I have received THOUSANDS of comments and messages as to what primer and setting spray I used and you will find all that down below. Love you guys and thank you for your endless support! _\u2764\ufe0f I now some were laughing because I said I only took \"some of my favorite products\" and as you can clearly see from the pics and the details below... It's a ton of makeup! Lol however, this statement was based solely on the fact that I had SO much makeup to choose from and I narrowed it down to only my favorite things that I knew would hold up through all the tears and emotions!

Baby Sofia was born two nights ago, on February 15, 2016 at 6:19pm weighing 8lbs 13oz and a height of 21.5 inches. Mash'allah! Both of us are doing well Alhamdullilah. She has only been a part of our lives for two days and I can't even remember what life was like before her. She has changed our lives in ways we never thought were possible and has given us the most beautiful outlook on life. How could a little human who we have only known for 48 hours, have so much impact on our lives? Both hubby and I are so in love with her that we stare at her for hours as our hearts fill with joy, and our eyes fill with tears trying to understand how we became so lucky to be chosen as her parents. Subhanallah, Mash'allah, Alhamdullilah, times a million for everything God has blessed us with! I know many people are asking for pics, and I'm sorry but her father and I have decided to keep her beautiful face private for some time to keep her all to ourselves a little while longer and keep her away from evil eyes or Nazar (it's a cultural/religious thing and I hope you all understand). Family and friends are more than welcome to reach out and come visit once we are settled in and well-adjusted. Thank you to all those who sent flowers, texts, emails, calls, etc. I haven't been able to get back to everyone individually but I will as soon as I can. Now many of you are probably wondering about this picture, LOL! It was taken the minute she was first handed to me after I delivered her, look at her little head in my palm. Yes, I went full glam lol and I'll post more pics later of me doing my makeup DURING Labor and pausing for the severe contractions lol. And yes, I wore my @hudabeauty @shophudabeauty mink lashes in \"SOPHIA\" since it was appropriate lol. I had a natural birth alhamdullilah so it was tough, but I'm lucky enough to have been able to experience it firsthand and am so grateful. I prayed for all of the women who are trying to conceive to get to experience this beautiful feeling as well inshallah! Again, thank you all for the sweet messages, wishes, and love! God bless!

Pregnant mothers have been known to take walks, get massages, and dance the tootsie roll (or even \"Thriller\") to alleviate labor pains and keep things moving.\n\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s gone through labor knows you can\u2019t do anything for hours except wait,\u201d Karimi told ABC News. \u201cSome people walk around, some people read books, some sit and watch TV. I did my makeup and I shouldn\u2019t be shamed for that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "makeup, artist, mom, distracts, herself, 10, hour, labor, pains, doing, her, face", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This new mother didn\u2019t let the pain of labor contractions stop her from looking glamorous during childbirth.", "title": "Woman Goes Through 10-Hour Labor, Distracts Herself With Makeup", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/labor-pains-contractions-makeup-artist-gone-viral-378643", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/03/21/alaha-karimi.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This new mother didn\u2019t let the pain of labor contractions stop her from looking glamorous during childbirth.", "title": "Woman Goes Through 10-Hour Labor, Distracts Herself With Makeup", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/labor-pains-contractions-makeup-artist-gone-viral-378643", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/03/21/alaha-karimi.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/21/alaha-karimi.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-03-21T09:58:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T10:07:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This new mother didn\u2019t let the pain of labor contractions stop her from looking glamorous during childbirth."}, "article_summary": "Labor pains can be overwhelming, but they didn\u2019t stop Alaha Karimi from applying a full face of makeup before giving birth to her daughter.\nYes, I went full glam lol and I'll post more pics later of me doing my makeup DURING Labor and pausing for the severe contractions lol.\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s gone through labor knows you can\u2019t do anything for hours except wait,\u201d Karimi told ABC News.\nWhat would normally take about 45 minutes ended up requiring about three hours, but it was her way of staying relaxed during labor.\nKarimi gave birth to her daughter over a month ago, but she only recently posted the photos to her Instagram."}
