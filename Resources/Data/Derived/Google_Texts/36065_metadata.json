The toymaker, known for its educational entertainment products reported that the company\u2019s consolidated net sales were down 5 percent, U.S. segment net sales were down 9 percent and net income per diluted share was down 4 percent.\n\n\u201c2013 was a challenging year to be in the kid business, especially in the U.S.,\u201d LeapFrog\u2019s Chief Executive Officer John Barbour, said during the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call on Feb 12.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the kid business for over 25 years and 2013 was one of the toughest holiday seasons I\u2019ve been through,\u201d he added.\n\nFor its fourth quarter earnings, LeapFrog had projected revenues between $203 million and $223.1 million \u2014 not even close to the market\u2019s projections of $259.9 million. The actual earnings were even lower, with fourth quarter sales at $186.7 million, down 24 percent compared to $244.7 million last year. Net income came in at $63.9 million, or 90 cents per share, compared to $62.3 million, or 89 cents per share year-over-year.\n\nThe company expected to end 2013 with revenues of between $570 million and $590 million, or earnings per share between 36 cents and 46 cents.\n\nInstead, consolidated net sales for 2013 came in at $553.6 million, nearly $20 million below projections. Earnings per share for the year were $1.19 compared to $1.24 for 2012. On a non-GAPP basis the company reported earnings per share of 30 cents compared to 56 cents for 2012. The adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the full-year 2013 was $65.8 million, down 29 percent compared to $93.1 million a year ago.\n\nWith more than two-thirds of the company\u2019s sales coming from the U.S. market, LeapFrog felt more of an impact than competitors who do a larger share of business in the international markets, Barbour said.\n\nIn the U.S., net sales were $123.7 million, down 30 percent from 2012.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed with our financial performance,\u201d he said. Barbour added that a number of factors influenced the decrease in sales, including the lack of having a LeapPad for less than $99 on the market until August, firmware issues with the LeapPad Ultra and the delayed launch of the company\u2019s new app store.\n\n\u201cWe were unable to build on the 28 percent full-year net sales growth that we achieved in 2012,\u201d Barbour said. He added that despite the substantial market challenges, the company delivered its second-most profitable year in the last 10 years.\n\nOn the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call, he stated that the company would perform well during the holiday shopping season, but cautioned that 2013 wouldn\u2019t be akin to successful shopping seasons of the past.\n\nThat caution turned out to ring true for the toy manufacturer.\n\nRunning up to the fourth quarter, Barbour had been optimistic. LeapFrog\u2019s sales were up 9 percent for the year with quality inventory, more retail shelf space and additional promotional support, Barbour said. However, aggressive price promotions driven by the soft market caused the company to take a hit in sales, he noted.\n\nOverall slow retail sales in the U.S., led to deep discounts from retailers, including on the company\u2019s top-selling tablet \u2014 the LeapPad 2 \u2014 which underwent a price cut from $79 to $39. This was a 60 percent reduction from its holiday 2012 price of $99, Barbour said.\n\nOther factors contributing to the drop in sales included a compressed holiday period \u2014 six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 and a more competitive tablet market.\n\nMany retailers expanded their tablet sections for 2013 with some entrants aimed at younger children, the very demographic that LeapFrog targets, which negatively impacted a portion of sales, Barbour said.\n\nEven with all the retail and competitive challenges, the company sold a record number of its popular LeapPad tablets in 2013. Sales grew 11 percent and LeapFrog was the market leader in children\u2019s learning tablets in most of their major markets for the third year in a row, including the U.S. and the U.K., Barbour added.\n\nThe company\u2019s products also received 18 awards in 2013, including the Toy Industry Association\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Toy of the Year award and Educational Toy of the Year. In total, LeapFrog\u2019s products have received more than 1,250 awards and inclusions on top toy lists in the company\u2019s nearly 20-year history. In 2014, the company plans to expand and refresh its content libraries, adding new cartridges, books and apps.\n\nThere was a small silver lining to the company\u2019s fourth quarter woes. Compound annual net sales growth rate for the last four years was 10 percent, and the company generated $78.9 million in operating cash flow.\n\n\u201c(We) ended 2013 with more cash on hand than we\u2019ve ever had at that time of year and with no debt,\u201d said Ray Arthur, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nIn March 2013, the company launched a new multimedia line and continued to expand into international markets, which have proven to be profitable. The international share of LeapFrog increased from 27 percent to 30 percent. Net sales were up 6 percent and grew in every key international market, Barbour said.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest international expansion in France did particularly well, as its sales there were up over 40 percent.\n\nDrawing on France\u2019s success, the international team is working on market expansion opportunities for 2015 and beyond, Barbour said.\n\n\u201cMany countries around the world are focused on improving education for their children and we believe this opens significant opportunities for LeapFrog,\u201d Barbour added.\n\nStrategic priorities for LeapFrog\u2019s 2014 outlook include diversifying their portfolio of products, innovating current categories, geographical expansion and significant infrastructure investments to help the company become more efficient, Barbour noted.\n\n\u201cDespite a disappointing performance in 2013, I believe we\u2019ve made strong progress over the last few years on our journey to transform LeapFrog into an educational entertainment company,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cAnd we have lots of exciting opportunities to help children achieve their potential ahead of us.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, the company said it expected sales for the first quarter of 2014 to fall in the $45 million to $50 million range, compared to $83 million in the first quarter of 2013. The company anticipates losses of 20 cents to 23 cents per share, or 5 cents on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nFor the year, the company expects sales to come in between $554 million or $580 million, and earnings per share of 18 cents to 25 cents, or 30 cents on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nAt the 4 p.m. close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Leapfrog were down 8.95 percent to close at $6.41.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business,earnings,Education,Kasia Grobelny,Leapfrog,Business & Money,Politics & Gov,Frontpage Featured,Science & Tech", "description": "The Emeryville-based toymaker reported that the company\u2019s consolidated net sales were down 5 percent, U.S. segment net sales were down 9 percent and net\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0e1\"", "article_summary": "Citing a difficult retail climate, Emeryville-based educational toy manufacturer, LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc., (NYSE: LF) posted disappointing results Wednesday for its fourth quarter earnings.\nFor its fourth quarter earnings, LeapFrog had projected revenues between $203 million and $223.1 million \u2014 not even close to the market\u2019s projections of $259.9 million.\nThe actual earnings were even lower, with fourth quarter sales at $186.7 million, down 24 percent compared to $244.7 million last year.\nInstead, consolidated net sales for 2013 came in at $553.6 million, nearly $20 million below projections.\n\u201cDespite a disappointing performance in 2013, I believe we\u2019ve made strong progress over the last few years on our journey to transform LeapFrog into an educational entertainment company,\u201d Barbour said."}
