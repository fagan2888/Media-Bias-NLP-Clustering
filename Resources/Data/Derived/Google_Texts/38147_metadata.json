One of the most dramatic gaps in opinion is between white voters and non-white nonvoters (shown below). As 2016 approaches, the question of how to mobilize the political power of people of color is increasingly being discussed with the rise of groups like Black Lives Matter. Though it\u2019s clear that voter turnout will not be enough to fully realize political equality, it can have a dramatic influence on policy.\n\nIn a study released last year, political scientist Jon Rogowski and Sophie Schuit of the Brennan Center for Justice find that members of Congress representing districts covered by the preclearance provision (which was struck down by the Roberts court when it gutted the Voting Rights Act) were more supportive of civil rights legislation. The chart below (on the left) shows that as the black population increased, a legislator in a district protected by the Voting Rights Act became more liberal on civil rights, while one in a non-covered district became more conservative. The chart on the right shows that in more competitive districts, representatives covered by the VRA were more progressive on civil rights than in non-covered districts. As the authors write, \u201cBy guaranteeing the voting rights of Black constituents, Section 5 created the incentives for elected officials to better represent Black interests.\u201d\n\nOther research on the impact of voting in the South comes to similar conclusions. For instance, economist Suresh Naidu finds that poll taxes and literacy tests lead to a decline in the teacher-child ratio at black schools of 10 to 23 percent (no effect on white schools). Economists Elizabeth Cascio and Ebonya Washington find that the boost in black turnout following the Voting Rights Act boosted state transfers to localities with higher black populations. Economist Ferran Elias finds that the court orders shifting cities from at-large elections to single districts (thereby guaranteeing black representation on the city council) boosted public good expenditures and tax collection, as well as the share of black public workers. He also finds that it boosted the value of houses owned by black citizens. This research all suggests that voter protections, many of them under assault by the court, have been integral to equitable representation.\n\nA fascinating working paper from Brazil sheds more light on the importance of voting \u2014 and making voting as easy as possible. The paper examined a re-registration program in Brazil that affected 1,186 municipalities. The program pulled down registration rates by 10 points and turnout by 5 percentage points in the affected districts. The authors find that the effect was dramatic: \u201cThe newly elected mayors responded to this change by reducing public expenditure in areas that disproportionately benefit poor and uneducated voters (education and health).\u201d Although the paper is still in the working-paper stage, it finds support from other similar studies: One from Princeton economist Thomas Fujiwara finds that the adoption of new electronic voting technology in Brazil, which boosted turnout among less-educated citizens, led to more government spending on healthcare. The result was increased prenatal visits, and therefore a reduction in low-weight births among less-educated women.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A giant body of research makes it increasingly clear why the votes of black Americans must be protected", "title": "The true cost of Voter ID: Everything you need to know about the monumental cost of voter suppression", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A giant body of research makes it increasingly clear why the votes of black Americans must be protected", "title": "The true cost of Voter ID: Everything you need to know about the monumental cost of voter suppression", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/04/the_true_cost_of_voter_id_everything_you_need_to_know_about_the_monumental_cost_of_voter_suppression/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/voting_line.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A giant body of research makes it increasingly clear why the votes of black Americans must be protected", "title": "The true cost of Voter ID: Everything you need to know about the monumental cost of voter suppression", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/voting_line.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, elections, Racism, Research, Voter ID", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Though it\u2019s clear that voter turnout will not be enough to fully realize political equality, it can have a dramatic influence on policy.\nEconomists Elizabeth Cascio and Ebonya Washington find that the boost in black turnout following the Voting Rights Act boosted state transfers to localities with higher black populations.\nA fascinating working paper from Brazil sheds more light on the importance of voting \u2014 and making voting as easy as possible.\nOne of the most dramatic gaps in opinion is between white voters and non-white nonvoters (shown below).\nThis research all suggests that voter protections, many of them under assault by the court, have been integral to equitable representation."}
