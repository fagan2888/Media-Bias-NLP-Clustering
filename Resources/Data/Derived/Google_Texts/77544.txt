A new daycare center in Albemarle County is in full operation. Little Learners Childcare Center at B.F. Yancey Elementary School is now taking students.

An open house was held at the school Sunday for parents to stop by and take a peek.

The Virginia Department of Social Services began looking to open the center two years ago.

People who helped get the center up and running say this is servicing a great need in the area.

"We went through various approvals, licensing all that, and came up with our first step in the whole process of providing the high quality childcare in southern Albemarle County with our pre-K program here," said John Robins, daycare organizer.

Board members say there was previously no formal licensed childcare center in the area. They say community members wanted a center that was close to their homes.
