He\u2019s out for the season this time.\n\nCowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said on his radio show Friday that Romo would sit out the remaining five games with a small fracture in the same collarbone that had already sidelined him for seven games.\n\nRomo will not need surgery after getting hurt in the third quarter of Thursday\u2019s 33-14 loss to Carolina. He didn\u2019t need surgery after breaking the collarbone in Week 2 at Philadelphia, either.\n\nIt\u2019s the third fracture in Romo\u2019s non-throwing shoulder in his nine-year career as the Dallas starter. He missed most of 2010 after getting hurt against the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cThe hard part is playing when you\u2019re trying not to get hurt, which is silly,\u201d Romo said after he threw three interceptions and Carolina returned two of them for touchdowns before the injury. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in costing our team a good chance to stay in the game early. Then on top of it, who knows how long after that. It\u2019s just a disappointing day.\u201d\n\nRomo was in his second game back after the Cowboys (3-8) lost seven straight without him. The skid ended in his return at Miami, and the Carolina loss was his first of the season.\n\n\u201cWe felt that the risk was worth the potential of having him be the impact he can be and he is on our team,\u201d Jones said on his radio show. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ever quit trying to do something that is extraordinary. The dream was if Tony could have come in, been the catalyst, played similarly and had results we had the week before against Miami \u2026 that it would\u2019ve been the beginning of maybe something special.\u201d\n\nMatt Cassel, who started four games during Romo\u2019s first absence, will be the starter as long as he\u2019s healthy. He lost all four of his starts after Brandon Weeden was 0-3 filling in for Romo. The Cowboys released Weeden the week Romo was activated, and he signed with Houston.\n\n\u201cYou have to step in and try to fulfill that role,\u201d Cassel said after leading Dallas\u2019 only touchdown drive against the Panthers. \u201cHopefully the guys rally around you. You have to move forward. I have confidence in myself and confidence in this team.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old Romo is becoming injury-prone late in his career. He\u2019s had two back surgeries since 2013, and a third back injury that sidelined him for a game last year. He also played through broken ribs and a punctured lung earlier in his career. He missed two games in 2008 with a broken finger.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t let Tony play if he wasn\u2019t ready to play physically,\u201d coach Jason Garrett said after the game. \u201cThere is no evidence we brought him back too soon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tony Romo out for year after second collarbone injury of 2015 season", "title": "Tony Romo out for year after second collarbone injury of 2015 season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/tony-romo-out-for-year-after-second-collarbone-injury-of-2015-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__498873712p1.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__498873712p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T18:19:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:27:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 Tony Romo knew he was risking another left collarbone injury by coming back eight weeks after breaking it.\nThe Cowboys released Weeden the week Romo was activated, and he signed with Houston.\nRomo will not need surgery after getting hurt in the third quarter of Thursday\u2019s 33-14 loss to Carolina.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t let Tony play if he wasn\u2019t ready to play physically,\u201d coach Jason Garrett said after the game.\nHe\u2019s had two back surgeries since 2013, and a third back injury that sidelined him for a game last year."}
