Collin Peterson\u2019s name will be on the ballot, but who really is running?\n\nWho brought Obamacare to the district? Collin Peterson voted against it. So who brought it? Nancy Pelosi, that\u2019s who. She\u2019s the person who pushed the bill through the House, and she\u2019s the person who scheduled the vote without anyone knowing what was in it. She worked with Jonathan Gruber, a health care economist who later admitted dishonesty and explained it passed because the American people are stupid.\n\nIs Peterson responsible for that? Yes, because the first vote he cast when he was elected to that Congress was to vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker. He put her in charge of the machinery of Congress for that result to occur. That\u2019s how Congress works.\n\nRegardless of how Peterson otherwise may vote, a vote for him is a vote for Pelosi and gun control; for Pelosi, Obamacare and poorer medical care; for Pelosi and \u201ctransgender\u201d men in women\u2019s bathrooms; for Pelosi and more in-your-face control by the United Nations over our lives; for Pelosi and Planned Parenthood and the aborting of babies; and for Pelosi and the massive tax-and-spend program wrapped around global warming.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/think-pelosi-voting-peterson/84289874/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Think \u2018Pelosi\u2019 before voting Peterson", "og": {"site_name": "St. Cloud Times", "description": "Think \u2018Pelosi\u2019 before voting Peterson", "title": "Think \u2018Pelosi\u2019 before voting Peterson", "url": "http://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/think-pelosi-voting-peterson/84289874/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sctimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Think \u2018Pelosi\u2019 before voting Peterson", "title": "Think \u2018Pelosi\u2019 before voting Peterson", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/12/StCloud/B9322111904Z.1_20160512152928_000_GKHEBQ9K8.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@sctimes", "site": "@sctimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=830659200", "fb": {"app_id": 170170889686818}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Nancy Pelosi, that\u2019s who.\nRegardless of how Peterson otherwise may vote, a vote for him is a vote for Pelosi and gun control; for Pelosi, Obamacare and poorer medical care; for Pelosi and \u201ctransgender\u201d men in women\u2019s bathrooms; for Pelosi and more in-your-face control by the United Nations over our lives; for Pelosi and Planned Parenthood and the aborting of babies; and for Pelosi and the massive tax-and-spend program wrapped around global warming.\nYes, because the first vote he cast when he was elected to that Congress was to vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker.\nShe\u2019s the person who pushed the bill through the House, and she\u2019s the person who scheduled the vote without anyone knowing what was in it.\nLetter to the editor (Photo: Times graphic)Who is running for election for Congress in the 7th District in Minnesota?"}
