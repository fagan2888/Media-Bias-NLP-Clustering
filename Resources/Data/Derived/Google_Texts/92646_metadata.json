Remember [National Security Adviser] Susan Rice on all the Sunday talk shows? And even President Obama kept talking about the video for weeks.\u201d\n\nThe video to which she referred is the Internet video that, according e-mails obtained by Judicial Watch, the Obama administration made the focal point of Rice\u2019s Sunday show talking points following the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.\n\n\u201cAre you suspicious?\u201d Van Susteren concluded in her \u201cOff the Record\u201d segment. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Greta Van Susteren claimed on Fox News Friday that the Obama administration pressured her to force one of her colleagues to drop a story on the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attack that killed four Americans, an event that Fox has aggressively covered since its occurrence.", "title": "Greta Van Susteren says she got a 'dirty' call from the Obama...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/09/greta-benghazi-600x337.jpg", "height": 337}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/09/07/greta-van-susteren-says-got-dirty-call-obama-administration-pressuring-fox-news-lay-benghazi-story/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "susan-rice-talking-points-benghazi", "published_time": "2014-09-07T15:31:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-09T15:20:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5d0\"", "article_summary": "Greta Van Susteren says she got a \u2018dirty\u2019 call from the Obama administration pressuring Fox News to lay off Benghazi storyGreta Van Susteren claimed on Fox News Friday that the Obama administration pressured her to force one of her colleagues to drop a story on the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attack that killed four Americans, an event that Fox has aggressively covered since its occurrence.\n\u201cI thought the call from the Obama administration was dirty.\n\u201cI think Fox News is being punished for aggressively asking questions, doing our jobs,\u201d Van Susteren speculated.\n\u201cAre you suspicious?\u201d Van Susteren concluded in her \u201cOff the Record\u201d segment.\n\u201cWhen reporter Jennifer Griffin said she was told that there was a stand down order at Benghazi, I got a weird call from the Obama administration trying to pressure me to get Jennifer to back down on her report,\u201d Van Susteren recalled."}
