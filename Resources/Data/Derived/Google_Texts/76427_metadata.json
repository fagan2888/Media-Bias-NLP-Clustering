The Boulder non-profit Bridge House, a homeless resource and advocacy center, took up Walnut's torch last year, using kitchen and dining room space at First United Methodist Church downtown.\n\nRicardo Rincones, left and Steven Kaufman watch their meals being brought by volunteers Andrea and Carlos Neri and Damaris Andrews, at right, at the Bridge House Christmas Meal held at the Lazy Dog on Thursday.

It shows that people still have warmth and compassion for another human being.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright only wishes he felt the same coziness for the other 364 days of the year.\n\n\"Some people see us as being problematic for society, with addictions and mental health issues in our lives,\" he said. \"So, stuff like this is so meaningful to me. These people could be doing something else, besides waiting on tramps like me.\"\n\nIndeed, dozens of volunteers \u2014 a surplus, in fact \u2014 helped with the event. Much of the donated food, however, was prepared by homeless folks who've been trained through Bridge House's Ready to Work program.\n\n\"When I got here four months ago, I didn't want to just be idle,\" homeless man John Wilson, 53, said. \"And so I went to the Bridge House and they told me about Ready to Work, and I got involved in it within about a week being here.\n\n\"It's great for me. It gives me something to do, and a reason to focus each morning. Sometimes, when you're in recovery, having that idle time isn't the best.\"\n\nBridge House's executive director, Isabel McDevitt, said rehabilitation programs, including Ready to Work, are particularly crucial in a city like Boulder, which sees a constant influx of new transients in critical need of a number of services.\n\n\"We have some major challenges,\" she said. \"Affordable housing is a huge challenge, and so is having access to mental health services and substance abuse treatment services and employment.\"\n\nIn 2014, 23 homeless people lost their lives in Boulder. Eight of them died outside.\n\n\"It's remarkable how many people do end up improving their situations, but there are many more people who are finding themselves in hard times,\" McDevitt said. \"We just continue to really focus on the positive, and focus on solutions. Hopefully 2015 will bring more of them.\"\n\nAlex Burness: 303-473-1389, burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2014-12-25T17:12:21-0700", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27207076:view"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Around meal times on most other days, Cisco Montoya, who has lived homeless in Boulder off and on since the '60s, would likely be diving in trash bins for food.", "title": "Bridge House, Lazy Dog serve up free food and company to Boulder's homeless on Christmas", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1225/20141225__26DCACHRw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-12-25T17:25:38-0700", "endDate": "2024-12-25T17:10:54-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Alex BurnessCamera", "pubDate": "2014-12-25T17:16:21-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-25T17:12:21-0700", "sailthru.title": "Bridge House, Lazy Dog serve up free food and company to Boulder's homeless on Christmas", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1225/20141225__26DCACHRw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Around meal times on most other days, Cisco Montoya, who has lived homeless in Boulder off and on since the '60s, would likely be diving in trash bins for food.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Around meal times on most other days, Cisco Montoya, who has lived homeless in Boulder off and on since the '60s, would likely be diving in trash bins for food.", "title": "Bridge House, Lazy Dog serve up free food and company to Boulder's homeless on Christmas"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1225/20141225__26DCACHRw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Ricardo Rincones, left and Steven Kaufman watch their meals being brought by volunteers Andrea and Carlos Neri and Damaris Andrews, at right, at the Bridge House Christmas Meal held at the Lazy Dog on Thursday.\nFor many years, the Walnut Brewery had served the homeless free Christmas meals, but that tradition came to a halt in 2012.\nThe Boulder non-profit Bridge House, a homeless resource and advocacy center, took up Walnut's torch last year, using kitchen and dining room space at First United Methodist Church downtown.\nMuch of the donated food, however, was prepared by homeless folks who've been trained through Bridge House's Ready to Work program.\n\"And so I went to the Bridge House and they told me about Ready to Work, and I got involved in it within about a week being here."}
