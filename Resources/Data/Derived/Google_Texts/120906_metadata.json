Bill Walker over his decision to expand Medicaid. Anyone who read the July 30 Anchorage Dispatch News opinion pages should have expected it.\n\nRep. John Coghill, R-North Pole, argued Walker likely violated state law. But despite his detailed legal analysis, this is just another salvo of \u201cjust say no\u201d politics Republican legislative leaders have embraced ever since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010.\n\nI\u2019m not a lawyer, so I\u2019m not going to pretend I understand Alaska laws related to accepting Medicaid funds from the federal government. The courts will decide that question. What a judge won\u2019t rule on, however, is whether or not the lawsuit is politically motivated. Even if the Legislature prevails, that question should go before the court of public opinion.\n\nThis story begins in 2010 when former Gov. Sean Parnell joined a lawsuit with other states to challenge the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Medicaid expansion wasn\u2019t the driver behind that decision. It was the individual mandate clause of the act that most believed was unconstitutional.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate in their July 2012 ruling. At the same time they determined states could choose not to implement Medicaid expansion. That\u2019s the direction Parnell went, but first he dragged his feet by commissioning a study that took nine months to complete. Then he delayed releasing it another eight months.\n\nAt no time during that 17-month period did state lawmakers challenge Parnell over the issue. That\u2019s not necessarily because he was exceeding his authority; their silence was a form of passive encouragement.\n\nFast forward to this past spring to a slight of hand by the legislative majority. House Speaker Mike Chenault, R-Nikiski, told the Alaska Dispatch News in March he believed Walker had that authority to expand the program unilaterally. So, lawmakers included provisions in the operating budget intending to prevent Walker from acting alone. They did that despite two separate legal opinions which said slipping those strings into the budget was likely unconstitutional. Obviously, they weren\u2019t concerned then with abuse of authority or sticking to the constitutional rule of law.\n\nThe GOP leadership has repeatedly argued that reforming state management of the Medicaid system should come before making a final decision about expanding it. But as I\u2019ve previously pointed out, the studies done under Parnell came up with just $37 million in savings. To paraphrase Rep. Wes Keller, R-Wasilla, that\u2019s a \u201cpaltry\u201d sum compared to the $3 billion general fund liability for Medicaid. And some of those, such as using artificial price controls and shifting costs from the Medicaid program to Social Security, aren\u2019t real savings at all.\n\nThen there\u2019s the way the Republican leadership refused to bring Medicaid expansion up for a vote unless the majority of its caucus supported it. That\u2019s because moderate members of the GOP who supported expansion would have joined the minority to pass it.\n\nThey argued the U.S. Supreme Court might effectively hollow out the entire Affordable Care Act if the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in the King v. Burwell case. In the words of Rep. Craig Johnson, R-Anchorage, it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to expand Medicaid \u201cand just have it undone.\u201d The sad part of that story is how the GOP would have applauded such a ruling even though Alaskans who obtained private health care insurance on the federal exchange would have lost their tax subsidies.\n\nOne would think that after another disappointing ruling from the Supreme Court they\u2019d give into what the majority of Alaskans want. But no, these penny-pinching politicians think it\u2019s perfectly fine to waste money suing the governor.\n\nIt was Sen. President Kevin Meyer, R-Anchorage, who claimed their decision to go to court was \u201ca question of authority and process and our constitution.\u201d But that\u2019s what he had to say. He couldn\u2019t come right out and admit that the GOP\u2019s track record on this issue shows it\u2019s all about getting their way.\n\nThere\u2019s a psychological disorder that fits the collective behavior of the GOP leadership. It\u2019s called borderline personality. Simply put, their need to win at all costs has displaced their view of reality.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Opinion, Rich Moniak, Bill Walker, John Coghill, Kevin Meyer, Sean Parnell, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Local, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "It wasn't surprising that the Legislative Council voted to sue Gov.
