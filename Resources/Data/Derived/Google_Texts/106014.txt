When Gov. Maggie Hassan spoke at “Politics and Eggs” recently at St. Anselm’s College, she enumerated her top priorities when she gets to the Senate will be climate change, women’s reproductive health, and more affordable college. Is that your top priority with your U. S. Senator? How many other Americans would put these issues as adversely affecting their lives? Such a narrow perspective from an adult is laughable.
