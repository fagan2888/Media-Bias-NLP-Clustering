I don\u2019t know what that implies. Is it a metaphor for some GOP position? I do know that the Greens, most of whom are progressive (Hillary) or socialist (Bernie) Democrats, really do want us to heat our houses with windmills and cook with rays from the sun.\n\nMORE MONEY\n\nTo \u201cJoe In Upper Darby,\u201d the only reason you are paying less than your old policy is if you have health problems. Your premiums would have been much higher before. But with Obamacare, the rest of us \u2013 you know, the healthy people that take care of ourselves \u2013 are paying higher premiums for you. It\u2019s not fair.\n\nTHE INFORMER\n\nYUMMY CHICKEN\n\nI can\u2019t wait for the new Royal Farms to open up on Route 452, so they can show that other convenience store what real chicken taste like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCHICKEN AFICIONADO\n\nRUSSIAN PLOT\n\nThe caller saying that bad weather is to blame on man going into space has to be one of the most ridiculous things I\u2019ve ever read. We all know it\u2019s due to the Soviets and their weather controlling machines.\n\nTIN FOIL HAT MAN\n\nRAINING MAN\n\nIf the comment about the recent rainfall being the result of space exploration is serious and not satire, it should be in the inaugural class of the Sound Off Hall of Fame. Also deserving is the one last week from the pro-union caller hoping that all the businesses go out of business, and those that think that all Republicans are wealthy and are out to \u201cdestroy the middle class.\u201d\n\nNO WOOD\n\nIt scares that there are really people out there like \u201cGOP Values\u201d who think this kind of stuff. Republican policies would have us heating our homes with wood stoves? Maybe if you\u2019re talking about the Republican of the 1790s, in other words the predecessors of the modern Democrats. If it wasn\u2019t for the conservatives parties in this country, we would have never industrialized, be it heavy industry or industrial agricultural.\n\nTROUBLEMAKERS\n\nI know when Trump had his rallies, the Bernie Sanders 99 percenters were out there disrupting everything and Trump got the blame for his \u201cincendiary language.\u201d What happened in Nevada for their Democratic convention? Same thing \u2013 Bernie\u2019s people. They disrupted, they turned over tables, they bum rushed the stage, they made death threat against a woman. I don\u2019t hear any condemnation against Bernie\u2019s people from the Democrats. They\u2019re brushing it under the rug \u2013 we\u2019ll all get along, sing \u201cKumbaya\u201d around the campfire on the hippie commune eventually. What say you, Bernie Sanders supporters? Are you \u201cfeeling the Bern?\u201d\n\nDON\u2019T CUT ME\n\nTo illustrate how unqualified Donald Trump is for president, it would be like letting a carpenter perform surgery on you. A carpenter knows carpentry, but if you let him operate on you, it would be disastrous. Similarly, Donald Trump may know his business, but to let him be president of the United State would be disastrous for our country. And yet Republican voters don\u2019t seem to understand how unqualified Donald Trump is. I wonder if these voters would let a carpenter operate on them.\n\nBAD CREDIT\n\nBe aware of giving your credit card to someone and not swiping it like you normally would do. I did that, and about a week later something was charged to my company\u2019s credit card for purchase online. Luckily, the credit card company shut it down, but that just goes to show you that unfortunately you can\u2019t trust anyone any more.\n\nFIXING IT UP\n\n\u201cReal Fix For Our Education System\u201d has no facts and figures to back up their insults they throw around. That\u2019s because they\u2019re a typical clueless right-wingers who doesn\u2019t believe in facts and figures, just throwing around invective.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S MONEY\n\nFor the fool complaining about Donald Trump raising big money from big donors, he\u2019s raising it for the GOP in the individual states. Last week he was in Camden raising money for the New Jersey GOP. And he will be going across the country to each state and raising money for each state GOP to run their campaigns in November. So wise up; don\u2019t be ignorant.\n\nVOTER WHO KNOWS", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, Primos Opinion news, PA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "title": "Sound Off: May 22, 2016", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20160522/NEWS/160529915", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Sound Off: May 22, 2016"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "FUN SHOWCongratulations Aston Elementary fifth graders and parents on their great variety show.", "title": "Sound Off: May 22, 2016", "url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20160522/NEWS/160529915", "image": {"src": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016"}, "site": "@delcotimes", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563336340", "iphone": "id508962453", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.thedelawarecountydailytime"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, Primos Opinion news, PA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "FUN SHOWCongratulations Aston Elementary fifth graders and parents on their great variety show."}, "article_summary": "And he will be going across the country to each state and raising money for each state GOP to run their campaigns in November.\nAre you \u201cfeeling the Bern?\u201dDON\u2019T CUT METo illustrate how unqualified Donald Trump is for president, it would be like letting a carpenter perform surgery on you.\nTRUMP\u2019S MONEYFor the fool complaining about Donald Trump raising big money from big donors, he\u2019s raising it for the GOP in the individual states.\nI don\u2019t know what that implies.\nSimilarly, Donald Trump may know his business, but to let him be president of the United State would be disastrous for our country."}
