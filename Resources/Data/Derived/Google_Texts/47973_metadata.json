Out of some 8.8 million persons who have signed up for coverage, about 5.5 million are in the federal insurance exchange receiving reduced rates, or benefits, to pay for their health insurance policies.\n\nREAD ALSO: It\u2019s time to ask Obamacare defenders if they are Obamacare users\n\nThe sliding scale subsidized policies are priced based on income, family size, and geographical location of the individual. Under the law, only citizens and legal immigrants are entitled to subsidized coverage.\n\nThe presentation shows that the data errors involve information concerning details on income, citizenship and immigration status.\n\nJulie Bataille, Director of Center for Medicare and Medicaid\u2019s Office of Communications, says that the discrepancies can be resolved over the summer, however there is a system in place to \u201cturn off\u201d benefits for anyone receiving benefits but who are ineligible.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a consumer has an inconsistency on their application does not mean there is a problem on their enrollment,\u201d said Bataille. \u201cMost of the time what that means is that there is more up-to-date information that they need to provide to us.\u201d\n\nIllegal immigrants are not eligible for health care coverage via the exchanges and the current cost of treating uninsured immigrants who entered this country illegally is estimated by The Center for Immigration Studies to be $4.3 billion a year, primarily at emergency rooms and free clinics.\n\nAmerican taxpayers are still paying for those costs, as well as the cost of subsidies offered through the federal exchanges.\n\nREAD ALSO: Obamacare: Pitting the middle class against the uninsured\n\nThe insurance exchanges involved have been offering subsidized private coverage to lower-income and middle-class people who are not able to access private health care via their work or who do not have work. Some consumers will be asked to repay if they have received \u201ctoo generous\u201d of a subsidy.\n\nBecause the program has been structured around tax credits, the IRS can deduct an overpayment from a taxpayer\u2019s following-year refund. But those deductions can only be made if the individual has a job and pays taxes.\n\nOf those affected, discrepancies are said to be:\n\n1.2 million related to income\n\n505,000 related to immigration\n\n461,000 related to citizenship information\n\nCorrecting the issues will require a \u201claborious effort requiring hands-on work from a legion of workers employed by government contractor Serco, Inc.\u201d\n\nThe administration says it will be triple-check consumer information to ensure that subsidy benefits are only being awarded to persons who are eligible due to income, immigration and citizenship status, among other factors.\n\nIn the meantime, the cost of fixing the shoddy rollout and administration of Obamacare continues to crush the middle class.\n\nREAD ALSO: Obamacare\u2019s sleight of hand: The numbers just don\u2019t add up\n\nFrom The Heritage Foundation, following are the five most prevalent and harmful burdens the middle class will be forced to bear under Obamacare:\n\n1. More taxes. Obamacare imposes $502 billion of new or increased taxes and fees. Heritage expert Curtis Dubay explains that several of the taxes \u201cwill ultimately be passed on to [middle-income families] through higher prices. These include the fees on medical device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and health insurance companies and the new tax on tanning services.\u201d The middle class will also be burdened by the individual mandate to purchase insurance, new restrictions and limits on their tax-free health and flex savings accounts, and a new tax on high-cost (Cadillac) health plans. Starting next year, Obamacare increases the Medicare payroll tax from 2.9 percent to 3.8 percent for individuals earning above $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000 and for the first time extends the tax to income earned from investment. But the threshold for the higher rate isn\u2019t indexed to inflation and will impact more middle-class families each year. The 2012 Medicare trustees report states, \u201cBy the end of the long-range projection period, an estimated 80 percent of workers would pay the higher tax rate.\u201d 2. Loss of existing coverage. As many as 35 million people could lose their existing coverage because of Obamacare. This is because Obamacare creates financial incentives for employers to drop coverage for their employees. One report that examined the health insurance costs of 71 fortune 100 companies estimated savings of $422.4 billion between 2014 and 2023 if they dropped their employee coverage and paid the employer mandate penalty. Another study predicts that 30 percent of employers will definitely or probably drop coverage under Obamacare. 3. Higher premiums. Americans who purchase coverage in the new Obamacare exchanges will find that health insurance is still very expensive. American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Scott Gottlieb, MD, explains, \u201cFor a family of four, premiums on even one of the lower priced \u2018silver\u2019 options could still cost more than $15,000 annually on the exchanges.\u201d A family\u2019s income might exclude them from subsidies but not be high enough to pay $15,000 for Obamacare\u2019s government-approved insurance. \u201cA family of four earning $90,000 annually takes home about $60,000 after local, state, and federal taxes. If they lose workplace coverage, and move onto the exchanges, they could find themselves spending as much as 25 percent of the family\u2019s take home pay for an average policy ($15,000 for the \u2018silver\u2019 plan).\u201d 4. Rising health care costs. As premiums and overall health care costs continue to rise, middle-class families, including those receiving a subsidy, will be left paying more. Beginning in 2019, Obamacare\u2019s cost-containment strategy for the exchanges is to hold the total cost of the subsidies to 0.504 percent of GDP. Charles Blahous, a Medicare trustee, concludes that \u201cthis limitation would likely cause the federal subsidies to grow less rapidly over the long term than the cost of health care and thus require low-income individuals in the exchanges to shoulder a steadily increasing percentage of their health costs. 5. More government control of health care. Obamacare transfers massive authority over to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and expands the role of government in delivering care and coverage. This huge expansion of government\u2019s role in health care delivery means that, by 2020, more than half of all Americans will be dependent on the federal government for health care and government bureaucrats will be in charge of deciding what you can and cannot buy and the level of health care you will receive. With Americans paying for insurance via the exchanges, a repeal of the law becomes increasingly impossible. Meaning that the program will continue to be funded via higher premiums for those who are not eligible (i.e., working) for subsidized coverage and increased consumer taxes.
