Six years after calorie labeling on menus was mandated as part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, the Food and Drug Administration has released final guidance on implementing the regulation.

Compliance and enforcement will kick in a year from now, in early May 2017.

The requirements apply to chain restaurants, supermarkets and other foodservice venues with 20 or more locations.

The National Restaurant Association stopped opposing menu labeling in 2009. McDonaldâ€™s set a high-profile precedent by posting calorie counts on U.S. menu boards in 2012; Panera Bread was among those that followed. Subway (shown) said it did the same as of last month.
