He reported his experiences in Black Like Me. Based on the journal he kept, the book has sold more than 10 million copies and remained continuously in print since its publication in 1961.\n\nSwedish journalist Petter Ljunggren had a similar idea, though he didn\u2019t have to go to Griffin\u2019s lengths to conduct the experiment. Replicating the experiment conducted by journalist Patrick Reilly in October 2013, Ljunggren donned a kippah and a Star of David to walk the streets of Malm\u00f6, Sweden, with its large Muslim population. Captured with a hidden camera, the experience depicted is not horrible, but rather unpleasant and threatening (at 17:50 and 29:30 or so in the video below).\n\nThe Algemeiner reports on the results of the experiment here. Elder of Ziyon follows up here.\n\nThe related television documentary has been uploaded to YouTube here; I\u2019m posting the video below. The comments at YouTube indicate that accurate English subtitles are forthcoming; the current English subtitles were generated automatically via Google. They have the quality of Ezra Pound\u2019s translation of Anglo-Saxon poetry into modern English without the imposing rhythms or alliterative lilt. You sort of get the drift.\n\nThe final ten minutes of the video include an interview with a couple of local politicians and are worth sticking around for. Long story short: life isn\u2019t going to be getting better for the Jews of Malm\u00f6.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "John Howard Griffin famously enlisted the assistance of a dermatologist to have his skin darkened so he could pass as a black man traveling in the deep South for six weeks in late 1959.
