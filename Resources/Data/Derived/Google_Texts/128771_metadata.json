Al Franken jokes with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the floor of the House Chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Sept. 9, 2009. (REUTERS/Jason Reed)\n\n4146387\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told Republican Sen. Tom Coburn Tuesday that his point about how few Obamacare plans are accepted at top cancer hospitals is \u201cin the weeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cNineteen of the cancer centers in this country, only five are covered under Obamacare,\u201d Coburn told The Washington Examiner.\n\n\u201cDr. Coburn is very good at getting into the weeds and trying to find something that he thinks makes sense, but I think we need to look at the overall context of this bill,\u201d Reid said at a Thursday Senate press briefing. \u201cIt really brings a lot of people in from the cold so that they have the ability to get health insurance, which they\u2019ve never had the opportunity [to do] before.\u201d\n\nCoburn is raising an issue that is playing out in top research hospitals around the country. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a market, and what they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve priced it where these cancer centers, a lot of them, aren\u2019t going to participate because they don\u2019t get paid to cover the costs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nation\u2019s top multi-campus cancer hospital The Mayo Clinic, which was cited by President Obama as a health reform model for the nation when promoting the law in 2009, now accepts only one kind of Obamacare insurance plan: the Blue Cross Blue Shield silver plan.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, a top-four U.S. hospital, is making $330 million in budget cuts this year, including more than $100 million in cuts that the hospital claimed was directly due to Obamacare, and projects a workforce reduction.\n\nOhio Republican Gov. John Kasich spoke at the Cleveland Clinic late last year to present his plan to accept a full Medicaid expansion package under Obamacare. The health law raises federal Medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of the poverty level.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals are seen as a way for hospital interests to get a portion of their money back \u2014 prompting the hospital lobby to push hard with an effective multi-state pro-Medicaid campaign.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "'In the Weeds': Reid disses Obamacare's war on hospitals", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told Republican Sen.
