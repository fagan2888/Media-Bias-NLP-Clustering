Today's Pittsburgh Steelers news looks at the revamped offensive line and behind the scenes at what the team did in its much-needed off week.

Pittsburgh opens as a favorite in Week 6 against the New York Jets, who come off a late victory over the Atlanta Falcons last night. The bye week allowed the Steelers to not only get healthy, but gave the coaching staff two weeks to plan for Geno Smith and the Jets.

Offensively, the addition of Levi Brown could be just the first change coach Mike Tomlin makes along the line. One reporter speculated that tackle Mike Adams could move to left guard in the event Ramon Foster misses time with a pectoral strain.

Defensively, safety Troy Polamalu is a bright spot on a unit that has yet to force a turnover through four games. The veteran is healthy again and playing well as the Steelers look to rebound after giving up 74 combined points in losses to Chicago and Minnesota.
