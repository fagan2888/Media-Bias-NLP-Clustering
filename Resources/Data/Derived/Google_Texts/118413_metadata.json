These will usually be below their book value, meaning the lenders could take significant losses on the debt.\n\nThe deal does not weigh on Italy's public finances, but Umberto Cherubini, finance professor at Bologna University, dismissed it as \"smoke and mirrors for the benefit of public opinion\" that would be of little use to the banks.\n\nOther fundamental weaknesses of Italian banks also remain unaddressed, analysts said. The government has been urging mergers as a cure for the country's fragmented bank industry, whose low profitability is made worse by the current environment of low interest rates, but deals have been slow to materialize.\n\nAfter rising on Tuesday in anticipation of the accord, Italian banking stocks continued their slide on Wednesday with the sector index closing down 2 percent as uncertainty over lenders' finances and possible capital needs persisted.\n\n\"Markets don't seem very enthusiastic and I can understand that,\" said Francesco Galietti of Rome-based risk consultancy Policy Sonar. \"The real weakness is there are individual bad banks, not a macro systemic one that could solve the problem.\"\n\nShares in the Italian banking sector are down 21 percent this year, with Italy's third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, down by around twice that much.\n\nThe market turmoil sent alarm bells ringing in Rome and Brussels, which both want to avert the possibility of a failing Italian economy that could weigh down the euro zone. A deal was finally reached when the situation had become critical.\n\n'RELAUNCH ECONOMY'\n\nRome passed up the chance of a state-funded \"bad bank\" which cleaned up the balance sheets of lenders in Spain and Ireland in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. At that time it said it didn't need one.\n\nWhen the situation changed due to the worst economic slump since World War II, it had missed the boat because stricter rules on state aid had been introduced after the crisis, in order to shield taxpayers.\n\nAs hopes of a major breakthrough with the Commission dwindled, Renzi stressed last week that \"the best way to solve the problem of banks' bad loans is to relaunch the economy\".\n\nHere too, there is no quick fix for what has been the euro zone's most sluggish economy over the last decade. Italian gross domestic product is estimated to have grown around 0.8 percent last year, half the euro zone average.\n\n\"Shifting non-performing loans is especially important for Italy because over 95 percent of Italian firms are micro-companies with less than 10 employees, reliant on bank loans for credit,\" said Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Alberto Gallo.\n\nHe added there should be roughly half of the nearly 700 banks that operate in Italy.\n\nUnder the deal they finally cut, banks can sell their bad loans to separate companies or \"special purpose vehicles.\"\n\nA complex system of guarantees offered by the state will allow those companies to offer a higher price for the loans than they would otherwise have done, but it many cases it will still be lower than the loans' book value, forcing the banks to take losses if they want to shift sizeable loan bundles.\n\nItaly lobbied for months for the guarantees to be cheap enough to allow the vehicles to buy the loans at high prices, but the Commission stressed on Tuesday they must be priced at market terms to avoid representing any form of state aid.\n\nMany question marks remain.\n\nFor example, the scheme is voluntary, so it remains to be seen how many banks decide to accept write-downs incurred by selling their bad loans. In the case of Monte Paschi, the ensuing capital shortfall has been estimated at between 2 billion and 5 billion euros.\n\nMoreover, the state guarantee only applies to the securitized loans considered most likely to be repaid, meaning that the banks in deepest trouble, full of very bad quality credit, are the least likely to benefit from the scheme.\n\n\"The delay in the set up of a bad bank leads us to believe the non-performing loan recovery will take longer than we originally expected, and in our view makes (industry) consolidation more urgent to restore confidence,\" Morgan Stanley said in a note.\n\n(Additional reporting by Francesca Landini; Editing by Silvia Aloisi and Pravin Char)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy's deal with the European Commission to help its banks offload b", "title": "Italy gets its deal on bad loans but bank problems persist", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/27/Italy-gets-its-deal-bad-loans-bank-problems-persist", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/italy-banks-bad-loans_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/27/Italy-gets-its-deal-bad-loans-bank-problems-persist", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/italy-banks-bad-loans_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy's deal with the European Commission to help its banks offload b", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Instead, Italian banks can sell bad loans to \"special purpose vehicles\" connected to each bank, at close to market prices.\n\"The real weakness is there are individual bad banks, not a macro systemic one that could solve the problem.\"\nUnder the deal they finally cut, banks can sell their bad loans to separate companies or \"special purpose vehicles.\"\n\"Shifting non-performing loans is especially important for Italy because over 95 percent of Italian firms are micro-companies with less than 10 employees, reliant on bank loans for credit,\" said Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Alberto Gallo.\nFor example, the scheme is voluntary, so it remains to be seen how many banks decide to accept write-downs incurred by selling their bad loans."}
