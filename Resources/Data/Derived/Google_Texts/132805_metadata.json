How else could you deliver a romantic note like \u201cJust sending a preemptive apology, since Valentine\u2019s Day can\u2019t possibly live up to your expectations\u201d? Cofounder and head writer Brook Lundy designed the cards to be the antithesis of the musical color-bomb ecards of yesteryear. He issues a daily assignment to contributors and matches the wittiest responses to anachronistic illustrations culled from image databases. We talked to Lundy about how Someecards has redefined (and profited from) the lowly ecard.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Someecards style? Sarcastic? Cynical?\n\nI\u2019d say honest. It\u2019s probably closer to Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld, because it\u2019s a bit absurd too. We like to play off the minutiae of life and call attention to it in a funny way. When you\u2019re being honest, stuff comes out that people usually don\u2019t talk about because it\u2019s dark, dirty, or inappropriate.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to be more honest than funny?\n\nIt\u2019s the goal. Does everyone really hate Red Sox fans? Do women\u2019s nipples get erect when it\u2019s cold? That\u2019s the fact-checking we\u2019re always doing. If you nail the honesty, you don\u2019t have to work too hard at the make-it-funny\n\npart.\n\nAnd you make money this way?\n\nThe cards are free, but we make money from the ones we create for advertisers like Ford and Clorox. We\u2019ve made them for shows like The Walking Dead and Modern Family. We combine the tone of Someecards with the voice or plot points of the show and release them online the same way as our other cards.\n\nHow many cards do you create each day?\n\nWe aim for six to 10, but it depends on the day and what\u2019s happening. Ecards about Obamacare, no one gives a shit about. But if Miley Cyrus does something crazy, that can give us fodder for the day. Kim Kardashian getting engaged, that was a gold mine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/themes/Phoenix/assets/images/favicon_ie.png", "Section": "Blog", "description": "A combination of deadpan humor and old-timey drawings has transformed Someecards into the Hallmark of the web, with 7 million unique visitors a month.
