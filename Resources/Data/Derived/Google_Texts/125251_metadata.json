Mark Meadows, R-N.C., is the guy helping Cruz keep the strings untangled.\n\nHe\u2019s the author of the House\u2019s version of the famous letter insisting that Republicans make funding the government contingent upon gutting Obamacare. He didn\u2019t, and won\u2019t get Obamacare defunded. But the signatories to that letter are a decent proxy for the group of hard-line Republicans who are holding Boehner\u2019s speakership over his head and thus making the country ungovernable.\n\nSo it was a big surprise when he told reporters on Tuesday that, really, the government shutdown has nothing to do with Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis fight now has become about veterans and about national guard folks that perhaps \u2014 reservists that are not getting paid,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the fight is today. Obamacare is mandatory spending that\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s great news! If the government shutdown fight isn\u2019t about Obamacare anymore, then opening the government back up should be a cinch. Could be done in a matter of minutes.\n\nBut Republicans have no intention of opening the whole government back up. That\u2019s why they spent all of Wednesday passing bills to reopen its narrowest but most visible and high-valence offices. Meadows was clumsily undertaking an act of subterfuge that has united the whole party. An attempt to distract the public and the press from the totem that\u2019s been at the center of the shutdown from the get-go. Unbeknownst to him, Meadows was also challenging the press not to allow itself to get bamboozled by these distractions.\n\nWhen NPR\u2019s Tamara Keith asked the obvious follow-up \u2014 if it\u2019s not about Obamacare anymore, why not pass a complete funding bill? \u2014 Meadows devolved into gibberish and scurried away.\n\nYou can listen to the audio here, courtesy of public radio\u2019s Todd Zwillich.\n\nA complete (or near complete) government shutdown is a big problem for the GOP for two related reasons. First, conservative Republicans have been telegraphing their intention to freak out and shut down the government over Obamacare for months, and now they\u2019ve gone and done it. And so the hardships it causes people create tons of pressure on them \u2014 not Democrats \u2014 to cave.\n\nCaving would mean genuinely giving up on extracting Obamacare concessions, and funding the whole government on a bipartisan basis. But if you only take care of the most glaring hardships \u2014 the ones that befall organized constituencies, Republican constituencies, highly visible constituencies \u2014 suddenly the pressure to cave recedes. Huge parts of the government remain shut down, and Republicans can go right back to demanding Obamacare concessions as the ransom for reopening the parts of the government that benefit the voiceless.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz and co. now claim this dispute is about veterans and reservists.
