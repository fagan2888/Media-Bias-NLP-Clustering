Rick Scott (R) on April 5, 2016. (WFTS-TV)\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott (R) was confronted on Tuesday by a local woman who criticized him for his stances on womens\u2019 reproductive health and the Affordable Care Act, WFTS-TV reported.\n\n\u201cYou cut Medicaid so I couldn\u2019t get Obamacare,\u201d said the woman, who identified herself as 39-year-old Cara Jennings. \u201cYou\u2019re an a*shole. You don\u2019t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here.\u201d\n\nThe face-off, captured on video by a witness, took place after Scott entered a Starbucks in Gainesville. Jennings is seen shushing another woman as she assails Scott, who responds that his administration has created one million jobs.\n\n\u201cA million jobs? Great, who here has a great job?\u201d Jennings asks. \u201cOr is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?\u201d\n\nJennings later told WFTS she was motivated by Scott\u2019s decision to sign a bill cutting funding toward Planned Parenthood clinics in the state.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about whether I should do it or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Here\u2019s my chance to tell the governor how I feel about the horrible bill.\u201d\n\nThe footage also shows Scott leaving the coffee shop after telling Jennings to \u201ctell the truth,\u201d without ordering anything. Jennings said that several customers thanked her for her actions.\n\nWatch the footage, as posted by WFTS, below.\n\n[h/t Gawker]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Rick-Scott-040516-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "\u2018You\u2019re an a*shole!\u2019: Florida woman publicly shames Gov.
