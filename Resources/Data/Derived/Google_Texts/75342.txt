Schieffer noted that Dickerson “sure has the right bloodlines” for the assignment. Dickerson’s mother, Nancy, was the first female correspondent in the CBS News Washington bureau.

Schieffer – the 78-year-old chief Washington correspondent of CBS News – announced Wednesday that he would be leaving the job early this summer. Schieffer has been with CBS News since 1969.

John Dickerson says he’s “honored and excited” by the new job.
