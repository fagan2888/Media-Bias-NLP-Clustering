For further explanation, I emailed their PR contact, Jordyn Lazar.\n\n\u201cBoth Good Stuff Eatery and We, The Pizza have a one percent environmental administration charge added to orders,\" she explained. \"Our company prides itself on Goodness at all levels, including our environmental impact in the world. We used eco-friendly cleaning supplies, recycled construction materials and use local suppliers. These business practices come at a higher cost. We choose to work with environmentally conscious vendors and pay environmental charges to them. This charge offsets a minimal portion of these costs.\n\nWe hope that our customers will continue to support us in our efforts to help make our environmental impacts as minimal as possible. For those who choose not to participate, the charge is immediately removed.\u201d\n\nShe then explained their restaurants are partnering with Plant a Billion Trees and directed me to Good Stuff Eatery\u2019s Environmental section, where it explains, at the bottom of the page,\n\nOur customers are part of the solution with us, 1 percent of your total bill is donated to plant a tree a day and sustain various environmental efforts.\n\nHm, so I wouldn\u2019t have known about this charge if I hadn\u2019t happened to notice the fine print on my receipt and asked an employee, or gone to their web page and scrolled down. After doing more research, it appeared I wasn\u2019t the only customer to be a little irked about this largely hidden fee. Here were just a few of the comments from Popville.com regarding the tax:\n\n\u201cYeah, sounds like a 1 percent arbitrary-markup-but-if-you-call-us-on-it-we\u2019ll-just-drop-it tax. pretty cheeky.\u201d \u201cReminds me of the \u2018hazardous waste\u2019 fee or \u2018shop materials\u2019 fee with an oil change. It\u2019s just a way to weasel more money out of the customer without being upfront about it. Sketchy sketchy sketchy.\u201d\n\nSpike Mendelsohn, a former contestant on Bravo TV\u2019s \"Top Chef,\" opened Good Stuff Eatery on Capitol Hill in 2008, and then We, the Pizza in 2010. He gave an interview in the Washington Post a few years ago about his restaurants and received a blunt question from one customer about their environmental charge.\n\n\u201cIf you really want me to know what I'm paying for, why not a line item breakdown of all the costs that go into a $4 slice of pizza? How much the dough and ingredients cost etc. I applaud you wanting to be environmental, I think its very noble. But you are really, really rubbing customers the wrong way with this \"tax\" - and on top of that passing it off like you are doing us a favor.\u201d\n\nMendelsohn responded:\n\n\u201cI think I know who you are and I'm sorry that you feel that way but the answer you're looking for. I think I have explained to you before... We do a lot of green stuff in the company and it cost us a pretty penny. The environment tax comes out to a couple of pennies on your bill and we will always happily refund if you want.\u201d\n\nIt may cost Mendelsohn\u2019s company a pretty penny, but why should customers be the ones to provide them? Not everyone is as adamant about being green and, while many may applaud the restaurateur\u2019s environmental efforts, customers didn\u2019t ask him to employ these green practices, so why should they have to fund them? What if, instead of planting a tree, they just want to enjoy a shake and burger?\n\nIt looks like this tax is not only going to be limited to DC. Mendelsohn is opening a new Good Stuff Eatery in Philadelphia as it continues expanding. And, considering the Good Stuff Eatery employee's earlier comments about them not \"hiding\" the environmental charge \"like others\" do, it makes me wonder how many other restaurants are charging customers more green for being green.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be upset if you were being charged a not-so-advertised environmental fee, or do you think it's an ideal way to promote a noble effort?\n\nRegardless of your opinion, hopefully this will encourage you to read your receipts before taking the first bite.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Want a hidden environmental fee with your burger? .05/23/2016 22:30:02PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Want a hidden environmental fee with your burger?", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - \"Enviro Charge\": DC Restaurants\u2019 \"Transparent\" Green Tax", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2013/12/03/enviro-charge-dc-restaurants-hidden-environmental-tax-n1756622", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/270/2011-09-27T130214Z_01_THR04_RTRIDSP_0_BELGIUM.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Want a hidden environmental fee with your burger?", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - \"Enviro Charge\": DC Restaurants\u2019 \"Transparent\" Green Tax", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2013/12/03/enviro-charge-dc-restaurants-hidden-environmental-tax-n1756622", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/270/2011-09-27T130214Z_01_THR04_RTRIDSP_0_BELGIUM.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\"Enviro Charge\": DC Restaurants\u2019 \"Transparent\" Green Tax , Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8809\"", "article_summary": "Before I enjoyed my Toasted Marshmallow milkshake from Good Stuff Eatery, a local Washington, DC establishment, I noticed a tax on my receipt that said, \"enviro charge.\"\n\u201cBoth Good Stuff Eatery and We, The Pizza have a one percent environmental administration charge added to orders,\" she explained.\nHe gave an interview in the Washington Post a few years ago about his restaurants and received a blunt question from one customer about their environmental charge.\nMendelsohn is opening a new Good Stuff Eatery in Philadelphia as it continues expanding.\nAnd, considering the Good Stuff Eatery employee's earlier comments about them not \"hiding\" the environmental charge \"like others\" do, it makes me wonder how many other restaurants are charging customers more green for being green."}
