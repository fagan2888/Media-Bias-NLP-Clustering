CORNWALL -- A father and son have been slapped with a 10-year ban on owning pets after their six-month-old puppy died after being denied essential medical care.

Mike Seguin Sr. and Mike Seguin Jr. of Cornwall pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges under the Ontario SPCA Act on Sept. 23 claiming they could not afford the medical costs following an incident back in July when a bone had been caught in the Mastiff's throat.

The Ontario SPCA received a call from Seguin Sr. saying that the dog had died and requested that officers remove the dead dog.

After the officers investigated, they found that the dog had not been eating and was vomiting because of the dislodged bone.

However, it was later determined by a veterinarian that the dog had parvovirus.

The men were charged with causing an animal to be in distress and failing to provide the care necessary for an animal's general welfare.

Along with 10 years probation from living with, caring for or owning any animals, they got an extra two years probation and were ordered to pay $100 each in restitution to the Ontario SPCA.

However, an exception was made in regards to two cats that belong to Seguin Sr.'s elderly mother who lives with the men.

They've been ordered to have the two cats examined by a veterinarian within the next six months and must send the report to the Ontario SPCA.Â‹
