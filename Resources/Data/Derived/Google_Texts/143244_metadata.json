A famously congested city to begin with, a worker\u2019s strike during the World Cup\u2014as international tourists pour in\u2014would wreak havoc.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAnd last week in the capital city of Brasilia, indigenous protesters clashed with riot police on horseback as they voiced their anger at the dissonance between money spent on the games and the lack of resources available to the nation\u2019s consistently neglected and disregarded populations.\n\n\u201cWho is the Cup for? Not us!\u201d the demonstrators shouted. \u201cI don\u2019t want the Cup, I want money for health and education.\u201d\n\nA year ago, when Brazil hosted the regional Confederations Cup tournament, more than a million people took to the streets for similar reasons in a series of marches and protests that brought the normal workings of several cities to a halt.\n\nIn anticipation of continued protest and public discontent , Brazil\u2019s President Dilma Roussef vowed on Tuesday to make \u201csecurity\u201d a top priority. According to Agence France-Presse, the nation\u2019s \u201cmilitary police units have been kitted out with hi-tech uniforms making their members look like something out of Robocop,\u201d a science fiction movie about a part-human, part-machine police officer. AFP addes\n\nAround 157,000 troops and police will be deployed across the 12 host venues for the Cup, running from June 12-July 13. Some 20,000 private security agents will also be on hand in the stadiums \u2014 some 1,800 per venue in an $860 million operation. In addition, 120 police officers from 40 countries will collaborate with the Brazilian authorities as they jointly collate and assess intelligence.\n\n________________________________\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.\n\nThis article was published by Common Dreams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Demonstrators call out government for spending billions on soccer tournament as poor sidelined and public services are diminished nationwide.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Demonstrators call out government for spending billions on soccer tournament as poor sidelined and public services are diminished nationwide.", "title": "Brazil Readies 'RoboCop' Riot Squads For World Cup Protests", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/brazil-readies-robocop-riot-squads-world-cup-protests/192078/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/082313_police_4x3.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-06T11:20:59-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Demonstrators call out government for spending billions on soccer tournament as poor sidelined and public services are diminished nationwide.", "creator": "@jonqueally", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/082313_police_4x3.jpg", "title": "Brazil Readies 'RoboCop' Riot Squads For World Cup Protests", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "World Cup", "published_time": "2014-06-07T05:00:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T11:20:59-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc151\"", "article_summary": "Brazil Readies \u2018RoboCop\u2019 Riot Squads For World Cup ProtestsDemonstrators call out government for spending billions on soccer tournament as poor sidelined and public services are diminished nationwide.\nA famously congested city to begin with, a worker\u2019s strike during the World Cup\u2014as international tourists pour in\u2014would wreak havoc.\nIn anticipation of continued protest and public discontent , Brazil\u2019s President Dilma Roussef vowed on Tuesday to make \u201csecurity\u201d a top priority.\nAFP addesAround 157,000 troops and police will be deployed across the 12 host venues for the Cup, running from June 12-July 13.\nIn addition, as of Thursday, the union of metro workers in San Paulo announced it was going on strike to protest low wages."}
