Just ask him. \u201cI\u2019m not very popular in Washington right now\u201d was his opening line at a series of town-hall meetings in New Hampshire, two weeks after he had filibustered and, temporarily, crashed the bulk collection of phone data by the federal government. \u201cI messed up their Memorial Day plans.\u201d The line drew laughter and applause in the great state of New Hampshire, a flinty and skeptical province. Anything that gums up the federal machine is a good thing, it seems, even if it involves national security. \u201cOne of my colleagues asked, \u2018What do we do if the authority to collect data lapses?'\u201d he continued. \u201cI told him, \u2018Well, we could rely on the Constitution for a few hours.'\u201d\n\n\n\nMore applause\u2013but weaker this time. This was relatively esoteric stuff, and Paul had to explain himself: He\u2019s in favor of using search warrants to collect the phone data of suspected terrorists, just not bulk collection of all the phone records of all the people, which he believes is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure. He goes all the way back to the colonial lawyer James Otis, who fought unwarranted search procedures by the British. His audiences stay with him as he explains all this. He speaks plainly and well, without bombast or frills. He knows his stuff. But this is not the sort of thing Republican audiences expect from their candidates. It\u2019s more educational than emotional. He doesn\u2019t speak in any detail about Obamacare, immigration, Iran, abortion or gay rights.\n\nBy the time his 15-minute stump speech is over, he has delivered a tutorial about the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth and 10th amendments to the Constitution. \u201cWe Republicans won\u2019t be successful as a party,\u201d he says, \u201cuntil we support the entire Bill of Rights as enthusiastically as we support the Second Amendment\u201d\u2013that is, the right to bear arms.\n\nRand Paul has a following in the GOP, just as his father Ron Paul did. But he\u2019s a far more interesting candidate. Paul the Elder had cranky tendencies, railing against the Federal Reserve and in favor of hard currency. Paul the Younger has softer edges; he is an ideologue, but a supple and eclectic one\u2013he talks about things his father never did, and his party doesn\u2019t much, like the justice system in poor black neighborhoods (Sixth Amendment: right to a trial by jury). He tells his Republican audiences the outrageous story of Kalief Browder, a black teenager who was arrested in New York City for allegedly stealing a backpack\u2013he claimed he was innocent, refused to plea-bargain\u2013and spent 1,000 days in jail awaiting trial. Browder committed suicide in early June. \u201cNo wonder people in those neighborhoods are pretty angry,\u201d he says.\n\nPaul drives his fellow Republicans crazy with his foreign policy views, which are the opposite of the frothing militarism of the John McCain wing of the party. He\u2019s not an isolationist, but not exactly a \u201crealist\u201d either. \u201cWe should arm the Kurds,\u201d he told me, sipping water at a diner in Derry. \u201cThey\u2019re about the only ones who are really fighting ISIS.\u201d I pointed out that the Egyptians were fighting ISIS too, in Libya and Sinai. He considered this for a moment, then said, \u201cYeah, but they put thousands of people in jail for dissent.\u201d It was a purist answer: he wasn\u2019t ready to support an oppressive state, even if it was fighting on our side against a mortal enemy.\n\nThe current conventional wisdom is that Paul doesn\u2019t have much of a chance to win the nomination\u2013even though, according to a recent poll, he runs stronger against Hillary Clinton than any other Republican does. But his message is fresh and consequential. It throws a klieg light on the deficiencies of the two major parties: the mindless Republican war-silliness and the utter failure of the Democratic welfare state to alleviate intergenerational poverty. \u201cI was on the South Side of Chicago a few weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the people there know the current system isn\u2019t working. They\u2019re about ready to try something new.\u201d\n\nBut what? His \u201csolutions\u201d\u2013like lower taxes on businesses in poor neighborhoods\u2013are insufficient, and his libertarianism doesn\u2019t begin to address the deficit of individual responsibility that plagues our communities, poor and rich alike. I\u2019d love to hear what he has to say about what democracy demands from its citizens. Still, he is attempting something that few candidates will risk\u2013an intelligent conversation, on issues that really matter. I\u2019m thrilled he\u2019s in the race.\n\nThis appears in the June 22, 2015 issue of TIME.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The candidate has proven chatty and thoughtful", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The candidate has proven chatty and thoughtful", "title": "How Rand Paul Has Already Changed the 2016 Race", "url": "http://time.com/3917723/chatty-and-thoughtful-rand-paul-has-already-changed-the-2016-race/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/rand-paul4.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/rand-paul4.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The candidate has proven chatty and thoughtful", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Rand Paul Has Already Changed the 2016 Race"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "joe klein", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "joe klein"}, "article_summary": "Rand Paul has a following in the GOP, just as his father Ron Paul did.\nRand Paul has been a bad, bad boy.\nPaul the Elder had cranky tendencies, railing against the Federal Reserve and in favor of hard currency.\nThe current conventional wisdom is that Paul doesn\u2019t have much of a chance to win the nomination\u2013even though, according to a recent poll, he runs stronger against Hillary Clinton than any other Republican does.\nHe goes all the way back to the colonial lawyer James Otis, who fought unwarranted search procedures by the British."}
