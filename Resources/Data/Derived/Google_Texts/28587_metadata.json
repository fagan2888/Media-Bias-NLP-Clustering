(RNS Image)\u201cEvangelical leaders are tripping over themselves in the rush to stand with Roman Catholic bishops against this perceived governmental overreach,\u201d Jacob Lupfer, a doctoral candidate in political science at Georgetown University, said in a Religion News Service commentary in December. \u201cAt the same time, a growing number of white evangelical leaders are attempting to sow seeds of doubt about the morality of birth control itself.\u201d\n\nAl Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., responded that on that point, Lupfer \u201cunderstates his own case.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good many evangelicals hope to do far more than sow seeds of doubt about the morality of birth control,\u201d Mohler replied. \u201cOur concern is to raise an alarm about the entire edifice of modern sexual morality and to acknowledge that millions of evangelicals have unwittingly aided and abetted that moral revolution by an unreflective and unfaithful embrace of the contraceptive revolution.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 column for the Christian Post, Mohler said most evangelical Protestants welcomed the development of artificial birth control as a medical advance just as they celebrated the discovery of penicillin. A shift occurred in the 1980s, with the rise of the Religious Right and opposition to abortion on demand.\n\nContraceptives vs abortifacients\n\nAffirming life as sacred at the moment of conception caused many to view intrauterine devices not as contraceptives but abortifacients, he said, and that conviction has extended to the use of oral contraceptives.\n\nThomas White, former professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and now president of Cedarville University, has denounced birth-control pills as \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Thomas White, then a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and now president of Cedarville University, made headlines in a seminary chapel sermon denouncing birth-control pills as \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cnot correct according to Scripture\u201d and\u2014in cases where the pill functions to prevent a fertilized ovum from implanting in the uterus\u2014\u201cmurder of a life.\u201d\n\nWhite later clarified he didn\u2019t mean to imply that all forms of birth control are murder but only the kind that \u201cends life after conception.\u201d\n\nAn 'early abortion'\n\nSouthwestern Seminary First Lady Dorothy Patterson once warned in an article that many women who believe life begins at conception are unaware oral contraceptives sometimes are effective by preventing a fertilized ovum from implanting, \u201cresulting in what is actually an early abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile taking an oral contraceptive is certainly not equal to purposely getting an abortion, the ethical considerations are similar,\u201d she writes. \u201cOne function of oral contraceptives is to help prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg. If life begins at conception, this function of the pill is not contraceptive but abortive.\u201d\n\nPatterson urged Christian women to consider if \u201cthe use of oral contraceptives truly is compatible with a pro-life stance.\u201d For many women, she said, the issue of whether to use the pill revolves around the issue of convenience. \u201cIs mere convenience a good enough reason to take a drug that may terminate human life, no matter how low the risk is?\u201d she asked.\n\nSome of the Duggar family in 2011.But medical considerations aren\u2019t the only thing driving second thoughts about birth control. Some, like the Southern Baptist Duggar family from Arkansas featured on TLC\u2019s 19 Kids and Counting, subscribe to a \u201cfull quiver\u201d theology, which leaves it up to God to \u201copen or close the womb\u201d without the aid of surgery or pills.\n\nPatriarchy groups speak of a \u201cmilitant fecundity\u201d in obedience to God\u2019s command to \u201cbe fruitful and multiply\u201d in Genesis 1:28.\n\n\u201cIt is the duty of Christians to bear large families full of godly seed to populate the earth and bring forth what God intended us to have, particularly in America,\u201d Cynthia Kunsman, a writer and blogger who specializes in spiritual-abuse issues, described the worldview at a 2008 conference at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get our Christian America.\u201d\n\n'Saved through childbearing'\n\nBruce Ware, professor of Christian theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, suggests that \u201cwomen will be saved through childbearing\u201d in 1 Timothy 2:15 should be taken literally, noting the Greek word translated in the New Testament as \u201csaved\u201d always refers to eternal salvation.\n\nRussell MooreSome theologians, like SBC Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission head Russell Moore, don\u2019t believe every act of intercourse must be left open to the possibility of conception. But they reject a \u201ccontraceptive culture\u201d that views children not as a blessing but rather an inconvenience to be avoided or postponed.\n\n\u201cI wonder how many Southern Baptist parents tell their newly married children to \u2018wait till you get settled\u2019 before having children so \u2018you can enjoy each other,\u2019 as though children will mean the end of romance,\u201d Moore wrote in 2006. \u201cI wonder how many Southern Baptist churches greet a family with four or more children with a snide comment from a Baby Boomer about whether \u2018you know what\u2019s causing that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder how many churches recruit older women to teach our girls that the greatest success they can find is not to be the first Southern Baptist female president of the United States or to tithe more money as a monied Southern Baptist bank executive but to be a wife and mother,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cIs it indicative of how far we\u2019ve fallen for the American dream that it would be controversial in some conservative Southern Baptist churches even to say this?\u201d\n\nMohler asserts the contraceptive culture has weakened the institution of marriage. \u201cThe pill was the chemical agent for making the sexual revolution possible,\u201d he observed in 2010. \u201cThe pill made sex outside of marriage far easier to conceal, lowering the social cost of extramarital and premarital sex.\u201d\n\nMoore wondered in 2011 if American evangelicals \u201cunwittingly traded the Blessed Virgin Mary for Margaret Sanger,\u201d originator of the phrase \u201cbirth control\u201d and its best-known advocate, who died in 1966.\n\nIn 2005 Mohler told the Chicago Tribune a decision by a married couple to refrain from having children was a violation of God\u2019s will, adding that rather than being concerned about overpopulation, he was concerned about under-population.\n\n\u201cWe are barely replenishing ourselves,\u201d Mohler said. \u201cThat is going to cause huge social problems in the future.\u201d\n\nMiguel De La TorreMiguel De La Torre, a professor at the Iliff School of Theology in Denver and regular contributor of ABPnews/Herald commentaries, read Mohler\u2019s reference as \u201ca race-based warning\u201d of upcoming demographic shifts.\n\nObserving in a 2005 commentary on EthicsDaily.com that the United States population is growing but growth rates are much higher among blacks, Asians, Hispanics and other races than whites, De La Torre accused Mohler of using \u201cwhite-supremacy code language advocating for the increase of white babies.\u201d\n\nDe La Torre termed Mohler\u2019s argument \u201ca call for white fecundity, lest America becomes overrun with \u2018colored\u2019 children, which would only lead, as Mohler puts it, to huge social problems in the future.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoore says Southern Baptists need to increase their birth rate if they are going to keep up with growing denominations like Mormons and the Church of God. \u201cLet\u2019s outbreed the Mormons and out-preach the Pentecostals,\u201d Moore encouraged Southern Baptists in 2006.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article was corrected March 11 to clarify a quote in the 14th paragraph.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Questions about the morality of birth control increasingly appear in columns and blogs by SBC ethicists and ministers.", "generator": "Joomla!
