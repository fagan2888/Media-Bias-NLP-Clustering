With school starting soon and temperatures beginning to cool, kids are looking back and wondering if they made the most of their summer. For those who attended New Haven's Eco Adventure Extreme Camp, the answer is likely: Yes!

According to The National Summer Learning Association, "More than half of the achievement gap between lower- and higher-income youth can be explained by unequal access to summer learning opportunities." Subsidized by the city and run through the Parks and Recreation Department, The Eco Adventure Extreme Camp seeks to address this issue.

While not free, the camp does strive to accommodate children of all income levels, regardless of their family's ability to pay. The camp runs throughout the summer in two-week sessions, providing all necessary equipment as well as meals.

Joshua Green, 13, from New Haven, explained why he returns to the program each summer. "It's fun because it's not just the same thing every day," he said. "Today, we'll go mountain biking, and tomorrow, we'll go kayaking. It's something new every day, and that's why I've kept coming back. It's a new adventure every time I come here."

Rafting, rock climbing, scuba-diving, archery, and overnight camping are just a few of the additional activities children experience at the Eco Adventure Extreme Camp.
