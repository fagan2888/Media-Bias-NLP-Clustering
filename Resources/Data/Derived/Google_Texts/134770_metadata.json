According to a CNN poll conducted in August of this year just 13 percent of Americans say the government can be trusted to do what is right always or most of the time, with just over three-quarters saying only some of the time and one in 10 saying they never trust the government.\n\nSimilarly, a Gallup Organization poll conducted in September, found slightly more than one in four Americans say they are satisfied with the way the nation is being governed, while nearly three in four are dissatisfied.
