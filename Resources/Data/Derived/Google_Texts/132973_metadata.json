How much consumers do or don\u2019t spend.\n\nThe latest information suggests that the middle class just isn\u2019t spending as much as it used to \u2014 and certainly not nearly as much as the rich do.\n\nHere to explain what the income divide means for businesses, we are joined by New York Times reporter Nelson Schwartz.\n\nSo in your story you looked at everything from refrigerators to hotel rooms \u2014 what are the businesses telling you?[nh_links align=\u201dright\u201d]\n\nNELSON SCHWARTZ: Basically that things are pretty stagnant in the middle of the economic sphere. Basically at the upper end \u2013 upper-end restaurants doing well. In the middle tier it\u2019s a very different story. I looked, in the restaurant space, at Olive Garden and Red Lobster are having a hard whereas Capitol Grill is doing very well. They are all owned by the same company, Darden. It\u2019s just very, very different trends. It\u2019s not as if people don\u2019t like the food at Olive Garden or Red Lobster because we\u2019re seeing the same thing going on in hotels, casinos and stores. Like Loehmann\u2019s is going out of business; Sears and JC Penny having a hard time but the dollar stores doing well. You\u2019re really seeing it in sector after sector.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So what\u2019s contributing to these divergent trends? Why are perhaps the rich spending more or the middle class spending less?\n\nNELSON SCHWARTZ: I think it\u2019s a couple of things. Primarily it\u2019s that people who own assets like real estate, like stocks are doing very well. The stock market is up \u2013 the housing market \u2014 big rebounds since 2008. If you\u2019re just depending on salaries though there is no growth in income. I think that\u2019s a big factor. Even as costs of things like healthcare and education are going up so what are middle class people going to cut back on? They\u2019re going to cut back on going to restaurants. They\u2019re going to cut back on shopping for clothes and that kind of thing. I think that\u2019s really driving it.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So what are the longer-term consequences if there\u2019s a middle class that\u2019s eroding its purchasing power?\n\nNELSON SCHWARTZ: The problem is that the economy can grow just based on consumption growth at the very, very top end. Just putting aside questions of fairness or social mobility \u2013 the economy can grow, but it can\u2019t grow that fast. So let\u2019s say right now the economy is growing at two percent which isn\u2019t enough to bring down unemployment very substantially. It can grow at that pace but we\u2019d like to see growth at say three, three and a half percent like we saw in the 90s and that\u2019s not going to happen if the bottom 80 percent of the population is left behind in terms of benefitting from growth.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So when you look at those numbers the bottom 80 percent is spending about as much as the top five percent are.\n\nNELSON SCHWARTZ: The growth, basically we found working with economists at the Washington University of St. Louis and the Federal Reserve of St. Louis, we found that basically if you looked at how much of the consumption growth came from the different categories. Basically, the top 20 percent consumption increased about 17 percent; whereas consumption has only grown about one percent from the bottom 80. So that increase is really driven by wealthier households.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Nelson Schwarz from the New York Times thanks so much.\n\nNELSON SCHWARTZ: Great to be here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Businesses across the country are dealing with a serious post-recession reality: a shrinking middle class consumer base.
