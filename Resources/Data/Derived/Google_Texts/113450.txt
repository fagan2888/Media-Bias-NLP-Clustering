The Denver Post has launched its annual contest for guest columnists, called Colorado Voices.

The first Colorado Voices panel was chosen in 1999. Since then, we’ve published the work of nearly 300 writers under the Voices banner on the pages of The Denver Post as well as online at denverpost.com/opinion.

The main requirement: Write about subjects of local, state or regional interest.

To apply:

• Send us two examples of your writing, each no more than 650 words, and a cover letter that gives us an idea of who you are and what you could contribute to The Post.

• Include your name, address and phone number.

• If you’re a student, note that in the subject line.

• E-mail your entries to voices@denverpost.com (no attachments, please). Or mail them to Barbara Ellis, Denver Post Editorial Page, 101 W. Colfax Ave., Suite 800, Denver, CO 80202.Deadline is midnight Jan. 11.

Note: The Denver Post does not pay Colorado Voices columnists.

If writing columns isn’t for you, consider a letter to the editor (maximum 150 words, sent to openforum@denverpost.com) or a guest commentary (maximum 600 words, sent to columns@denverpost.com).
