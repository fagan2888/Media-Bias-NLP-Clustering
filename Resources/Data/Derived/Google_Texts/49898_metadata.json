Only where the problem isn\u2019t straightforward should blood tests and so on be ordered.\u201d\n\nHe said pet owners should ask more questions of vets and even seek a second opinion.\n\nHis comments came in the wake of a new claim of \u201cover-servicing\u201d in the veterinary industry, drawing an angry reaction from some vets, as preventive pet healthcare and hi-tech diagnostics are now the \u201cgold standard\u201d taught in veterinary schools.\n\n\u201cIf you are happy with receiving cut-price, low-quality care for your animal despite your highly educated vet advising you otherwise, I cannot stop you from seeking that,\u201d one vet wrote in response.\n\nOPINION: A trip to the vet shouldn\u2019t include a scalping\n\nYvonne Merritt took her cat to the vet for a dental clean. She was told it would cost her $500 because the cat would need a general anaesthetic.\n\nBefore she picked up her cat, the vet called her and said he needed to put three stitches in an old wound that she knew had healed. For that she was quoted an extra $450.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pay the extra. It was ridiculous. I\u2019m a self-funded retiree \u2014 you don\u2019t expect to be taken for a ride by your vet,\u201d said Mrs Merritt. She has found a new vet.\n\n\u201cBut the whole industry is getting a bad name because the minority do the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nMrs Merritt was one of dozens of pet owners to contact the Sunday Herald Sun after an opinion piece published this week suggested some vets used owners\u2019 ignorance and guilt to sell treatments. They told of:\n\nA VET who refused to put down a very old and incontinent cat and instead offered a three-month course of anti- depressants;\n\nTHE owner of an eight-week-old Chihuahua was told it needed operations on both its back legs \u2014 at $2000 a leg. The operation was refused and, several years later, the dog has no leg problems; and\n\nA SPECIALIST rabbit vet charged $700 to file a pet \u00adrabbit\u2019s teeth.\n\nAustralian Veterinary \u00adAssociation president Ben Gardiner welcomed what he said was a \u201creasonable debate\u201d highlighting the issue.\n\nWhere problems weren\u2019t life-threatening, vets should not make people feel guilty for opting out, particularly because of cost, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be concerned if any vet in the association was doing that,\u201d he said, adding that sometimes pet owners should think on the options overnight.\n\nruth.lamperd@news.com.au", "article_metadata": {"description": "PET owners are being pressured by guilt into spending hundreds of dollars for expensive and unnecessary tests, says the RSPCA.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "HeraldSun", "description": "PET owners are being pressured by guilt into spending hundreds of dollars for expensive and unnecessary tests, says the RSPCA.", "title": "Owners get a guilt trip at the vets to add to bill", "url": "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/owners-get-a-guilt-trip-at-the-vets-to-add-to-bill/story-fni0fit3-1226834827207", "image": "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/02/22/1226834/828978-1bf35dfc-9aa3-11e3-ae2a-c06439f32ae2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/02/22/1226834/828978-1bf35dfc-9aa3-11e3-ae2a-c06439f32ae2.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@theheraldsun", "id": "@theheraldsun"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135469303148773}, "articleid": 1226834827207, "keywords": "pet owners, dental clean, unnecessary tests, preventive pet healthcare, Association president, incontinent cat, Ruth Lamperd, Yvonne Merritt, angry reaction, self-funded retiree, lower-cost option, low-quality care, hi-tech diagnostics, Ben Gardiner, educated vet advising, rabbit vet, veterinary industry, veterinary schools, reasonable debate, diagnostic testing", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Feb 22 21:13:16 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Feb 22 21:13:16 EST 2014", "author": "Ruth Lamperd"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1ec\"", "article_summary": "Owners get a guilt trip at the vets to add to billPET owners are being pressured by guilt into spending hundreds of dollars for expensive and unnecessary tests, says the RSPCA.\nOnly where the problem isn\u2019t straightforward should blood tests and so on be ordered.\u201dHe said pet owners should ask more questions of vets and even seek a second opinion.\n\u201cI\u2019d be concerned if any vet in the association was doing that,\u201d he said, adding that sometimes pet owners should think on the options overnight.\nOPINION: A trip to the vet shouldn\u2019t include a scalpingYvonne Merritt took her cat to the vet for a dental clean.\nWhere problems weren\u2019t life-threatening, vets should not make people feel guilty for opting out, particularly because of cost, he said."}
