Police say the investigation is continuing.\n\nIn 1980, Lee ruled that parents of three white girls could transfer their custody to friends so the girls could stay at an all-white school. Federal courts overruled him.\n\nLee said his \"Buckeye Three\" rulings were not about race, but about whether federal courts have any say over family law.\n\nIn a 1986 case about purging voter rolls, he ruled that state Republicans were illegally trying to shed black voters during a U.S. Senate race.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Louisiana judge who made national headlines in the 1980s for defying a federal desegregation order has been found dead in his law office.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/Judge-from-1980s-desegregation-case-found-dead-in-law-office-365589951.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/law+court+legal+lawyer+judge.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Louisiana judge who made national headlines in the 1980s for defying a federal desegregation order has been found dead in his law office.", "title": "Judge from 1980s desegregation case found dead in law office"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A Louisiana judge who made national headlines in the 1980s for defying a federal desegregation order has been found dead in his law office.", "title": "Judge from 1980s desegregation case found dead in law office", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/Judge-from-1980s-desegregation-case-found-dead-in-law-office-365589951.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/law+court+legal+lawyer+judge.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Judge from 1980s desegregation case found dead in law office", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Judge from 1980s desegregation case, found dead in law office"}, "article_summary": "A judge who made national headlines in the 1980s for defying a federal desegregation order has been found dead in his law office.\nLee said his \"Buckeye Three\" rulings were not about race, but about whether federal courts have any say over family law.\nIn 1980, Lee ruled that parents of three white girls could transfer their custody to friends so the girls could stay at an all-white school.\nFederal courts overruled him.\nIn a 1986 case about purging voter rolls, he ruled that state Republicans were illegally trying to shed black voters during a U.S. Senate race."}
