A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that just 34% believe Clinton is unlikely to have done anything illegal. This includes 42% who say it is Very Likely Clinton broke the law and only 15% who think it\u2019s Not At All Likely.\n\nWhat's worse, a sizable number of Democrats believe her to be guilty.\n\nEven among her fellow Democrats, 37% think it\u2019s likely Clinton broke the law while using the private e-mail server at the State Department, with 16% who say it\u2019s Very Likely.\n\nMen and those 40 and over are more likely to think Clinton broke the law than women and younger voters are. But most voters in nearly every demographic group say Clinton is likely to have broken the law.\n\nThese findings should make the Clinton camp shudder. Why would Americans vote for someone they don't trust?\n\nClinton perhaps fooled the public into thinking she was being accountable for her actions by handing her emails back to the State Department, but a new report revealed that there is a five-month gap in the document dump her staff reluctantly provided.\n\nI think it's time to take that survey again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More bad news for Team Clinton..05/26/2016 3:32:21AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "More bad news for Team Clinton.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Yikes: Voters in Nearly Every Demographic Say Hillary Broke the Law", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/09/16/yikes-voters-in-nearly-every-demographic-say-hillary-broke-the-law-n2052631", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/256/9e03bccf-b219-49cd-990e-d18f02f112e6.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "More bad news for Team Clinton.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Yikes: Voters in Nearly Every Demographic Say Hillary Broke the Law", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/09/16/yikes-voters-in-nearly-every-demographic-say-hillary-broke-the-law-n2052631", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/256/9e03bccf-b219-49cd-990e-d18f02f112e6.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Yikes: Voters in Nearly Every Demographic Say Hillary Broke the Law, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d23\"", "article_summary": "But most voters in nearly every demographic group say Clinton is likely to have broken the law.\nMen and those 40 and over are more likely to think Clinton broke the law than women and younger voters are.\nThis includes 42% who say it is Very Likely Clinton broke the law and only 15% who think it\u2019s Not At All Likely.\nVoters think it\u2019s likely Clinton broke the law by sending and receiving e-mails containing classified information through a private e-mail server while serving as secretary of State.\nWhen 1,000 voters were asked if former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton broke the law by using a private server to handle classified information, nearly 60 percent said \"yes.\""}
