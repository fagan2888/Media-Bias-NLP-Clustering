It has been a month since Cinda, an elephant from the Sedgwick County Zoo died, leaving her long time friend, Stephanie all along.

Stephanie and Cinda were relocated from South Africa in 1972 and placed in the Sedgwick County Zoo. The pair have been close all those decades, until Cinda died on November 5th.

Melissa Graham of the Sedgwick County Zoo says that elephants are very social and many people were be concerned about Stephanie's emotional health.

Trainers at the zoo have been spending extra time with Stephanie, making sure she has her favorite food, alfalfa grass, to eat. Stephanie also likes to watch television.

Graham says that because Stephanie is alone now, she is getting extra attention. "The animals here are well loved and well cared for and well spoiled," Graham said.
