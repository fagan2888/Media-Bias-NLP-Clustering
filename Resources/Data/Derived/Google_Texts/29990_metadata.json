I think this is one of the worst ones I have seen, yes,\" Elite Limousine owner Glenn Fenwick said.\n\nFenwick was driving home New Year's partiers when he drove up to the scene of the deadly crash at 10th and Sycamore.\n\n\"I think it happened minutes before I got there, if not seconds,\" Fenwick said.\n\nFenwick says it\u2019s frustrating that people still drink and drive.\n\n\"There's so many ways to get a ride home. There are taxi companies, there are limo companies such as myself, there's free rides home last night (New Year\u2019s Eve). No one is saying to not party just to get a ride home; a safe ride home,\" Fenwick said.\n\nAnd according to police if a 20-year-old Sioux Falls man would have followed that advice on New Year's Eve a deadly crash could have been prevented.\n\n\"If he would have just got a ride home everything would have been fine today and unfortunately things like this happen and today he's paying the consequences,\" Fenwick said.\n\nConsequences that are being felt by two families on the first day of 2014.\n\nThe name of the victim has not been released.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "A Sioux Falls family is mourning the loss of a loved one New Year&#39;s Day while a 20-year-old sits in jail following a deadly crash early Wednesday", "title": "SF Limo Driver Describes Deadly New Year's Crash", "url": "http://www.keloland.com/news/article/news/sf-limo-driver-describes-deadly-new-years-crash", "image": "http://assets.keloland.com/images/images/default-source/agriculture/crops/barley/54756.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521498541203189}, "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.3.5630.0 PE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A Sioux Falls family is mourning the loss of a loved one New Year&#39;s Day while a 20-year-old sits in jail following a deadly crash early Wednesday"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0db\"", "article_summary": "Sioux Falls, SDA Sioux Falls family is mourning the loss of a loved one New Year's Day while a 20-year-old sits in jail following a deadly crash early Wednesday morning.\nFenwick was driving home New Year's partiers when he drove up to the scene of the deadly crash at 10th and Sycamore.\nAnd according to police if a 20-year-old Sioux Falls man would have followed that advice on New Year's Eve a deadly crash could have been prevented.\nSioux Falls Police say Oscar Madrigal is charged with vehicular homicide and his second DWI after he drove through a flashing red stop light and hit a minivan, killing the female passenger.\nNo one is saying to not party just to get a ride home; a safe ride home,\" Fenwick said."}
