The weather can make or break a round of golf, so that's why a staff of meteorologists travel on the PGA tour to give officials the most up-to-date information.

The safety of players and spectators is top priority. Heavy rains, strong winds or electrical storms are all grounds to call off a round of golf.

Meteorologist Wade Stettner welcomed Eyewitness News into his makeshift weather center where he set up shop for the week at TPC River Highlands.

"I'm mainly here for weather support for the tournament staff, rules officials," Slettner said. "We're keeping them aware of any changing weather conditions."

Meteorologist stay from the first day until the last put drops Sunday.

Depending on weather conditions, tournament staff can implement a plan of action depending on the situation.
