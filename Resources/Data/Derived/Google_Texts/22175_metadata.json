This includes the FDA-approved Plan B, also known as the \u201cmorning-after pill,\u201d ulipristal acetate, or the \u201cweek-after pill,\u201d and various other intrauterine devices (IUDs).\n\nBecause these contraceptives utilize artificial means to prevent the implantation of a human embryo or remove an implanted embryo from a uterine wall, the Catholic Church, in some cases, views these preventive options as forms of abortion.\n\nHercules Industries, as an employer with more than 50 employees, is required under the Health Care Law to make a qualifying group health care plan available to its employees. As reported in The NEWS Aug. 20, 2012, the company\u2019s lawsuit did not challenge the requirement that it provide a qualifying health care plan \u2014 just the contraceptive mandate.\n\nCompanies that do not provide a qualifying health care plan face financial penalties through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\n\u201cLike any business owner, we operate our business based on a set of principles, and our principles happen to be rooted in our Catholic faith,\u201d said Andy Newland, president, Hercules Industries. \u201cThe government\u2019s plan required coverage of items we feel are contrary to our faith. We felt [a lawsuit] was necessary, and we\u2019re obviously very pleased the court agreed with our contention that this was an invasion of our ability to operate our business in accordance with the principles of our faith.\u201d\n\nIn issuing its permanent injunction on March 16, the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado rejected the Obama administration\u2019s argument that the administration must sign off on the injunction before the court can issue it.\n\n\u201cThis proposed arrogation of authority offends the very structure of our government and ignores the exclusive jurisdictional authority of the U.S. District Court to provide such relief,\u201d the court wrote in its opinion in the case, Newland v. Burwell.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding [the administration\u2019s] suggestion to the contrary, the injunction is entered under the jurisdictional authority of the U.S. District Court and it remains in full force and effect unless and until modified or dissolved by the District Court upon a showing of just cause or by order entered by the Court of Appeals following review.\u201d\n\nThe Newland family, owners of Hercules Industries, was represented by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) attorneys. ADF describes itself as an alliance-building, nonprofit legal organization that advocates for the right of people to freely live out their faith.\n\n\u201cAmericans should be free to live and work according to their faith without fear of punishment by the government,\u201d said Matt Bowman, senior legal counsel, ADF. \u201cIn this country, citizens have always had the freedom to believe, the freedom to express those beliefs, and the freedom to operate their businesses in accordance with those beliefs. The Supreme Court upheld that time-honored principle in its Conestoga/Hobby Lobby decision just last year, and the district court has rightly done the same.\u201d\n\nADF attorneys and allied attorneys represented Conestoga Wood Specialties in its 2014 victory at the U.S. Supreme Court. In that case, the court held that religious owners of closely held corporations can use their religious beliefs to determine what medical treatments will be covered by company health plans.\n\nSome dissenting opinions of that case pointed out that ruling did not take into account the religious beliefs of a corporation\u2019s employees. Newland said, however, that has not been an issue at Hercules.\n\n\u201cOur employees have been overwhelmingly supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everyone may agree with the morality, but, in general, people appreciate standing strong on issues and principles that are important to you, so we\u2019ve heard a lot of support.\u201d\n\nNewland added the company has always provided a very generous health care plan for its employees, long before the Affordable Care Act came along.\n\n\u201cI think many people surmise that we\u2019re just doing this because we don\u2019t like Obamacare in general,\u201d Newland said, \u201cbut that\u2019s certainly not the case. We\u2019re willing to comply with everything we need to, it\u2019s just that there was one small provision we felt was worth standing up against.\u201d\n\nFamily-owned and operated, Hercules Industries\u2019 board of directors is comprised of siblings Paul, James, and William Newland, and Christine Ketterhagen.
