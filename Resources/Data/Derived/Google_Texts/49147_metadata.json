She did not mention, nor was she reminded by any of the reporters present, that as of this writing, at least three UN-run schools in Gaza have been used as rocket warehouses, a gross violation of international law that clearly falls within the category of war crimes. Neither did she mention, nor was she reminded, that in at least two of the three cases cited above, the terror rockets found on UN property in Gaza were returned to Hamas by the UN.\n\n\"What I'm seeing now is a recurrence of the very acts that the Gaza fact-finding mission indicated as constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/08/un_accuses_israel_of_another_war_crime_not_sharing_iron_dome_with_hamas.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: UN accuses Israel of another 'war crime': Not sharing Iron Dome with Hamas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd74\"", "article_summary": "Navi Pillay told reporters following yet another \"emergency\" meeting of the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council that Israel was not doing enough to protect civilians.\n\"What I'm seeing now is a recurrence of the very acts that the Gaza fact-finding mission indicated as constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity,\" she said.\nHamas, the terror group created to pursue the extermination of the Jewish state and now waging a terrorist war against it \u2013 constitutes a war crime against the civilians of Gaza.\nJust because Hamas fires rockets indiscriminately aimed at Israeli civilian population centers without provocation and fires them from within its own population centers does not \u201cabsolve\u201d Israel from its own legal violations, Pillay told reporters Thursday.\nThe UN chairwoman criticized the U.S. for helping fund Israel's Iron Dome system which has saved countless Israeli and Palestinian lives."}
