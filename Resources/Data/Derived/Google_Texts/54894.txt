FORT COLLINS — On Monday, Colorado State opposite hitter Adrianna Culbert — a junior from Delton, Mich. — was named the Mountain West Conference’s volleyball player of the week and the 18-1 Rams jumped a spot in the latest coaches’ poll, to No. 6. And then on Tuesday, she was named ESPNw’s national player of the week.

Culbert is the fourth different Ram in five weeks to be selected for the MW honor, following Kelsey Snider, Marlee Reynolds and Deedra Foss. This is the third time Culbert has won the league honor in her career.

CSU beat Wyoming and Fresno State last week and Culbert averaged 3.0 kills per set in the two matches.

The Rams are at New Mexico Thursday and at Air Force Friday.
