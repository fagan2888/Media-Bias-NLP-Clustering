Ryan, who came to TIME\u2019s office to do an interview for the magazine\u2019s 10 Questions page about his book The Way Forward, says that folks are excited to see him mostly because he\u2019s listening to them.\n\nWhen asked if his experiences in urban neighborhoods had given him any insight to what\u2019s happening in Ferguson, he sounded a few words of caution about rushing to judgment. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to be respectful of what\u2019s happened,\u201d he says, \u201cand try to get to the truth and let the investigation takes its hold.\u201d He also believes that when people think poverty is a problem the government takes care of, they don\u2019t get involved and it isolates poor communities. \u201cAnd so the way I think we ought to approach this is, we\u2019d better be thinking about how to fight poverty eye-to-eye, soul-to-soul, person-to-person and reintegrate our communities instead of isolating people in our communities,\u201d says Ryan.\n\nShifting gears, the former vice presidential candidate said that no further investigation of the President\u2019s attempts at health care reform is necessary. Ryan thinks the health care legislation will collapse under its own weight. \u201cI do believe that we will ultimately repeal this law,\u201d he says of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. \u201cAnd the reason I say that is not because I\u2019m just some optimistic person who\u2019s naive. It\u2019s because I think this law will implode.\u201d Ryan takes particular issue with the IPAB (Independent Payment Advisory Board), the committee set up to manage Medicare costs. \u201cI don\u2019t think people on Medicare will sit with the idea of 15 unelected bureaucrats determining how their care is going to be allocated.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the interview, the Wisconsin congressman declared that\u2014despite putting out a book explaining his background and his policies in quite meticulous detail\u2014he hasn\u2019t decided if he\u2019s going to make a run at the presidency and won\u2019t until 2015. In the meantime, he\u2019s offered up his proposals for immigration reform: secure the border, offer trackable work visas and then give current illegal immigrants a probationary period to become legal, while working.\n\nHe also revealed that whenever there\u2019s a stressful meeting that John Boehner\u2019s leading, he tries to sit way on the other side of the room. Boehner\u2019s a stress-smoker and says Ryan, \u201cI just hate getting that smell in my clothes.\u201d Good to know.\n\nSubscribers can read the full interview here.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Paul Ryan talks about his new book, the riots in Ferguson, and what campaign fundraisers can learn from the Ice Bucket Challenge.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "People are excited to meet their first-ever Republican, he says.", "title": "Paul Ryan Explains What Happens When He Visits Urban Black Communities", "url": "http://time.com/3151010/paul-ryan-ferguson/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/paul-ryan.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/paul-ryan.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Paul Ryan Explains What Happens When He Visits Urban Black Communities", "description": "People are excited to meet their first-ever Republican, he says.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "paul ryan, black, republican, urban, the way forward, ferguson, rand paul, ice bucket challenge, obama care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Black, Republican, Urban, The Way Forward, Ferguson, Rand Paul, Ice Bucket Challenge, Obama Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0ae\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s because I think this law will implode.\u201d Ryan takes particular issue with the IPAB (Independent Payment Advisory Board), the committee set up to manage Medicare costs.\nBoehner\u2019s a stress-smoker and says Ryan, \u201cI just hate getting that smell in my clothes.\u201d Good to know.\n+ READ ARTICLECongressman Paul Ryan, who has been spending some time in the last 18 months visiting urban black neighborhoods, says that he\u2019s often the first Republican the people he talks to there have ever met.\n\u201cAnd so the way I think we ought to approach this is, we\u2019d better be thinking about how to fight poverty eye-to-eye, soul-to-soul, person-to-person and reintegrate our communities instead of isolating people in our communities,\u201d says Ryan.\nRyan thinks the health care legislation will collapse under its own weight."}
