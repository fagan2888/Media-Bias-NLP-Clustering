Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who called Saturday for the law to be defunded or repealed and disputed figures from the administration touting a robust expansion of health insurance coverage under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was supposed to be fully operational by January 1 of this year, but here we are two weeks into 2014, and the administration continues to struggle to implement the law\u2019s burdensome mandates,\u201d Cochran said in the weekly Republican address. \u201cThe law is not living up to the promises made by its supporters, and it is questionable whether the law will meet its fundamental purpose - to significantly expand health insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nThe administration and congressional Democrats have recently been touting the law\u2019s expansion of coverage to roughly nine million Americans - three million young adults who have been able to stay on their parents\u2019 plan, two million consumers who have enrolled in the private insurance exchanges and four million low-income consumers who have been inducted into an expanded Medicaid program.\n\nCochran, however, argued there may be less to those figures than meets the eye.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s enrollment numbers don\u2019t paint a pretty picture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell us how many of the enrollees have actually lost existing coverage and were forced into the exchanges; and the numbers don\u2019t tell us whether applicants have actually paid their premiums and received coverage. There is ample reason to be skeptical that those numbers will improve substantially.\u201d\n\nCochran\u2019s other complaints about the law had a familiar ring: that it\u2019s booting people off of health plans they liked despite the president\u2019s promise that people could keep their current insurance; that it\u2019s forcing people to change doctors; that many consumers are finding their prices going up under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf the law can\u2019t keep its most basic promise, it should be repealed,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe should go back to the drawing board and draft commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will work better for all Americans, without spending billions of taxpayer dollars to support these failing policies.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe again called on Congress to extend recently lapsed federal unemployment insurance - a \u201cvital economic lifeline\u201d that \u201chelps people support their families while they look for a new job.\u201d Democrats and a handful of Republicans have called for a three-month extension while the specifics of a longer deal are worked out, but most in the GOP have been reluctant to extend benefits without offsetting the cost elsewhere in the budget. The president also previewed a series of upcoming events aimed at highlighting high-tech manufacturing jobs, job training programs, and work opportunities for the long-term unemployed. And he offered a glimpse at the central theme of his upcoming State of the Union address: a populist message focused on upward mobility and equality of opportunity. \u201cI will mobilize the country around the national mission of making sure our economy offers everyone who works hard a fair shot at opportunity and success,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Americans, that\u2019s what we should expect. And after everything you\u2019ve done to recover and rebuild from crisis these past five years \u2013 after all your hard work and sacrifice \u2013 that\u2019s what you deserve.\u201d\n\nIn his own weekly address on Saturday, President Obama reprised his call for 2014 to be a \u201cyear of action,\u201d urging lawmakers to help accelerate the economic recovery.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats have touted a robust expansion of insurance coverage, but GOP Sen.
