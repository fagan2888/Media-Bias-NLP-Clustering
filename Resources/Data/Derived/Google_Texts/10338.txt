Conservative San Francisco Bay Area-based radio talk show host Michael Savage took over the time slot occupied by Sean Hannity on New Year's Day. Savage's new show will now be heard live on KSFO 560-AM Noon-3 p.m.

In an article published in the New York Daily News on Monday, Savage promised to offer listeners an alternative to Hannity.

“I know what Sean does,” he told the paper. “He works from Republican Party talking points. He says he doesn’t any more, but he does. “I don’t. You can’t drone on about the Bill of Rights. It’s just not interesting radio. My show is also an Obamacare-free zone. Who wants to hear about that?”

Savage began his radio career in the Bay Area 20 years ago as a fill-in host for KGO radio. In January 1995, he was given a regular show on KGO's sister station KSFO.

Savage is known for his fierce independence often knocking both Democrats and Republicans with equal ferocity. He also had not hesitated to criticize fellow talk show hosts including Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levine, and Glenn Beck when he thinks his they have gone astray.

Although Savage opposes gay marriage, he once told this reporter that he is a sexual libertarian.

I don’t care what people do to stimulate the orifices," Savage said. "That’s the simplest way I could put it.”

Savage’s move means he will take over the coveted 3-6 p.m. afternoon drive time slot in the eastern time slot. His new show began on New Year’s Day with a taped collection of the stories of Savage’s humble upbringing in New York for which Savage is famous. His stories included the famed "Dead Man's Pants," in which Savage described wearing clothes that his father obtained from estate sales.

Savage's first live show in the formerly Hannity slot begins on Thursday, January 2.
