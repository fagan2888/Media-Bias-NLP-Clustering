Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) will run for a 15th term in Congress, she tells The Hill.

Rumors have swirled that Slaughter, 84, might be considering retirement. But she laughed off questions, joking that she was being confused with Rep. Bill Owens (D-N.Y.), who announced he'd leave Congress earlier this week.

"No, that was Owens, he retired," she said with a laugh. "Everyone thought it was me when it said 'Democrat from Upstate,' but it's not me."

Slaughter, the ranking Democrat on the House Rules Committee, said she planned to run for reelection â€” though she left the door a crack open to change her mind.

"I'm for sure [running]. Yeah, as sure as I can be," she said.
