But, Peter Beinart argues, Republican ideological influence is increasing.\n\nThe news from Washington is all about President Obama\u2019s impending triumph in the government shutdown/debt ceiling standoff. \u201cBoehner Blinks,\u201d declared a recent headline in The Washington Post. \u201cRepublicans,\u201d explained ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl, \u201care working out the terms of their surrender.\u201d\n\nIf this is Republican surrender, I hope I never see Republican victory.\n\nTo understand how upside down the current media analysis is, you need to go back a couple of years. In 2011, with Republicans threatening to provoke a debt default, President Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which cut government spending by $917 billion over 10 years. The agreement also created a congressional \u201csupercommittee\u201d charged with finding additional cuts. If the committee failed to do so, cuts totaling $1.2 trillion over ten years would kick in automatically at the end of 2012, via a process called \u201csequestration.\u201d\n\nTraditionally in Washington, budget compromises had meant Democrats agreeing to cut domestic spending and Republicans agreeing to raise taxes. But by raising the specter of default, Republicans had changed the equation. In the Budget Control Act, taxes weren\u2019t raised a dime. Democrats compromised by cutting spending and Republicans \u201ccompromised\u201d by agreeing not to let America default on its debt and provoke a global financial crisis.\n\nNot surprisingly, conservatives liked the deal more than liberals. In the House, Republicans backed it by a margin of almost three to one while Democrats split evenly. \u201cIs this the deal I would have preferred? No,\u201d Obama admitted. By contrast, House Speaker John Boehner boasted, \u201cI got 98 percent of what I wanted.\u201d\n\nFast forward to the beginning of this year. Despite months of negotiations, the supercommittee failed to reach an agreement, and so this March, automatic sequester cuts kicked in. (In between, Congress did raise some revenue by not extending the Bush tax cuts for individuals making over $400,000 a year). If Democrats disliked the 2011 Budget Control Act, they disliked its bastard stepchild, the sequester, even more. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama calls the sequester cuts: \u201charsh\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d and warned that they would \u201cdevastate priorities like education, energy and medical research\u201d and \u201ccost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, being less supportive of federal spending on things like \u201ceducation, energy and medical research,\u201d were more supportive of the sequester. Indeed, as recently as last month, GOP leaders described locking in the sequester cuts\u2014via a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution (CR) that extended them into 2014\u2014as a major victory. In a memo to fellow Republicans on September 6, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor boasted that by \u201csigning a CR at sequester levels, the President would be endorsing a level of spending that wipes away all the increases he and Congressional Democrats made while they were in charge and returns us to a pre-2008 level of discretionary spending.\u201d\n\nThe shutdown according to everyone else.\n\nFor their part, Democrats bristled at the prospect of a \u201cclean\u201d CR. Four days after Cantor\u2019s memo, the Democratic-aligned Center for American Progress warned that by extending the sequester, Republicans were \u201ctrying to lock these additional spending cuts into place and create a new baseline from which future negotiations must begin.\u201d CAP added that \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see why this approach would be attractive to Speaker Boehner; it is much harder to understand why any progressive or centrist would support such an approach.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s pause for a moment to underscore the point. In early September, a \u201cclean\u201d CR\u2014including sequester cuts\u2014that funded the government into 2014 was considered a Republican victory by both the Republican House Majority Leader and Washington\u2019s most prominent Democratic think tank. Now, just over a month later, the media is describing the exact same deal as Republican \u201csurrender.\u201d\n\nPartly, that\u2019s because of Ted Cruz. Starting last month, as we all know, the Texas Senator\u2014in conjunction with his fellow Tea Partiers in the House\u2014forced GOP leaders to abandon the very \u201cclean\u201d CR proposal they had once championed. The new Republican position became no funding for the government and no increase in the debt ceiling without the defunding (or at least delaying) of Obamacare.\n\nNow that Republicans are backing off those demands, the press is saying they\u2019ve caved. But that\u2019s like saying that the neighborhood bully has caved because after demanding your shoes and bike, he\u2019s once again willing to accept merely your lunch money.\n\nMost of the press is missing this because most of the press is covering the current standoff more as politics than policy. If your basic question is \u201cwhich party is winning?\u201d then it\u2019s easy to see the Republicans as losing, since they\u2019re the ones suffering in the polls. But the partisan balance of power and the ideological balance of power are two completely different things. The Nixon years were terrible for the Democratic Party but quite good for progressive domestic policy. The Clinton years were, in important ways, the reverse. The promise of the Obama presidency was not merely that he\u2019d bring Democrats back to power. It was that he\u2019d usher in the first era of truly progressive public policy in decades. But the survival of Obamacare notwithstanding, Obama\u2019s impending \u201cvictory\u201d in the current standoff moves us further away from, not closer to, that goal.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Obama looks likely to accept the sequester cuts as the basis for future budget negotiations. It\u2019s that while he\u2019s been trying to reopen the government and prevent a debt default, his chances of passing any significant progressive legislation have receded. Despite overwhelming public support, gun control is dead. Comprehensive immigration reform, once considered the politically easy part of Obama\u2019s second term agenda, looks unlikely. And the other items Obama trumpeted in this year\u2019s state of the union address\u2014climate change legislation, infrastructure investment, universal preschool, voting rights protections, a boost to the minimum wage\u2014have been largely forgotten.\n\nDemocrats keep holding out hope that losing yet more public support will break the ideological \u201cfever\u201d that grips the Republican Party and help GOP moderates regain power. The problem, as the last few weeks have shown, is that the GOP keeps defining moderation down. For instance, the Washington GOP\u2019s plummeting approval ratings may well boost the presidential prospects of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, just as the Gingrich Congress paved the way for the comparatively moderate George W. Bush. Like Bush, Christie is described as moderate because he has Democratic allies in his home state and because his rhetoric is not as harsh on cultural issues. But in the White House, Bush\u2019s economic policies were hardly moderate. To the contrary, from taxes to social security to regulation, he governed well to the right of Ronald Reagan. Christie likely would as well. As governor, after all, he\u2019s vetoed a hike in the minimum wage, cut the earned income tax credit, vetoed a millionaires\u2019 tax three times and adopted basically the same attitude towards public sector unions as Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "peterbeinart"}, "keywords": "government shutdown, Republican Party, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201310140945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/features/2013/10/the-government-shutdown", "description": "Republicans may be losing public support, but they are increasing their influence in Washington, argues Peter Beinart.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Why the Shutdown is a Republican Victory", "tags": "entity:politicalevent/government_shutdown,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why the Shutdown is a Republican Victory\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/14/why-the-shutdown-is-a-republican-victory.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/14/why-the-shutdown-is-a-republican-victory/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46058487.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/14/why-the-shutdown-is-a-republican-victory\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-14T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. Politics\",\"author\":\"Peter Beinart\",\"tags\":[\"government_shutdown\",\"republican_party\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "government shutdown, Republican Party, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Peter Beinart", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2013-10-14T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/peter-beinarthtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/14/why-the-shutdown-is-a-republican-victory", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Republicans may be losing public support, but they are increasing their influence in Washington, argues Peter Beinart.", "title": "Why the Shutdown is a Republican Victory", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/14/why-the-shutdown-is-a-republican-victory.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/10/14/why-the-shutdown-is-a-republican-victory/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1381754630983.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/p/peter-beinart", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc4b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRepublicans,\u201d explained ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl, \u201care working out the terms of their surrender.\u201dIf this is Republican surrender, I hope I never see Republican victory.\nIn early September, a \u201cclean\u201d CR\u2014including sequester cuts\u2014that funded the government into 2014 was considered a Republican victory by both the Republican House Majority Leader and Washington\u2019s most prominent Democratic think tank.\nDespite months of negotiations, the supercommittee failed to reach an agreement, and so this March, automatic sequester cuts kicked in.\nIn the House, Republicans backed it by a margin of almost three to one while Democrats split evenly.\nIt\u2019s not just that Obama looks likely to accept the sequester cuts as the basis for future budget negotiations."}
