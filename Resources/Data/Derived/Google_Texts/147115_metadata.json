Obamacare, on the other hand, just keeps on going like a cancer that\u2019s ignored, perpetuating itself and destroying everything in its path.\n\nWhile we thought the health care act was a train wreck, it\u2019s more like cancer.\n\nDiscovering you\u2019ve got a problem should be the first step on the road to recovery. You\u2019re supposed to go in and confront it like you would if you found a tumor.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t just leave it there, wondering what it was up to, hoping it would go away on its own. No, you\u2019d enlist some help and take care of business.\n\nWith all the anti-Obamacare rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership, they funded it for another year in the budget agreement.\n\nThat\u2019s like thinking you can trash-talk your cancer into remission, while smoking three packs a day, and putting off that pesky surgery to remove the tumor until later. Genius.\n\nThis last week was a real wake-up call for those still living in the \u201cObamacare is great!\u201d fantasy world, fueled by Richard Simmons videos, tweets by pro athletes, and now television ads (paid for with your tax dollars, of course) featuring singing animals imploring humans to \u201cenroll today.\u201d\n\nOne has to guess that President Obama\u2019s little marketing gurus, once they put the bong down, think strange men exercising in short shorts and singing doggies will entertain you into complete Obamacare submission.\n\nThe happy lull you\u2019re supposed to be in will presumably eclipse news of intelligence reports that Belarus, a former Soviet republic and current Russian ally, managed to insert malicious code into Healthcare.gov.\n\nHeck, forget about hacking; if this is true, the hackers have built themselves into the Obamacare website itself.\n\nOr maybe the Obama White House is hoping you\u2019ll be lighting up your own joint, distracting you from allegations that Covered California, the poster child for \u201csuccessful\u201d Obamacare exchanges, has been misleading people looking for insurance by providing a \u201cphantom list\u201d of doctors attached to their plans.\n\nYou know, hypothetically, to make it seem like you\u2019ll be getting a certain product (which doesn\u2019t really exist), because what they\u2019re really offering isn\u2019t what you want and doesn\u2019t even work.\n\nSo fooling you, by lying about what the situation is, will at least get you to buy into the scheme. That\u2019s weird, but that sounds like something Mr. Obama would do.\n\nOne guy ruined the plan after he purchased health insurance on the California exchange and then had the gall to call doctors to set up an appointment. His temerity drove him to call every doctor listed as in-network, and none of them were.\n\nIn the normal world, this would be called \u201cfraud.\u201d In Obama\u2019s America, it\u2019s called a \u201csnag,\u201d and on a national scale, the Obama regime labels it \u201cShut up, Fox News!\u201d\n\nAfter all, isn\u2019t the goal getting everyone insured? Who cares if you can\u2019t actually see a doctor or get health care, because everyone will get a terrific piece of paper that says \u201chealth insurance policy.\u201d Equality, at last \u2014 everyone\u2019s got the same thing; namely, nothing at all.\n\nOne California woman \u2014 an avowed Obama and Obamacare supporter, and cancer patient \u2014 was quite taken aback by the disaster.\n\nDanielle Nelson dutifully enrolled in an Obamacare plan, and then went to see her oncologist, but was greeted at the door by a sign announcing they did not accept any Covered California plans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a complete fan of the Affordable Care Act, but now I can\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d Ms. Nelson told The Los Angeles Times. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine this is how President Obama wanted it to happen.\u201d\n\nWell, she doesn\u2019t have to imagine. She simply needs to accept that her hero and his minions actually did have something else in mind \u2014 single payer, which would require the destruction of the individual marketplace.\n\nMr. Obama, who\u2019s never run anything in his life, wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone other than himself when he did this. Who has time to think about irksome cancer patients when you\u2019ve got a legacy to build?\n\nThen the latest gem from this week: The Congressional Budget Office issued a report stating that Obamacare will, as Forbes puts it, \u201cdrive 2.5 million Americans out of the workforce,\u201d essentially disincentivizing work.\n\nRunning immediately into the fray with buckets of water and rhetoric on behalf of the White House, The New York Times offered up an editorial that actually declared this disaster a \u201cgood thing\u201d and is \u201cliberating\u201d people from their work. You know what else would be \u201cliberating\u201d? All New York Times employees being \u201cfreed\u201d from their work.\n\nJason Furman, the White House economic adviser, actually noted that these 2.5 million people were \u201ca small percentage of the economy.\u201d This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise; it\u2019s what happens when the leftist bureaucratic machine mistake people for the budget. You are no longer an individual, you are a number on a piece of paper, and an expendable one at that.\n\nIt\u2019s strange, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Mr. Obama and his liberal trolls have managed to get everything wrong, all the time. You actually have to work 24/7 to screw things up this badly.\n\nSo now Americans have Obamacare, a cancer that no one is trying to stop as it keeps replicating itself, metastasizing further into our body.\n\nWe do have a piece of paper, though, that says \u201chealth insurance.\u201d\n\nTammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When a locomotive crashes, it stops.
