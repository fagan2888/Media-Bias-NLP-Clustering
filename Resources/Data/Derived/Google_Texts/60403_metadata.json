The school has been aggressive about fundraising, prudent about spending and diligent about prayer, she said.\n\nAs a result, \u201cThe school has never been more financially sound than we are right now,\u201d Voss told The Daily Signal in an interview.\n\nTimothy Christian, which Voss describes as a \u201cparent-run school\u201d in which parents \u201cform a society who then appoint and vote on school board members,\u201d has taken advantage of some school choice laws enacted by the Iowa Legislature.\n\nOne law, passed in 2006, created the Student Tuition Organization.\n\nThis program allows non-public schools to raise scholarship money. This is done by partnering with another private school to form a separate non-profit organization.\n\nThe non-profit can bring in donations to be distributed to families based on their income. A set cap is imposed by the legislature on how much can be raised each year. Schools get money based on enrollment from the previous year.\n\nAnd for those that donate? They receive 65 percent of their donation back as a direct tax credit on their Iowa income tax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d Voss said. \u201cPeople are lining up to do this. They are happy to help kids attend private school.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2013, Iowa became one of the last states in the nation to allow independent accreditation of private schools. Before, schools had to be accredited by the Iowa Department of Education to benefit from the Student Tuition Organization and other federal funding opportunities, such as transportation cost reimbursement to parents.\n\nTimothy Christian is accredited through Christian Schools International, to which it has belonged for years.\n\nVoss calls this \u201cthe single biggest thing that has happened in Iowa in terms of private education.\u201d\n\nBut she has her sights set on an even bigger thing for private education. The Iowa Legislature is considering legislation that would create Education Savings Accounts, in which parents receive a portion of the average cost for a child to attend a public school in the state. The parents are then able to put the money toward their children\u2019s schooling. States typically create a list of accepted expenditures, such as schools, therapists, educational specialists, materials and other expenses. This could benefit the some 250 private schools that serve almost 47,000 students in Iowa.\n\nVoss, who has served on the board of the Iowa Association of Christian Schools for the past seven years, said these accounts would give parents \u201cthe opportunity to use the taxes that they\u2019ve already paid where they want to use it.\u201d\n\nEven better, she said, \u201cThe money is not coming to our school. It goes directly to parents to then use how they choose.\u201d\n\nVoss said if the legislation does not pass this year, she thinks it will within the next two or three.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Iowa, changes to state law have enabled private schools to join forces to raise money and create scholarship opportunities for needy students.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In Iowa, changes to state law have enabled private schools to join forces to raise money and create scholarship opportunities for needy students.", "title": "Why This Iowa Principal is Thankful for School Choice", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150615_TCS_voss.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-17T15:28:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1cX8dPC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In Iowa, changes to state law have enabled private schools to join forces to raise money and create scholarship opportunities for needy students.", "title": "Why This Iowa Principal is Thankful for School Choice", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150615_TCS_voss.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "school choice", "published_time": "2015-06-17T13:45:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T15:28:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Timothy Christian School, Iowa legislature, Wellsburg, school choice, Education Savings Accounts, Student Tuition Organization, Christian Schools International, Iowa Department of Education"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf457\"", "article_summary": "WELLSBURG, Iowa\u2014For this coming fall, Timothy Christian School will welcome just 45 students in kindergarten through 8th grade\u2014the fewest to begin an academic year since the school opened in 1941.\nTimothy Christian, which Voss describes as a \u201cparent-run school\u201d in which parents \u201cform a society who then appoint and vote on school board members,\u201d has taken advantage of some school choice laws enacted by the Iowa Legislature.\nThis is done by partnering with another private school to form a separate non-profit organization.\nTimothy Christian is accredited through Christian Schools International, to which it has belonged for years.\nThis could benefit the some 250 private schools that serve almost 47,000 students in Iowa."}
