PARIS (AP) — More than 1,000 Kurds and leftist Turks have marched in Paris to protest airstrikes by Turkey on Kurdish militant camps in northern Iraq.

One banner held high at Saturday’s march read, “To hit the PKK is collaborating with Daesh.” PKK is the Kurdish acronym for the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, whose affiliates have helped battle the Islamic State group, which is called “Daesh” in France.

The march was originally called to protest Monday’s Islamic State suicide attack in the southeast Turkish town of Suruc that killed 32 people. But Turkish airstrikes on PKK camps in Iraq changed the agenda of the protest march from the Gare de l’Est train station to the Place de la Republique.
