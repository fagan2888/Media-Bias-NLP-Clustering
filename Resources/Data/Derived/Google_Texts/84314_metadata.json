Sara, who declined to give her last name because she worried about an abusive ex-boyfriend, said she has had an abortion.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand what people go through,\u201d she said of the demonstrators.\n\nThe activists are required by a city ordinance enacted last November to stay 39 feet from the Planned Parenthood entrance. But they may soon be allowed to cross the street and again stand in spaces they occupied each Friday for about 15 months before the ordinance became law.\n\nThe Portland ordinance, passed unanimously and enacted on an emergency basis, is patterned on a Massachusetts law struck down June 26 by a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nThe city ordinance is being challenged in U.S. District Court in Portland by Daniel and Marguerite Fitzgerald of Shapleigh, two of their children, and Richmond resident Leslie Sneddon.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim the buffer zone violates their First and 14th Amendment rights. One June 18, Judge Nancy Torresen declined to strike down the ordinance, citing the pending Supreme Court decision in the Massachusetts case, McCullen v. Coakley.\n\nErin Kuenzig, an attorney from the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Thomas More Law Center, represents the plaintiffs. She is seeking an injunction from Torreson to strike down the ordinance, based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\n\u201cThe decision sends the clear message that the government may not take the extreme step of closing a substantial portion of a public sidewalk to all speakers simply because this extreme step is easier than enforcing other laws that already exist to achieve the government\u2019s interest,\u201d Kuenzig said in an email.\n\nOn Friday, Hebert\u2019s daughter, Allison Hebert, stood across the street from Planned Parenthood, holding her infant son, Nathan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands, we are waiting to see what happens,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are just out here to witness to people.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. Supreme Court majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the requirement in Massachusetts for a 35-foot buffer zone around health care centers performing abortions (excluding hospitals) was found to violate activists\u2019 rights to counsel patients outside a health care center.\n\nCity spokeswoman Jessica Grondin on Thursday said the Portland ordinance remains in effect, but it will be studied.\n\n\u201cWe need to conduct a review of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to examine how it will apply to our buffer zone ordinance here in Portland,\u201d Grondin said. \u201cIn regards to our pending legal case, we will wait to hear from the Court to see what the next steps are.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Northern New England spokeswoman Nicole Clegg, meanwhile, expressed dismay at the decision.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court Justices\u2019 decision today to strike down the buffer zone law shows a disregard for the safety of patients and staff entering reproductive health centers, and we are disappointed by their decision to strike down the Massachusetts law,\u201d Clegg said in a press release.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Roberts noted Massachusetts plaintiff Ellen McCullen does \u201c\u2018sidewalk counseling,\u2019 which involves offering information about alternatives to abortion and help pursuing those options.\u201d\n\nDonna Hebert said she wants to do the same while asking women about \u201cmaking the choice to murder the child in her womb.\u201d\n\nThe stark terms are necessary, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is the truth, and being confronted with the truth is hard,\u201d she said.\n\nGreeters who escort patients to Planned Parenthood declined comment, but Sara was adamant the anti-abortion activists are not offering counseling.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t sit down and talk to people about decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt killed me, it kills me everyday. There is logic and reason behind [abortion] for most women.\u201d\n\nCity Councilors created the buffer zone after complaints about anti-abortionist activists harassing Planned Parenthood patients and customers at a diner on the first floor of the building.\n\nDiner owner Mike Fink, who also owns Guitar Grave, next to the entrance to Planned Parenthood, blamed the demonstrations when he closed the diner about a year ago. Planned Parenthood said its surveys showed more than 70 percent of patients felt \u201charassed\u201d by the activists.\n\nRoberts upheld the right of activists to use public ways in his majority opinion.\n\n\u201cIt is no accident that public streets and sidewalks have developed as venues for the exchange of ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cEven today, they remain one of the few places where a speaker can be confident that he is not simply preaching to the choir.\u201d\n\nRoberts suggested there are ways to remedy the harassment buffer zone supporters said patients have endured.\n\n\u201cWhile [Massachusetts] contends that individuals can inadvertently obstruct access to clinics simply by gathering in large numbers, that problem could be addressed through a law requiring crowds blocking a clinic entrance to disperse for a limited period when ordered to do so by the police,\u201d the chief justice said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Waterboro resident Donna Hebert stood on a Congress Street sidewalk Friday morning, one of about 10 anti-abortion activists hoping to engage with women going into the Planned Parenthood of New England offices across the street. \u201cPeople come and talk with us, and we talk about the Lord [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Waterboro resident Donna Hebert stood on a Congress Street sidewalk Friday morning, one of about 10 anti-abortion activists hoping to engage with women going into the Planned Parenthood of New England offices across the street. \u201cPeople come and talk with us, and we talk about the Lord [...]", "title": "Anti-abortion protesters, clinic patients in Portland react to Supreme Court ruling", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2014/06/28/politics/being-confronted-with-the-truth-is-hard-anti-abortion-protesters-clinic-patients-in-portland-react-to-supreme-court-ruling/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10013901_H13133083-600x399.jpg?strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Waterboro resident Donna Hebert stood on a Congress Street sidewalk Friday morning, one of about 10 anti-abortion activists hoping to engage with women going into the Planned Parenthood of New England offices across the street. \u201cPeople come and talk with us, and we talk about the Lord [...]", "title": "Anti-abortion protesters, clinic patients in Portland react to Supreme Court ruling", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2014/06/28/politics/being-confronted-with-the-truth-is-hard-anti-abortion-protesters-clinic-patients-in-portland-react-to-supreme-court-ruling/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10013901_H13133083-250x250.jpg?strip=all", "site": "@bangordailynews", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "keywords": "Maine, news, elections, election results, politics, sports, Bangor, Portland, Augusta, weather, obituaries, Waterville, Aroostook, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Hancock, Washington, bdn,nation,news,politics,state,anti-abortion protesters, clinic patients in portland react to supreme court ruling,is_article,david harry", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb06\"", "article_summary": "She is seeking an injunction from Torreson to strike down the ordinance, based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision.\nOn Friday, Hebert\u2019s daughter, Allison Hebert, stood across the street from Planned Parenthood, holding her infant son, Nathan.\nGreeters who escort patients to Planned Parenthood declined comment, but Sara was adamant the anti-abortion activists are not offering counseling.\n\u201cWe need to conduct a review of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to examine how it will apply to our buffer zone ordinance here in Portland,\u201d Grondin said.\nThe activists are required by a city ordinance enacted last November to stay 39 feet from the Planned Parenthood entrance."}
