Teal Media\u2019s homepage featured its work on Obamacare prominently, placing a link to the firm\u2019s work on one of the most well-known websites in America front and center. Now that link, as well as the page devoted to Teal\u2019s work on HealthCare.gov, have been removed.\n\nHere\u2019s a cached version of what the homepage used to look like. And here\u2019s a cached version of Teal\u2019s page devoted just to its work on HealthCare.gov. That page has been deleted.\n\nTeal Media doesn\u2019t seem interested in talking about its work on HealthCare.gov. A woman who answered the phone at the company\u2019s headquarters immediately referred BuzzFeed to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at the Department of Health And Human Services (HHS) before a single question was asked. CMS is listed as Teal\u2019s client on the firm\u2019s now-erased HealthCare.gov page.\n\nWhen asked about the changed content on the Teal Media site, the woman said that was done \u2018in consultation with HHS,\u201d and again referred a reporter to CMS.\n\nA CMS spokesperson declined to comment on the record.\n\nTeal Media is led by a prominent former member of President Obama\u2019s celebrated digital campaign team, Jessica Teal. She was Design Manager for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, a job that, according to her LinkedIn profile, put her in charge of \u201cthe official campaign website and microsites, web/email-based fundraising campaigns, state and constituency literature, large-scale signage and event materials, and special projects.\u201d\n\nTeal\u2019s firm lists many prominent clients in Democratic politics and the government, including the Democratic National Committee, EMILY\u2019s List, the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission. Teal Media\u2019s role in the design of HealthCare.gov was heralded when the firm signed on. The Verge described the company as a \u201chip design house,\u201d and reported that the design Teal and other consultants came up with was one of the few good things about the Obamacare portal.\n\n\u201cIf the backend of Healthcare.gov reminded us that the government makes terrible websites, the front end actually proved the opposite,\u201d Verge\u2019s Adrianne Jefferies wrote.\n\nAn administration official praised Teal Media\u2019s work on the site in June Atlantic article. The piece credited Teal with making \u201ca difference in how Healthcare.gov looks and works on a mobile device today.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic article got a prominent link on the Teal Media HealthCare.gov page that has since been deleted.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2681553, "userid": 568833}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Teal Media was founded by a former member of Obama's campaign design team.
