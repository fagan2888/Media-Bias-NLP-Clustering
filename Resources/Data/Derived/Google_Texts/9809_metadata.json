Now that I receive Medicaid, upon my death, the government will lien my assets. At the present time, my house is underwater, but by the time I die, there may be some equity, which I had hoped would pass to my children. But the government has something called \u201casset recovery.\u201d Please say it isn\u2019t true.\n\nSo, Gary, we hate to tell you this: It\u2019s true.\n\nAsset recovery isn\u2019t part of the Affordable Care Act. The federal government has required states since the early 1990s to recover Medicaid costs from the estates of people older than 65 who use the federal program to pay for nursing-home or in-home care, hospital stays and prescription-drug services, as well as from enrollees who have Medicaid as their primary insurance from ages 55 to 64.\n\nYou\u2019re suddenly hearing about this along with Obamacare because the law expands the number of adults ages 55 to 64 who are eligible for Medicaid. That means a lot more consumers are, like you, getting a big shock when they learn about the government\u2019s asset-recovery rights. Plus, expanded Medicaid verifies eligibility based on incomes, not assets, said Kim Boyer, owner of Boyer Law Group in Las Vegas and an expert on eldercare and Medicaid rules. So people may qualify if they have both lower incomes and assets, such as home equity or retirement accounts, Boyer said.\n\nOnce you\u2019re enrolled, you are on the hook after you die. Nevada can come after your estate to recoup every last dollar of the medical benefits Medicaid paid to you. So if you run up a $200,000 tab on a quadruple bypass, your estate will have to pay it back, if it can. Nor is there any limit on the types of assets the state can take. The basic idea is, if you have value stashed in your home, investments or possessions, it\u2019s not fair to let you draw down federal entitlements, Boyer said.\n\nThere are limits, though. The state cannot collect assets from a deceased Medicaid enrollee who\u2019s survived by a spouse, a child younger than 21 or a blind or disabled child of any age. If you share a home with a sibling, the state can\u2019t collect, either. Officials can file a lien against those assets, but they generally won\u2019t execute the lien until your spouse, child or sibling dies. What\u2019s more, states have to waive estate recovery if it would cause undue hardship, though Boyer said hardship is difficult define. So, to ease one of your big concerns, Gary, your wife won\u2019t be out on the street should you pass away with equity in your house.\n\nYou can find ways around asset recovery, including putting your home or other assets in someone else\u2019s name. But you may have to transfer assets years ahead of enrollment to qualify, and you risk losing those assets in case of divorce or family discord.\n\n\u201cGenerally, people are not ready to give up their independence and autonomy just to keep the government from taking their assets,\u201d Boyer said.\n\nGary, you also wanted to know why you weren\u2019t given the choice to opt out of Medicaid and purchase a private plan to avoid asset recovery. You actually do have the right to unenroll from Medicaid, go to an insurance broker and ask him or her to find you an individual, private plan outside the state exchange\u2019s system, Boyer said.\n\n\u25a0 Gary Stange dreams of a utopia in which we bend the health cost curve down by, you know, maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking. He writes: We have too many people in this country who think they have a right to do what they want, and that their self-gratifying choices have no consequences and do not affect others. They are wrong! Do you realize how much health care costs would drop if people would take care of themselves?\n\nIf the numbers are to be believed, Gary, costs might drop a lot.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pegged the number of Americans who are overweight or obese at 69.2 percent in 2010. That\u2019s about 215 million people. And 19 percent \u2014 or nearly 60 million \u2014 smoke (there\u2019s some overlap between the two). Nevada\u2019s rate of obesity and overweight is a little lower than average, at 60.3 percent. But our smoking rate is higher, at 22.2 percent.\n\nBoth obesity and smoking are linked to cancer, heart disease and stroke, according to the CDC. And they weigh heavily on U.S. health spending: Obesity cost the system nearly $150 billion in 2008; a 2011 study from the National Institutes of Health found that America\u2019s obesity rate explains as much as 35 percent of the country\u2019s lower life expectancy as compared to other developed nations.\n\nMeanwhile, smoking cost the country more than $193 billion in extra health care costs in 2004. What\u2019s more, a June report from the Ohio State University found that employees who smoke cost a company $6,000 a year more than nonsmokers \u2014 and that factors in any pension or retirement-plan savings that come when a smoker dies prematurely. (It is worth noting that some research shows smokers and the obese may save the system money long term by dying younger.)\n\nThen there are other preventable problems that affect U.S. life expectancy: A 2007 report from Texas A&M economist Robert Ohsfeldt found that if you control for murders, suicides and car accidents, the nation has the top life expectancy among developed countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has provisions designed to curb obesity and smoking. The law requires insurers to cover, free of charge, screening and counseling for obesity and tobacco-cessation therapy. That means patients won\u2019t have to pay for weight-loss guidance or help quitting cancer sticks, as long as they\u2019re working with a doctor in their network.\n\nThe law also mandates that restaurant chains and grocery stores eventually start putting calorie details on prepared foods, though a 2013 study from New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center said such menu labeling hasn\u2019t affected consumer choices where it\u2019s been tried.\n\nAs for smokers, Obamacare lets insurers charge them as much as 50 percent more on their premiums as an incentive to get them to stop.\n\nBut Robert Jeffery, a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota, said those measures might not go far enough.\n\n\u201cBanning the sale of tobacco products would certainly reduce the use of those products and the health problems they cause,\u201d Jeffery said. \u201cWhy we have not done that is as mysterious to me as why we don\u2019t do more to reduce the number and lethality of firearms.\u201d\n\nLimiting or taxing products such as sugar-sweetened beverages or the use of salt in processed foods could also help, Jeffery said. But \u201call of these measures are difficult politically because of public opinion and vested commercial interests,\u201d he added.\n\nYou\u2019re also going against human nature, Gary.\n\n\u201cPeople find exposure to these products pleasurable and the health care consequences are very much delayed,\u201d Jeffery said. \u201cImmediate rewards are much more powerful in guiding behavior than delayed ones most of the time.\u201d\n\nHave a question or comment you\u2019d like to run by Obamacare Explained?
