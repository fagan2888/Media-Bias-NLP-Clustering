Ted Cruz often complains, regarding the paucity of conservative victories following the Republican takeover of Congress.\n\nPlenty, actually. A number of legislative proposals by President Barack Obama \u2014 from public jobs programs to universal preschool to a federal minimum wage increase \u2014 have been stifled since Republicans took the House in 2010.\n\nThis little thing called the sequester also came to pass, which nobody likes to take credit for, but in fact has helped reduce the annual budget deficit from nearly 10 percent of GDP to below 3 percent.\n\nYet Cruz and other backbencher congressional conservatives were driven mad by the constitutional reality that controlling one branch of government doesn\u2019t mean you get your way on everything all the time.\n\nThe president retained his executive authority, and Senate rules give the Democratic minority some legislative power as well. These are the obstacles that prevent the granting of every conservative wish, like the repeal of Obamacare. House conservatives weren\u2019t able to remove those, so they\u2019ve decided to burn the House down instead.\n\nDelusional dissatisfaction is most pronounced and consequential among congressional conservatives. But we see it in the Republican presidential primary with the troika of the unqualified \u2014 Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson \u2014 lapping all the candidates who had the temerity to accumulate some governmental experience before running for president.\n\nTrump lowered the bar on qualifications by hysterically declaring that \u201cour system is broken\u201d and \u201cthe American Dream is dead.\u201d His greatest evidence of our democracy\u2019s collapse? The rate of illegal immigration. Which is \u2026 down.\n\nBorder security has been tightened more than ever before under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Now, the number of undocumented workers is about one million fewer than in 2007. Somehow, reaching zero net illegal immigration is an example of \u201call talk, no action politicians\u201d because we\u2019re not able to literally stop every person trying to cross or deport every undocumented worker who got here.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders is the one who believes everything is awful. \u201cThe American political system is totally corrupted,\u201d he thunders. \u201cThis is not democracy. This is oligarchy.\u201d\n\nIf things are that bad from a liberal perspective, then how did President Obama enact Obamacare, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and the EPA greenhouse gas regulations?\n\nSanders has been supportive of all of these as partial measures, but that doesn\u2019t square with his broadsides against the system. If progress is possible under the current regime, it\u2019s not that corrupted. And if dissatisfied liberals want to build on Obama\u2019s progress, it might make more sense to expend energy showing how well his policies are working than diminishing their import by trashing the status quo.\n\nEven centrist voices cry that all is lost. The National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier greeted the Republican midterm victory with deep pessimism because \u201cneither party is capable of achieving what most Americans want \u2014 a bipartisan, transparent, pragmatic approach to governance that addresses big problems in an era of socioeconomic change.\u201d That\u2019s true, as far as it goes, because the two parties have different philosophical beliefs about how to address big problems in an era of socioeconomic change.\n\nAnd yet, during a period of divided government with hard-fought budget battles, (preceded by a very partisan, historically huge, economic stimulus program), three of the last five quarters have experienced GDP growth at an annualized rate of about 4 percent or higher. We\u2019ve had 66 consecutive months of positive job growth, creating more than 13 million net private sector jobs. Wages are flat, but so are prices. America has done alright with the politics it has.\n\nNone of this is to say that everything is perfect and there are no problems left to solve. It\u2019s only to say that the voices claiming that our present democracy is incapable of solving problems aren\u2019t paying attention.\n\nPolitics isn\u2019t broken. It\u2019s just hard. People disagree about things. Forging compromises can take time. When compromise is not possible or progress is slow, it doesn\u2019t mean the system is corrupted or party leaders must be dumped. It just means you either need to work harder to win more people to your side, or you need accept that sometimes you don\u2019t win, and it\u2019s time to focus on another issue.\n\nAs dissatisfied as some are, a steadily growing economy typically dampens any fervor for radical upheaval. In turn, the presidential election process likely won\u2019t reward the angriest voices among us. But the House Republican caucus is more tethered to ideologically pure congressional districts than it is to GDP. Until the conservative base can be more accepting of political and constitutional reality, the speaker\u2019s chair is going to remain a hot seat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker John Boehner\u2019s resignation from Congress is a symptom of a chronic condition that pervades not just the right, but also the left and the center: the pernicious belief that everything in...", "title": "Boehner a Victim of Unrealistic Expectations | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/09/28/boehner_a_victim_of_unrealistic_expectations_128226.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/322221_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Speaker John Boehner\u2019s resignation from Congress is a symptom of a chronic condition that pervades not just the right, but also the left and the center: the pernicious belief that everything in...", "title": "Boehner a Victim of Unrealistic Expectations | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Boehner a Victim of Unrealistic Expectations | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "polarization,Obamacare,economic growth,GDP,Ted Cruz,conservative ideology,House Republicans,John Boehner resignation,"}, "article_summary": "But the House Republican caucus is more tethered to ideologically pure congressional districts than it is to GDP.\nThis is oligarchy.\u201dIf things are that bad from a liberal perspective, then how did President Obama enact Obamacare, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and the EPA greenhouse gas regulations?\nThe president retained his executive authority, and Senate rules give the Democratic minority some legislative power as well.\nWhen compromise is not possible or progress is slow, it doesn\u2019t mean the system is corrupted or party leaders must be dumped.\nIt\u2019s only to say that the voices claiming that our present democracy is incapable of solving problems aren\u2019t paying attention."}
