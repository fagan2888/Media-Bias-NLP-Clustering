They are cleaning your hotel room, making your sandwich. The law has helped this population enormously.\n\nTwo-thirds of the country\u2019s newly insured adults were minorities. Of the 1.2 million non-citizens who gained coverage, 60 percent were Hispanic and around one-third were Asian. The law also helped cover high rates of part-time workers and residents with only a high school education.\n\nThe Times\u2019 findings are significant given the context of 2016\u2019s election, as both parties vie for Hispanic and minority votes. The health care law \u2014 which passed in 2010 without the help of Republicans and was later upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 \u2014 remains a hotly disputed piece of legislation which each of the Republican presidential candidates have promised to repeal.\n\nThe law still has hurdles to clear. Some Americans still cannot afford coverage, and the Pew Research Center\u2019s Mark Hugo Lopez told the Times that the vast majority of the country\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants remain uninsured.\n\nFurthermore, 19 states have refused to expand their Medicaid programs to cover the poor, as per the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 ruling. This disproportionately affected the coverage rates of black residents, the majority of whom live in those states that have refused the expansion, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Mark", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Two-thirds of the country\u2019s newly insured adults are minorities.", "title": "America's most vulnerable residents have made the biggest gains under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/americas-most-vulnerable-made-big-gains-under-obamacare-2016-4", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5716e62052bcd05c658bd9f6-506-253/americas-most-vulnerable-residents-have-made-the-biggest-gains-under-obamacare.jpg", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics,law", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Hispanics, Minorities, low income, Michelle Mark", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Hispanics, Minorities, low income, Michelle Mark", "author": "Michelle Mark", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-19", "sailthru.title": "America's most vulnerable residents have made the biggest gains under Obamacare", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5716e60752bcd05b008bdba2-50-50/americas-most-vulnerable-residents-have-made-the-biggest-gains-under-obamacare.jpg", "description": "Two-thirds of the country\u2019s newly insured adults are minorities.", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5716e60752bcd05b008bdba2/americas-most-vulnerable-residents-have-made-the-biggest-gains-under-obamacare.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2016-04-19", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/michelle-mark"}, "sailthru.description": "Two-thirds of the country\u2019s newly insured adults are minorities.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Two-thirds of the country\u2019s newly insured adults are minorities.", "title": "America's most vulnerable residents have made the biggest gains under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/americas-most-vulnerable-made-big-gains-under-obamacare-2016-4", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5716e62052bcd05c658bd9f6-1190-625/americas-most-vulnerable-residents-have-made-the-biggest-gains-under-obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "America's most vulnerable residents have made the biggest gains under Obamacare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5716e60752bcd05b008bdba2/americas-most-vulnerable-residents-have-made-the-biggest-gains-under-obamacare.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "article_summary": "Nearly one-third of the newly insured adults were Hispanic, and coverage rates soared for low-wage workers such as cooks, hairdressers, and cashiers.\nImmigrants \u2014 including more than one million non-citizen residents \u2014 saw the largest surge in coverage rates, the Times reported.\nThe Times analysis, which examined 2014 census data, determined the demographic breakdown of the newly insured.\nTwo-thirds of the country\u2019s newly insured adults were minorities.\nImmigrants, low-income workers and racial minorities saw big gains in health care coverage in 2014, the first full year in which the Affordable Care Act was in effect, a New York Times analysis revealed Tuesday."}
