We examined the impact of factors likely to influence providers\u2019 acceptance of an alerting system, designed to facilitate electronic communication in outpatient settings, on provider satisfaction, intentions to quit, and turnover.\n\nStudy Design and Methods\n\nWe conducted a cross-sectional Web-based survey of EAS-related practices from a nationwide sample of primary care providers (PCPs) practicing at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. Of 5001 invited VA PCPs, 2590 completed the survey.\n\n\n\nWe relied on Venkatesh\u2019s Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use ofTechnology to create survey measures of 4 factors likely to impact user acceptance of EAS: supportive norms, monitoring/ feedback, training, and providers\u2019 perceptions of the value (PPOV) of EASs to provider effectiveness. Facility-level PCP turnover was measured via the VA\u2019s Service Support Center Human Re- sources Cube. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling.\n\nResults\n\nAfter accounting for intercorrelations among predictors, monitoring/feedback regarding EASs significantly predicted intention to quit (b = 0.30, P <.01), and PPOV of EASs predicted both overall provider satisfaction (b = 0.58, P <.01) and facility-level provider turnover levels (b = \u20130.19, P <.05), all without relying on any intervening mechanisms.\n\nConclusions\n\nDesign, implementation, and use of EASs might impact provider satisfaction and retention. Institutions should consider strategies to help providers perceive greater value in these clinical tools.\n\nAm J Manag Care. 2014;20(11 Spec No. 17):SP520-SP530", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Department of Veterans Affairs, Electronic Medical Record, Health IT, Information Systems, Physician Behavior, Physician Satisfaction", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "site_name": "AJMC", "description": "Users' acceptance of electronic health record-based asynchronous alerts can negatively impact provider satisfaction, intentions to quit, and ultimately turnover.", "title": "Electronic Alerts and Clinician Turnover: The Influence of User Acceptance"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJMC_Journal", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "description": "Users' acceptance of electronic health record-based asynchronous alerts can negatively impact provider satisfaction, intentions to quit, and ultimately turnover.", "card": "summary", "title": "Electronic Alerts and Clinician Turnover: The Influence of User Acceptance"}, "description": "Users' acceptance of electronic health record-based asynchronous alerts can negatively impact provider satisfaction, intentions to quit, and ultimately turnover."}, "article_summary": "Use of certain components of electronic health records (EHRs), such as EHR-based alerting systems (EASs), might reduce provider satisfaction, a strong precursor to turnover.\nWe examined the impact of factors likely to influence providers\u2019 acceptance of an alerting system, designed to facilitate electronic communication in outpatient settings, on provider satisfaction, intentions to quit, and turnover.\nConclusionsDesign, implementation, and use of EASs might impact provider satisfaction and retention.\nFacility-level PCP turnover was measured via the VA\u2019s Service Support Center Human Re- sources Cube.\nResultsAfter accounting for intercorrelations among predictors, monitoring/feedback regarding EASs significantly predicted intention to quit (b = 0.30, P <.01), and PPOV of EASs predicted both overall provider satisfaction (b = 0.58, P <.01) and facility-level provider turnover levels (b = \u20130.19, P <.05), all without relying on any intervening mechanisms."}
