They face an 11-1 Louisville squad with something to prove as well, and Kentucky junior guard Dominique Hawkins believes that beating another quality opponent provides more motivation than the rivalry.\n\n\u201cWe know that they\u2019re a great pressing team and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to prepare for,\u201d the Richmond, Kentucky, native said of the Cardinals. \u201cIt\u2019s just another game and we\u2019re just looking to win.\u201d\n\nWhile that may be underplaying it a little, if the Wildcats are going to come away with a victory, they\u2019ll have to beat a Cardinals team that might be even hungrier than Ohio State. The Buckeyes were unfazed by Kentucky\u2019s height and hype in their 74-67 win last week in Brooklyn, New York. Ohio State led throughout and withstood a second-half rally led by Jamal Murray\u2019s 33-point explosion.\n\nImpressive as Murray\u2019s game was, Kentucky coach John Calipari seeks more offensive contributions. A presence in the middle will be needed on both ends against the quick, physical Cardinals.\n\nAs Kentucky works to establish continuity, its inside game could be helped this weekend with the recent addition of 6-foot-10, 255-pound forward Tai Wynyard from New Zealand. He has only had a couple of workouts and Calipari has been coy about whether he\u2019ll play Saturday because he\u2019s a work in progress \u2014 much like the Wildcats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got things that we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cWe\u2019re still tweaking offensively exactly how we have to play. I saw some good stuff in the second half of that game (Ohio State). But, we\u2019re a ways away.\u201d\n\nLouisville began the season unranked with a made-over roster of youngsters as well, but has quickly grown into a group looking to be competitive in the Atlantic Coast Conference and beyond.\n\nThe Cardinals enter the game leading the nation in scoring margin at plus-30.2 points per game and ranked sixth in field goal percentage (.519). Granted, their opponents have not all been the caliber of top-ranked Michigan State, but Louisville led that game on the road before the Spartans rallied in the final minutes for a 71-67 win.\n\nBut Louisville\u2019s lopsided victories have provided young players valuable playing time and helped the Cardinals\u2019 offense blossom enough to shoot above 50 percent nine times this year, one more than last season.\n\n\u201cOur confidence is pretty high,\u201d said Louisville coach Rick Pitino, comparing his team\u2019s docket to the alternative of a tougher schedule with such a young team.\n\nGraduate transfers Damion Lee (17.3) and Trey Lewis have combined for nearly 32 points per game in the backcourt with sophomore guard Quentin Snider averaging 10 points. They\u2019ll face Kentucky\u2019s three-guard backcourt of Murray, Isaiah Briscoe and Tyler Ulis.\n\nThe game is a chance for Louisville to earn a signature win, against its biggest rival at that. The Cardinals also seek their first win at Rupp since 2008 and aim to end a three-game slide in a series Kentucky leads 33-15.\n\nThough many of the young Cardinals may not fully grasp the magnitude of the rivalry, their fans have certainly reminded them of what beating Kentucky means to them. Players just hope it can provide something that helps down the road.\n\n\u201cWe know how bad our campus wants this, how bad our fans want this game,\u201d said Lewis, who\u2019s averaging 14.7 points per game. \u201cWe\u2019re going into this as some very tough competition (entering) the next stretch, so we don\u2019t feed too much into the hype. But we know what this game means.\u201d\n\nAP Freelance Writers Josh Abner and Ed Peak in Louisville contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No. 12 Kentucky vs. No. 16 Louisville a battle for Bluegrass bragging rights", "title": "No. 12 Kentucky vs. No. 16 Louisville a battle for Bluegrass bragging rights", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/25/no-12-kentucky-vs-no-16-louisville-a-battle-for-bluegrass-bragging-rights/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__73a44b38a9d2ea388a0f6a706700832dp1.jpg", "height": 542}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__73a44b38a9d2ea388a0f6a706700832dp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T21:16:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:51:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I saw some good stuff in the second half of that game (Ohio State).\nOhio State led throughout and withstood a second-half rally led by Jamal Murray\u2019s 33-point explosion.\n12 Kentucky and 16th-ranked archrival Louisville than claiming Bluegrass bragging rights.\nThough many of the young Cardinals may not fully grasp the magnitude of the rivalry, their fans have certainly reminded them of what beating Kentucky means to them.\nBut we know what this game means.\u201dAP Freelance Writers Josh Abner and Ed Peak in Louisville contributed to this report."}
