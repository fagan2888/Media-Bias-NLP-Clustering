Gov. Steve Beshear on Tuesday proposed a $20.3 billion, two-year spending plan for Kentucky that would return much of the state's lost funding for K-12 schools; provide long-delayed pay raises for school employees and state workers; restore child-care assistance for low-income working parents; and fully fund the required contributions to the struggling state pension system.
