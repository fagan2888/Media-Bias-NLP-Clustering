Burwell, the administration official charged with getting Americans signed up for coverage, vowed to cut through headlines and political rhetoric to give people information they need.  With some 6 million Texans still uninsured, Burwell's early appearance this go-round shows a renewed fight to increase the health care law's impact in Texas, where the governor's office has refused to create a state-run marketplace or accept billions of dollars in federal funding to expand Medicaid to extend coverage to millions more people.  Burwell's appearance at a news conference at the Denver Harbor Multi-Service Center, which includes a community health clinic and serves as health insurance marketplace enrollment center on the east side, followed a meeting held by the Gulf Coast Health Insurance Marketplace Collaborative.  Unlike the first health insurance enrollment period mandated by the health care law, Burwell said this time around there are thousands of success stories to share, proving marketplace coverage works and is affordable.  The state's uninsured rate dropped about 2 percent this year, but Elena Marks, president and CEO of Houston's Episcopal Health Foundation, a philanthropy that will fund health care providers, said many Texans gained employer-based insurance as the economy created more jobs.  Marks said it makes sense for Burwell and other officials to bypass Texas' political leadership and instead work with local governments, agencies and organizations, including those in the Houston area, to find the uninsured and enroll them in health coverage.  Risha Jones, deputy director of Houston's Department of Health and Human Services, said her agency's goal is to directly contact 100,000 uninsured residents and reach another 400,000 through community and educational outreach.", "vf": {"section": "business", "unique_id": "premiumchron-article-5902257"}, "author.name": "By Lora Hines", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "Without committing to a specific numerical goal for Texas, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Tuesday in Houston that she plans to make repeated trips to and across the state to meet with organizers and to hold substantive health-care conversations with uninsured Texans about the importance of insurance and the subsidies that will cut premium costs for most of those who now lack insurance.
