A popular snowbird destination in Panama City Beach is giving locals and out of towners a sneak peak of what they have planned for the year.

Organizers for The Ark, formerly known as Noah's Ark, held their first open house of the year. Organizers put together a karaoke event, craft tables, and handed out pastries.

Some of the events locals and snowbirds can sign up for include woodshop and art classes.

"We're just so glad to be able to reach out to our local community as well. Some folks have had the impression that this was kind of an opportunity just for the snowbirds or just for the youth groups in the past, but we want locals to know," said Pastor Ric Brigman.

Other classes you can sign up for include creative writing, square dancing, and sewing.

You can call Noah's Ark at (850) 234-6062. They are located at 12902 Front Beach Road.
