Both the city and members of the Teamsters Local 525 made concessions, said Trustee Michael Stumpf, who served on the negotiating committee with Trustee Sarah Johnes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good contract for the village and for the employees,\u201d Stumpf said. \u201cThese guys do a fantastic job. They have never faltered.\u201d\n\nPoints of contention between the two parties were health insurance costs and wage increases. Historically, union members have not paid out-of-pocket for health insurance. Under the new contract, workers will contribute no out-of-pocket insurance costs the first year, $2.50 per week the second year and $5 per week the third year.\n\nWorkers asked for a 4-percent increase in wages per year, but settled for 2 percent.\n\nNegotiations were drawn-out and required federal mediation services because of either side\u2019s unwillingness to concede, said Stumpf.\n\n\u201cThey had asked for a 4 percent raise (per year) with nothing out of pocket. In today\u2019s world, in 2015, that\u2019s just not feasible.\u201d\n\nTeamsters President and Business Representative Kyle Bollinger was unavailable for comment by deadline Wednesday.\n\nThis is the first three-year contract the union has secured in several years. A series of one-year contracts preceded the newest one while the village observed how the Affordable Care Act would affect health insurance costs.\n\nTeamsters Local 525 represents workers in Calhoun, Greene, Jersey, Macoupin, Madison and Montgomery counties.\n\nReporter Kelsey Landis can be reached at 618-208-6460, Ext. 1396 or on Twitter @kelseylandis.\n\nBy Kelsey Landis [email protected]\n\nReporter Kelsey Landis can be reached at 618-208-6460, Ext. 1396 or on Twitter @kelseylandis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-IL", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Alton", "og": {"site_name": "The Telegraph", "description": "GODFREY \u2014 Godfrey Street Department workers have a new three-year contract after more than five months of negotiations with the village.The village board of trustees unanimously approved the contract at Tuesday night\u2019s board meeting.
