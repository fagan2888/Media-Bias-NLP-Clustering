You eat. You pay. And you tip.\n\nMore than 4 million American workers rely on tips to make a living, and more than 60 percent of them are employed in the foodservice industry usually as servers or bartenders.\n\nIn most states, tipped workers \u2013employees who receive at least $30 per month in tips\u2013earn a base pay significantly lower than the minimum wage. At the federal level, minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 an hour, which hasn\u2019t increased in 25 years.\n\nThe rationale is that tipped workers will make at least minimum wage through the tips left by their customers.\n\nShannon Sorenson, a waitress in Wisconsin, said the instability of tips makes it difficult for her to plan financially.\n\n\u201cThere are some days the tips are amazing,\u201d she told PBS NewsHour Weekend. \u201cThere\u2019s days that, you know, I\u2019m making probably compared to someone with a four-year degree. But then there\u2019s other days that I\u2019m making nothing. It\u2019s so tough.\u201d\n\nWhen tips aren\u2019t enough to make minimum wages, employers are supposed to make up the difference. But, according to the Department of Labor, there were at least 1,500 cases of tip credit violations in the past three years.\n\nSome states like Minnesota, have eliminated the separate wage structure and now require employers to pay tipped workers the full minimum wage as base pay, regardless of tips. That means more money for tipped workers\u2019 bottom line.\n\n\u201cWhat we see in those states is that the poverty rate among tipped workers is dramatically lower than in the states where they\u2019re getting $2.13 per hour as their base wage,\u201d David Cooper of the Economic Policy Institute said.\n\n\u201cWhat that tells us is that, even though, in theory, these folks in the other states are supposed to be getting at least the normal minimum wage, something isn\u2019t adding up.\u201d\n\nBut restaurant employers in Minnesota say that paying tipped workers more has made the cost of running a restaurant unmanageable. It has also increased the wage disparity between the serving staff and the kitchen staff, who don\u2019t earn tips.\n\nThe move has prompted some restaurants to address the wage issue in another way: by paying servers a higher hourly rate, but eliminating tipping altogether from their restaurants.\n\nRead the full transcript of this segment below:\n\nLESA MELBY: Hello gentlemen, how are you today?\n\nALISON STEWART: Lesa Melby has been a waitress at \u201cGrandma\u2019s Restaurant Company\u201d in Duluth, Minnesota, for 34 years.\n\nALISON STEWART: How many tables can you handle comfortably?\n\nLESA MELBY: Kind of a lot.\n\nALISON STEWART: A lot? How many?\n\nLESA MELBY: I can comfortably do probably nine.\n\nALISON STEWART: Wow. That\u2019s impressive.\n\nALISON STEWART: Melby relies on tips as a core part of her income. But she also gets paid Minnesota\u2019s state minimum wage of 9 dollars an hour.\n\nALISON STEWART: If you have a day when you get completely stiffed on tips, you will still take home your minimum wage.\n\nLESA MELBY: right. Right.\n\nALISON STEWART: The federal minimum wage is 7.25 an hour. But in 43 states employers are allowed to pay tipped workers less \u2014 some as little as $2.13 an hour, a federal wage which has not increased in 25 years.\n\nThe rationale is that customer tips are supposed to make up the difference between 2.13 an hour and the minimum wage. And if the tipped employee doesn\u2019t receive the minimum wage through tips, employers are required to pay the difference. In the industry it is called \u201ctopping up.\u201d\n\nIn seven states, including Minnesota, \u201ctopping up\u201d is not an issue because those states require employers to pay tipped workers the full minimum wage. Tips are considered additional income.\n\nALISON STEWART: Right next door to Minnesota, here in Wisconsin, it\u2019s a different reality. The minimum wage for tipped workers in Wisconsin is $2.33 an hour.\n\nALISON STEWART: Shannon Sorenson lives in Eau Claire Wisconsin, about an hour\u2019s drive from the Minnesota border. She\u2019s been working as a waitress for about 6 years and her current employer pays her a little more: 3 dollars an hour before tips. She recently switched to working part time.\n\nSHANNON SORENSON: There are some days the tips are amazing. There\u2019s days that, you know, I\u2019m making probably compared to someone with a four-year degree. But then there\u2019s other days that I\u2019m making nothing. It\u2019s so tough. I got the car payment, I got the bill payment. Oh, I got the car insurance payment too. Oh wait, I also need to eat too.\u201d\n\nALISON STEWART: Do you think you could survive being a server in Wisconsin full-time?\n\nSHANNON SORENSON: It would be a very stressful life. Very stressful. Living paycheck to paycheck. Never really knowing what I\u2019m going to make. I don\u2019t want that.\n\nALISON STEWART: Now Sorenson wants to finish her college degree and pursue a career in interior design. She likes being a waitress and her bosses but she rarely makes enough to support herself.\n\nSHANNON SORENSON: People just don\u2019t understand how much work goes into being a waitress. And just the days I don\u2019t get a lot of money, it\u2019s just so hard. And everything becomes more expensive, so it\u2019s harder and harder.\n\nALISON STEWART: David Cooper has been studying tipped labor for the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan, Washington think tank. Cooper says almost 15-percent of tipped servers earn less than the federal poverty line. But in states that pay higher base wages, tipped workers, like Lesa Melby in Minnesota, are faring better.\n\nDAVID COOPER: What we see in those states is that the poverty rate among tipped workers is dramatically lower than in the states where they\u2019re getting the $2.13 per hour as their base wage. So, what that tells us is that, you know, even though, in theory, these folks in the other states are supposed to be getting at least the normal minimum wage, something isn\u2019t adding up.\n\nALISON STEWART: Even though employers are supposed to \u201ctop up\u201d and make sure tipped workers earn the full minimum wage, Cooper says, they don\u2019t always do so.\n\nDAVID COOPER: You have to do this additional calculation of adding up their tips, and counting their hours, and making sure that the base wage plus tips equals the full minimum wage. And it\u2019s complicated. And it\u2019s also complicated for employers, too. Because the law isn\u2019t entirely clear about how to do this calculation.\n\nALISON STEWART: The federal labor department has looked into this question. In the past three years, tip credit violations were found in over 1,500 investigations resulting in nearly 15.5 million dollars in back wages being identified.\n\nALISON STEWART: Employers are supposed to match up to the minimum wage if you don\u2019t make it.\n\nSHANNON SORENSON: I did not know that.\n\nALISON STEWART: What if someone said to you, \u201cwow, we\u2019re going to be just like your neighbors over there in Minnesota and you\u2019re going to get minimum wage as your base salary, plus your tips\u201d?\n\nSHANNON SORENSON: I would love that. I actually know some people who used to work in Minnesota as a server, and then they came over here. And they realized that they\u2019re only making $2.33, and they\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m literally losing thousands of dollars by coming over here in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nALISON STEWART: At the Butter Bakery Caf\u00e9, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, waiter Andrew Dunn says being paid the state\u2019s required 9-dollar-an-hour minimum wage before tips is a crucial safety net.\n\nANDREW DUNN: The amount I\u2019m working is the maximum that I can work right now. And I pay all my bills, but not a lot more. So it would be very hard to have my base wage slip below the minimum wage. We have those slow mornings, where hardly anybody comes in, and your tips are really low.\n\nALISON STEWART: In terms of the percentage you take home, on your best day, what percentage is base wage and what percent is tip?\n\nANDREW DUNN: On the best day, I would say that my base wage is about half, and my tips are about half, and on the worst day, my base wage is about three-quarters of what I take home, and my tips are about a quarter.\n\nALISON STEWART: Butter Bakery Cafe is not a full service restaurant, so there is less opportunity for tipping servers. Owner Dan Swenson-Klatt says paying his workers a living wage has always been a priority.\n\nDAN SWENSON-KLATT: Currently, I have to pay a little more, because they don\u2019t see the same level of tips. If I knew they were getting a lot more tips, I might look at dropping my base wage a bit more. Cause ideally it\u2019s about what they make total, the total compensation.\n\nALISON STEWART: At Grandma\u2019s Restaurant Company in Duluth, where servers can make a higher amount of tips, Lesa Melby is afraid that her customers will tip her less if they learn of her minimum wage increases.\n\nLESA MELBY: I make more money off of my tips than I do my paycheck. And if people are going to think that I\u2019m getting a higher minimum wage, they\u2019re going to start tipping less or not at all.\n\nALISON STEWART: And Grandma\u2019s regional manager Tony Boen says that the requirement to pay servers minimum wage has had unintended consequences at their six restaurants. For one, it has increased the wage disparity between the serving and kitchen staff.\n\nTONY BOEN: The mandated minimum wage increase was giving an increase to our most highly compensated employees, at the peril of our cooks and the guys in the back of the house, who don\u2019t make tips. So we needed to find a way, and we still need to find a way, to bridge that wage disparity. So that\u2019s a huge challenge for us. How can we do that?\n\nALISON STEWART: They\u2019ve raised prices to cover the higher labor costs for their 400 to 600 employees, the number fluctuates depending on the season. But Boen says that\u2019s not enough to keep up with ongoing mandatory minimum wage jumps. The next one will be in august from 9 to 9.50 an hour.\n\nALISON STEWART: Have you ever had a customer say, \u201cHey, why are your prices going up?\u201d\n\nTONY BOEN: No. They don\u2019t say that.\n\nALISON STEWART: What do they say?\n\nTONY BOEN: They just don\u2019t come. We\u2019ve cut jobs. We\u2019ve cut hours. We closed three restaurants that became unprofitable due to minimum wage, plus some other factors but that was a huge factor.\n\nALISON STEWART: On the other hand, employment in the hospitality industry in states that pay full minimum wage to tipped workers actually saw stronger growth from 1995 to 2014 than in states that pay less.\n\nALISON STEWART: When we talk about raising the minimum wage, what can we do to help the restaurant owner?\n\nDAVID COOPER: I think, as long as you phase in those increases over time, it gives businesses time to adjust. When you raise the minimum wage, all of the competitors are also facing that additional labor cost. So, presumably, they should be able to pass that additional cost on through higher prices, and no one\u2019s going to be at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nI think that the tipping system creates some unique challenges there because at a higher-end restaurant, they know that the clientele probably has a little more money to spend; they can absorb those price increases a little more easily. At a, you know, more family dining restaurant, it might be a little harder to absorb those increases.\n\nALISON STEWART: Some restaurants are addressing the wage issue by paying servers like other employees: wait staff receive a higher hourly rate, but the restaurant has a no tipping policy.\n\nERICK HARCEY: Rib-eye, seat 9.\n\nALISON STEWART: That\u2019s how chef and restaurant owner Erick Harcey runs his two Minneapolis restaurants. Customers at his \u201cVictory 44\u201d and \u201cUpton 43\u201d are told they should not leave a tip.\n\nERICK HARCEY: A lot of it was just sort of trying to get in front of some of the change, the policy. The minimum wage is going up.\n\nALISON STEWART: Servers at his restaurants are paid a starting base salary of 17 dollars an hour. To cover the cost, he raised his prices 18 percent \u2014 about the equivalent of a tip at his restaurant. The no tipping policy also helps him pay the kitchen staff higher wages.\n\nERICK HARCEY: For the servers, it may have averaged out slightly. Some are making more. Some maybe slightly less, but it\u2019s guaranteed. But for the cooks, the dishwashers, the hosts, they\u2019re making substantially more than they have in the past.\n\nWAITRESS: We are gratuity-free so the number here is your total for the evening.\n\nALISON STEWART: How are you going to know when this has been a success?\n\nERICK HARCEY: I feel it\u2019s a success already.\n\nALISON STEWART: Really? Why?\n\nERICK HARCEY: The success I\u2019m gauging is the feedback from the guests. They\u2019re just \u2014 they love the experience.\n\nAnd when they leave and say, \u201cYou know what? This was phenomenal service,\u201d they\u2019re not, \u201coh, it was better because there was no tips.\u201d they\u2019re just stating, \u201cThis was great service.\u201d and then, at the end of the night, I, you know, I count my cash in the register. That\u2019s the success.\n\nChasing the Dream: Poverty and Opportunity in America is a multi-platform public media initiative that provides a deeper understanding of the impact of poverty on American society.
