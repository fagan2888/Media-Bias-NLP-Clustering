My heart is telling me I\u2019m better off alone. My husband can be very controlling, but I am struggling with guilt that he thinks we will reconcile. He is trying hard to address the issues we had and is in counseling himself. I don\u2019t want to lead him on, but if I tell him \u201cdivorce\u201d I know he will only increase his efforts to win me back.\n\nA: I\u2019m guessing that part of your instinct to walk on eggshells is not about guilt, but rather fear. It sounds like he\u2019ll make it very hard for you to do what you feel is best for you, and that he will be relentless in getting his way (romantic in movies, but not so much with a real-life controlling ex).\n\nGive yourself even more emotional space to get out from his grip, to evaluate your feelings and generate a plan of action. It\u2019s great he\u2019s working on himself, but that may not be enough. And you need a space of your own to hear yourself think, and to have those thoughts and feelings validated.\n\nSeek counseling on your own, so that your decision is one that springs from your own wants and needs - not his.\n\nQ: I am in my first real relationship. I love him, but he makes little, picky comments about my appearance. When you add them up, he has criticized practically every part of my body.\n\nIt\u2019s like \u201cYou should run more \u2014 I bet it would tone you up\u201d or \u201cTime for a trim \u2014 your hair is out of control.\u201d It ruins the moment. He thinks I\u2019m too sensitive and he\u2019s just trying to be helpful.\n\nA: This is the reality: He\u2019s consistently criticizing you, then criticizing your feelings about being criticized. If he thinks it\u2019s \u201chelpful\u201d to repeatedly make you feel unattractive, and then to tell you that you should just get used to it, I urge you to reconsider this whole shebang.\n\nFirst relationships can be bliss, but they run the risk of making you settle for subpar treatment. I hear your love for him, but in situations like this, that attachment can make it harder to pull the plug \u2014 even when an advice columnist\u2019s gut tells you to.\n\nAndrea Bonior, a clinical psychologist, writes a weekly mental health advice column for The Washington Post\u2019s Express and is author of \u201cThe Friendship Fix.\u201d For more information, visit www.drandreabonior.com.
