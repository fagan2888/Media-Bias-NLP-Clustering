Intakes varied on a regional level \u2014 2.18g in parts of Africa, 3.6g in North America, 5.5g in Central Asia \u2014 but for the most part, we\u2019re all just eating too much salt.\n\n\"These 1.65 million deaths represent nearly one in 10 of all deaths from cardiovascular causes worldwide,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \"These new findings inform the need for strong policies to reduce dietary sodium in the United States and across the world.\"\n\nIn fact, in the U.S., Mozaffarian and his team found 58,000 cardiovascular deaths were directly tied to sodium consumption. And regardless of sodium, cardiovascular-related disease is the number one cause of death around the world.\n\nAccording to WHO, most cardiovascular disease can be prevented by avoiding risk factors, which, in addition to sodium, include tobacco use, obesity, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n\nHow can we kick our salt habit? Essentially, an intervention, Mozaffarian said. A separate study published in Hypertension says reducing sodium intake would save up to 850,000 lives over the next several years. Also, cutting as little as four percent of sodium from processed or restaurant-prepared foods would save up to 500,000 lives.\n\nIt's true some salt is helpful \u2014 it balances fluid in the body and keeps muscles from contracting \u2014 but sticking to the recommended amount is what promotes better health. Some healthier alternatives for when a food's flavor is sub-par: herbs and spices. Garlic and black pepper powder, cayenne, lemon juice, and basil are all considered legit swaps for salt.\n\nSource: Mozaffarian, D, Fahimi, S, Singh, G, et al.
