Another is assured of elimination.\n\nThat\u2019s what will happen Monday when Serena Williams plays older sister Venus Williams for the sixth time at the grass-court Grand Slam in southwest London.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been unbelievable for the sport. I\u2019ve said that many times,\u201d said Roger Federer, a seven-time Wimbledon champion who will also be playing on Manic Monday. \u201cTheir head-to-heads, I don\u2019t know how much that has to do with it. I think it\u2019s more their individual play.\u201d\n\nIndividually and together, the Williams sisters have become two of the greatest champions at the All England Club. They have each won five singles titles, and have teamed up to win five more in doubles.\n\nAgainst each other on the grass at Wimbledon, Serena leads 3-2, with all three of her wins coming in finals. Venus won one final, and also won a semifinal match against her younger sibling in 2000 \u2014 the first time they met on court at the tournament.\n\nAlthough Serena is still at the top of her game and going for a true Grand Slam this season, Venus has been struggling for the past few years and was diagnosed with an energy-sapping autoimmune disease in 2011, three years after her last Wimbledon title. It was the previous year, in 2010, when she last reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.\n\nBut this year, Venus has been nearing her past high standards, winning all three of her matches in straight sets.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing so well,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI\u2019m practicing next to her every day and I\u2019m in awe of how she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s a little frustrating because I know I have to play her.\u201d\n\nThe Williams matchup is just one of the 16 fourth-round matches on the schedule for Monday \u2014 eight for the men and eight for the women.\n\nHere are some things to know about Monday\u2019s matches:\n\nROGER\u2019S RECORD\n\nRoger Federer is the only current player with more Wimbledon singles titles than a Williams, and the seven-time champion is one away from a record-setting eighth.\n\nFederer has had a relatively straightforward first week, winning his first two matches in straight sets and his third in four. His next opponent is 20th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut, a Spaniard who is playing at Wimbledon for the third time and has never reached the fourth round.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All-Williams matchup headlines Monday\u2019s action at Wimbledon", "title": "All-Williams matchup headlines Monday\u2019s action at Wimbledon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "All-Williams matchup headlines Monday\u2019s action at Wimbledon", "title": "All-Williams matchup headlines Monday\u2019s action at Wimbledon", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/all_williams_matchup_headlines_mondays_action_at_wimbledon/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/britain-wimbledon-tennis.jpeg45-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "All-Williams matchup headlines Monday\u2019s action at Wimbledon", "title": "All-Williams matchup headlines Monday\u2019s action at Wimbledon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/britain-wimbledon-tennis.jpeg45-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Lehourites", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLONDON (AP) \u2014 One five-time Wimbledon champion is guaranteed to reach the quarterfinals.\nAgainst each other on the grass at Wimbledon, Serena leads 3-2, with all three of her wins coming in finals.\nThat\u2019s what will happen Monday when Serena Williams plays older sister Venus Williams for the sixth time at the grass-court Grand Slam in southwest London.\nI\u2019ve said that many times,\u201d said Roger Federer, a seven-time Wimbledon champion who will also be playing on Manic Monday.\nVenus won one final, and also won a semifinal match against her younger sibling in 2000 \u2014 the first time they met on court at the tournament."}
