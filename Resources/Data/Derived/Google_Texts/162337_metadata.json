The FDA based its designation on Insmed's phase 2 study results, and now Insmed will work with the FDA to determine the optimal pathway to a possible regulatory approval for Arikayce. As a refresher, the breakthrough therapy designation allows investigational drugs with game-changing potential to potentially file new drug applications using early and mid-stage data as the basis for approval. It can also result in an expedited review process once an NDA is filed.\n\nNow what: The breakthrough designation on Insmed comes as a bit of a surprise given how mixed its phase 2 results were for Arikayce. While the secondary endpoint of culture conversion heavily favored the Arikayce-treated group with considerably more culture negative patients than the placebo at days 84 and 168, which is a positive, Arikayce also failed to meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant change in mycobacterial density using a seven-point scale from baseline through week 12. Not to mention that Arikayce was also associated with a higher number of adverse events during its phase 2 study relative to the control arm. Though today's move is clearly positive in that it could push Arikayce toward a new drug application very soon, I'm not sold on Insmed or its lead drug as of yet and would suggest sticking to the sidelines following today's romp higher.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:51", "date": "2014-06-18T17:51:00Z", "description": "Insmed shares soar after the Food and Drug Administration grants its lead drug a special designation.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_single-control_50", "author": "Sean Williams", "promo": "Insmed shares soar after the Food and Drug Administration grants its lead drug a special designation.", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "Insmed shares soar after the Food and Drug Administration grants its lead drug a special designation.", "title": "Why Insmed Incorporated Shares Skyrocketed --  The Motley Fool"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Insmed shares soar after the Food and Drug Administration grants its lead drug a special designation.", "title": "Why Insmed Incorporated Shares Skyrocketed --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/06/18/why-insmed-incorporated-shares-skyrocketed.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffool%2Ftmf-logo.png&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "headline": "Why Insmed Incorporated Shares Skyrocketed", "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "c9b1ae54-f709-11e3-83b3-0050569d32b9", "pitch": 823, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2014 06 18", "tickers": "INSM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now what: The breakthrough designation on Insmed comes as a bit of a surprise given how mixed its phase 2 results were for Arikayce.\nAs a refresher, the breakthrough therapy designation allows investigational drugs with game-changing potential to potentially file new drug applications using early and mid-stage data as the basis for approval.\nWhat: Shares of Insmed (NASDAQ:INSM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing inhaled therapeutics to treat serious lung diseases, surged as much as 41% this morning after announcing that the Food and Drug Administration had granted its lead investigational drug Arikayce the highly coveted breakthrough therapy designation.\nThe FDA based its designation on Insmed's phase 2 study results, and now Insmed will work with the FDA to determine the optimal pathway to a possible regulatory approval for Arikayce.\nNot to mention that Arikayce was also associated with a higher number of adverse events during its phase 2 study relative to the control arm."}
