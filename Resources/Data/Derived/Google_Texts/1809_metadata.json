His plan immediately had Democrats and some Republicans crying foul.\n\n\u201cWe can quite frankly do much better than what the House is proposing,\u201d Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said Tuesday on the Senate floor.\n\nThe Obama administration threatened a veto of Rogers\u2019 measure, saying in a statement the amount was \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and that funds for Ebola shouldn\u2019t be cut to pay for it.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is close to running out of the money it needs to develop a Zika vaccine and may not be able to begin testing early next year without more funding, the head of its infectious disease program told Bloomberg BNA in an interview Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really running out of time,\u201d Anthony Fauci said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the money soon, then we\u2019re really going to have to start modifying our plans.\u201d\n\nBattleground Florida\n\nEven if House and Senate Republicans were on the same page it could take months to get the broader spending package to the president\u2019s desk. The amount of money at stake could be dwarfed by the political blowback should the virus take hold in key election battleground states like Florida later this year.\n\n\u201cWhy take the chance that you\u2019re going to have to go home in August and September and explain to millions of people across this country why are so many Americans being infected by this and you were low-balling our approach to it a few months ago?\u201d Rubio asked his colleagues.\n\nThe Florida Republican is backing the full $1.9 billion Obama administration request and has repeatedly taken his colleagues to task for slow-walking the matter.\n\n\u201cThis is a public health emergency that cannot wait for this extended debate on this issue,\u201d Rubio said.\n\n\u2018Totally Inadequate\u2019\n\nDemocrats also torched the House plan.\n\n\u201cTotally inadequate,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the heir apparent to Minority Leader Harry Reid, said in an interview in the Capitol. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have enough to fight Zika and it robs Peter to pay Paul.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the Democrat who negotiated the $1.1 billion compromise package with Republican Roy Blunt of Missouri and also pushed unsuccessfully for the full $1.9 billion request in a separate vote. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t get us to what we need. It\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d she said of the House bill, adding that the money should be treated as emergency spending that doesn\u2019t require offsetting cuts.\n\nBut Rogers said the House plan would give the administration about $1.2 billion to spend on Zika through Sept. 30, counting money the administration already transferred from Ebola accounts at Republicans\u2019 request, with potentially more on the way in next year\u2019s spending bills.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just for the next five months,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House request was for several years.\u201d The Senate proposal would provide funds through Sept. 30, 2017.\n\nEbola Cuts\n\nRogers\u2019s package takes even more from the Ebola account \u2014 money the administration says will help prevent another outbreak in the coming years, as well as from other administration accounts \u2014 rather than provide new funding.\n\nHe disputed whether the administration really needs the money for Ebola, saying they have about $2 billion in that account \u201cthat\u2019s just laying there.\u201d\n\nThe broader philosophical debate has Democrats and some Republicans contending that spending for emergencies like Zika shouldn\u2019t count against the spending caps set in last year\u2019s bipartisan budget deal. Congress has traditionally approved emergency spending above the caps, ranging from responses to viral outbreaks to hurricane relief. But it\u2019s a practice fiscal conservatives have repeatedly chafed at because it adds to the deficit.\n\nThe spending offsets, Rogers said, are \u201cnecessary\u201d for House Republicans.\n\nThree Amendments\n\nSenate Republicans held three votes Tuesday on amendments to a package of spending bills that fund transportation, housing and veterans programs, H.R. 2577. Senators blocked the full $1.9 billion emergency request sponsored by Florida\u2019s two senators, Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson, as well as an amendment that would offset the $1.1 billion package with cuts to an Obamacare account.\n\nThe second vote was intended to give Republicans enough political cover to back the deficit-raising emergency package crafted by Blunt and Murray, because they could blame Democrats for not supporting the Obamacare cuts.\n\nThe final 68-29 vote exposed deep splits within the GOP. Most vulnerable Republicans up for re-election backed the $1.1 billion in emergency Zika spending, along with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. But most Republicans voted no, including No. 2 Republican John Cornyn of Texas, and two facing tough re-election fights, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.\n\nToomey, a former president of the conservative Club for Growth, stood at the well of the Senate for several minutes before finally voting no.\n\nThe spending bill package would still need to be approved by the Senate and the House, which is likely to further delay the enactment of any Zika funding.\n\nBlunt, who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that funds health programs, told reporters he hopes for a deal with the House on Zika funding in a few weeks. He said he wants funding to last through September 2017, when a vaccine may be available.\n\nRogers said Tuesday he would try to get the Zika bill on the House floor Wednesday, although \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of competition\u201d this week for floor time. He described the Senate\u2019s much bigger bill as \u201ca bridge too far.\u201d\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "House and Senate Republicans can't get on the same page when it comes to fighting the Zika virus -- and Democrats are pouncing.
