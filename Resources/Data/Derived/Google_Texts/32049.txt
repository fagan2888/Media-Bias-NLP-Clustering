Today marks the return of Cartoonist Jonny Hawkins to Health News Florida page. A test run of his offbeat health humor this summer proved successful. And we're happy to bring him back every Friday.

We hope you enjoy a laugh or two as you end the work week. And as always, let us know what you think of this or any other news here at Health News Florida. We look forward to hearing from you.
