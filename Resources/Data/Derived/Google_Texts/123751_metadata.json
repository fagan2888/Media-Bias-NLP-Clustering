Instead, many Republicans have gone back to some old favorites: \u201cObamacare\u201d is causing premiums to spike; the nation can\u2019t afford the system; it will bankrupt us all; we\u2019re all doomed, etc.\n\nI can only imagine how frustrating it must be lately to be an opponent of this law.\n\nThe most expensive provisions of Obamacare will cost taxpayers about $100 billion less than expected, the Congressional Budget Office said Monday. CBO also said it doesn\u2019t expect big premium increases next year for insurance plans sold through the health care law\u2019s exchanges. In its latest analysis, CBO said the law\u2019s coverage provisions \u2013 a narrow part of the law that includes only certain policies \u2013 will cost the government $36 billion this year, which is $5 billion less than CBO\u2019s previous estimate. Over the next decade, the provisions will cost about $1.4 trillion \u2013 roughly $104 billion less than CBO last estimated.\n\nThe CBO report is available in its entirety here (pdf). The CBO also released a helpful summary with some lovely charts.\n\nThe report found that coverage is likely to cost less thanks to premiums being lower than expected through the exchange marketplaces. In other words, take pretty much everything you\u2019ve heard from congressional Republicans lately and believe the opposite.\n\nAnd as part of the same review, of course, the CBO added that the Affordable Care Act will also continue to reduce the federal budget deficit, which is also the opposite of critics\u2019 claims.\n\nWait, for the right, it gets worse.\n\nIgor Volsky flagged some news that was easy to overlook.\n\nIn a blow to conservative critics, the office also concluded that the law\u2019s so-called shock absorbers \u2013 reinsurance payments that are distributed to insurers that attract high-cost enrollees \u2013 \u201creduced exchange premiums this year by approximately 10 percent\u201d and will \u201creduce premiums by smaller amounts in 2015 and 2016.\u201d Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (FL) have described the provision as an \u201cinsurance bailout\u201d and have introduced legislation to repeal it. C BO also found additional savings in Medicaid, revising downward government spending per adult enrolled in the program. Ultimately, 12 million more nonelderly people will have health insurance in 2014 as a result of the law. Twenty-six million more \u201cwill be insured each year from 2017 through 2024 than would have been the case without the ACA,\u201d the CBO concluded.\n\nSo, taken together, what have we learned of late?\n\n* ACA enrollment through exchanges reached 7.1 million , ahead of early estimates.\n\n* The ACA is quickly reducing the uninsured rate .\n\n* Thanks in part to the ACA, health care spending has slowed dramatically and health care inflation is at its lowest point in 50 years.\n\n* According to the Department of Commerce, the ACA is also having a positive effect on personal incomes .\n\n* And according to the CBO, the system is even more affordable than perviously projected.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It must be incredibly frustrating to be an ACA critic right now.
