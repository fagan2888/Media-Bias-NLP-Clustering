Syracuse, N.Y. -- New Yorkers are getting more time to complete their Obamacare applications.

The state announced today people who apply for coverage through the state health insurance exchange by the end of the day Sunday will have until Feb. 28 to finish their applications and enroll in health plans.

Nearly all Americans are required to have health insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. People who do not enroll can face financial penalties.

The state said people who want to enroll must start the application process by the end of Sunday by visiting the health insurance exchange website, calling the exchange's customer service center at 1-855-355-5777 or by making an appointment to get in-person assistance. The customer service center will be open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

All applications and enrollments must be completed by the end of the day Feb. 28. After that deadline, most individuals will not be able to enroll in private health plans offered through the exchange this year unless they move or have other special circumstances.

People can enroll in Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, anytime.

ACR Health at 835 W. Genesee St., Syracuse, will be open 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday to help people enroll.

Individuals can make appointments by calling 475-2430, extension 268.
