Now it wants another billion.\n\nHouse Republicans were flabbergasted when Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen asked the House Appropriations Committee for another $1 billion for the IRS budget for fiscal 2017, following the $290 million increase he got in fiscal 2016. An extra billion is a 12% beef-up for the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nSeems the customer service is a shambles, with 8 million, or half, of calls from taxpayers seeking to comply with the law going unanswered. And for those who do get through, it takes an average of 23 minutes on hold.\n\nCybersecurity has fallen apart, too, with hackers scooping up data in at least two major security breaches affecting 431,000 people based on the agency\u2019s failure to spend for vital upgrades. Koskinen said $900 million had been cut from that part of the budget \u2014 and used for ObamaCare enforcement.\n\n\u201cCongress, as I noted in my testimony, has underfunded \u2026 the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Koskinen said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner. \u201cThat does not remove the statutory mandate we have that we have to implement the Act.\u201d\n\nTo his credit, the House Appropriations Committee chairman wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cThe mandate we want you to have is to serve the public and you\u2019re not doing that,\u201d said Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican. He pointed out that Congress forked out the extra cash last year to ensure that the IRS improves customer service and cleans up its act after a string of scandals involving excessive bonuses, lavish conferences and the targeting of political dissidents.\n\n\u201cEach year we learn that customer service diminishes,\u201d Rogers told Koskinen, who admitted the situation has been bad for \u201cthree or four years.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may argue it\u2019s because the IRS budget has been cut, but I\u2019m going to argue it\u2019s because the IRS chooses to spend its funds in other areas like the Affordable Care Act, bonuses and conferences,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nKoskinen faults Congress for not funding ObamaCare enforcement. So he let vital services to fall apart to make ObamaCare a priority.\n\nAnd now he wants a billion more.\n\nIt\u2019s as if ObamaCare is black hole consuming the IRS, and not because of the law \u2014 but because of the president\u2019s priorities and the decisions of his officials. It\u2019s its own reason to scrap ObamaCare and for the IRS to just say no.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Big Government: The IRS admitted to Congress what many suspect: That its abysmal customer service and failure to protect taxpayer data are\u00a0because it's diverted", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Big Government: The IRS admitted to Congress what many suspect: That its abysmal customer service and failure to protect taxpayer data are\u00a0because it\u2019s diverted its resources to ObamaCare.
