But if you're looking to spice things up, take a cue from mixologists around Europe, who are bringing out the apple's zesty flavor in drinks made with fresh crushed fruit and special infusions.\n\nENLARGE Delicious Sour Alys Tomlinson at Difford\n\nAt T Bar at the Grand Hotel Tremezzo on Lake Como, the new season cocktail, the Autumn Fusion, is made by crushing half a green apple and adding gomme syrup, Thai pepper and lime to vodka. It is topped with a slice of fresh apple.\n\n\"This cocktail is the perfect combination of autumnal flavors and colors from Lake Como and the surrounding mountains,\" says barman Max Chinaglia. \"The fresh green apples\u2014grown in the Valtellina valley, just north of Lake Como\u2014combined with the triple-distilled vodka from Russia, create a very special sweet and sour flavor.\"\n\nThe final touch, grinding a bit of Thai pepper on the top of the cocktail, adds some shine to the freshly squeezed apples.\n\n\u2018Using infusions or apple-based distillates, the apple flavor can add warmth and roundness to a drink.\u2019\n\nTrue apple addicts should head to the Park Hyatt Hamburg, where Apples Bar has an entire menu dedicated to, well, the apple. Made with freshly squeezed juice, the 12 signature drinks\u2014with names like Applestini and Applesrinha\u2014will make sure you don't fall too far from the tree. For a little heat, try the Hot Jalisco, a mix of Tequila, vanilla, lime, apples and chili.\n\nAt Nightjar in London, the Delicious Sour is made with a crab apple infusion, instead of the traditional Applejack. \"By using a crab apple infusion, we are able to preserve the more delicate flavors of Hennessy Fine de Cognac, whilst bringing a fresh and slightly tarter apple flavor to the drink,\" says Nightjar owner Edmund Weil. \"The cocktail is a perfect autumnal treat.\"\n\nAccording to Mr. Weil, the apple flavor itself can perform many functions. Apple juice adds bite and freshness\u2014particularly when combined with herbal flavors like Zubr\u00f3wka or more tropical, like passion fruit. \"In our case, however, using infusions or apple-based distillates, the apple flavor can add warmth and roundness to a drink,\" he says. \"A little like the difference between biting into an apple fresh off the tree and tucking into a warm apple pie.\"\n\nDELICIOUS SOUR\n\nFrom Nightjar, London\n\nIngredients\n\n30 mL Hennessy Fine de Cognac, infused with dehydrated crab apples\n\n30 mL Umeshu\n\nBee pollen syrup\n\nJuice of half a lime\n\nCombine the ingredients together in a cocktail shaker and shake.
