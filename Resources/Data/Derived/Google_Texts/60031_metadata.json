I expected someone dressed in a sharp suit, his eyes hidden behind designer sunglasses. Yet when I walked into Nelson Mandela\u2019s bedroom with the breakfast tray, I found no stiff head of state but a warm, unaffected man.\n\nMandela sat up, and I put the tray next to him. He thanked me graciously and began chatting about the previous night\u2019s game drive: \u201cOh, last night we had an amazing time. We saw a leopard. We saw it jump onto the back of a buck.\u201d\n\nThe man we all called Madiba (his family tribal name) radiated humility, walking the grounds in a beat-up boxer\u2019s T-shirt, old tracksuit pants, and scuffed slippers. He was still trying to adjust to his immense stature after being released from twenty-seven years of isolation, most of it in a cramped coffin of a ten-by-ten cell on Robben Island. His innocence had been utterly destroyed by forces of which I was then blissfully ignorant, yet somehow during that unjust imprisonment, he had restored his own soul.\n\nIt was 1990. Mandela had become one of the most famous and inspiring people in the world, yet parts of him were still deeply imbedded in his years of prison life. People close to him within the ANC realized that he needed a period of adjustment and recovery. Enos Mabuza, an activist who had been close with my family for years, believed that Londoz, where apartheid\u2019s tentacles had never reached, would be the perfect place for Mandela to relax. Most important, if the people wanted to put themselves in his path, they\u2019d risk getting eaten\u2014an unusually compelling deterrent.\n\nThree months after his release from prison, Mandela paid the first of many visits to our reserve. At first he stayed in one of the guest chalets, but once he became more comfortable with the place, he preferred the quiet of our family cottage, where the accommodations were far more modest: a bed and a bookshelf. He liked the simplicity and being away from the hustle and bustle of the camp. He fell into a nice routine each morning: he would sleep in and then have a late breakfast with my uncle. Having already returned from an early morning\u2019s filming, Uncle John would sit at the head of a large stinkwood table, pour his muesli, and cut a very ripe banana into it. In true JV style, Uncle John treated Mandela exactly the same as he treated everyone else: as an equal and a friend. I have no doubt that if Mandela had been out in the bush during an amazing action sequence, Uncle John would have made him a camera assistant. Nelson would sit to John\u2019s left with a plate of fruit, and they would discuss recent events on the reserve, including the highlights of the morning\u2019s footage and the animal sightings from Mandela\u2019s latest game drive, which never failed to enchant him. I joined them often, although I can\u2019t say that, at age seven, I fully appreciated what momentous occasions these were.\n\nA few weeks into this routine, Mandela invited Uncle John to join him for a more official lunch at the camp with some ANC members who had come to the reserve to see him. Once again, I expected sharp suits, but these men were dressed in typical strugglewear: jeans and black leather jackets, more like union leaders than politicians. From the time they arrived on the front deck of the camp, it was clear that this was an event beyond the casual breakfast-in-slippers routine. When it came time to be seated, Uncle John, in a rare moment of tact, headed for a side seat at the table. Nelson stopped the proceedings. \u201cNo, John,\u201d he said in his gracious way. \u201cI would never take your place at the head. Please come and sit here.\u201d\n\nWhenever I went into the village with Mandela, it was clear just how important he was. People flocked around him, not in a mobbing way but at a respectful remove. Everyone just wanted to drink in his peaceful presence. Years later, when Oprah Winfrey asked him to be on her show, he agreed, then asked, \u201cWhat will it be about?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to comprehend that viewers would be on the edge of their seats, waiting to hear the story of a man unjustly imprisoned for twenty-seven years, who upon being freed immediately reconciled with his jailers and guided a reunited country toward freedom.\n\nMadiba was at Londolozi at the start of the CODESA talks between the ANC and the National Party, of which F. W. de Klerk was the president. The country was fragile, and tensions were high; the talks between these deeply opposed parties were meant to be about how to communicate on equal footing in the future. Almost immediately, the right wing of the National Party drove an armored vehicle into the latest summits and took them over, waving their old South African flags, as inflammatory a gesture as raising a Confederate flag in post-Civil War America. Mandela asked Dad, Mom, and Uncle John to charter a helicopter to fly him to the scene immediately.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t do it,\u201d they said. \u201cIf you land at the scene, they\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d\n\nMandela didn\u2019t care. \u201cI must be with my people. Charter me a helicopter.\u201d\n\nThe argument grew quite heated. \u201cWe are your people,\u201d Dad told him, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t help us if you fly off and get shot. We\u2019ll charter you an airplane and fly you to a nearby airport and you can get a report before you go in.\u201d Mandela stormed off. Shortly afterward, he returned and agreed with my parents and uncle. As it happened, by the time he flew in for the summit, the revolution was over and everyone was out having a barbecue.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only time we saw Mandela assert himself on behalf of his people. One Saturday night, reports came in that ten people had been murdered in Alexandra Township, a poor black slum\u2014more casualties of the Third Force, a group dedicated to the breakdown of negotiations between the ANC and the National Party. The Third Force was essentially made up of terrorists who committed atrocious acts and blamed them on one party or the other to try to blow apart the fragile peace.\n\nWe had an ancient TV in the family room with bunny ears antennae. The next morning as Dad and Mandela watched the news, they saw only a snowy transmission of this tragedy. Our phone lines were down for scheduled maintenance. In classic Londolozi style, Dad came to a last-minute rescue with a jerry-rigged radiophone.\n\n\u201cDe Klerk!\u201d Mandela screamed into the line, trying to get his point across through heavy static. \u201cI\u2019m warning you! If the Third Force doesn\u2019t stop, I\u2019ll pull out of the negotiations!\u201d The connection was so terrible that the future president of the ANC and the current president of South Africa couldn\u2019t hear each other. Dad was frantic: the whole future of our country rested on a fuzzy phone line. Luckily, Dad was able to get the phone working and persuade Mandela to speak into the transmitter instead of holding it to his ear, and he and de Klerk came to a resolution. In late 1993, Mandela and de Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in negotiating a peaceful transition against the backdrop of imminent civil war. And in 1994, Nelson Mandela became the first democratically elected president of South Africa.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After his release from prison, the great man spent many weeks living with my family, and taught me about real grace", "title": "A great man will be visiting us: \u201cI walked into Nelson Mandela\u2019s bedroom\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After his release from prison, the great man spent many weeks living with my family, and taught me about real grace", "title": "A great man will be visiting us: \u201cI walked into Nelson Mandela\u2019s bedroom\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/07/a_great_man_will_be_visiting_us_i_walked_into_nelson_mandelas_bedroom/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/06/1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After his release from prison, the great man spent many weeks living with my family, and taught me about real grace", "title": "A great man will be visiting us: \u201cI walked into Nelson Mandela\u2019s bedroom\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/06/1.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Boyd Varty", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, de klerk, Editor's Picks, Londolozi, Madiba, Mandela 27 years, Mandela prison, Nelson Mandela, South Africa", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce42e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, de klerk, Editor's Picks, Londolozi, Madiba, Mandela 27 years, Mandela prison, Nelson Mandela, South Africa, News\u201cA very great man will be visiting us,\u201d Dad told me.\nYet when I walked into Nelson Mandela\u2019s bedroom with the breakfast tray, I found no stiff head of state but a warm, unaffected man.\n\u201cDe Klerk!\u201d Mandela screamed into the line, trying to get his point across through heavy static.\nWhen it came time to be seated, Uncle John, in a rare moment of tact, headed for a side seat at the table.\nAnd in 1994, Nelson Mandela became the first democratically elected president of South Africa."}
