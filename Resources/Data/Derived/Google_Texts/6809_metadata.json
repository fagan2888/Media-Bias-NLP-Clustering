And Mitchell isn\u2019t the only respected writer to take Twitter fiction seriously.\n\nEver see GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING film? Nottalotta action TBH, but v.classy allthesame. Some1 wrote novelisation2. (Like u I like books)xB\n\nOver the past four days, Mitchell has intermittently posted tweets from the perspective of his narrator, an obsessive stalker and hacker. The story is told in the style of slang-filled tweets, rather than 140-character snippets of narrative. But the Twitter handle @I_Bombadil is a reference to a Tolkien character, and there are frequent cultural allusions amid the hashtags and emojis.\n\nThe award-winning author David Mitchell is writing a new short story, and you can read his work-in-progress on Twitter.\n\nPhilip Pullman spent several months tweeting the tale of Jeffrey the housefly, Pulitzer prize-winner Jennifer Egan published Black Box via The New Yorker\u2019s Twitter feed, and Margaret Atwood was one of many established authors who took part in this year\u2019s #TwitterFiction festival.\n\nJeffrey listless, melancholic. My fault: I left a volume of French verse open on the kitchen table and he\u2019d spent the night on Baudelaire. \u2014 Philip Pullman (@PhilipPullman) November 21, 2013\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that writers\u2019 interest in Twitter fiction is partly driven by publishers. Authors are encouraged to use social media to engage with their readers, and a large Twitter following can translate into strong book sales.\n\nBut while Twitter may be filled with snarky comments and aggressive trolls, there\u2019s no reason why stories with serious literary value can\u2019t be published via tweets.\n\nMelissa Terras, a professor of Digital Humanities at University College London, says that every literary medium has some kind of constraint, and Twitter is simply the latest restriction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the role of literature to play with forms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn poetry you have very rigid forms, and people have to operate within those constraints. With Twitter fiction, people are taking the limitation of 140 characters and doing something creative. It\u2019s a slightly different art form and it creates a different experience of fiction.\u201d\n\nAuthors have already embraced several different styles of writing Twitter fiction.\n\nRita Raley, an associate professor of English at University of California, Santa Barbara, said that Mitchell\u2019s latest piece of Twitter fiction seems less compelling than his earlier work, though his use of modern vernacular \u201ccould work quite brilliantly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Raley describes Egan\u2019s Twitter story as \u201cshort poetic exercises,\u201d where atomistic tweets are strung together to form a narrative.\n\nPeople rarely look the way you expect them to, even when you\u2019ve seen pictures. \u2014 New Yorker Fiction (@NYerFiction) May 25, 2012\n\nShe points to Teju Cole\u2019s series of seven stories on drones as an example of fiction that can be told within one 140-character tweet.\n\n6. Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond. His torso was found, not his head. \u2014 Teju Cole (@tejucole) January 14, 2013\n\nNot everyone is convinced that Twitter fiction should be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cCan Twitter be an art form? Toothpicks can be an art form!\u201d Jonathan Franzen #NYerFest \u2014 Maria Popova (@brainpicker) October 5, 2013\n\nBut, as Terras says, resistance to new literary mediums is inevitable. In the Victorian era, critics were aghast when production-press technology became more advanced and allowed authors to write longer novels. \u201cYou had all these critics saying, \u2018The books are too long, they\u2019re awful,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nBut as writers embraced the new medium, readers and critics came to celebrate their work. Perhaps the today\u2019s avant-garde authors of Twitter will be just as convincing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Authors are turning social media into a literary genre, 140 characters at a time.", "author": "Olivia Goldhill", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "David Mitchell, Philip Pullman, and Margaret Atwood have all experimented with stories in 140 characters.", "title": "Is Twitter Fiction the New Literary Genre?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/09/eye/facebook.jpg?1441915196", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/the-rise-of-twitter-fiction/404761/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb795\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Philip Pullman (@PhilipPullman) November 21, 2013There\u2019s no doubt that writers\u2019 interest in Twitter fiction is partly driven by publishers.\n\u2014 Teju Cole (@tejucole) January 14, 2013Not everyone is convinced that Twitter fiction should be taken seriously.\nWith Twitter fiction, people are taking the limitation of 140 characters and doing something creative.\nAnd Mitchell isn\u2019t the only respected writer to take Twitter fiction seriously.\nIt\u2019s a slightly different art form and it creates a different experience of fiction.\u201dAuthors have already embraced several different styles of writing Twitter fiction."}
