I was very sad to hear of Dr. Munir’s resignation from Pottsville Internists Associates. He is a very kind, unselfish and caring physician. He will surely be missed by his patients and friends in Schuylkill County.

My hat’s off to Pine Grove Area School District for getting rid of that superintendent they had. In my opinion, it was $115,000 that would be better served flushed down the toilet. She destroyed Saint Clair Area School District inside and out and was very inflexible and hard to deal with. I congratulate Pine Grove for having enough sense to send her on her way, wherever that is.

To the caller from Ringtown who does not understand why most women will not vote for Hillary: Most women have self-respect and Christian values and will not vote for someone lacking these attributes. I would be ashamed to have Hillary represent America.

Instead of most people who go to work, come home and listen to snippets on the news, I read the newspaper and gather news. I read in your newspaper in black and white that Sen. Casey and Sen. Toomey, who never agreed to vote “yes” on anything together, conveniently voted for $700M in planes to go to Pakistan. That’s what people don’t understand, Democrat or Republican, it doesn’t matter. Such a debt problem but we can send that money to Pakistan. What a joke. Our country is crying about debt but we have $700M worth of planes that we can ship to Pakistan and both our Pennsylvania representatives voted “yes” on it. Give me a break.

Pottsville

Are you sure Pakistan wasn’t buying those planes? That sounds like a more likely scenario to me.

Shenandoah borough is missing a lot of income they could have. There are coal trucks going through town without tarps on them. There are illegally parked cars, especially at fire hydrants; and when the churches are in, there are cars parked without registration and inspection. A lot of income they could have.

According to reporters, the people disrupting Trump campaign events are Bernie Sanders’ supporters, communists and anarchists. They are not peaceful protesters. They are violent terrorists who should be arrested and prosecuted. They are trying to shut down the campaign event and prevent Trump from exercising his constitutional right of freedom of speech. Lock these terrorists up and throw away the key.

To all the callers complaining about the drug dealings and drug using and the cops not doing anything: I was one of the accusers until I became involved. Another set of eyes always helps. I started taking dates, times, descriptions of people, cars, even pictures. I’d like to think I helped clean up the druggie problem from a few months ago in my town.

Good for you!!
