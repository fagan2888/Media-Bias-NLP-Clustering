Q: What are muscle “knots” (often in the back or neck) made of?

A: Surprisingly, no one knows definitively what muscle knots are made of — and some researchers question whether they even exist.

Many experts believe that the knots, often referred to as myofascial trigger points, are “specific areas of contraction within the muscle fiber,” said Rob Grieve, a senior lecturer in physiotherapy at the University of the West of England.

The knots seem to develop when a muscle tenses repeatedly and “are normally not caused by a specific, traumatic event,” he said, “but by muscle overuse or faulty biomechanics.” (Also known as slouching.) It is thought that these small bits of hyper-tensed muscle cause discomfort by “blocking some of the normal blood flow to the affected tissue,” said Jan Dommerholt, a physical therapist in Bethesda, Maryland.

But in the March issue of Rheumatology, scientists pointed out that muscle knots rarely show up on scans, leaving researchers with “no scientific basis” for believing that knotted muscle fibers make us sore.

They contend the soreness is likely neural, involving the brain and irritated nerve endings.

Most therapists feel the best treatment for knots is to pummel them. Vigorously massage the sore spot with hands, Grieve said, or use a small, hard ball or a foam roller.

If the soreness persists, consult a doctor or physical therapist.
