Here\u2019s his letter in full:\n\nCome on, Oprah. You\u2019re way too smart to be this stupid.\n\nWhen are you going to get off this kick about Barack Obama being disrespected more than previous presidents just because he is a black man?\n\nIt\u2019s getting embarrassing, Oprah.\n\nYou\u2019re one of America\u2019s great talents and greatest success stories.\n\nYou\u2019re a self-made billionaire, an astute multimedia mogul, a beloved cultural icon.\n\nYou\u2019re admired around the world for your generosity and good works. Your opinions and endorsements influence what millions of people read, how they think, and who they vote for.\n\nBut after five years of President Obama\u2019s reign, you apparently still haven\u2019t learned a thing about presidential politics and race relations in this country.\n\nYou proved it again just last week in Britain when you were plugging that movie \u201cThe Butler.\u201d\n\nYou were asked \u2014 for the umpteenth time \u2014 by the BBC whether you thought President Obama was being treated unfairly or criticized disproportionately by the media and others because he was black.\n\nYou said, \u201cWhen the senator yelled out, \u2018You\u2019re a liar\u2019 \u2014 remember that? Yeah, I think that there is a level of disrespect for the office that occurs, and that occurs in some cases and maybe even many cases because he\u2019s African American.\u201d\n\nSeriously, Oprah.\n\nI realize your primary job in London was to promote \u201cThe Butler,\u201d the movie about the real-life black butler who worked in the White House for eight presidents that was so bad I dubbed it \u201cThe Butler from Another Planet.\u201d\n\nBut was your response to the BBC reporter\u2019s question \u2014 a variation of the same claim you\u2019ve made before \u2014 really the most thoughtful thing you could come up with?\n\nWere you jet-lagged? Exhausted? Were you weary of being asked the same dumb question and having to give the same cliched answer?\n\nCome on, Oprah. You\u2019re off your usual game.\n\nUsing the example of the president being called a liar in Congress as proof that President Obama is a victim of racism is getting pretty stale.\n\nIt occurred in 2009. And it wasn\u2019t a senator; it was South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson who yelled out \u201cYou lie\u201d when Obama was overpromising the benefits of his Affordable Care Act to a joint session of Congress.\n\nOprah, you\u2019re great. But you need to brush up on your history and current events.\n\nAmerica still has racists and bigots. They come in all colors and creeds. But you, better than anyone, must realize that the American people, especially the young, are increasingly colorblind.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t have become the most influential woman on the planet and America\u2019s richest black woman if white audiences hadn\u2019t fallen in love with you and your TV talk show.\n\nAnd President Obama couldn\u2019t have been elected twice without the broad support of white voters who cared more about his hopes and promises than the color of his skin.\n\nObama is being beat up for political reasons, not racial ones. Just take off those black-and-white glasses, Oprah, and read the headlines.\n\nObamacare is a disaster. Obama\u2019s economic policies are failing, and his administration is incompetent.\n\nThe president\u2019s bipartisan critics in the media and in Congress don\u2019t care what color his skin is, just as the \u201cdisrespecters\u201d of Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Ronald Reagan didn\u2019t care about their white skin.\n\nOprah, let\u2019s face it. It is you who is still fixated on the color of the president\u2019s skin.\n\nYou need to update and upgrade your thinking. What you say matters. People trust you. They expect intelligent thoughts about race from you, not outdated and predictable cliches.\n\nImagine if you had said something to that BBC reporter like, \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a really dumb and racist question. President Obama isn\u2019t America\u2019s black\n\npresident, he\u2019s America\u2019s president. He\u2019s taking his lumps because he\u2019s been screwing up. It happens to presidents all the time. Except for a few racists, no one in America cares anymore what color the president\u2019s skin is. Neither do I. I only care about the job he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nThat would have been an Oprah-worthy answer \u2014 and an important message about race for America.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s son wrote an open letter to Oprah Winfrey, slamming her for repeated accusations of racism hurled at those who disagree with President Obama.
