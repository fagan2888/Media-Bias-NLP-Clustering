John McCain. The nation has been through much since then, as have Mr. McCain and Mrs. Palin, who nevertheless remain on public radar. Mrs. Palin still rattles the landscape \u2014 particularly when it comes to her many critics.\n\n\u201cBless their hearts, those haters out there. They don\u2019t understand that it invigorates me to get out and defend the innocent. It makes me want to work so hard for justice in this country,\u201d she told Fox Business Network on Tuesday. \u201cSo, hey, the more they\u2019re pouring on, the more I\u2019m going to bug the crap out of them by being out there with a voice, with the message \u2014 hopefully running for office in the future too.\u201d\n\nAnd to the Republican Party, she has this message: \u201cThose who at least have the titles of leaders in the GOP, they need more guts. They need to be empowered. They need to have the confidence that the American people understand that the planks in the Republican platform are strong planks upon which our country can grow and prosper and be secure.\u201d\n\nA possible Palin campaign for anything, meanwhile, would be a seismic occurrence in both press and politics. Over three years ago, speculation that Mrs. Palin planned to run for U.S. Senator in Arizona fixated journalists who instantly took to rumors she had already bought an 8,000-square foot stucco home and established her campaign headquarters in Scottsdale. Mrs. Palin and Mitt Romney were at the top of a Gallup presidential poll. And Democrats? They were already fundraising. \u201cHelp us send a strong message that Arizona should not be a stepping stone for extremist politicians and their radical agendas,\u201d the Arizona Democratic Party noted in an email pitch of the moment.\n\nA CLANDESTINE CULTURAL MOMENT\n\n\u201cAs we pass one million followers, we thank you for connecting to learn more about your FBI,\u201d the federal agency advised its Twitter fans on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe public has a telling affection for the intelligence community. Brethren agencies also attract many fans in social media. Among them: The CIA now has 746,000 Twitter followers, the NSA 37,000 followers, the Defense Intelligence Agency 29,100, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \u2014 that\u2019s James Clapper, folks \u2014 has 22,800 and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has 18,400 followers.\n\nPERRYFIED\n\n\u201cIf you ask me to name the number one issue confronting America, I would not say it is our porous border. I would not say it is the weakest recovery since the Great Depression. I wouldn\u2019t even say it\u2019s all the challenges that are adding up overseas. The greatest problem of all is that in the face of these troubles so many serious challenges, we don\u2019t have the leadership to deal with it. We are experiencing a crisis of competence in America, and the people know it,\u201d Texas Gov. Rick Perry told an audience assembled Monday evening at a public affairs event organized by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\n\u201cI believe that come 2016, if the American people are given the choice, they will be ready for a clean break from the Obama agenda and anything like it.\u201d\n\nCARLYIZED\n\n\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t heard, there\u2019s a war on women being waged by Democrats. Their policies \u2014 making everything from finding a job to filling up our cars to visiting our doctors \u2014 more difficult and more expensive,\u201d says American Conservative Union Foundation chairman Carly Fiorina in a video outreach now targeted to voters in Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Virginia.\n\n\u201cHere are the facts. The Obama economy has put millions of women out of the work force altogether; 227,000 women were added to the unemployment roles in June alone. Obamacare erodes healthcare choices, hiking premiums and canceling plans that women had and liked across the country. Those premium hikes are hitting women ages 55 -64 the hardest. No, women are not being denied access to birth control. But yes, women are losing access to their healthcare. Under Obamacare many of us have had to find new doctors and new hospitals for treatment,\u201d she concludes.\n\nMs. Fiorina, meanwhile, has launched the Unlocking Potential Project, her own initiative to counter endless claims that the Republicans are not female-friendly, and to set forth a few facts.

Now on book shelves, it\u2019s \u201cThe Reagan Enigma\u201d by Thomas C. Reed, an insider\u2019s insider who says that the 40th president was a political grand master \u201ca dozen moves ahead of every opponent.\u201d\n\nMr. Reed is a former Secretary of the Air Force who also managed Reagan\u2019s gubernatorial campaigns, his 1968 presidential nomination drive and served as a White House special assistant for national security policy.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for me to open my archives, to collect the insights of my surviving peers and to weave all of this into and unexpected but accurate explanation of Reagan\u2019s mind,\u201d the author says. The book was published Tuesday by Figueroa Press, a branch of the University of Southern California.\n\nPARSING OPPORTUNITY\n\n\u201cPopular conversation about opportunity often takes too narrow a view, failing to see the full range of contributors. Freedom from artificial impediments like burdensome regulations or the current economic climate are part, but not all, of what opens the way of opportunity. Factors like family and the formation of values also play a significant role,\u201d declares the Heritage Foundation, which has created something called the 2014 Index of Culture and Opportunity to explain how social and economic factors influence Americans\u2019 chance of success.\n\nThe organization is gathering some significant thinkers from within its ranks as well as from the Buckeye, Manhattan and Charlotte Lozier Institutes for some big talk on the big idea.
