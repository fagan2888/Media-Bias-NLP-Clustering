Educators\u2019 work hours have also been cut due to the mandate, including part-time instructors and adjunct professors.\n\nA long and growing list of 450 companies, school districts, colleges and institutions that have slashed and capped work hours to comply with the employer mandate \u2013 which goes into effect next year \u2013 has been compiled by Jed Graham of Investor\u2019s Business Daily, whose tally chronicles employers both public and private.\n\n\u201cCritics say the Affordable Care Act gives businesses an incentive to cut workers\u2019 hours below the 30-hour-per-week threshold at which the employer mandate to provide health insurance kicks in,\u201d Graham notes. \u201cWhite House economists dismiss such evidence as anecdotal. \u2026 In the interest of an informed debate, we\u2019ve compiled a list of job actions with strong proof that Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate is behind cuts to work hours or staffing levels.\u201d\n\nThe list, which Graham started in August 2013, is nowhere near being comprehensive, as many employers have not been clear about how they\u2019re adhering to the mandate, he said in an email to The College Fix.\n\n\u201cI do not think this list is close to being comprehensive,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWhile colleges and universities are far more transparent about workforce policies than the private sector, even many public sector employers have been less than crystal clear about how they are responding to the employer mandate.\u201d\n\nObamacare has essentially created a greater financial burden for students, according to Graham.\n\n\u201cCollege and graduate school already leave students with a large financial burden and anything that restricts the ability to earn money risks adding to that burden,\u201d Graham said.\n\nWith permission from Graham, The College Fix extracted the colleges and universities cited on the list to create a unique tally that shows the impact of Obamacare on campuses nationwide.\n\nAmong the dozens of universities and colleges that have cut hours are North Carolina State University, Kansas University, Penn State University, Clemson University, Arizona State University, University of Alabama, Indiana University, University of Arizona, Ohio State University, and Virginia Tech. As of Oct. 27, there are 122 on the list, and The College Fix will add to it as more campuses slash and cap hours as a result of the federal law.\n\nStudents, scholars pan law\n\nSamantha Watkins, a student at Point Loma University and a regular contributor to The College Fix, recently wrote about her experiences as a student employed by her university.\n\n\u201cHour caps for students working on campus make it a challenge for those who financially need it,\u201d she said in an email to The College Fix. \u201cAnd off campus jobs mean a commute, if students are able to find ample transportation.\u201d\n\nAmong others critical of the Obamacare employer mandate are professors and medical doctors.\n\n\u201cReduced hours will do net harm to students,\u201d D. Eric Schansberg, a professor of economics at Indiana University Southeast who recently co-wrote an op-ed critical of the effects Obamacare would have on students, told The College Fix in an email. \u201cIf they preferred fewer hours, the market\u2013 between employers and employees\u2013 would have reached that outcome. Some students will find other jobs; others will have tighter budgets; and so on.\u201d\n\nProfessor Schansberg also gave an example comparing the effects of the government mandate to increasing workers\u2019 wages, having both positive and negative outcomes, depending on the worker\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s actions are always contingent,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, the simplest model (a labor demand curve) would say that a higher minimum wage will help those who keep their jobs and harm those who lose their jobs. On the one hand, you\u2019re increasing wages for those who have jobs\u2013 but you\u2019re also making them more expensive to hire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ACA is similar,\u201d Schansberg argued. \u201cYou can mandate X\u2013 or connect X to a tax/penalty\u2013 under certain circumstances. But then you make those circumstances less likely.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmployers will look to avoid those conditions when possible. And when employers are particularly flexible\u2013 as in this case\u2013 one would expect them to often avoid those conditions,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham also explained the problems with the employee mandate, which he says have caused a plunge in workweek hours for low-wage industries, shrinking to an average of 27.3 hours.\n\n\u201cThere had been \u2013 and still is \u2013 a lot of denial from supposed experts that the employer mandate was having an impact. This effort, I think, helps to show that the anecdotal evidence is pretty weighty,\u201d Graham explained, referencing his list of businesses that have cut hours. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t relied only on anecdotes. I have used government data to show that the work week among low-wage private sector industries has shrunk to a record low and the share of workers clocking just above 30 hours per week has plunged relative to those with hours just below Obamacare\u2019s 30-hour full-time threshold.\u201d\n\nDr. Rob Steele, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School who is running for University Regent also had critical words of the employee mandate and subsequent cut hours.\n\n\u201cThe government view of the solution for students needing insurance is to go on their parents plan if you are under 26,\u201d he said in an email to The College Fix. \u201cUsually the students are more worried about a decrease in pay rather than the insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reduction in hours will increase because the costs of insurance will continue to rise.\u201d\n\nCollege Fix reporter Derek Draplin is a student at the University of Michigan.\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGE: Dr. Farouk/Flickr", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Obamacare has created financial burden, onerous regulations for the higher education community.", "title": "OBAMACARE: More than 120 colleges slash and cap student and faculty work hours - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Steth.DrFourouk.Flickr.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-05-28T17:34:46-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/19844/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Steth.DrFourouk.Flickr.jpg", "description": "Obamacare has created financial burden, onerous regulations for the higher education community.", "card": "summary", "title": "OBAMACARE: More than 120 colleges slash and cap student and faculty work hours - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "ObamaCare", "published_time": "2014-10-28T02:34:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T17:34:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Among the dozens of universities and colleges that have cut hours are North Carolina State University, Kansas University, Penn State University, Clemson University, Arizona State University, University of Alabama, Indiana University, University of Arizona, Ohio State University, and Virginia Tech.\nSince the launch of Obamacare, at least 122 colleges and universities across the nation have cut student and faculty work hours to skirt the federal law\u2019s mandate requiring employers to provide healthcare for people who work 30 hours or more per week.\nEducators\u2019 work hours have also been cut due to the mandate, including part-time instructors and adjunct professors.\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on TwitterIMAGE: Dr. Farouk/Flickr\nAs of Oct. 27, there are 122 on the list, and The College Fix will add to it as more campuses slash and cap hours as a result of the federal law."}
