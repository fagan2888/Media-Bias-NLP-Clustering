So he embarked upon an eight-year odyssey in search of international students. Lindberg visited a host of countries, concentrating primarily upon far eastern nations such as China, South Korea, and the Philippines and, he admits, developed serious cases of jet lag and homesickness.\n\nToday the school enrolls 128 international students out of a total of 270, with the balance coming from the Lee area through a contract the school has with SAD 30. Its international student program revenues probably make Lee Academy the only high school in northern Maine that doesn\u2019t automatically institute no-growth budgeting, Lindberg says.\n\nSo: If you are new headmaster Gus LeBlanc, how do you top all that?\n\nThe 61-year-old Auburn transplant isn\u2019t sure he has to, but he has some ideas.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest challenge,\u201d LeBlanc said during an interview Thursday, \u201cis that Lee has gone from a small school in a small rural town to a school that has regional and international connections. I would say that probably the school\u2019s operational budget has quadrupled in the last eight years because of our growth and connections.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s staff, buildings, students and educational programs have increased under Lindberg, who retired as headmaster in May but is staying on as the academy\u2019s director of international programs.\n\nLeBlanc said he must expand and stabilize the beachhead won by the Lindberg administration\u2019s academy-saving work. That includes maintaining the international program\u2019s vibrancy, updating the school\u2019s managerial structure to reflect the growth, and improving the F grade Lee Academy received from a controversial grading system the Maine Department of Education\u2019s instituted in May at Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s insistence.\n\nLeBlanc and Lindberg said the grading system is seriously flawed. In the academy\u2019s case, it measures only the efforts of the Lee-area students the school contracts with SAD 30 to serve \u2014 excluding international students who are 47 percent of the school\u2019s population. The students are not considered part of a public school system, Lindberg said.\n\nThe grading system also ignored socioeconomic factors, such as the Springfield-Lee area\u2019s poverty \u2014 a common complaint against it.\n\n\u201cThe other side of that coin, to completely dismiss the report card, is a mistake,\u201d LeBlanc said. \u201cIf the message is that Lee Academy could improve, I would agree, but to categorize it as a failing school, I am not sure that I would agree.\u201d\n\nLeBlanc plans to review all aspects of the school\u2019s academic programs, including the programs\u2019 level of student expectations, student attendance, and disciplinary standards, he said.\n\nHis essential question, he said, will be: How can educators best increase student aspirations and faculty expectations? What programmatic changes should occur?\n\n\u201cThere is recognition that the international program is supportive of Lee Academy,\u201d LeBlanc said, \u201cthat is tempered by the recognition that we want to remain a town academy, with a strong commitment to Maine kids and strongly connected to Maine academies.\u201d\n\nLindberg said he is pleased with his accomplishments and his successor.\n\n\u201cI think Gus is going to do a tremendous job. We have made great strides over the last few years,\u201d Lindberg said Thursday during an interview conducted via Skype. \u201cWe have been able to improve our academic program. Some huge changes have occurred with our physical facilities. We have increased our revenue streams enormously to the benefit of all of our students.\u201d\n\nLeBlanc doesn\u2019t promise any instant changes.\n\n\u201cYou can walk into a new school and think that a lot needs to be done,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you have to first see what is there and why.\u201d\n\nAs the principal of Lewiston High School, LeBlanc got to see some of Lee Academy up close as part of the three-member Maine Principals\u2019 Association hearing panel that recommended placing the school on two years\u2019 probation last December for allegedly using tuition assistance to entice students to play basketball.\n\n\u201cIn a school like this there are a lot of moving parts,\u201d LeBlanc said. \u201cA lot of times we will get international students who will come to this school and we don\u2019t know until that kid gets here [that he or she] wants to be an athlete.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s athletic program wasn\u2019t aware of precisely who received tuition assistance, LeBlanc said, and Lindberg, who solely decided assistance questions, said at the time that school officials disagreed with the MPA ruling but would accept it.\n\nToday, the headmaster, school finance officer and its admissions director direct tuition assistance. School officials rewrote assistance guidelines to better define the criteria, LeBlanc said.\n\nOne of the academy\u2019s biggest administrative changes is already in effect: The board of trustees prevailed upon Lindberg to continue to oversee recruiting and all aspects of the Lee Academies in the Philippines and in Daegu, South Korea \u2014 two significant sources of international students and revenue.\n\nThis, in effect, puts a headmaster in two places at the same time.\n\n\u201cMe being located in Asia right now makes it much easier to have conversations with people looking to partner with Lee Academy in this part of the world,\u201d Lindberg said.\n\nBut even with Lindberg in the Far East, LeBlanc plans to compile some frequent-flier miles of his own by visiting the satellite schools at least four times a year.\n\n\u201cI will still need to do some of that traveling,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LEE, Maine \u2014 When Bruce Lindberg became Lee Academy\u2019s headmaster in 2005, the school\u2019s board of trustees gave him a grim task, he says.Find new revenue sources, board members said, or you will be our last headmaster.The semi-public high school\u2019s dwindling population and revenues made its closure inevitable, Lindberg said.
