It hurts to know that it closed and no one else will receive all the blessings I got from there.\u201d\n\nMore than blessings, Genesis House provided one of the greatest weapons in the battle against serious drug and alcohol addiction: motivation.\n\nThe particular brand of motivation offered at the 41-year-old Madrona treatment center was among the rarest in the world of chemical-dependency recovery: The facility was one of only a handful in the state that allowed recovering addicts enrolled in inpatient treatment\u2014whether under court order or their own volition\u2014to stay with their children. Even rarer, Genesis House offered intensive six-month treatment services to men and women with children\u2014predominantly low-income clients\u2014offering care for kids up to age 12. In other words, Genesis House was a place where addicts could kick their habit without breaking up their family. It also allowed parents whose kids had been removed from their care by the state a chance to reunite with them under the agency\u2019s supervision.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge motivator,\u201d says Laurel Reiter, who worked a total of 12 years at Genesis House, most recently as a clinical supervisor. \u201cOf the people we got into treatment, the majority were parents. A lot of them came in because their kids had been taken and they knew they could be reunited with them [at Genesis House].\u201d\n\n\n\nThe ruins of what was the Genesis House. Photo by Morgen Schuler\n\nDaniel Masler, a doctor of clinical psychology contracted to conduct trauma and parenting groups at Genesis House, echoes the sentiment. \u201cWhen we can safely reunite families, with consistent treatment, people start feeling hopeful,\u201d Masler tells Seattle Weekly. \u201cThere\u2019s something to start living for. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times a resident would say, \u2018Yes, this is tough, but I\u2019m going to push through for my kids. I\u2019ll do this just to start being with my kids.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the past year, that type of service has become harder to access. The demise of Genesis House followed the closure of Perinatal Treatment Services last October, leaving just one facility in the Puget Sound region that offers similar services. Seadrunar, a drug and narcotic treatment center near White Center, has the capacity to serve 150 adults, but only 25 children, up to 12 years old.\n\nWithout these places, says former Genesis House family-services director Ian Bell, the destructive cycle of addiction strikes families hard. \u201cI just heard from an old colleague that someone we know from the recovery community relapsed,\u201d Bell tells Seattle Weekly. \u201cShe has lost her 1-year-old to the state, and it looks like she will have to wait months to find a bed in an inpatient facility.... The state will either wait to give her the child back until after treatment or at the end of her program, which means the soonest the child will be in the care of her mother will be eight to 10 months.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s to blame for the closure of Genesis House and the financial struggles of programs like it?\n\nOne popular alleged culprit is the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) and the expansion of Medicaid that the law has made possible in Washington. But while the ACA-related uptick in Medicaid\u2014which will see 400,000 additional enrollees by 2015\u2014has put stress on many of the state\u2019s outpatient facilities, Genesis House was not affected directly by this change. The facility never received Medicaid money, due to a longstanding, and much-derided, federal law that prohibits any Medicaid money from flowing to facilities with more than 16 beds. Therefore Genesis House was largely dependent on contracts from the Washington Department of Social and Health Services and state general-fund dollars, leaving it vulnerable to economic shifts, like the one that hit six years ago.\n\nThe grip of the Great Recession is still being felt in Washington. Jane Beyer, who leads DSHS's Behavioral Health and Service Integration Administration, says that since 2009, money for chemical-dependency treatment coming out of Olympia has flatlined. The last time the state studied the rates it pays chemical-dependency treatment providers was early 2000, and as Beyer puts it, \u201cWe haven\u2019t really made significant changes since then.\u201d Throw in inflation over the past five years\u2014the cost of running a treatment facility has only gone up\u2014and you\u2019ve got a recipe for financial peril.\n\nThe decision to close the doors at Genesis House, in other words, was made by cold, hard economics.\n\n\n\nGenesis House was largely dependent on DSHS contracts and state general-fund dollars, leaving it vulnerable to economic shifts.\n\nPhoto by Morgen Schuler\n\n\u201cWhen recessions roll around and cuts have to be made to the budget, it\u2019s often the 100-percent-state-funded kind of things that end up coming up for consideration, largely because by cutting those dollars you don\u2019t lose federal matching dollars,\u201d says Byers. \u201cThe chemical-dependency system took some cuts. I remember sitting in those rooms and having horrible discussions.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s some hope that future state budgets will include more funding for drug treatment\u2014and a statewide switch in 2016 that will bring chemical-dependency and mental-health treatment together under a managed-care plan provides further cause for optimism\u2014no one seems to be holding their breath. Meanwhile, what the future of Washington\u2019s chemical-dependency treatment landscape will look like remains anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nmdriscoll@seattleweekly.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "I just want to say this program saved my life.\u201d This is", "og": {"site_name": "Seattle Weekly", "description": "I just want to say this program saved my life.\u201d This is one of the many messages posted on the \u201cFriends of Genesis House\u201d Facebook", "title": "Following Rehab Center Closures, an Uncertain Future for Addicts With Kids", "url": "http://", "image": "http://archive.seattleweekly.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=XQaHlOqQN0ebB68oYJzuNs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsGlnx7rjvET4A41UGrfrzwWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "GENESIS, TREATMENT, STATE, KIDS, CHEMICAL, DEPENDENCY, CARE, FACILITY, CENTER, SERVICES,", "fb": {"app_id": 500578586675733}, "msvalidate.01": "3443F17DFB93961891E95B1452B50579", "google-site-verification": "HB1ruhwjr9G2iMWnFITxFS9YXCHqRDvxfYM7NFy7KA0"}, "article_summary": "Seadrunar, a drug and narcotic treatment center near White Center, has the capacity to serve 150 adults, but only 25 children, up to 12 years old.\nIn other words, Genesis House was a place where addicts could kick their habit without breaking up their family.\nMeanwhile, what the future of Washington\u2019s chemical-dependency treatment landscape will look like remains anyone\u2019s guess.\n\u201cWithout Genesis House and all the staff and people there I don\u2019t know where I would be.\nWithout these places, says former Genesis House family-services director Ian Bell, the destructive cycle of addiction strikes families hard."}
