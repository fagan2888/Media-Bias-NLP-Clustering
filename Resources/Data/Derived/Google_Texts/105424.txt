A na­tion­al-ser­vice pro­gram seeded by Pres­id­ent George H.W. Bush, launched by Pres­id­ent Bill Clin­ton, and ex­pan­ded by Pres­id­ent George W. Bush faces drastic cuts un­der Pres­id­ent Obama, pos­ing a new threat to his leg­acy.

Re­pub­lic­ans in Con­gress are tak­ing an ax to the budgets of the Ameri­Corps fam­ily of pro­grams, and Obama seems un­able or un­will­ing to pro­tect them. More broadly, the cul­prit is a cul­ture in Wash­ing­ton that ab­hors com­prom­ise””a Re­pub­lic­an Party that won’t raise taxes and a Demo­crat­ic Party that won’t tame en­ti­tle­ment spend­ing to jointly lower na­tion­al debt while pro­tect­ing vi­tal pub­lic pro­jects.

In short: The prob­lem is short-sighted, cow­ardly lead­er­ship.

Caught in the middle is a bi­par­tis­an suc­cess called the Cor­por­a­tion for Na­tion­al and Com­munity Ser­vice, which over­sees Ameri­Corps and scores of oth­er pro­grams that pay na­tion­al-ser­vice work­ers small sti­pends. Those pro­grams in­clude Teach for Amer­ica, Hab­it­at for Hu­man­ity, City Year, and Vista. (Dis­clos­ure: My eld­er daugh­ter was a mem­ber of the City Year corps in De­troit, and I re­ceived an award from the ser­vice com­munity in 2014 for writ­ing about this top­ic.)

Each pro­gram com­petes for fed­er­al money, meas­ures and re­ports res­ults, and raises private-sec­tor con­tri­bu­tions to match gov­ern­ment grants. In ad­di­tion to re­ceiv­ing sti­pends that help pay tu­ition and make ends meet, the mostly young work­force learns the value of serving oth­ers for a great­er good.

It’s a bar­gain for tax­pay­ers: For every fed­er­al dol­lar in­ves­ted, na­tion­al-ser­vice mem­bers de­liv­er as much as $3 in ser­vices. In the bru­tal new eco­nomy, non­profit or­gan­iz­a­tions are strug­gling to meet people’s needs, and the Cor­por­a­tion for Na­tion­al and Com­munity Ser­vice fills the gaps, win­ning praise from Re­pub­lic­an law­makers, in­clud­ing those now poised to gut the pro­gram. GOP na­tion­al se­cur­ity ex­perts and re­tired mil­it­ary lead­ers con­sider the fed­er­al spend­ing a small in­vest­ment in fur­ther­ing a na­tion­al eth­os of ser­vice.

Among the pro­gram’s suc­cesses: im­prov­ing aca­dem­ic per­form­ances in the na­tion’s poorest schools and help­ing vet­er­ans with the trans­ition from war to peace­time.

And yet, a GOP-led House Ap­pro­pri­ations sub­com­mit­tee is pro­pos­ing to slash the ser­vice cor­por­a­tion’s budget by one-third, from $1.05 bil­lion to $687.8 mil­lion. That is 42 per­cent less than Obama re­ques­ted, and would force the elim­in­a­tion of more than 40,000 of Ameri­Corps’ 75,000 po­s­i­tions.

That’s dra­coni­an. Dur­ing his first pres­id­en­tial race, Obama pledged to “ex­pand and fund Ameri­Corps” from 75,000 to 250,000 po­s­i­tions, put­ting ser­vice-minded mil­len­ni­als to work on the na­tion’s toughest prob­lems. Un­der Bush, the pro­gram had grown from 50,000 slots.

After just three months in of­fice, Obama signed the Ed­ward M. Kennedy Serve Amer­ica Act au­thor­iz­ing the ex­pan­sion of the pro­gram to the goal of 250,000. He had kept his prom­ise, Obama bragged, and he de­clared 2009 the dawn of a “new era of ser­vice.”

But the dawn nev­er broke. Con­gress nev­er fun­ded the quarter-mil­lion hires, not even when Demo­crats con­trolled both cham­bers from 2009 to 2010. En­roll­ment nev­er crept above 80,000.

Of all his broken prom­ises, this might hit closest to home for Obama, a former com­munity or­gan­izer with a spe­cial af­fin­ity for Ameri­Corps. As I’ve writ­ten be­fore, it also re­flects a fa­mil­i­ar pat­tern of his pres­id­ency: Raise hopes for big change, watch dogged rivals crush those hopes, and hear Demo­crats gripe about his strategy or re­solve.

When I asked An­nMaura Con­nolly on Thursday morn­ing what the White House was do­ing to counter the GOP cuts, the pres­id­ent of Voices for Na­tion­al Ser­vice said with more than a hint of frus­tra­tion: “That would be a good ques­tion to ask them. I have been email­ing the White House with aban­don today with no luck so far.”

I also emailed a White House spokes­man. No reply yet.

Easi­er to reach was the sub­com­mit­tee chair­man, Rep. Tom Cole, an Ok­lahoma Re­pub­lic­an. (Dis­clos­ure: my young­est daugh­ter in­terned for Cole last sum­mer.) He called the pro­posed cuts a mat­ter of “pri­or­it­ies, not an­ti­pathy.”

In the same bill, the GOP-con­trolled pan­el is pro­pos­ing budget in­creases for the Na­tion­al In­sti­tutes of Health, the Cen­ters for Dis­ease Con­trol, and edu­ca­tion ser­vices for spe­cial-needs chil­dren. In many cases, Cole said, those pro­grams””long fa­vor­ites of the Demo­crat­ic Party””would get more money than Obama put in his own budget.

Cole’s coun­ter­parts in the Sen­ate are also ex­pec­ted to slash Ameri­Corps budgets, though not quite as much. Ne­go­ti­ations with the White House will likely lead to changes in the bills, Cole said, but he held out little hope for Ameri­Corps sup­port­ers. “If I had more money,” he said, “I’d put it in­to early child­hood edu­ca­tion,” an­oth­er pro­gress­ive cause.

Some con­ser­vat­ives have been crit­ic­al of Ameri­Corps, as­so­ci­at­ing it with Clin­ton and ques­tion­ing the mer­its of even a mod­est sti­pend. Cole said those per­cep­tions are “a factor, not a big factor” in the pro­posed cuts.

He said law­makers are ham­strung by a tight budget, and blamed Obama for passing up a chance to strike a “grand bar­gain” on the budget after his reelec­tion, when Re­pub­lic­ans were bow­ing to de­mands to raise taxes on the wealthy. That may be, but the White House has good reas­on to point the fin­ger back at Re­pub­lic­ans, who seem un­will­ing to com­prom­ise on taxes bey­ond let­ting Bush-era tax cuts ex­pire.

Truth is, they’re both at fault. Due to a vari­ety of polit­ic­al and so­cial trends, there is little in­cent­ive for the two ma­jor parties to co­oper­ate, little room to lead. Un­til the GOP raises rev­en­ue and Demo­crats trim spend­ing, parts of the budget not “en­titled” to pro­grams like Medi­care and So­cial Se­cur­ity will con­tin­ue shrink­ing””squeez­ing out suc­cess­ful “dis­cre­tion­ary” pro­grams dear to both lib­er­als and con­ser­vat­ives.

Pro­grams like the Bush-Clin­ton-Bush na­tion­al-ser­vice mis­sion, all rooted in the first Bush’s “Points of Light” ini­ti­at­ive.

You don’t have to tell that to John Bridge­land, a found­ing mem­ber of the ser­vice co­ali­tion who ran the young­er Bush’s do­mest­ic policy team and na­tion­al-ser­vice ini­ti­at­ive.

“Con­gress hasn’t lived up to its part of the bar­gain in re­cog­niz­ing the power of na­tion­al ser­vice to heal our broken cit­izen­ship,” said Bridge­land, a Re­pub­lic­an.

He ticked off the hor­rors: “So­cial trust in one an­oth­er is half of what it was a gen­er­a­tion ago, in­clud­ing among mil­len­ni­als. Our com­munit­ies, places like Fer­guson and Bal­timore, are fray­ing. Many won­der wheth­er we are liv­ing in two na­tions, one for chil­dren from well-off fam­il­ies and oth­ers for fam­il­ies that are not well-off. And we have a Con­gress that can’t work to­geth­er to get things done for the coun­try.”

“Na­tion­al ser­vice is an an­ti­dote for that,” he ad­ded. “It brings people to­geth­er from dif­fer­ent polit­ic­al af­fil­i­ations, races, eth­ni­cit­ies, in­come levels, and geo­graph­ies to work on com­mon prob­lems to­geth­er.”

And yet, this sick Con­gress may kill a cure.
