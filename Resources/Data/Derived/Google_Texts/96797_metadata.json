But back home, Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear has embraced the law and seen its implementation go so well that Kentucky has become the poster child for Obamacare\u2019s promise.\n\nIt\u2019s the only southern state that decided to both expand Medicaid and set up its own health insurance \u201cexchange,\u201d and unlike the federal Obamacare website, HealthCare.gov, Kentucky\u2019s online market has worked consistently \u2014 something Mr. Beshear said was the result of extensive testing and a clean website design that forsook bells and whistles in favor of convenience.\n\nSEE ALSO: Beshear a lonely Southern fan of Obamacare\n\n\u201cEvery time the topic of reform comes up, both pundits and the president of the United States himself say, \u2018Look at what Kentucky\u2019s doing,\u2019\u201d the governor told the Families USA Health Action 2014 conference in Washington.\n\nBut consensus on the topic is hard to come by in the Bluegrass State.\n\nFor Mr. Beshear, the law\u2019s implementation has been a point of pride. On the other hand, it\u2019s kindling for Mr. McConnell\u2019s fiery campaign rhetoric as he tries to protect his seat from GOP primary challenger Matt Bevin and then Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic front-runner.\n\nSEE ALSO: HENDERSHOTT: White House didn\u2019t stop \u2018flagging\u2019 Obamacare \u2018misinformation\u2019\n\nAs minority leader, Mr. McConnell frequently uses his time on the Senate floor to rail against the law and Mr. Obama\u2019s flawed promise that if Americans liked their health plans, they could keep them.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, the junior senator and fellow Republican, has criticized Kentucky\u2019s health exchange, \u201ckynect,\u201d for adding more people to the government-funded Medicaid rolls than to private insurance.\n\nBut to Mr. Beshear, Kentucky is a progressive state with a \u201cred-state persona.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who don\u2019t know Kentucky might consider the commonwealth an odd choice to be leading the nation in implementing federal health care reform,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, my state has historically suffered from a national stereotype of being, ya\u2019 know, just another one of those southern states that are a little bit behind the times.\u201d\n\nOne out of six Kentucky residents lacked health insurance before the law, but some 175,000 people have signed up for Medicaid or a private insurance since Oct. 1, according to the governor.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t some group of aliens from a distant planet,\u201d Mr. Beshear said. \u201cThese are our friends and our neighbors.\u201d\n\nHe said his embrace of the law was the \u201cmorally right thing to do\u201d and offered a holistic solution for Kentuckians, who ranked all-too-high in many health-risk categories.\n\nA new McConnell campaign ad argues that health is one of the senator\u2019s priorities, although the TV spot has been criticized by the Grimes campaign as a stale retread from the senator\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\nIn the ad, a throat cancer survivor from Paducah, Ky., who was exposed to radiation on the job said Mr. McConnell\u2019s \u201cstrong voice\u201d led to compensation and cancer-screening programs for sick workers.\n\nA Grimes campaign spokeswoman said Mr. McConnell\u2019s 2008 campaign used a rather similar ad and that it is \u201cinsulting to Kentuckians for McConnell to haul out this old, dishonest play every six years when he\u2019s on the ballot,\u201d according to Politico.\n\nMcConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore hit back last week, saying, \u201cOnly the most partisan, embittered, dogmatically liberal activists would have the audacity to call a Paducah cancer survivor\u2019s story dishonest.\u201d\n\nOn Obamacare, Ms. Grimes must walk the political tightrope that other Democratic candidates face in 2014, after millions of Americans said their health policies were canceled because of the health care law.\n\nHer campaign website talks about preserving Medicare but does not tout the health overhaul that, by many accounts, her state has implemented so well.\n\n\u201cI will continue to make sure the concerns I have about the Affordable Care Act are taken to heart,\u201d she said at a campaign stop this month in Prestonsburg, Ky., according to WKYT, a CBS affiliate. \u201cThat, for instance, when Washington politicians make promises that if you like your doctor and you like your plan you can keep it, that we follow through with that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kentucky has an identity crisis when it comes to Obamacare.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Kentucky has an identity crisis when it comes to Obamacare.", "title": "In Kentucky, opposing views on Obamacare success", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/26/kentucky-a-strange-example-of-obamacare-done-right/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/26/1_262014_kentucky-budget8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/26/1_262014_kentucky-budget8201.jpg", "title": "In Kentucky, opposing views on Obamacare success", "description": "Kentucky has an identity crisis when it comes to Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Mitch Mcconnell, Steve Beshear, Alison Lundergan Grimes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd988\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThese aren\u2019t some group of aliens from a distant planet,\u201d Mr. Beshear said.\nFor Mr. Beshear, the law\u2019s implementation has been a point of pride.\nSteve Beshear has embraced the law and seen its implementation go so well that Kentucky has become the poster child for Obamacare\u2019s promise.\nHer campaign website talks about preserving Medicare but does not tout the health overhaul that, by many accounts, her state has implemented so well.\nBut to Mr. Beshear, Kentucky is a progressive state with a \u201cred-state persona.\u201d\u201cPeople who don\u2019t know Kentucky might consider the commonwealth an odd choice to be leading the nation in implementing federal health care reform,\u201d he said."}
