And that could mean sticker shock over their new monthly premiums.\"\n\nVirtually any change in income can significantly change what kind of premiums and plans are available to current Obamacare enrollees. Americans who thought they were lucky to get a raise this past year are likely to either lose their Obamacare subsidies entirely or see them significantly reduced. Americans who report less income compared to a year ago might not qualify for private health insurance at all and could be forced into Medicaid.\n\nIncome changes are not the only threat facing Obamacare enrollees. The rates for their specific plan may have increased dramatically from last year and reports indicate that the most popular low cost plans also experienced the steepest rate hikes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare rates are going up, but not till after election day..05/27/2016 8:29:27AM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare rates are going up, but not till after election day.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Obama to Hide Obamacare Rates Till After Election Day", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/10/09/obama-to-hide-obamacare-rates-till-after-election-day-n1903026", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/281/b5d56fec-3474-4250-9797-0ab9b8cf8b79.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Obamacare rates are going up, but not till after election day.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Obama to Hide Obamacare Rates Till After Election Day", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/10/09/obama-to-hide-obamacare-rates-till-after-election-day-n1903026", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/281/b5d56fec-3474-4250-9797-0ab9b8cf8b79.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama to Hide Obamacare Rates Till After Election Day, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\"Insurers say one big challenge for next year will involve millions of returning customers,\" the AP reports.\nVirtually any change in income can significantly change what kind of premiums and plans are available to current Obamacare enrollees.\nAmericans who report less income compared to a year ago might not qualify for private health insurance at all and could be forced into Medicaid.\nHealthCare.gov, the online portal where millions of Americans must buy health insurance, will not display premiums for 2015 until after the 2014 elections, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.\n\"Existing customers who do nothing will be automatically re-enrolled in their current plan as of Jan. 1,\" the AP continues."}
