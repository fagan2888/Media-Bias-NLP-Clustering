This is footage we’re not seeing on the network TV evening newscasts: evidence of Nazi-like atrocities committed in the name of religion, clips from networks around the globe charting the growing threat, in-depth interviews with Iraqi politicians, American policymakers and military experts pinpointing what missteps allowed al-Qaeda to metastasize into ISIS.

PBS “Frontline” this week explores how ISIS rose to power in a typically thorough report, “The Rise of ISIS,” airing Oct. 28 at 9 p.m. on RMPBS.

While all the networks have devoted some time to the ongoing jihadist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), “Frontline” stands apart in putting the story together with a longer view. Veteran producer Martin Smith, who has documented the conflict in four other films since 2003, continues his exploration.

The point is, an interview subject tells Smith, ISIS has grown into “the al-Qaeda that Osama bin Laden only dreamed of building.”

This is a terrorist group, the hour notes, that has no interest in being a political party as we define it. They simply want to kill everyone who disagrees with them, according to counterterrorism expert Ali Soufan.

With Colorado in the jihad-related headlines as three teen girls from Arapahoe County apparently went to Syria intending to join the Islamic State, this report has local reverberations.
