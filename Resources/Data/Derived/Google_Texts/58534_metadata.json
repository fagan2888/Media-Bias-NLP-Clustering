But she reluctantly let him go to a friend\u2019s house in Montbello on Friday night, and saw her worst fears realized.\n\n\u201cMy son was killed because he was hanging out at a party like other kids do,\u201d Abram said Tuesday as she and scores of other family and friends of her son, Reysean, gathered to mourn his death on what would have been his 14th birthday.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t an angel. He experimented in a lot of things. But I don\u2019t think it should have cost him his life.\u201d\n\nTuesday night, police announced that they had arrested two juveniles and an adult in connection with the Friday night shooting, which happened as Reysean rode his bike in the 4700 block of North Enid Way,.\n\nThe adult was identified as 20-year-old Marquise Lewis.\n\nDenver police have said little about what led up to the shooting, but witnesses said that at least one shooter opened fire from a passing vehicle. Officers found Reysean suffering a gunshot wound when they arrived.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let these people get away with this, whoever killed my baby,\u201d she said, adding that she learned about her son\u2019s death from friends on Facebook.\n\n\u201cIf you can get the message out on Facebook, then you can get the message out about who killed my baby.\u201d\n\nPolice offered no new details about their investigation on Tuesday, nor would a spokesman say whether detectives believe the shooting was gang-related. But stories about the night abounded among Reysean\u2019s friends, who said he was not in a gang but did associate with gang members.\n\nPeople who were at the party said rival gangs exchanged words before shots were fired.\n\nHis mother said Reysean \u201cjumped in\u201d but his involvement did not go further than that. She said she had become concerned by what looked like mounting tensions in some of her son\u2019s Facebook postings. Reysean himself appears to be flashing signs in some of his photos.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a gang member. He was from the east side of Denver and that\u2019s all that he represented,\u201d said another cousin, Rahshay Abram, 15.\n\nBut those close to the teenager, who had just finished the first week of his freshman year at Montbello High School, found it hard to believe he would be a target. They wondered if the gunfire was meant for someone else.\n\n\u201cSean never really had enemies like that. \u2026 so that I can grieve, so that I can have closure, I\u2019m going to say it was an accident,\u201d said his cousin Quna\u2019Shanay Jones, 15, who saw him a few hours before the party, which she opted not to attend.\n\n\u201cHe got hit by a bullet that didn\u2019t have his name on it.\u201d\n\nSadie Gurman: 303-954-1661, sgurman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/sgurman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Three suspects held in slaying of Denver teen Reysean Abram", "title": "Three suspects held in slaying of Denver teen Reysean Abram", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/03/three-suspects-held-in-slaying-of-denver-teen-reysean-abram/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130903_074853_Reysean-Abram-2.jpg", "height": 651}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130903_074853_Reysean-Abram-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-03T19:43:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T07:12:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83e4\"", "article_summary": "He was from the east side of Denver and that\u2019s all that he represented,\u201d said another cousin, Rahshay Abram, 15.\nReyniko Abram had been strict about letting her 13-year-old son go to house parties this summer, knowing they sometimes turn violent.\nBut she reluctantly let him go to a friend\u2019s house in Montbello on Friday night, and saw her worst fears realized.\nBut stories about the night abounded among Reysean\u2019s friends, who said he was not in a gang but did associate with gang members.\n\u201cHe got hit by a bullet that didn\u2019t have his name on it.\u201dSadie Gurman: 303-954-1661, sgurman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/sgurman"}
