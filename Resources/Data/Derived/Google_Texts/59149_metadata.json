In Qualls' view, there is no reason for campus police departments not to gain access to military equipment:\n\n\u201cIf we continue on with the 1033 program, as those items become obsolete at the military level and if they become available, why not get \u2019em?\u201d Mr. Qualls said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be prepared than not prepared.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing that the events of Ferguson showed was that once police departments possess military equipment, they are increasingly likely to use it. The improper use of such equipment can further exacerbate tensions with law enforcement, and is potentially disastrous.\n\nAmerica has already seen the disastrous consequences that can occur when a militarized force clashes with students. In 1970 it resulted in the death of four young college students, in what became known as the Kent State massacre.\n\nThis senseless loss of life was recently used as inspiration for a sweatshirt design, in what was probably a publicity stunt by Urban Outfitters. Regardless of your view of the garment, it's a reminder of what is at stake when it comes to police militarization.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "At least 117 colleges have acquired surplus military equipment from the Department of Defense, according to a recent article in The Chronicle of Higher", "title": "Why Is the Pentagon Sending Grenade Launchers to College Campuses?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/09/17/grenade-launchers-college-campuses", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14109652207931.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At least 117 colleges have acquired\nsurplus military equipment from the Department of Defense,\naccording to a recent article in The Chronicle of Higher\nEducation.\nThe surplus military gear was made available under a program\nknown as the 1033 program, which shot to public attention following\nthe recent events in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nCampus police departments ha", "creator": "@PatHannaford", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14109652207931.jpg", "title": "Why Is the Pentagon Sending Grenade Launchers to College Campuses?", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Civil Liberties", "published_time": "2014-09-17T15:59:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/patrick-hannaford"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde627\"", "article_summary": "At least 117 colleges have acquired surplus military equipment from the Department of Defense, according to a recent article in The Chronicle of Higher Education.\nTrousers and office supplies aside, why do campus police departments require military equipment designed to withstand roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan?\nModified grenade launchers were also acquired, by University of Central Florida, and Hinds Community College, whilst at least 60 institutions used the program to obtain M-16 assault rifles.\nAmong those contacted by the Chronicle was Michael Qualls, an associate professor of criminal justice at Fort Valley State University, Georgia.\nThe surplus military gear was made available under a program known as the 1033 program, which shot to public attention following the recent events in Ferguson, Missouri."}
