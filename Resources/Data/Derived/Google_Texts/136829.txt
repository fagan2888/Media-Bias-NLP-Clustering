Lil Jon spoke to students at Oxford University yesterday (May 11).

According to a new report on The Independent, Lil Jon opened up about his thoughts on Kanye West, who spoke at Oxford University's Museum of Natural History back in early March.

“Kanye, I've known the dude for a while,” Lil Jon says. “He's a good dude, stuff just happened to him throughout his life that's changed him a little bit. He's still a good guy deep down. People just misunderstand him, when he talks a certain way. He's just expressing himself, he's intense. I couldn't do the big spectacle thing. I'm on the road every day, I'm intoxicated some times, it'd take time to write a nice speech.”

Touching upon a different topic, Lil Jon responded positively when asked about his take on President Obama’s administration. The Atlanta native even hinted at which candidate he will be rooting for come next year’s presidential elections.

“I think Obama's done a great job,” Lil Jon says. “It takes time to restore an old historic car - you can't just do it overnight. That's how I look at the administration that came before Obama. He put a new engine in it, he put some new rims, got a paint job. He's criticized, and at the end of today it's because he's black. The numbers don't lie - unemployment is down, Obamacare is a great thing. I think Hillary is about it for 2016.”

Later in the conversation, Lil Jon offered a simple reply when asked about what The East Side Boyz are currently up to.

“I have no idea, dawg,” he replied.
