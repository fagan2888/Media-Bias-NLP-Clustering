The media and certainly liberal activists are being dishonest about what it actually does.\n\nFirst people seem to believe that Indiana is the only state to have such a thing. No, 30 states have either RFRA laws or RFRA protections via the courts. See this map from the 1st Amendment Partnership below:\n\nSecond, RFRA does not allow discrimination. What I see circulating around in the media and the liberal activists they quote is speculation like this:\n\nRestaurants will not seat homosexuals if the owners do not like them.\n\nSome medical practitioners will not treat homosexuals.\n\nHomosexuals can be denied a driver\u2019s license!\n\nLandlords can deny housing to homosexuals because they hate them.\n\nThere are already laws that deal with much of this AND the language of RFRA does not say anything of the sort.\n\nThree questions are asked during any lawsuit brought under RFRA.\n\n1. Does the individual have a sincere belief that is being burdened substantially?\n\nIf the answer is no the individual loses, and the case is closed.\n\nIf the answer is yes the case moves forward.\n\n2. Does the government have a compelling interest (health or safety) to interfere?\n\nIf the answer is no the individual wins, case closed.\n\nIf the answer is yes the case moves forward.\n\n3. Is there a reasonable alternative to serve the public interest?\n\nIf the answer is no the individual loses, case closed.\n\nIf yes the individual wins, case closed.\n\nAs the 1st Amendment Partnership puts it RFRA does not guarantee that the religious argument will prevail, but it does guarantee it will at least see its day in court. It places a check on government\u2019s use of power against those of religious faith.\n\nSo RFRA would not protect say child abuse, refusing homosexuals medical treatment or housing, but it could provide relief in these circumstances:\n\nThey owned a wedding chapel and declined to host a gay wedding.\n\nThey owned a bakery and declined the business of baking a cake for a gay wedding.\n\nThey owned a florist and chose not to do the floral arrangements for a gay wedding.\n\nThey had a photography business and chose not to photograph a gay wedding.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen places close as a result of legal sanctions, have to pay settlements and generally lose business as a result.\n\nThis bill does provide protection for people of faith who don\u2019t want to be legally compelled into doing something that is contrary to their faith. Notice the examples above? They are not about denying service to gay people. They are about people not wanting to participate in a gay wedding.\n\nMemories Pizza in Walkerton, IN was the one business that the media could find who did say they would deny catering a gay wedding (who would have a pizza place cater their wedding?) even said they would not deny serving homosexuals in general. I\u2019m not sure why they offered that opinion prior to being placed in that situation. The owner is closing up shop, at least for a time, because of threats that they have received. How tolerant.\n\nYet none of the talk is about that, but these examples of what could happen are hypothetical because it isn\u2019t happening. When Brian Myers and I spoke with Dick and Betty Odgaard, the owners of Gortz Haus in Grimes, IA, who had a complaint filed against them for refusing to rent out their facilities for a gay wedding they said they had no problems serving homosexuals. They decided to get out of the wedding business all together.\n\nRFRA would provide some protection for people like the Odgaards. Which is absolutely reasonable. Opponents of this bill need to actually argue about why folks like the Odgaards are not worthy of protection and why they must be compelled to participate in an activity that would violate their religious conscience instead of trumping up hypothetical situations that no one has provided any evidence of actually happening.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/04/what-indianas-religious-freedom-restoration-act-actually-does/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/State-RFRA-Map-IN.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-04-02T08:08:41+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-25T11:32:47+00:00", "keywords": "1st amendment partnership, dick and betty odgaard, gay weddings, gortz haus, indiana religious freedom restoration act, memories pizza, religious freedom restoration act, cultural issues", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "The media and liberal activists are not being honest about what Indiana (and other) state Religious Freedom Restoration Act actually does - protect freedom.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "The media and liberal activists are not being honest about what Indiana (and other) state Religious Freedom Restoration Act actually does - protect freedom.", "title": "What Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act Actually Does | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/State-RFRA-Map-IN.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-02T23:09:30-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/04/what-indianas-religious-freedom-restoration-act-actually-does/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The media and liberal activists are not being honest about what Indiana (and other) state Religious Freedom Restoration Act actually does - protect freedom.", "title": "What Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act Actually Does | Caffeinated Thoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/State-RFRA-Map-IN.jpg", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2015-04-02T03:08:41-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Cultural Issues", "modified_time": "2015-04-02T23:09:30-05:00", "tag": "Religious Freedom Restoration Act"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6b5\"", "article_summary": "There are already laws that deal with much of this AND the language of RFRA does not say anything of the sort.\nSee this map from the 1st Amendment Partnership below:Second, RFRA does not allow discrimination.\nThe feigned uproar over Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is amazing to me.\nAs the 1st Amendment Partnership puts it RFRA does not guarantee that the religious argument will prevail, but it does guarantee it will at least see its day in court.\nThey owned a florist and chose not to do the floral arrangements for a gay wedding."}
