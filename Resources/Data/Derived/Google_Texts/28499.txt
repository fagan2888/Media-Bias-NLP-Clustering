FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) - Dozens of girls from middle schools and high schools are spending time in Fort Dodge this week to learn about science, technology and industrial jobs.

Organizers of the annual “Diva Tech” at Iowa Central Community College say the event exposes young women to careers they may not have considered, the Fort Dodge Messenger reported (http://bit.ly/1lJRTyJ ). Topics covered include electrical systems, computer networking and engineering.

“That’s why camp got started,” said Industrial Tech Associate Phyllis Minnihan. “To expose them to non-traditional career fields. Employers like to hire females. And these are well-paying, good careers.”

Some of the hands-on activities included the use of a simulated paint sprayer, the design of metal nameplates and the construction of coat hangers in the carpentry department.

Minnihan, who helps with teaching at the event, said there’s a need for more women in science and industry.

“Almost all of my classes have at least one female,” she said. “Even in science fields, women are a minority.”

High school students participated in the event Monday through Wednesday, and middle school students were to learn Wednesday through Friday. Diva Tech is now in its eighth year.

Bethany Granger, a sixth-grader from Fort Dodge, said she liked the event.

“I wanted something to do this summer,” she said, “and to show my grandpa that I can do the same things he can.”
