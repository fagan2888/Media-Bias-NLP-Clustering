Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Democrat.\n\n\u201cThis is not a typical election,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican candidate. \u201cI think the stakes have never been higher.\u201d\n\nSure, no candidate is going to say this election is no big deal. But more important or direr than 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression? Or 1940, on the verge of World War II? Or 1980 or 2008?\n\nIn fact, the stakes for the two U.S. political parties could be that great. Consider the likely ramifications of a 2016 defeat for Democrats and Republicans.\n\nIf the Democrats lost the presidency, it\u2019s a near certainty that the party wouldn\u2019t regain control of the Senate or the House, where Republicans already enjoy comfortable margins. Republicans could control in excess of half the governorships and state legislatures in 2017.\n\nAnd Republican appointees are a majority on the Supreme Court, which, after some liberal-leaning decisions on the Affordable Care Act and gay marriage, will likely tilt conservative again.\n\nSuch a scenario would make Republicans even more powerful than when they held all the levers of power from 2003 until 2007: Then, they didn\u2019t control as much on the state level, and in Congress there still were moderate to liberal party lawmakers, such as Arlen Specter and Lincoln Chafee, who often voted with Democrats. (Both subsequently became Democrats.)\n\nThe Democrats, who consider themselves the governing party, would be in their weakest position since the 1920s.\n\nMoreover, they would be strikingly short of younger fresh faces \u2014 who is the Democrats\u2019 equivalent of the 45-year-old Paul Ryan? In the Senate, Harry Reid, 75, has anointed Chuck Schumer, who will be 65, to replace him as Democratic leader. In the House, Nancy Pelosi, for more than a decade a powerhouse leader, is 75; the No. 2 Democrat, Steny Hoyer, is 76.\n\nThe party would struggle to find a way to highlight younger up-and-comers: senators such as Michael Bennet of Colorado (50), New York\u2019s Kirsten Gillibrand (48), the likely next Maryland senator, whether Chris Van Hollen (56) or Donna Edwards (57). For the House, there is Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts (35); or promising candidates such as 44-year-old Lon Johnson, former state party chairman, running in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula.\n\nThe consequences of a loss would be even more cataclysmic for the Republicans, threatening a party split. It would be the sixth of the past seven elections in which Republicans have lost the popular vote. That has never happened before.\n\nThere are bitter schisms within the party. Ryan is likely to replace John Boehner this week as House speaker, but there\u2019s already betting on how long his honeymoon with rival factions within the party will last. That, along with a divisive presidential contest, foreshadows a blood bath if the party loses next year.\n\nIf an establishment Republican \u2014 Jeb Bush, John Kasich or Marco Rubio \u2014 were to win the nomination and lose the election, the right wing would explode. It\u2019s an article of faith among the movement right that the establishment needs to be decimated before the party can rebuild. A defeat with an establishment candidate would ignite those passions.\n\nIf one of the outsider candidates \u2014 Donald Trump, Ben Carson or Cruz \u2014 led the ticket and was routed by a Democrat, the establishment would contemplate ways to diminish the role of those they consider the \u201cnuts\u201d in the party.\n\nUnlike with the Democrats, the Republicans do have some younger figures angling for leadership: Ryan, Cruz or Rubio. But none transcends these fissures.\n\nAnd in the unlikely event Trump were to win? Republicans and Democrats both might have nervous breakdowns.\n\nAlbert R.
