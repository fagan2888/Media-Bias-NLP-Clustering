Stephen Colbert has a good feeling about the GOP’s plan to defund Obamacare. Last night on The Colbert Report, the host echoed the words of Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) when he said it’s time to take a “victory lap” because “Obamacare is dead!” Cue the balloon drop and Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines.”

Colbert then performed his best Miley Cyrus impression, twerking up against Death himself while waving around a big, red foam finger.





When the spectacle was complete, Colbert sat back down and finished his sentence, “…maybe.”

He informed his audience that there may still be a “few wrinkles to iron out before this brave act of extortion takes effect.” With the October 1st implementation date fast approaching, Colbert warned, “Obamacare is coming folks, run for your lives. No wait! Don’t run for your lives, that will make you healthier, and that’s just what he [Obama] wants!”

But “the most dangerous thing about Obamacare,” Colbert declared, “is that people might like it.”
