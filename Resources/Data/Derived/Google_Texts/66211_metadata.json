More than 80 per cent of respondents indicated that they plan to vote in next year\u2019s presidential election, higher than the 75 percent among the non-gaming public. In 2012, the figures were 79 per cent of gamers and 69 per cent of non-gamers.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe survey also reveals that gamers\u2019 political orientations are highly diffuse, with 48 per cent of respondents identifying as conservative, 38 per cent as liberal, and 14 per cent as \u201cother.\u201d Party affiliation is also fairly evenly split, with 38 per cent of respondents reporting they are Republican/Tea Party voters, 38 per cent Democrats, and 24 per cent Independents.\n\nIn contrast to progressive authoritarians, who warn that conservative reactionaries are attempting to infiltrate the gaming community, the ESA\u2019s results show that right-leaning gamers already constitute a small majority. Even so, many gamers are in agreement with libertarians and liberals on social and environmental issues, with 71 per cent of respondents indicating a belief in humans having an effect on climate change, 67 per cent supporting increased investment in renewable energy.\n\n61 per cent expressed concern over the disparity of wealth distribution in America. Among respondents aged 18-24, race relations, class disparity, and education were all identified as issues of high importance.\n\nGamers care most about the economy, with only 41 per cent of respondents indicating that they were better off financially than eight years ago, and a majority of 61 per cent supporting cutting government spending to address the budget deficit, compared to only 25 per cent supporting increased taxes.\n\nThe survey shows that gamers are a diverse and wide-ranging community deeply concerned by the issues Americans are facing today and engaged in the political landscape, as opposed to the insular, homogeneous, self-obsessed hyper-consumer stereotype propagated by many in the gaming and mainstream press.\n\n\u201cGamers are engaged, informed and hold strong opinions on critical issues,\u201d Michael D. Gallagher, president and CEO of the ESA, stated in a press release.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re smart, concerned and they vote,\u201d concured Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cThis ESA survey tells us a lot about the gamers and how they could potentially reshape the political landscape in 2016.\u201d\n\nSimon Rosenberg, founder and president of liberal think-tank NDN, noted, \u201cThe views of gamers are as diverse as the nation itself, and there can be little doubt now that playing video games is a near universal activity at the very core now of the national experience in the U.S.\u201d\n\nGallagher expects \u201c100 million gamers will vote next year,\u201d which would constitute an enormous share of the expected voter turnout. For comparison, the total number of votes cast in the 2012 presidential election was just over 129 million. \u201cFrom both sides of the aisle, and in every state across the country, they will influence the course of our nation\u2019s future,\u201d Gallagher predicted.\n\nThe ESA provided an infographic of the key points from their survey results, which can be viewed below.\n\nEssential Facts About Gamer Politics\n\nNoah Dulis is the Deputy Managing Editor of Breitbart News and co-editor of Breitbart Tech.
