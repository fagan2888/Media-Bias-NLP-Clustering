He walked away from the incident with non-serious injuries.\n\nMichael LaDue was cruising along the interstate on his motorcycle when he was struck my lightning. He walked away from the incident with non-serious injuries. CC BY-SA\n\nFify-nine-year old Michael LaDue\u2019s helmet was struck by lightning while he rode his motorcycle through a storm in Washington state around 9:30 a.m. Thursday. Luckily, he was able to walk away from the hit with non-life threatening injuries.\n\nAccording to the Seattle Times, Martin Zaplac and his family watched LaDue ride ahead of them. They saw that the lightning struck low, but figured that LaDue had not been hit since he continued driving his motorcycle a while longer. That was until he slowly drove to the right shoulder of the interstate where he collapsed. Zapalac says he pulled over to the side of the road to check on LaDue.\n\n\u201cWhy am I stopped here?\u201d asked LaDue, looking dazed.\n\nLaDue\u2019s hair was singed and his ear was burned, but other than that he had no major injuries. He was in the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center for a short while, but was released from the hospital Friday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "motorcyclist, michael ladue, lightning", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Michael LaDue was cruising along the interstate on his motorcycle when he was struck my lightning.
