Titled \u201c\u2018They Don\u2019t Give a Damn About Governing': Conservative Media\u2019s Influence on the Republican Party,\u201d the study essentially indicts right-leaning media outlets \u2014 with Hannity commonly figuring among the perpetrators \u2014 for acting \u201cin ways that are impeding Republicans\u2019 ability to govern and to win presidential elections.\u201d\n\nZeroing in on Hannity, the report, written by New York Times national correspondent Jackie Calmes, quotes an unnamed Republican as follows: \u201cThere\u2019s not a platform in the Laura Ingraham-Sean Hannity wing of conservatism. There\u2019s nothing that you can take to the country and hope to win the presidency on that they believe in. I mean, anti-immigration, don\u2019t\n\nhesitate to shut down the government, repeal Obamacare, no new taxes \u2013 that\u2019s not a governing platform. That will rally 40 percent of the population.\u201d\n\nBy Hannity\u2019s account, Calmes never rang him up to get his side of the story. The Erik Wemple Blog did, and Hannity called the allegation that he doesn\u2019t advance solutions \u201cbull\u2014-.\u201d Responding to just this sort of criticism, Hannity in early 2014 unveiled a platform of his own \u2013\u201cconservative solutions\u201d to U.S. problems, including a balanced budget amendment and fomenting \u201chome-grown energy resources,\u201d among other measures. \u201cShe\u2019s making a broad, sweeping generalization,\u201d says Hannity.\n\nThe Fox News host, too, sounds as though he\u2019s familiar with the refrain that conservative media outlets have radicalized the Republican Party. When they run for office, he says, Republican candidates make \u201cvery specific promises.\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m old-fashioned but if you give your word on the campaign trail, you\u2019re supposed to keep it,\u201d says Hannity. An example: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) became a \u201cpariah\u201d on account of his 2013 effort to defund Obamacare \u201cwhen all he was doing was fulfilling the promise they all had made,\u201d says Hannity. Also: What about all those promises to secure the border? What happened to them? asks the host. \u201cThe Republican Party in Washington is a carbon copy of the Democratic Party,\u201d says Hannity, \u201cand now we have gotten into this pattern of lashing out against conservatives.\u201d\n\nOn immigration, Calmes\u2019s report accuses Hannity of changing his opposition in response to prevailing conservative sentiment:\n\nIn 2007 Hannity had \u201chelped kill\u201d George W. Bush\u2019s immigration overhaul, according to a study that year by the nonpartisan Project for Excellence in Journalism, now part of Pew Research Center. But five years later, a day after the 2012 election, when exit polls showed Latinos\u2019 rejection of Romney had contributed to the Republican\u2019s loss, Hannity told his audience that he had \u201cevolved\u201d and now would support a \u201cpathway to citizenship\u201d for illegal immigrants \u201cto get rid of the immigration issue altogether.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2013, Hannity \u201crejoined\u201d the opposition to such reform, notes Calmes. \u201cYeah \u2014 blah, blah,\u201d says Hannity when presented with Calmes\u2019s critique. \u201cTell her to read my entire statement,\u201d says Hannity, who in addition to his Fox News program hosts the second-ranked radio program in Talkers magazine\u2019s hierarchy. Throughout the debate over immigration, insists Hannity, he has been clear and consistent that the reigning priority lies with securing the border \u2014 and until that happens, the rest is an afterthought.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, she had a predetermined opinion before\u201d embarking on the study, says Hannity. The report itself is long, detailed and full of nice, chunky paragraphs \u2014 even Hannity concedes that it features some \u201cgood research.\u201d Its signature quote comes from former Republican representative Tom Latham, who rips away on conservative media folks: \u201cThey will not take 80 percent \u2013 it\u2019s got to be 100 percent or you\u2019re not pure,\u201d Latham said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give a damn about governing, or about anything than being pure themselves.\u201d In the sort of question that would never be allowed in a courtroom, Calmes asks Latham whether he feels that \u201cRepublicans helped create a monster.\u201d Yes, responds Latham.\n\nRecent months have been good to \u201cHannity,\u201d which has scored a number of first interviews with declared Republican presidential candidates. In that department, \u201cHannity\u201d has gotten some competition from ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, who was singed this year by revelations that he\u2019d made contributions to the Clinton Foundation. \u201cI keep winning, so I\u2019m not that worried about it,\u201d says Hannity of the challenge posed by Stephanopoulos. \u201cI think Republicans can make whatever decision they want, but I would say that if they go on his show, they are dealing with a Clinton sycophant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Radio and TV host says he wasn't contacted for study, has opinions about it.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Radio and TV host says he wasn't contacted for study, has opinions about it.", "title": "Sean Hannity lashes back at Shorenstein study on conservative media outlets", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/07/29/sean-hannity-lashes-back-at-shorenstein-study-on-conservative-media-outlets/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/files/2014/02/Hannity-415.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/07/29/sean-hannity-lashes-back-at-shorenstein-study-on-conservative-media-outlets/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Sean Hannity, Fox News, premiere networks, shorenstein center, jackie calmes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Sean Hannity, Fox News, premiere networks, shorenstein center, jackie calmes"}, "article_summary": "The Fox News host, too, sounds as though he\u2019s familiar with the refrain that conservative media outlets have radicalized the Republican Party.\nSean Hannity (Fox News)Fox News host Sean Hannity is mentioned 20 times in a new study released by Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.\n\u201cIn my opinion, she had a predetermined opinion before\u201d embarking on the study, says Hannity.\nRecent months have been good to \u201cHannity,\u201d which has scored a number of first interviews with declared Republican presidential candidates.\n\u201cI keep winning, so I\u2019m not that worried about it,\u201d says Hannity of the challenge posed by Stephanopoulos."}
