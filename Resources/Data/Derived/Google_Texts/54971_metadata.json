(REUTERS/Jason Reed)\n\n3928205\n\nHundreds of thousands of Americans who purchase their own health insurance have received cancellation notices since August because the plans do not meet Obamacare\u2019s requirements.\n\nThe number of cancellation notices greatly exceed the number of Obamacare enrollees.\n\nInsurance carrier Florida Blue sent out 300,000 cancellation notices, or 80 percent of the entire state\u2019s individual coverage policies, Kaiser Health News reports. California\u2019s Kaiser Permanente canceled 160,000 plans \u2014 half of its insurance plans in the state \u2014 while Blue Shield of California sent 119,000 notices in mid-September alone.\n\nTwo major insurance carriers in Pennsylvania, Insurance Highmark in Pittsburgh and Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia plan to cancel 20 percent and 45 percent of their total plans, respectively.\n\nNearly 800,000 New Jersey residents\u2019 health-care plans will not longer exist in 2014, forcing insurers to create new ones for individuals and small business owners that hew to the Obamacare\u2019s new regulations, The New Jersey Star Ledger found in early October.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I need to change, but I have to,\u201d Jeff Learned, a television editor in Los Angeles, told Kaiser Health News. Learned now needs to scramble to find a plan to cover his teenage daughter, whose health problems have required several surgeries.\n\nMore Americans have lost their individual health coverage in Florida and California than have gotten past the login screen on HealthCare.gov, according to The Washington Post, which reports that 476,000 applications have \u201cbeen started,\u201d but not completed. HealthCare.gov\u2019s dysfunctional website has helped enrollment grind to almost a complete halt. (RELATED: HealthCare.gov contractor: We had only two weeks to test site)\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to determine exactly how lopsided the rates of cancellations versus the rates of enrollment are \u2014 the Obama administration jealously guards the official enrollment numbers, refusing to release them to even the law\u2019s loyal Democratic supporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s screwed up,\u201d New York Rep. Charlie Rangel said of the White House\u2019s secretive maneuvers.\n\nSeveral states have released Obamacare enrollment data, however, revealing extremely low rates. South Dakota reported that only 23 people enrolled in the exchanges, a mere 0.0000276 percent of that state\u2019s population. North Dakota enrolled only 20 residents.\n\nAlaska, meanwhile, comes in at seven total enrollees, or 0.000957 percent of Alaskans.\n\nSources inside the Department of Health and Human Services told The Daily Mail that only 6,200 Americans signed up for coverage the day HealthCare.gov launched, while only 51,000 applied in the first week. (RELATED: Obama administration will not release number of Obamacare enrollees on opening day)\n\nDuring his campaign to pitch the law to voters back in 2009, President Barack Obama vowed that Obamacare would merely lower costs for Americans with health insurance while providing coverage to the uninsured.\n\n\u201c[N]o matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period,\u201d Obama said to an audience at the annual conference of the American Medical Association. \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, [the Affordable Care Act] is for people who aren\u2019t happy with their current plan. If you like what you\u2019re getting, keep it. Nobody is forcing you to shift,\u201d he later added.\n\nFollow Katie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Katie McHugh", "description": "'I don't feel like I need to change, but I have to'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Americans who purchase their own health insurance have\u00a0received cancellation notices since August because the plans do not meet Obamacare's requirements.
