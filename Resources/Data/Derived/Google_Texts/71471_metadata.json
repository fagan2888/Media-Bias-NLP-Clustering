There are no textbooks. Just sheets of paper and some pencils and crayons that two young refugee women use to teach children how to read and write, count and draw, sing songs and recite poems.\n\n\u201cWe are giving them the basics, letters and numbers,\u201d said one of the teachers, Hanadi, 23, who asked to be identified by only her first name. \u201cWe mostly try to bring some joy into their lives. They\u2019ve seen too much bloodshed.\u201d\n\nAnas might be considered one of the luckier ones in Syria\u2019s long conflict, which reached its third anniversary Saturday. Nearly half of Syria\u2019s school-age children \u2014 2.8 million and counting \u2014 cannot get an education because of the devastation and violence, UNICEF recently reported.\n\n\u201cThey come every day, these sad parents, begging me to take their children to school,\u201d said Etaf Seif Abdel Samad, principal of a public grade school in Beirut, where Syrian children learn with the Lebanese side by side.\n\nBy the end of last year, school-age Syrian children in Lebanon \u2014 currently estimated at 400,000 \u2014 outnumbered their Lebanese peers by 100,000.\n\nMore than 2 million children who should be in school remain in Syria, where classrooms have been bombed, used as shelters or turned into military barracks.\n\nAnother 300,000 Syrian children don\u2019t attend school in Lebanon, along with about 93,000 in Jordan, 78,000 in Turkey, 26,000 in Iraq and 4,000 in Egypt, UNICEF officials in Geneva say.\n\nThose numbers likely are higher. UNICEF can\u2019t count the children whose parents didn\u2019t register with the U.N. refugee agency.\n\nExperts say that puts a whole generation of Syrians at risk of coming of age illiterate, lost to a war that has killed about 140,000 people already. UNICEF estimates more than 10,000 children have died in the violence.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddafa\"", "article_summary": "Nearly half of Syria\u2019s school-age children \u2014 2.8 million and counting \u2014 cannot get an education because of the devastation and violence, UNICEF recently reported.\nBy the end of last year, school-age Syrian children in Lebanon \u2014 currently estimated at 400,000 \u2014 outnumbered their Lebanese peers by 100,000.\n\u201cThey come every day, these sad parents, begging me to take their children to school,\u201d said Etaf Seif Abdel Samad, principal of a public grade school in Beirut, where Syrian children learn with the Lebanese side by side.\nAnother 300,000 Syrian children don\u2019t attend school in Lebanon, along with about 93,000 in Jordan, 78,000 in Turkey, 26,000 in Iraq and 4,000 in Egypt, UNICEF officials in Geneva say.\nUNICEF estimates more than 10,000 children have died in the violence."}
