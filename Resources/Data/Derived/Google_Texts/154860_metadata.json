Reuters\n\nCurrent low levels of U.S. inflation are likely temporary and the risks of keeping U.S. policy rates at zero for too long \u201cmay be substantial,\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President, James Bullard, said Thursday, signaling that the U.S. central bank should get on with raising rates soon.\n\n\u201cNow may be a good time to begin normalizing U.S. monetary policy so that it is set appropriately for an improving economy over the next two years,\u201d Mr. Bullard said in prepared remarks to the OMFIF City Lecture in Frankfurt. \u201cEven with some normalization, policy will remain exceptionally accommodative.\u201d\n\nHe said that from his perspective, normal Fed policy would suggest an eventual return to historical norms with a balance sheet closer to $1 trillion\u2013versus over $4 trillion now\u2013and official policy rates of \u201cseveral hundred basis points.\u201d\n\nMr. Bullard\u2019s comments echo recent warnings he has made that the Fed\u2019s zero interest rate policy is no longer appropriate for the U.S. economy that has grown strongly in recent quarters, pushing unemployment down.\n\nMr. Bullard, who isn\u2019t a voting member of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting board this year, warned that if interest rates remain near zero for too long, destabilizing bubbles may form in some asset markets.\n\n\u201cIf a bubble in a key asset market develops, history has shown that we have little ability to contain it,\u201d Mr. Bullard said. \u201cA gradual normalization would help to mitigate this risk while still providing significant monetary policy accommodation for the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the Fed official downplayed the effects of the U.S. dollar\u2019s strong rise in recent months, brought on in part by the European Central Bank\u2019s decision in January to launch a large-scale bond purchase program that began earlier this month.\n\nIn contrast, Fed officials signaled this month that they are likely to raise interest rates this year by dropping their assurance that they will be \u201cpatient\u201d in tightening policy. The change in language \u201cshould be interpreted as a sign of strength for the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Bullard said Thursday.\n\nEconomic research \u201csuggests limited effects of exchange rate movements on U.S. economic performance,\u201d Mr. Bullard said. \u201cThe U.S. is an open economy, but it\u2019s not that open.\u201d\n\nAnd he signaled that currency markets have largely priced in the expected divergence between the monetary policies of the Fed and ECB and that future movements will likely be driven by shocks or surprises to the economic outlook. After a \u201cpretty successful launch\u201d of the ECB\u2019s asset purchase program this month, the eurozone economy should see better growth in 2015 than it did last year, Mr. Bullard said.\n\nEven if U.S. gross domestic product is only assumed to have expanded at a 1.5% annualized pace in the first quarter, the economy is likely to grow in the 3% range over the medium term, Mr. Bullard said. Some of the recent softness in U.S. data was driven by poor weather, he said, and there should a bounce-back in activity during the second quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201clabor markets continue to improve and are approaching or even exceeding normal performance levels,\u201d he said, observing that a U.S. unemployment rate in the low-4% range is a \u201creasonable prediction\u201d for next year.\n\nLow levels of U.S. inflation are likely temporary and driven by oil prices, Mr. Bullard said, though he is keeping a close eye on inflation expectations.\n\n\u2013Jason Douglas contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Current low levels of U.S. inflation are likely temporary and the risks of keeping U.S. policy rates at zero for too long \"may be substantial,\" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President, James Bullard, said Thursday.", "title": "Fed\u2019s Bullard: Risks of Keeping U.S. Policy Rates at Zero Too Long \u2018May be Substantial\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/03/26/feds-bullard-risks-of-keeping-u-s-policy-rates-at-zero-too-long-may-be-substantial/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HP321_bullar_P_20150326044201.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Fed\u2019s Bullard: Risks of Keeping U.S. Policy Rates at Zero Too Long \u2018May be Substantial\u2019", "description": "Current low levels of U.S. inflation are likely temporary and the risks of keeping U.S. policy rates at zero for too long \"may be substantial,\" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President, James Bullard, said Thursday.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Brian Blackstone", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "Current low levels of U.S. inflation are likely temporary and the risks of keeping U.S. policy rates at zero for too long \"may be substantial,\" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President, James Bullard, said Thursday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-03-26T08:43:25-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/03/26/feds-bullard-risks-of-keeping-u-s-policy-rates-at-zero-too-long-may-be-substantial/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-31549", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Current low levels of U.S. inflation are likely temporary and the risks of keeping U.S. policy rates at zero for too long \"may be substantial,\" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President, James Bullard, said Thursday.", "title": "Fed\u2019s Bullard: Risks of Keeping U.S. Policy Rates at Zero Too Long \u2018May be Substantial\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/03/26/feds-bullard-risks-of-keeping-u-s-policy-rates-at-zero-too-long-may-be-substantial/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HP321_bullar_P_20150326044201.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-31549", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-26T11:01:34-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe519d\"", "article_summary": "The change in language \u201cshould be interpreted as a sign of strength for the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Bullard said Thursday.\n\u201cIf a bubble in a key asset market develops, history has shown that we have little ability to contain it,\u201d Mr. Bullard said.\nLow levels of U.S. inflation are likely temporary and driven by oil prices, Mr. Bullard said, though he is keeping a close eye on inflation expectations.\nMr. Bullard, who isn\u2019t a voting member of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting board this year, warned that if interest rates remain near zero for too long, destabilizing bubbles may form in some asset markets.\nEconomic research \u201csuggests limited effects of exchange rate movements on U.S. economic performance,\u201d Mr. Bullard said."}
