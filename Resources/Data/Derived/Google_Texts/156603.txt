What happened?

--Parisians woke up Saturday to a full realization of the horror wrought by the terrorist attacks of the previous evening -- violence deadlier than anything Paris has experienced since World War II.

-- The Paris Police Prefecture said the toll was at least 129. The spokesman said 352 people had been injured, 99 of whom were in critical condition. The death toll is expected to rise significantly, said Paris' Deputy Mayor, Patrick Klugman.

-- Eight terrorists died, seven of them in suicide bombings.

-- Belgium's federal prosecutor's office says authorities have so far made three arrests linked to the deadly attacks in Paris.

-- French media, citing law enforcement sources, reported that a Syrian passport was found on of the bodies of the attackers, and that verification was in progress. The finding did not necessarily mean the person was Syrian.

-- President Francois Hollande was at Stade de France, where France was hosting Germany in a soccer friendly. Hollande was evacuated and has vowed a ruthless response to the attacks.
