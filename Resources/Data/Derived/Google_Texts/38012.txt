During a Thursday night speech in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Donald Trump promised the audience he’d never use profanity again.

Trump was railing against “political hacks,” when he stopped short of using a worse term. “I won’t use foul language,” he said to the crowd. “I’m just not going to do it, I’m not going to do it.”

“They’re all saying, ‘Do it, do it.’ No,” Trump said. “I’m not. That’s better, right?”

“Even if it’s not a bad word, if it’s a little bit off they kill me, so I won’t do it. I’ll never do it again, actually,” he promised.

Perhaps Trump watched Bloomberg Politics’ focus group of South Carolina Republicans, which found that nearly every one was turned off by Trump’s “crassness” and use of profanity.
