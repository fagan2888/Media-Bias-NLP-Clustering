As it has taken effect, Obamacare has had huge impacts on entire industries, including health insurance companies and health-care providers. In anticipation of Obamacare's positive impact, shares of insurers UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and WellPoint (NYSE:ANTM) soared last year, and hospital companies Community Health Systems (NYSE:CYH) and HCA Holdings (NYSE:HCA) also enjoyed sharp gains. Yet some are now questioning whether Obamacare will really help all of these industries as much as they expected.\n\nIn the following video, Fool health-care analyst David Williamson and Fool director of investment planning Dan Caplinger discuss the potential winners of Obamacare. Dan notes that many people initially believed that a decrease in the number of uninsured patients would help HCA, Community Health, and other health-care providers by helping them reduce uncollectible debts from serving those without the means to pay for care. Yet he observes that as many people have chosen lower-tier insurance plans, they still have to pay big deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, and that could leave hospital companies still having to write off substantial amounts for lower-income patients. David adds that with UnitedHealth, WellPoint, and other insurers largely competing with each other on price, especially for lower-tier policies, many customers don't realize the full costs they might end up realizing. Although a rise in people using health care is a positive for hospitals, David observes, it only benefits them if customers -- or their insurance companies -- will end up paying the bill.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "10:10", "date": "2014-03-01T15:10:00Z", "description": "Health-insurance companies and hospitals were both seen as big winners from the Affordable Care Act.
