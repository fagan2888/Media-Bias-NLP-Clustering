She gained national attention after her rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at a University of Kentucky basketball game went viral in 2012.\n\nDespite the fact that neither of VanHoose\u2019s parents have a musical background, the aspiring singer took up music at a very young age.\n\n\u201cI started humming \u2018Jesus Loves Me\u2019 before I could talk,\u201d VanHoose, 19, told The Daily Signal.\n\nA devout Christian, VanHoose began playing the piano at around age two, churning out renditions of songs like \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d on a tiny toy keyboard. Today, she specializes in singing and playing Gospel music.\n\nVanHoose credits God with giving her the strength and courage to sing in front of such broad audiences. She calls God \u201cher first role model,\u201d but says that her mother is her \u201cearthly role model.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c[\u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019] is one of my favorite songs,\u201d VanHoose said. \u201cThe fourth verse of the anthem is my favorite verse, because it talks about God the Creator.\u201d\n\nVanHoose, who graduated from high school one year ago, says that by this point, she has done \u201ctoo many [performances of the anthem] to count.\u201d\n\nThis week alone, VanHoose performed six times. Last month, she sang at the packed Game 6 of the National Basketball Association finals.\n\nVanHoose\u2019s mother, Teresa, says she is particularly proud of how her daughter handles the spotlight. Teresa VanHoose recently resigned from her 13-year-long stint as a special education teacher to have more free time to travel with her daughter. She plans to continue working as an independent education provider for children with disabilities.\n\n\u201cHer dad and I really have never focused on her disabilities but on her abilities, and she does the same,\u201d Teresa told The Daily Signal of her daughter, who she says they treat no differently than their 16-year-old, football-playing son. \u201cWe have treated her as normally as we can.\u201d\n\nRecently, Marlana\u2019s performances allowed her to take her first airplane ride. She also enjoys biking and going to the movies.\n\nDespite her success and relative normalcy, VanHoose has also experienced health issues including adrenal insufficiency, scoliosis, and a short stature as a result of her disabilities.\n\n\u201cYou go through several emotions from why me, depression, anger, and acceptance,\u201d Teresa said of the experience of having a child born with a disability. \u201cBut you realize that God gave you this child for a reason. We want Marlana to experience what any other child experiences. We will continue to let her experience life as any other person experiences it.\u201d\n\nVanHoose has never let her disability hold her back, and has no intention of slowing down. She hopes to continue performing and, one day, sign a major record deal, sing on a Disney television show or movie, and do voiceover work, all the while living out her favorite Bible verse, as stated in the King James Version, Philippians 4:13: \u201cI can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blind 19-year-old Marlana VanHoose belts a viral rendition of the national anthem at performances across the country.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Blind 19-year-old Marlana VanHoose belts a viral rendition of the national anthem at performances across the country.", "title": "Blind 19-Year-Old Belts Viral Rendition of National Anthem", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/marlana.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-16T16:07:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1V7At4p"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Blind 19-year-old Marlana VanHoose belts a viral rendition of the national anthem at performances across the country.", "title": "Blind 19-Year-Old Belts Viral Rendition of National Anthem", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/marlana.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-07-16T13:51:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-16T16:07:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Marlana VanHoose, national anthem, star-spangled banner"}, "article_summary": "Born with Cytomegalovirus, a virus that left her blind and with cerebral palsy, Kentucky native VanHoose is no stranger to major performances.\nShe gained national attention after her rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at a University of Kentucky basketball game went viral in 2012.\nTeresa VanHoose recently resigned from her 13-year-long stint as a special education teacher to have more free time to travel with her daughter.\nVanHoose credits God with giving her the strength and courage to sing in front of such broad audiences.\nLast month, she sang at the packed Game 6 of the National Basketball Association finals."}
