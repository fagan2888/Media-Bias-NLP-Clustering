And they weren\u2019t just words to vote by and to make you feel good. A group of Catholics, most of whom probably vote Republican \u2014 in some cases primarily if not exclusively because of abortion \u2014 gathered in Washington, D.C., to support a new health-care sharing ministry, Christ Medicus Foundation CURO.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, health-care sharing ministries that were already in existence before the law was passed were grandfathered in \u2014 allowed to continue to operate without being subject to the individual mandate or the abortion-drug, contraception, and sterilization mandate issued by the Department of Health and Human Services after the passage of the law. CURO is the first Catholic health-care sharing ministry in the United States. It is able to exist because of a partnership with the veteran Samaritan Ministries International.\n\nThis partnership represents an ecumenical \u201cGod-honoring, Christ-centered, sharing health-care\u201d effort, as Samaritan\u2019s Anthony Hopp puts it, to combat not just the affronts to freedom of conscience and human dignity that the president\u2019s health-care legislation embodies, but the whole trajectory of our culture in America. Pope Francis often talks about a throwaway society where indifference to the suffering of others has become routine. These health-care sharing ministries are a counter-cultural effort to rebuild, to remind people that we should look our brother and sister in the face and help them in their needs. It is a practical and prayerful effort, and in many senses a new way of life.\n\nAt the time of the CMF CURO launch, I just happened to have the neighboring state of Virginia on my mind \u2014 the state which, its advertising proclaims, is \u201cfor lovers.\u201d Cosmopolitan, the women\u2019s glossy, has been branching out into political commentary. But, unlike CMF CURO, the results are less than inspiring, as in a recent editorial about a congressional race.\n\nBarbara Comstock is a Republican running for Congress in Virginia. She\u2019s exactly the kind of woman you\u2019d want in politics. She loves her family and her country, knows how Washington works, and takes the responsibilities of government seriously. Were her politics a little different, she\u2019d be the cover gal for women in politics for any magazine.\n\nBut Cosmo came out for her opponent, John Foust, repeating tired, misleading rhetoric mired in the tired dogma of the sexual revolution and a rigid stance on abortion rights that is out of step with Americans today. Cosmo urges readers to vote for Comstock\u2019s opponent because he passes the abortion litmus test that is all too often the only thing required to earn the Left\u2019s seal of approval. And that\u2019s a shame.\n\nBut the over-the-top nature of this type of commentary may just offer an opportunity to see people and their visions whole. Another candidate in Virginia, Ed Gillespie, who is running for Senate, has made it a point to talk about the \u201cdignity of work\u201d in his stump speech, focusing on his economic plan to help people find self-worth and value in helping to transform the world through labor. During a convocation talk at Liberty University, he elaborated by quoting both St. John Paul II and Timothy Keller, the popular pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York.\n\nWe are \u201cCreated in God\u2019s image, we were given the mandate to transform the earth. By their work, people share in God\u2019s creating activity,\u201d Gillespie quoted from JPII\u2019s 1981 letter on labor. Later, in his northern-Virginia office, reflecting on this idea of the dignity of being able to provide a service, Gillespie is especially excited by Keller\u2019s description of God, in Genesis, taking \u201cdelight\u201d in his work. In his Liberty speech, Gillespie, who like me is a graduate of the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., cited Keller, sharing this insight with the students: \u201c. . . in Genesis we see God as a gardener, and in the New Testament we see him as a carpenter. No task is too small a vessel to hold the immense dignity of work given by God. Simple physical labor is God\u2019s work no less than the formulation of theological truth.\u201d Gillespie hopes his \u201cfive-point plan for economic growth\u201d will work toward affording more Americans the opportunity to know \u201cthe dignity of work.\u201d\n\nPope Francis frequently points to the problem of unemployment among young people, and, when he does, he is inviting us into a holistic understanding of human dignity. He also talks about seeing the unborn child and the elderly as Christ Himself. This is why even non-religious Americans might welcome a development like CMF CURO teaming up with Samaritan. A culture where doctors and patients have a relationship, where cost sharing is rooted in a belief in common brotherhood, where people feel the need to serve because they believe all men and women were created in the image and likeness of God \u2014 that is the kind of culture where charity is fostered and nourished. It\u2019s a culture where it becomes implausible that you would completely ignore the pain of another, as we so routinely do.\n\nRallying around human dignity in policy and practice \u2014 and, yes, even in politics \u2014 is the way out of a culture of indifference and inhumanity.
