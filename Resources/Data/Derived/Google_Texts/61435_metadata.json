The American racer said Monday on her Facebook page: \u201cSee ya in a week!\u201d Originally, she was targeting a March return for the World Cup finals in St. Moritz, Switzerland.\n\nWith only three slalom races left \u2014 along with a parallel event this month in Stockholm that counts in the slalom standings \u2014 the three-time defending champion still has a slim mathematical chance to retain her crown in the discipline. She trails slalom leader Frida Hansdotter of Sweden by 305 points.\n\nShiffrin won two slalom races this season \u2014 both in Aspen, Colorado, and both by big margins \u2014 before tearing a ligament and bruising a bone in her right knee while training for a giant slalom in Sweden two months ago. Her right ski slipped and then her knee buckled, before hitting some grippy snow that caused her to hyperextend her knee and skid into the protective netting.\n\n\u201cI never thought that I would have an injury because I have always worked as hard as I can to prevent injuries,\u201d Shiffrin said in a release through her ski sponsor, Atomic. \u201cI rarely fall when I\u2019m skiing. If I\u2019m scared in a situation, training or racing, I would tend to slow myself down before taking the risks and crash hard.\n\n\u201cI am lucky that I hurt two of the things in my knee that can heal on their own really well. If I had hurt my ACL or meniscus and needed surgery, I think this would have been a lot more difficult for me. But I have thought about my knee like a big cut on my leg or something.\u201d\n\nWhile away, she said she watched every men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup race.\n\n\u201cI would pretend that I was skiing it and figure out how I might ski it differently than the other girls,\u201d said Shiffrin, who turns 21 on March 13.\n\nShiffrin returned to snow in late January, with some easy drills. Steadily, she ramped up her training and recently went through gates.\n\n\u201cI had to keep my speeds really slow so I didn\u2019t put too much force through the joint,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who will train in Colorado until later this week before flying to Switzerland. \u201cWe just wanted to see how my knee responded to being on skis and snow before putting energy into the ski.\u201d\n\nShe said she never really considered sitting out, even though it could\u2019ve protected her starting position for 2016-17.\n\n\u201cNo matter how it effects my start order, I would really regret knowing that I was 100 percent and ready to race and decided not to anyway,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI\u2019m a racer at heart. I belong in the starting gate.\u201d\n\nAP Sports Writer Graham Dunbar in Switzerland contributed.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin returns to slalom racing next week", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin returns to slalom racing next week", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/08/mikaela-shiffrin-returns-to-slalom-racing-next-week/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__Mikaela-Shiffrinp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__Mikaela-Shiffrinp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-08T12:46:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:16:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Olympic and world slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin said she will return to World Cup skiing next week in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, after a knee injury sidelined her for two months.\nShiffrin moved up her comeback when a slalom was organized for next Monday at Crans-Montana.\nIf I\u2019m scared in a situation, training or racing, I would tend to slow myself down before taking the risks and crash hard.\n\u201cI am lucky that I hurt two of the things in my knee that can heal on their own really well.\nShiffrin returned to snow in late January, with some easy drills."}
