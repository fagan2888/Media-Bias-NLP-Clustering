Expansion will, by design, increase prices because it will increase demand without any corresponding increase of supply, i.e., doctors, nurses, clinics, etc. That means higher prices for everyone except the able-bodied, childless recipients who are the beneficiaries of expansion. Oh, you weren't aware that's who the expansion population is? Alaska already provides the most extravagant health care plan in the United States for the most needy, the elderly, families with dependent children, pregnant women and the disabled. The expansion population is mainly, but not entirely, made up of able-bodied, childless adults. What? You thought it was for the most vulnerable among us?
