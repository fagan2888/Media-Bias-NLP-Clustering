The Republican candidate for Colorado House District 29, Robert Ramirez, notified the Secretary of State’s Office this week that he is no longer a candidate to represent the north Jefferson County district.

Ramirez told The Denver Post on Thursday that he submitted a withdrawal letter with state elections officials on Wednesday. He did not explain his decision to get out beyond saying that he was “working all the time.”

Colorado GOP Chair Ryan Call said party officials have begun organizing a vacancy committee, hopefully to meet July 2, to appoint a Republican candidate to face Rep. Tracy Kraft-Tharp in November in the district covering portions of Westminster and Arvada.

“I’ve had the pleasure of talking to one of two candidates who are inspiring,” Call said. “We have every confidence that Republicans will be able to field a credible candidate in the general election.”

Ramirez served in the House for one term before Kraft-Tharp handily defeated him in 2012.

Several races in Jefferson County, which is evenly split politically, have been targeted by the GOP for victory.

Ramirez’s decision comes during the same week Liz Geisleman, former treasurer of the Jefferson County Democratic Party, filed a campaign finance complaint against Ramirez alleging that he failed to file 12 legally required campaign finance disclosure reports.

Geisleman’s complaint claims that Ramirez hasn’t submitted a single report since filing his candidate affidavit in March. With the Secretary of State’s Office levying fines of $50 a day for the violations, she alleges that Ramirez’s campaign owes $12,300 in penalties.

Ramirez wouldn’t comment on the complaint beyond saying he had asked the Secretary of State’s Office for a waiver in the matter.
