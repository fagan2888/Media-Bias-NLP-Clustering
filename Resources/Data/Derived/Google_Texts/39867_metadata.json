James H. Evans Jr., pastor of St. Luke.\n\nOn Tuesdays, nurses will provide basic health screenings. On Wednesdays, medical students and attending physicians will perform basic tests and conduct physicals. On Thursdays, help will be available for English- and Spanish-speakers who want to sign up for health insurance, and social workers will be on site.\n\nSt. Luke Community of Care, Inc., includes the James Perkins Youth Development Center, People Inc. Finger Lakes After School Respite Program and the St. Luke Community Foundation.\n\nFor more, call 271-2870.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1fs8bZR", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Services offered three days a week are free on a walk-in basis.", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "Services offered three days a week are free on a walk-in basis.", "title": "St. Luke Tabernacle opens health center", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2014/02/26/st-luke-tabernacle-opens-health-center/5841895/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Services offered three days a week are free on a walk-in basis.", "title": "St. Luke Tabernacle opens health center", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/baf7bf9d01490b3c2d0c8cee59aba477f6705bb2/c=0-0-800-800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/03/02/newsbrief26.jpg", "creator": "@DandC", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/57c08817794715b2b711ca061eb79dae1fcbcb8c/c=99-0-699-800/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/03/02/newsbrief26.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/96f1db5946de6051b8af17e4f472b4b757a5bf51/c=0-0-800-800/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/03/02/newsbrief26.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aaf9ccc78c90cf6c34bbb102f0dbdcdacc255d1a/c=0-99-800-699/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/03/02/newsbrief26.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c042f1d7bf7b07ab6e09384a3ee0d910d8bbd2fc/c=0-174-800-624&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/03/02/newsbrief26.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-02-26T16:00:05-05:00", "shorthed": "St. Luke Tabernacle opens health center", "articleid": 5841895, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/722b7e05871c3cef36e147dd726fa9dad3d4f800/c=0-174-800-624/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/03/02/newsbrief26.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5173c58650cf58b05cb1b92e8e952cc027321b6e/c=174-0-624-800/local/-/media/Rochester/2014/03/02/newsbrief26.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "pageclass": "article", "title": "St. Luke Tabernacle opens health center"}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc648\"", "article_summary": "St. Luke Community of Care, Inc., includes the James Perkins Youth Development Center, People Inc.
