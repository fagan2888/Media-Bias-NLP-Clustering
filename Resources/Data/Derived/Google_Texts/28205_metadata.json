In the lead up to his comments, Perry focused on what he said was the havoc wreaked by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a point of contrast to the 16.4 million people who are newly insured as a result of the healthcare law, Perry pointed to his own state as a model for what he\u2019d like to see happen nationally.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of what we did in the state of Texas,\u201d he said.\n\nLater into the speech, he continued:\n\nAccess to healthcare is the real issue. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for us, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the appropriate thing for us to judge success by how many people can we force to buy insurance. I think it\u2019s important how many people have access to really good quality healthcare. That\u2019s what we aught to be working on.\n\nThis is where he jumped into women\u2019s healthcare specifically, explaining that the Texas model focused on providing access to \u201cthe least among us.\u201d His choice to focus on low-income women\u2019s access to healthcare was\u2026interesting.\n\nOne of the signature policies under Perry\u2019s tenure as governor was HB2, the omnibus abortion bill that\u2014until a Supreme Court order issued earlier this month temporarily blocked its total enforcement\u2014threatened to shutter all but a handful of clinics in the state. (It was a victory of sorts, though it\u2019s probably better to call it the maintenance of a profoundly shitty status quo.)\n\nHB2 is very much a bill designed to restrict access to abortion\u2014through forced waiting periods, expensive clinic renovations, business contracts between clinics and hospitals\u2014so it\u2019s no great surprise that access in the state is now severely restricted.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, HB2 has forced hundreds of thousands of women to travel long distances to access basic care (emphasis added):\n\nThe number of women of reproductive age in Texas living more than 50 miles from a clinic providing abortion in Texas increased from 816,000 in May 2013 to 1,680,000 by April 2014. When the ASC requirement goes into effect this will increase to 1,960,000. The number of women of reproductive age in Texas living more than 100 miles from a clinic providing abortion in Texas increased from 417,000 in May 2013 to 1,020,000 by April 2014. When the ASC requirement goes into effect this will increase to 1,335,000. The number of women of reproductive age in Texas living more than 200 miles from a clinic providing abortion in Texas increased from 10,000 in May 2013 to 290,000 by April 2014. When the ASC requirement goes into effect this will increase to 752,000.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume that access to abortion isn\u2019t part of Perry\u2019s calculation about how great women\u2019s healthcare was in Texas while he was governor. (I mean he is, after all, at a national anti-abortion convention talking about his bonafides as a pro-life governor. This isn\u2019t a stretch of the imagination.) But other kinds of reproductive healthcare also tanked under Perry.\n\nData released by the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) in 2013 (two years after the Texas legislature cut state family planning funds by two-thirds) found that doctors involved in the program saw 77 percent fewer family planning patients. And for each clients they did see, costs were 17 percent higher.\n\nAndrea Grimes, a senior political reporter at a reproductive health-focused site called RH Reality Check, reported on this back in 2013:\n\nIn 2010, providers in the state\u2019s fully funded family planning program saw nearly 212,000 patients. In 2013, the providers that managed to stay afloat after the funding cuts saw a little over 47,000 patients. [\u2026] At a DSHS council meeting Wednesday in Austin, commissioner Dr. David Lakey told council members that the decline in clients served was a direct result of the 2011 funding cuts. \u201cThere\u2019s been significant changes in the way that we\u2019re addressing some of these issues following the last two legislative sessions,\u201d said Lakey.\n\nBut the legislature tried a little bit of self-correction in 2013, restoring some funds to fill in the gaps created by previous cuts. But access remains limited.\n\nAccording to another report from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, his one released in 2015, women in the state\u2014particularly low-income women and women of color\u2014are still struggling to access basic services. According to that report, 55 percent of women \u201creported at least one barrier to accessing reproductive health care services, including cervical cancer screening or family planning services.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Rick Perry was one of the four Republican presidential candidates to speak Friday morning\u00a0at the National Right to Life convention, a conference put on each year by the anti-abortion group.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Rick Perry was one of the four Republican presidential candidates to speak Friday morning\u00a0at the National Right to Life convention, a conference put on each year by the anti-abortion group.", "title": "Rick Perry Says He's \"proud\" of What He Did for Women's Healthcare in Texas.
