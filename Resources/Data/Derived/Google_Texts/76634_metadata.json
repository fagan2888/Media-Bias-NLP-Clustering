The point of this sequence, it seems, is to show how exceptional the real-life SEALs are before introducing SEALs as characters. With soldiers\u2019 conviction and might thus demonstrated, the film can then whisk a few of them off on a mission that, as the title suggests, does not end particularly well. But this montage serves another, more insidious function. Assembled like a high-gloss music video and slathered in Explosions in the Sky\u2019s soaring post-rock, it plays out like an advertisement for the Marine Corps\u2014an affectionate endorsement from Hollywood of the SEALs\u2019 peerless brawn. Adapted from the memoirs of former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell (played in the film by Mark Wahlberg, who also co-produced), Lone Survivor is the sort of film you expect to seem at least a little propagandistic. It\u2019s rooted in a tradition of patriotism as old as the motion picture itself, stretching from the John Wayne vehicle The Green Berets to the recent Act of Valor. Many of its more aggressively nationalistic elements are just a matter of following genre protocol.\n\nRelated Story Finally, National-Security Storytelling That's Not Propaganda Consider how Berg introduces our tragic heroes. His opening testimonial is followed by a low-key scene in which an outfit of SEALs laze around their makeshift living quarters, firing off fond emails to loved ones and fretting over forthcoming social engagements. They play games and sing songs and like American beer. They are, in other words, ordinary guys, totally down-to-earth despite being the best at what they do. Now, compare this exaggeratedly casual introduction with the way the film brings in its Taliban villains. Their unruly gang storms into a quiet village while firing off machine guns and, while screaming unintelligibly, drags a man into the streets and lops his head off with a machete. (Sinister-sounding music accompanies, just in case the sentiment wasn\u2019t clear.) This is cartoon villainy\u2014the realm of the black hat and the twirling moustache. Such gestures serve a straightforward dramatic purpose: They align the audience with the heroes while encouraging them to dislike the bad guys, so that when the battle finally ignites, the viewer\u2019s sympathies have already been sorted out. During the film\u2019s longest and most spectacular sequence, in which four SEALs face off against a veritable army of Taliban soldiers in the middle of the Afghan mountains, we need to feel an emotional connection to the heroes in a way that we don\u2019t with their enemies. We need to believe, even subconsciously, that while the Americans are three-dimensional characters to whom we can relate, the seemingly endless droves of attackers who besiege them are not\u2014they\u2019re merely The Enemy, a faceless mass, a manifestation of evil. We want to see them shot at, eviscerated, blown to pieces. Steven Spielberg declared that \u201cevery war movie, good or bad, is an antiwar movie.\u201d Nobody leaves \"Saving Private Ryan\" under the impression that Normandy was fun. This strategy, of course, is nothing new. And because an informed viewer is perfectly capable of distinguishing fiction from reality, it\u2019s doubtful that even the most outrageously jingoistic war films are actually dangerous in any meaningful sense. In other words, nobody will be rushing off to war on account of Peter Berg.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even if films don&#39;t glorify conflict itself, they all come down to good guys against bad guys.", "author": "Calum Marsh", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Even if films don&#39;t glorify conflict itself, they all come down to good guys against bad guys.", "title": "Lone Survivor's Takeaway: Every War Movie Is a Pro-War Movie", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/o_LONE_SURVIVOR_TRAILER_facebook/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/01/-em-lone-survivor-em-s-takeaway-every-war-movie-is-a-pro-war-movie/282812/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7b5\"", "article_summary": "Steven Spielberg declared that \u201cevery war movie, good or bad, is an antiwar movie.\u201d Nobody leaves \"Saving Private Ryan\" under the impression that Normandy was fun.\nThe point of this sequence, it seems, is to show how exceptional the real-life SEALs are before introducing SEALs as characters.\nIn other words, nobody will be rushing off to war on account of Peter Berg.\nNow, compare this exaggeratedly casual introduction with the way the film brings in its Taliban villains.\nThey are, in other words, ordinary guys, totally down-to-earth despite being the best at what they do."}
