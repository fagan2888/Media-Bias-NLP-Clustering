I see it as a precedent for future apps of its kind,\" said Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh, a Dubai-based consultant for app makers in the Iranian market.\n\nGershad does not describe itself as a form of protest, but its website describes it as a \"social movement\" and asks: \"Why should we give up the most basic right of choosing what clothes to wear?\"\n\nAn online video advert shows patrol members, rendered as dopey-looking cartoon figures, fidgeting impatiently at a checkpoint as the app diverts the flow of pedestrians away from them.\n\n\"Wander freely!\" says the tagline.\n\nSmartphone messaging applications are popular in Iran, where half of the population is aged under 25. Young Iranians use apps to share news and jokes that would not be allowed in the tightly controlled traditional media.\n\nA recent poll suggested that about 20 million Iranians, around a quarter of Iran's population, use Telegram, a messaging app with a focus on privacy and security.\n\nMany young Iranians hope the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions last month will be accompanied by an easing of cultural restrictions, particularly if an election on Feb. 26 ushers in a more moderate legislature.\n\nBut hardliners in the establishment have moved to block any relaxation of the Islamic Republic's social rules, warning of the \"infiltration\" of Western culture. Thousands of moderate and reformist candidates have been barred from standing in the elections.\n\nSECURITY\n\nGershad's interactive map at times shows dozens of checkpoints in Tehran and other Iranian cities but also flags checkpoints in London and Los Angeles, showing the potential unreliability of data provided by an online community.\n\nSome Iranians have expressed concern on social media about Gershad's digital security in a country where the authorities frequently arrest social media users for sharing what they regard as \"immoral\" or \"subversive\" content.\n\nThe developers said they were working to better detect false reports. They said their servers were based outside Iran and that they do not collect user information when users report checkpoint locations.\n\nGershad's website says it uses Psiphon, a Canadian-made app designed to circumvent censorship. Psiphon co-founder Michael Hull said his company's technology allows users in Iran to open an encrypted connection to Gershad's servers outside the country, making their activity harder to block or detect.\n\n\"Once they have that tunnel, the traffic that's going back and forth is just mixed in with the rest of the Psiphon network,\" Hull said.\n\n(Editing by Timothy Heritage)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - A new smartphone application that helps Iranians dodge the Islamic R", "title": "New app helps young Iranians avoid 'morality police'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/12/New-app-helps-young-Iranians-avoid-morality-police", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-rights-apps_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/12/New-app-helps-young-Iranians-avoid-morality-police", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-rights-apps_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - A new smartphone application that helps Iranians dodge the Islamic R", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "DIGITAL PROTESTGershad is an example of how young Iranians are turning to technology to circumvent checks on their everyday lives.\nYoung Iranians use apps to share news and jokes that would not be allowed in the tightly controlled traditional media.\nDUBAI (Reuters) - A new smartphone application that helps Iranians dodge the Islamic Republic's \"morality police\" is proving popular with the young, tech-savvy population but has quickly fallen foul of the authorities.\nMany young Iranians hope the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions last month will be accompanied by an easing of cultural restrictions, particularly if an election on Feb. 26 ushers in a more moderate legislature.\nSome Iranians have expressed concern on social media about Gershad's digital security in a country where the authorities frequently arrest social media users for sharing what they regard as \"immoral\" or \"subversive\" content."}
