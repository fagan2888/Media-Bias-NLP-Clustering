Rapid City, SD

A 23-year-old Rapid City man wants to use a $10,000 grant to help others get a running start on their health and fitness.



James Pine is one of 10 recipients of a grant administered by Running Strong, an American Indian youth nonprofit based in Virginia.



Pine, who ran cross-country and track in high school, plans to begin a series of two-day youth camps called Lakota Forever Running and Fitness this summer.



He wants to start them in eight communities across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.



The Rapid City Journal reports Pine will work with program director Dustin Martin for Wings of America in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to help implement the youth camp.
