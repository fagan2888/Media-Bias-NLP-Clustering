Women of all ages, races, classes and backgrounds have worked to promote peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all in the community.\n\nOn Dec. 2, the YWCA will recognize 100 of the trailblazers, hidden heroes and leading ladies in Tulsa\u2019s history. The YWCA and Sharon King Davis will host the 100 Women of Moxie ceremony to honor the chosen and to celebrate the first 100 years of YWCA Tulsa.\n\nThe list of honorees was made available to the Tulsa World and can be seen below or at 100womenoftulsa.org .\n\nSo what is \u201cmoxie\u201d?\n\nTo honoree Missy Kruse, the word means being action-oriented and \u201cdoing things regardless of whether they are easy to do or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like moxie,\u201d said honoree Dale McNamara. She interprets it as having confidence and being a free spirit and unafraid to jump in the middle of things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a word that seems to have been around for a long time,\u201d honoree Sheryl Siddiqui said. \u201cI can remember my parents and grandparents talking about women who had the guts to do what needed to be done.\u201d\n\nSaid honoree Risha Grant: \u201cWomen have always been expected to stay calm, be passive and act ladylike, but in my experience those women who have truly made a difference have shown courage, not been afraid to speak up and are passionate. Ultimately, they have raised hell and made a difference. I have always admired women like this, and I am honored to be considered one of them.\u201d\n\nAmong the honorees is Tulsa World managing editor Susan Ellerbach, who later this year will become the newspaper\u2019s first female executive editor.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of people I admire whom I consider to have \u2018moxie,\u2019 it\u2019s because they have courage,\u201d Ellerbach said. \u201cTheir concern isn\u2019t of what others might think of them or what\u2019s in it for them, but rather how they can accomplish a goal for the betterment of the community as a whole. They take a positive approach and proceed with enthusiasm where others may fear to go.\u201d\n\nTulsa World Opinion Associate Editor Julie DelCour also was among the 100 women selected. DelCour joined the World staff in 1977 and moved to Opinion in 1998. She has received numerous honors and covered various high-profile news events, including the three-year investigation and trials of Oklahoma City bombing conspirators Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.\n\nAn independent committee of community members gathered to review more than 200 nominations received.\n\nWomen from the past and present were chosen who exemplify the mission of the YWCA and share its core values. They must have had a connection to Tulsa through residence, work or volunteerism.\n\nAccording to a release that accompanies the list of 100 honorees, the committee looked for extraordinary women with a mix of exceptional qualities \u2014 plus that \u201cspecial something.\u201d The committee paid special attention to honoring a wide variety of women of different eras, ages, races and ethnicities, sexual and gender identities, and class and experience backgrounds.
