â€” Two Wake Forest police officers have been cleared in a May shooting that left a Raleigh man dead.

Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said in a Monday letter to the State Bureau of Investigation, which investigated the May 6 shooting of David William Johnson, that she had reviewed their findings and determined "the matter does not warrant prosecution or further criminal investigation."

Raleigh police requested assistance regarding the discharge of a stolen firearm, and Wake Forest police officers David Cohen and Darryl Ragland confronted Johnson, 18, on Stone Monument Drive, off South Main Street. Johnson fled in a vehicle but crashed it about a quarter-mile away behind The Factory entertainment complex, police said.

Police said Johnson refused to comply with repeated demands to drop a handgun, prompting Cohen and Ragland to shoot him. He died several hours later at WakeMed in Raleigh.

Both officers spent several weeks on paid administrative leave while the SBI investigated the shooting but have since returned to normal duty.
