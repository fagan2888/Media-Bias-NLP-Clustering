It\u2019s a city that is growing quickly, whose livability is being enhanced \u2014 by the week, by the month. It\u2019s a place that has always been somewhere people of different ages, perspectives, backgrounds, religions have been able to come together well, work together well, and create just a splendid city. More and more these days people are taking notice of San Antonio as a community on the move.\n\n2. How does the AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities program fit with your \"SA 2020\" initiative, which asked San Antonio\u2019s residents to help set goals for what the city should be like by 2020.\n\nSA 2020 is all about a vision for a very livable city, to make San Antonio a lively city and a place that is welcoming and comfortable for everyone. The age-friendly initiative fits perfectly with that because it\u2019s about ensuring we don\u2019t just focus on one age group, but that we focus on all age groups, particularly seniors as they get older to ensure that San Antonio will offer them a fantastic quality of life.\n\n3. Why are older San Antonians important to the city?\n\nParticularly in a city like San Antonio that is such a Hispanic city \u2014 63 percent is Hispanic \u2014 there\u2019s an inveterate respect for elders in the Hispanic community and the growing community that is 50-plus. It\u2019s a great fit for an age-friendly agenda in a place like San Antonio. We know that just as our future is tied to folks who are sitting in a classroom right now, our future is also tied to the health and well-being of people who are turning 50, and older, and still have a long life to live and a lot to give to the community.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "5 Questions for Julian Castro", "estimated_publish_date": "2014-05-23", "Last-Modified": "2015-03-14T04:27:41.276-04:00", "keywords": "julian castro, san antonio, texas, mayor, joaquin castro, age-friendly, SA2020, secretary, housing and urban development", "paywallStatus": "off", "livefyreId": "350119:http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/interview-julian-castro-san-antonio-mayor.html", "author": "Rafael Ayuso", "lfdataConfig": "{\"globalConfig\":{\"network\":\"aarp.fyre.co\"},\"livefyreConfig\":[{\"collectionMeta\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LmFhcnAub3JnL2xpdmFibGUtY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvaW5mby0yMDE0L2ludGVydmlldy1qdWxpYW4tY2FzdHJvLXNhbi1hbnRvbmlvLW1heW9yLmh0bWwiLCJ0aXRsZSI6IjUgUXVlc3Rpb25zIGZvciBKdWxpYW4gQ2FzdHJvIiwidXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL3d3dy5hYXJwLm9yZy9saXZhYmxlLWNvbW11bml0aWVzL2luZm8tMjAxNC9pbnRlcnZpZXctanVsaWFuLWNhc3Ryby1zYW4tYW50b25pby1tYXlvci5odG1sIiwidGFncyI6IiIsImNoZWNrc3VtIjoiZDE5MWMxYmU4NmQ5MmMyZDdiMjcwNmIzODMyNmE4NWIiLCJ0eXBlIjoibGl2ZWNvbW1lbnRzIn0.2TBgOAnYNIPLokCw9uGWHUuMqQKeVNa4p1GLEQVE7Uw\",\"checksum\":\"d191c1be86d92c2d7b2706b38326a85b\",\"siteId\":\"350139\",\"articleId\":\"http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/interview-julian-castro-san-antonio-mayor.html\",\"el\":\"livefyreConversation\",\"disableAvatars\":true,\"postToButtons\":[\"tw\",\"fb\"]}]}", "source": "livable_communities", "type": "info", "description": "AARP visits with Julian Castro, mayor of San Antonio, to talk about creating an age-friendly city.", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "Division:Livable Communities", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "Subject3": "DCSubjects:Travel/Domestic Travel", "viewport": "width=device-width", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "AARP visits with Julian Castro, mayor of San Antonio, to talk about creating an age-friendly city.", "title": "Interview with Julian Castro, Mayor of San Antonio, HUD Secretary Nominee - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/interview-julian-castro-san-antonio-mayor.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/home-and-family/livable-communities/2014-05/120-castro-julian-five-questions.imgcache.rev1401369088762.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarp/en/home/livable-communities/info-2014/interview-julian-castro-san-antonio-mayor", "mcafeesecure-site-verification": "fa79d1a3c2770869e1286a81816d01a4", "Subject2": "Locations:Texas", "IALevel1": "livable-communities", "IALevel2": "info-2014", "s43": "7.StayinHome|MyFinancialSecurity", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-24"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe42c6\"", "article_summary": "More and more these days people are taking notice of San Antonio as a community on the move.\nThe San Antonio story in this 21st century is of a city on the rise.\nIt\u2019s a great fit for an age-friendly agenda in a place like San Antonio.\nParticularly in a city like San Antonio that is such a Hispanic city \u2014 63 percent is Hispanic \u2014 there\u2019s an inveterate respect for elders in the Hispanic community and the growing community that is 50-plus.\nSA 2020 is all about a vision for a very livable city, to make San Antonio a lively city and a place that is welcoming and comfortable for everyone."}
