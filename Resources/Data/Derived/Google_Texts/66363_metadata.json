These systems add water and bleach to dangerous chemicals, converting them into an inert liquid byproduct.\n\nThough this process has never been carried out at sea, the officials said hydrolysis is \"a proven technology\" that will result in \"a very low risk operation.\"\n\nAbout 100 personnel will be aboard the ship, 60 of them Defense Department civilians working with the hydrolysis systems, officials said. The rest will include security contractors and OPCW inspectors to verify that the chemicals are being neutralized.\n\nThe Cape Ray will undergo sea trials in a few weeks so the hydrolysis systems can undergo operational testing, officials said, with the expectation that it will be ready to sail in January. However, there are still gaps in the OPCW's plans for where the neutralization of the Syrian chemicals will actually take place.\n\nThe OPCW's timeline calls for the 500 metric tons of \"priority one\" chemicals to be removed from Syria by Dec. 31. An additional 800 metric tons of less dangerous chemical precursors will be destroyed by one of 35 companies that have bid for the contract, officials said.\n\nThe \"priority one\" chemicals will be taken to the Syrian port of Latakia for loading onto about 150 shipping containers to be placed onto a ship from an as-yet undetermined country, officials said.\n\nIt remains unclear where the Cape Ray would pick up the containers as the OPCW has yet to find a host country willing to allow one of its ports to be used for the transfer of the chemicals.\n\nOnce a port is chosen, a transfer of the chemicals onto the Cape Ray could be completed within 48 hours, officials estimated. The vessel would then depart for an undetermined off-shore location, where the hydrolysis could begin.\n\nThe \"effluent\" by-product will not be dumped into the ocean, but would be stored aboard the ship until a commercial company is selected to dispose of the by-product either through incineration or some other means, officials said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "US Prepares to Destroy Syrian Chemical Weapons", "description": "US Prepares to Destroy Syrian Chemical Weapons", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/12/us-prepares-to-destroy-syrian-chemical-weapons-at-sea/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "A U.S. cargo ship equipped with special gear could neutralize the chemicals.", "title": "US Prepares to Destroy Syrian Chemical Weapons"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "at sea, chemical weapons, hdyrolysis, opcw, pentagon, ship, syria, tons, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8509\"", "article_summary": "A U.S. cargo vessel equipped with special gear could be neutralizing some of Syria's most dangerous chemical weapons at sea come January.\nAbout 100 personnel will be aboard the ship, 60 of them Defense Department civilians working with the hydrolysis systems, officials said.\nNo final decisions have been made yet by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), but it appears increasingly likely that the agency will accept an offer from the United States to destroy the dangerous chemicals at sea.\nThese systems add water and bleach to dangerous chemicals, converting them into an inert liquid byproduct.\nAn additional 800 metric tons of less dangerous chemical precursors will be destroyed by one of 35 companies that have bid for the contract, officials said."}
