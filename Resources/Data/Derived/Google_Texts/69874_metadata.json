Scoring was spread from the first line to the fourth.\n\nBut at the same time, first-line center Nathan MacKinnon suffered through a goal-scoring drought that still exists, and he and his wingers were held without a goal the past three games.\n\nTime for a change. The Nine Line \u2014 coined from the sweater numbers of Gabe Landeskog (92), MacKinnon (29) and Matt Duchene (9) \u2014 was not intact in Saturday\u2019s practice and is not expected to surface in Sunday\u2019s game against the Arizona Coyotes at the Pepsi Center.\n\nMacKinnon and John Mitchell have traded spots, with Mitchell now between Landeskog and Duchene and MacKinnon with 30-somethings Alex Tanguay and Jarome Iginla. MacKinnon might get fewer even-strength minutes but will continue to play with Duchene and Landeskog on the power play.\n\n\u201cWe were together for two months, and we\u2019ve played really well,\u201d MacKinnon said of the Nine Line. \u201cIt\u2019s a long season, and we\u2019re not even at the halfway point yet. There\u2019s a lot of hockey left, and I\u2019m sure those guys will be at my wings at some point. But right now, we all hope this works.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon, a natural goal-scorer, hasn\u2019t scored in 13 consecutive games. Landeskog has just three goals in 12 games, and Duchene \u2014 who was the NHL\u2019s top goal producer in November \u2014 has just five in his past 13.\n\n\u201cChemistry comes and goes, and you gotta get a jolt every now and then, and I think that\u2019s kind of what Patty\u2019s trying to do,\u201d Duchene said of coach Patrick Roy\u2019s line changes. \u201cIf all of us get back to the foundations of our games within those lines, it will be a good thing.\u201d\n\nRoy is hoping the unchanged lines continued to produce. The newcomers line \u2014 center Carl Soderberg and wingers Blake Comeau and Andreas Martinsen \u2014 and the Cody McLeod-Mikhail Grigorenko-Jack Skille trio have been fantastic.\n\nThe Avs returned from a four-day Christmas break Saturday and practiced longer and harder than normal.\n\n\u201cThat was a good one,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cThe harder you push it the first day back, the better you feel. It should come back quick for us.\u201d\n\nARIZONA AT COLORADO 6 p.m. Sunday, ALT2; 104.3 FM\n\nSpotlight on Anthony Duclair:\n\nA year ago, Duclair and teammate Max Domi \u2014 Arizona\u2019s leading scorer \u2014 were playing for Canada at the World Junior Championship. They won the gold medal together and now are major pieces in Arizona\u2019s bright future. Duclair, 20, has 10 goals, tied with Domi for second among the Coyotes, and has a plus-3 rating, tied for the team high. Duclair was drafted by the New York Rangers in 2013 but acquired by Arizona in the Keith Yandle trade in March.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nCOYOTES: They hosted the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday, and Sunday\u2019s game will be their only road contest in a nine-game stretch. They began 4-1 on the homestand, including a 3-2 victory against Toronto on Tuesday. \u2026 Arizona defeated Colorado 4-2 on Nov. 5 in the desert. Defenseman Nicklas Grossman scored two goals for the Coyotes; he has only three this season. \u2026 Arizona\u2019s 34 points are just one fewer than the Avalanche, but the Coyotes are minus-14 in goals for, goals against. Colorado is plus-2. \u2026 Arizona is 7-10-1 on the road.\n\nAVALANCHE: Defenseman Nate Guenin was diagnosed with a concussion after Monday\u2019s game against Toronto but has passed tests and said he felt fine after Saturday\u2019s practice. But he is not scheduled to play against the Coyotes, with former Arizona defenseman Brandon Gormley taking his place on the third pairing with Zach Redmond. \u2026 Semyon Varlamov will start in goal Sunday. Calvin Pickard is the scheduled starter Monday at San Jose. Pickard is 9-8 with a 2.75 goals-against average and .917 save percentage for San Antonio of the American Hockey League.
