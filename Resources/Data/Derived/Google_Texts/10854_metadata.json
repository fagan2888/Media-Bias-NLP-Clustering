The plan promises lower monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs for patients by shifting away from a \"fee-for-service\" model and rewarding doctors based on a series of health quality measurements.\n\nThat all makes the plan parallel many of the priorities set by the Affordable Care Act and the Obama Administration, yet many New Jersey Democrats are crying foul.\n\nState lawmakers say Horizon drew up the plan behind closed doors with no transparency, and that the plan will lead to hospital closures across the state for hospitals who aren't included in OMNIA's top tier of providers.\n\n\"For the doctors and hospitals left outside of that tier, it's going to lead to a loss of patients because Horizon is so large,\" NJ Spotlight's healthcare writer, Andrew Kitchenman, told WNYC's Soterios Johnson. \"If it does lead to hospitals closing, then it could worsen access [to healthcare] for some patients.\"\n\nHorizon says concerns over OMNIA are a \"misunderstanding\" and that the plan does not present an immediate crisis for non-OMNIA providers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey's largest health insurer says its OMNIA plan will \"transform\" healthcare in the state.
