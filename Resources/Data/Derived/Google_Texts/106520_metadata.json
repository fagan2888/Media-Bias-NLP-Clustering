The law allows the state to submit an innovation waiver to the United States Health and Human Services and the U.S. Treasury requesting a waiver of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act that compromises the state\u2019s existing Prepaid Health Care Act.\n\nUnder the bill, the state is also allowed to implement the waiver after being approved by the federal government.\n\nIn addition, SB 2341 was signed into law. Act 14 relates to respiratory therapists and makes the licensure and regulation of the therapists permanent. It also creates a board for respiratory care.\n\n\u201cThere are 200,000 people with lung disease in Hawai\u2018i who need quality care,\u201d Governor Ige said in a release Monday afternoon. \u201cLicensing respiratory therapists will enable them to work outside of hospital settings such as hospices or community clinics.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis law will ensure that respiratory therapists practicing in Hawai\u2018i are held to the same high standards, guaranteeing quality of care for our people and building safer, healthier communities.\u201d\n\nThe third bill signed was SB 2934 SD2 \u2013 Act 15 in relation to driver licensing. The law allows the implementation of reciprocal driver\u2019s licenses with foreign jurisdictions. The Director of Transportation will be allowed to waive the written test for applicants with recognized licenses.\n\nAll driver\u2019s licenses will be required to have a photograph of the licensee.\n\n\u201cIn this modern age of cross border commerce and cooperation, this will be instrumental in increasing tourism and bolstering our economy by making it easier for visitors to drive throughout our state,\u201d said Senator J. Kalani English, who had been a supporter of the bill from his time as chair of the Senate Transportation committee. \u201cHawai\u2018i driver\u2019s license holders will also benefit from this Act by allowing our citizens traveling in foreign countries to be able to drive abroad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "description": "Governor David Ige signed three bills into law Monday.", "og": {"url": "http://bigislandnow.com/2016/04/25/governor-ige-signs-several-bills-in-law/", "type": "article", "image": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/governor-ige-signs-a-bill.jpg", "site_name": "Big Island Now  |  Governor Ige Signs Several Bills in Law", "title": "Big Island Now: Governor Ige Signs Several Bills in Law"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "theme-color": "#57ace2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/themes/BigIslandNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "governor david ige,ige,big island now,big island news,hawaii,hawaii news,laws,bills into laws,east hawaii news,news,north hawaii news,west hawaii news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2246\"", "article_summary": "Three bills were signed into law on Monday by Governor David Ige, including laws that involve the Affordable Care Act, Respiratory Therapists, and Driver Licensing.\n\u201cLicensing respiratory therapists will enable them to work outside of hospital settings such as hospices or community clinics.\n\u201cThere are 200,000 people with lung disease in Hawai\u2018i who need quality care,\u201d Governor Ige said in a release Monday afternoon.\nAct 14 relates to respiratory therapists and makes the licensure and regulation of the therapists permanent.\n\u201cHawai\u2018i driver\u2019s license holders will also benefit from this Act by allowing our citizens traveling in foreign countries to be able to drive abroad.\u201d"}
