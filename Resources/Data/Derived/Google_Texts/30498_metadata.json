That was at the root of trying to find value for our payment system,\u201d Galvin began.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that we\u2019re doing healthcare payment reform. People are arguing against the administration and asking how to accomplish this healthcare payment reform. As we expand upon new payment models, patients and consumers have seamless care and can see their doctors seamlessly while doctors are excited about seeing their patients and applying science and their compassion toward it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all working very hard at this. I want to talk about why the folks involved in payment reform should care what employers think. Benefit design is moving in a direction that isn\u2019t compatible with payment reform. Commercial payers are important [when it comes to benefit design],\u201d he clarified.\n\n\u201cWhy should any one provider care about the employers since they never see employers and never hear about employers? \u2018Why should I care?\u2019 payers and providers consider,\u201d Galvin continued.\n\n\u201cI think the reason to these questions is that we are the voice behind the insurers. It\u2019s really not their money that they\u2019re using. It\u2019s the employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 money that payers are using.\u201d\n\n\u201cPayers could innovate with GE or other major employers. [Medicare and federal agencies] have a theory of what they want to do and if it\u2019s not where you want to go, you can work with employers,\u201d explained Galvin.\n\n\u201cThrough employers is how the workers get all their benefits. It is how employees and their kids get benefits. However, in today\u2019s world, when kids turn 26 years old [and lose their parents\u2019 coverage under Obamacare], they\u2019re not happy [with the state of the health insurance market.]\u201d\n\n\u201cMany employees think \u2018What\u2019s in it for me?\u2019 The way employers are thinking about this is important. It\u2019s interesting \u2013 it is a very unique thing that the US has employers involved in [healthcare coverage and access].\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, employers are not in this because they love healthcare. They\u2019re in it because of great tax breaks and because of employee retention and recruitment,\u201d Dr. Galvin positioned.\n\n\u201cRecruitment and retention is real and becoming more needed as people become grow into a more skilled labor force. It is important because it is about employers,\u201d said Galvin. \u201cEmployers are powerful in a unique way \u2013 they are unified and they look for value for their dollar which is why we have the push toward value-based payment models.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmployers have a high level for policy. Employers are clearly powerful. For example, when it comes to the Cadillac tax, employers made an impact on its policy. And when it comes to managed care \u2013 where did that start? It began with employers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, health promotion and disease management did not generate from Medicare and Medicaid but from employers. With all of the positives I\u2019ve said, healthcare coverage is not imperative for employers. They don\u2019t think about healthcare all of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to remember that the vast number of employers. Around 95 percent have under a few hundred people employed. These are the ones by and large making the final opinion on healthcare payment reform,\u201d Galvin concluded.\n\nAs the medical industry innovates to pursue new payment models and work toward quality improvements among clinics and hospitals, it will be beneficial to have a multitude of stakeholders involved including payers, providers, federal agencies, state officials, the patient community, and employers.\n\nWhen providers and payers join together to form accountable care organizations, bundled payment programs, or beneficiary incentives, it will grow imperative to speak to the consumer base and the executives of small and mid-sized businesses, according to Dr. Robert Galvin.\n\nHealthcare payment reform will need to involve the participation of employers. Company leaders will need to have a seat at the table when health plans are putting together new benefit offerings or attempting to innovate into new payment models such as value-based care reimbursement or healthcare bundled payments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Robert Galvin, MBA, MD, CEO at Equity Healthcare, spoke at the HFMA National Payment Innovation Summit about employers and healthcare payment reform.", "author": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/healthcare-payment-reform-may-need-the-employer-perspective", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/stethoscope_money.jpg", "site_name": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "title": "Healthcare Payment Reform May Need the Employer Perspective"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Robert Galvin, MBA, MD, CEO at Equity Healthcare, spoke at the HFMA National Payment Innovation Summit about employers and healthcare payment reform.", "title": "Healthcare Payment Reform May Need the Employer Perspective", "image": {"src": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/stethoscope_money.jpg"}, "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "People are arguing against the administration and asking how to accomplish this healthcare payment reform.\nDr. Robert Galvin, MBA, MD, CEO at Equity Healthcare, spoke at the HFMA National Payment Innovation Summit about employers and healthcare payment reform within the medical industry.\nThese are the ones by and large making the final opinion on healthcare payment reform,\u201d Galvin concluded.\nHealthcare payment reform will need to involve the participation of employers.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that we\u2019re doing healthcare payment reform."}
