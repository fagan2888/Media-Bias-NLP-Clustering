Monday marks 60 years since a deadly tornado nearly wiped out a small Kansas town.

The storm killed 20 percent of the population of Udall.

Hundreds of people--both those who lived through the tornado and those who only know about it from the stories-- came together Monday afternoon for the special Memorial Day anniversary to honor the lives lost and celebrate how far the town has come since.

Emotions are still raw and memories are still vivid for many of the survivors.

"In some ways it feels like it was yesterday," said Patricia Kraus

"The wind blew terrible that day," said Robert Atkinson Jr.

"Just as we were getting to the cellar, it took the roof off the porch," said Carroll Walker.

The storm ripped through the town around 10:30 at night on May 25, 1955.

Four hundred buildings and houses were damaged or destroyed, 250 people were injured, 77 were killed.

Kraus says she knew every person who didn't make it.

She was 13-years-old when the twister flattened her home.

"Everything caved in on us. My mother was on top of my little sister, my dad was on top of my brother, and I was between them. And all I could hear her say was, 'my legs are broken, my legs are broken,'" Kraus said.

Kraus says her family was lucky to survive. Her father was Udall's mayor at the time, and it was his resilience she said that inspired the community to keep going.

"The morning after the tornado, several people came up to my dad and said, 'Toots where are you going to go?' And he said, 'I'm staying right here. I'm going to rebuild. This is home,'" Kraus said.

Kraus's dad has since passed away but she says his spirit lives on because of ceremonies like the one held Monday.

"I know my dad would be so proud," she said. "His dream was to build Udall back to be bigger and better than ever."
