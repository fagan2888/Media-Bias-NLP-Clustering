But a stroll down the street with the former Republican governor, now trying to get his old job back as a Democrat, exhibits Crist\u2019s strongest assets as a candidate.\n\n\n\nHe glad-hands with store owners, pedestrians and drivers stuck at a stop light. He poses for pictures. He asks about their jobs, their children and their hobbies. With a knitted brow, he listens to their stories. He writes down his cell phone number on the back of a business card if they say they need help. He makes them feel that they matter.\n\n\n\nFriends and foes agree Crist is the quintessential pol.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe is a consummate politician, particularly in the sense that most politicians are actors,\u201d said J.M. \u201cMac\u201d Stipanovich, a GOP consultant and lobbyist who has known Crist for 25 years and has supported him in every election \u2014 until now.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis social sensors are extremely highly developed. In any situation, he immediately knows the role he has to play in order to please. Then he plays that role flawlessly. It\u2019s intuitive. It\u2019s almost instantaneous. And then, knowing his audience, he knows exactly how to act out his role,\u201d Stipanovich said.\n\nThat Zelig-like quality has also made the Republican-turned-independent- turned-Democrat a subject of ridicule from critics, especially those at GOP headquarters.\n\n\n\nAt an event in his hometown of St. Petersburg where Crist formally announced he was entering the race for governor as a Democrat a year ago, Republican Party of Florida staffers handed out fans bearing Crist\u2019s visage on both sides.\n\n\u201cCharlie Crist is a fan of whatever you want him to be,\u201d the fans \u2014 blue on one side, red on the other \u2014 read. The gag was just a taste of a bitter battle waged over the past year by the Republican Party, whose leaders view Crist as an apostate. Incumbent Gov. Rick Scott, his backers and the party have reportedly planned to spend up to $100 million, as they paint Crist as an untrustworthy flip-flopper.\n\nLess than three weeks before the Nov. 4 election, the soft-spoken Crist, who often refers to himself as \u201ca live-and-let-live kind of guy,\u201d seemed unfazed by the assaults.\n\n\n\nIn an interview, Crist said he is confident he can defeat Scott \u201cby going to people in person and having the chance to reacquaint them with my heart and what I care about, which is them.\u201d\n\nAs witnessed during a sidewalk promenade or at one of the many black churches he\u2019s visited on Sundays for the past few months, Crist appears to genuinely enjoy something many politicians hate \u2014 campaigning.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nice that a person who\u2019s in politics actually likes people. He enjoys retail campaigning. He enjoys politics. He enjoys governing, but I think he enjoys politics as much as anything. I think it\u2019s refreshing when a guy actually likes to mix it up with his constituents,\u201d said Brian Ballard, an influential Republican lobbyist and fundraiser who once raised money for Crist and is now doing the same for Scott.\n\nCampaigning is an activity that Crist, who registered as a Democrat in 2012, has engaged in throughout his two decades in public office, even during the rare times when he wasn\u2019t seemingly running for office.\n\n\u201cCharlie Crist \u2014 a lifelong Republican, Reagan conservative \u2014 can go to a black church and preach with the appropriate cadence and applaud with the appropriate rhythm and be as tactile and as huggy as anyone in the building. He can drive across town and go to a Republican women\u2019s club and knock the ball out of the park just as easily. And would do both if he thought there were votes both places,\u201d Stipanovich said.\n\nA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, Crist started his two decade-long political career as a Republican when he was elected in 1992 to the Florida Senate, where he served six years before an unsuccessful bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Bob Graham.\n\nCrist then racked up a series of statewide victories, starting with a two-year stint as education commissioner, which became an appointed position two years after he won the seat. In 2002, Crist \u2014 a lawyer who flunked the Bar exam twice \u2014 was elected attorney general. Four years later, Crist sailed into the governor\u2019s office, defeating Democrat Jim Davis by a seven-point margin.\n\nHe never sought a second term as attorney general or governor, another point of ridicule for Crist critics.\n\nA bachelor during his first two years in the governor\u2019s mansion, \u201cThe People\u2019s Governor\u201d \u2014 a moniker Crist still clings to \u2014 could frequently be seen shopping at a nearby Publix supermarket, earplug-wearing bodyguards in tow. Carrying a green plastic basket, often filled with just Crist\u2019s trademark Red Bull and a pre-packaged salad, the governor would turn on the charm for the cashier, holding out his hand and introducing himself as \u201cCharlie.\u201d\n\nThe rail-thin Crist\u2019s eating habits \u2014 he eats but one meal a day \u2014 is also a source of ribbing, and of frustration for campaign workers and staff, who often go hungry on the campaign trail, and even, at one time, for the chef at the Governor\u2019s Mansion.\n\nCrist\u2019s culinary tastes are just one of the quirks drawing derision from detractors.\n\nAn avid fisherman who lives in a condominium overlooking the water in downtown St. Petersburg, Crist\u2019s George Hamilton-esque, golden-brown appearance earned him the nickname \u201cThe Tan Man.\u201d Crist \u2014 an admitted sun lover who once jetted around St. Petersburg in a yellow convertible Mustang \u2014 laughs off the handle. He says his Greek heritage is responsible for his bronze look.\n\nThe ubiquitous miniature fan inevitably found at Crist\u2019s feet beneath the podium is another source of teasing. At a recent event in Panama City, Crist was cooled by not one but three fans as he delivered remarks to the NAACP\u2019s Florida conference.\n\nTan, fan and food aside, the most obvious target for critics is the decision by Crist, who reportedly made Republican presidential candidate John McCain\u2019s shortlist as a potential running-mate in 2008, to abandon the GOP in a quest for the U.S. Senate in 2010. Crist ran as an independent against Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek.\n\n\n\nWithout a party backing him, Crist earned 30 percent of the vote \u2014 10 percent more than Meek \u2014 but was handily outstripped by former state House Speaker Rubio, whose 49 percent victory sent him to Washington.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, Crist revealed his registration as a Democrat at a White House Christmas party, where he was accompanied by his wife, Carole.\n\n\n\nThe Crists were married in 2008 \u2014 Crist was also married briefly in his early 20s \u2014 at the Vinoy Renaissance Resort in the former governor\u2019s hometown, which he affectionately calls \u201cThe \u2018Burg.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince then, Crist has been fiercely protective of his wife, who periodically accompanies him on the campaign trail but who is reportedly a major, behind-the-scenes force.\n\n\n\nOne of the more memorable moments of the Crist wedding featured a boozy Jim Greer, hand-picked by Crist to chair the Republican Party of Florida, who took the stage to belt out several Elvis Presley songs. Greer later pleaded guilty to four counts of grand theft and one count of money laundering and served an 18-month prison sentence. In a salacious tell-all released this summer, Greer excoriated his former pal Crist as a backstabber who would do practically anything to climb to the top of the political heap.\n\n\n\nCrist maintains that he knew nothing of Greer\u2019s wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nCourting Florida Democrats for more than a year, Crist \u2014 a onetime \u201cReagan Republican\u201d who as a state senator sponsored legislation requiring inmates to serve 85 percent of their prison time and at one time embraced the nickname \u201cChain Gang Charlie\u201d \u2014 repeatedly invokes the mantra that \u201cI didn\u2019t leave my party, my party left me.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis memoir, released this summer, is titled \u201cThe Party\u2019s Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat.\u201d\n\n\n\nCrist points to his record bucking his own GOP as chief of state to demonstrate support for causes more aligned with his new party than the one he dumped.\n\n\n\nOne of his first actions as governor was to make it easier for convicted felons to get their rights restored, including the right to vote. He issued an executive order forcing polls to stay open later during the 2008 presidential election after reports of voters waiting in long lines to cast their ballots. He vetoed legislation that would have forced women to have ultrasounds before getting abortions, a measure later passed by the GOP-dominated Legislature and signed by Scott. In his final year in office, Crist inflamed Republicans when he axed a bill that would have done away with teacher tenure.\n\n\n\nThis year, Crist apologized to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community for his previous support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in Florida.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s made increased education funding and the environment two of his top campaign priorities.\n\n\u201cAll we need is somebody to lead with common sense again. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running. Who understands that everybody counts. That\u2019 we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Crist told hundreds of black activists in Panama City this month. \u201cIt really comes down to one word. Respect. It\u2019s about respect. \u2026 These things matter. What goes around is coming around. It\u2019s coming around in 24 days as long as we work hard and do what\u2019s right. We\u2019re going to finish strong.\u201d\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "charlie crist,homepage,rick scott,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/crist-scott-slider.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "Space Coast Daily is Brevard's own social community news platform with the latest in news, articles, events, obituaries and more.
