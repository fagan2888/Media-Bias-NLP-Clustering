Cuban estimates of that damage range from $121 billion to more than $300 billion.\n\nNeither side is eager to pay the full value, setting up a negotiation.\n\n\"The meeting is the first step in what we expect to be a long and complex process, but the United States views the resolution of outstanding claims as a top priority for normalization,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Monday.\n\nCuba nationalized all foreign businesses and reached settlements with owners from other countries. The government recognizes the U.S. claims but it cut off negotiations in response to the decision by former President Dwight Eisenhower to suspend Cuba's sugar quota in 1960.\n\nThe claims sat dormant for half a century as a result of the U.S.-Cuba estrangement, which ended a year a ago when U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced detente.\n\nMany of the nationalized companies no longer exist and individual claims have been passed to heirs.\n\nThe largest claim, by the Cuban Electric Company for more than $267 million, has changed hands several times due to mergers and acquisitions and is held by Office Depot, itself a takeover target of Staples Inc pending antitrust review.\n\nWith interest that claim is now worth more than $1 billion.\n\nOther major claimants include Starwood Hotels, Coca-Cola, the former International Telephone & Telegraph Co., now ITT Corp, and various oil, sugar and financial interests.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Trotta)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban and U.S.", "title": "U.S., Cuba to negotiate billions in claims against each other", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/07/US-Cuba-negotiate-billions-claims-against-each-other", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cuba-dailylife_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/07/US-Cuba-negotiate-billions-claims-against-each-other", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cuba-dailylife_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban and U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Those claims, registered with the U.S. Justice Department's Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, are now worth roughly $8 billion when including 6.0 percent annual interest.\nCuban law ties the settlement of the claims to U.S. reparations for damages resulting from the embargo and other acts of U.S. aggression against Cuba.\nSome 5,913 U.S. corporations and individuals have been awarded $1.9 billion worth of claims for factories, farms, homes and other assets that were nationalized in Cuba after Fidel Castro's rebels came to power on Jan. 1, 1959.\nThe claims sat dormant for half a century as a result of the U.S.-Cuba estrangement, which ended a year a ago when U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced detente.\nMany of the nationalized companies no longer exist and individual claims have been passed to heirs."}
