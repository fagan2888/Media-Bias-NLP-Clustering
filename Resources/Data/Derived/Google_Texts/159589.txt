U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard set a new World Cup record with 16 saves in Tuesday’s 2-1 loss to Belgium, and some well-deserved recognition on Wikipedia.

ADVERTISEMENT Belgium took 38 shots during the game, with 27 on goal. But they were only able to net two goals thanks to Howard’s record number of saves.

Fans on Twitter praised Howard’s skills and jokingly called for the goalkeeper to be vaulted to the top of the Pentagon in honor of his defensive prowess.

The altered Wikipedia page showed a picture of Howard diving for a ball.

“The current secretary of Defense is Tim Howard, who assumed office on February 27, 2013,” the page read, listing his “state of residence” as “heaven.”

Gradually, the site was edited back, and by 9 p.m. all traces of the prank were gone.

But on Twitter, the Howard hype continued, with some fans even calling for Howard to run for president in 2016.
