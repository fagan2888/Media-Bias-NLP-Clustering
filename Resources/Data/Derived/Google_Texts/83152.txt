Marco Rubio has formally announced that he is running for president in 2016, and while he pales in comparison to the crazy that is Ted Cruz, you can rest assured that Rubio still has plenty of terrible views in his arsenal.

As with Cruz, conservatives are expecting Rubio, who is Cuban-American, to bring in the Latino votes. Here are five reasons why that won’t happen.

He’s Not Very Popular With Them

Marco Rubio actually trails Jeb Bush by three points among Latinos. I guess it makes sense, though, when you consider that Jeb Bush miraculously became “Hispanic” when he declared himself one on his voter registration application in 2009.

He Flip-Flopped on Immigration

Immigration is a big deal to Latino voters. 81 percent think comprehensive immigration reform should be a priority for Congress next year. Rubio once had aspirations of fixing immigration, but has since fallen in line with more rightwing Republicans, whose support he needs in 2016.

He Doesn’t Believe in Climate Change

A whopping 86 percent of Latinos believe we are harming the planet for future generations, but Marco Rubio is on record saying he doesn’t think there’s science to justify that belief. This is an issue Latinos want to see addressed, but Rubio clearly doesn’t want to make it a major part of his platform.

He Wants to Repeal the Affordable Care Act

According to The Associated Press, Florida currently has the highest number of people buying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which Rubio voted to repeal. Only 25 percent of Latinos agreed with that move, and 61 percent want to keep it.

He’s Marco Rubio

The GOP is still struggling with the concept that Latinos won’t vote for someone just because they are of Latin descent. These polls demonstrate that Latinos care about the issues, and they feel strongly about having them addressed.

Marco Rubio is not up to that task.
