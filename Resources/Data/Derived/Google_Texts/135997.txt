Another candidate has dropped out of the race recently, and that means another edition of Hungry for Power Games on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. As Colbert sees it, Marco Rubio is more like Ru-bye-o. Such a segment is a far cry from Colbert previously saying the GOP needs to unite around Rubio.

Colbert doesn’t think very highly about any of the last remaining candidates. For as he pointed out, “they’re like the Beatles, except there are six of them and they’re all Ringo.”

Also part of the segment was a snuff box, with Colbert doing “a gram of Lindsey Graham,” because “nothing gets my blood pumping like the crushed dreams of failed candidates.”

Marco Rubio was referred to not only as “brave tribute” and a Florida Senator, but “boy whose birthday party your parents made you attend.”

To much laughter and applause, Colbert countered a line from Rubio in his concession speech that “there’s nothing more you could have done” with “well, you could have voted for him, but besides that, no.” He also referenced Rubio’s “string of third place victories.”

It was his “second place defeat in Florida,” which did him in. This is the Florida which “votes yes on Jimmy Buffett, yes on releasing pythons into toilets, on Marco Rubio, no thanks.”

Colbert also commented on Rubio’s support from the establishment, while likening him to Jeb Bush. On that note he asked the audience to “please clap, please clap, and now.”

About Trump moving that much closer to becoming the nominee, Colbert, in a nervous tone, tried to claim everything was still under control.

Towards the end the segment closed with some of Rubio’s insults about Donald Trump. On Rubio’s comment about Trump, “you know what they say about men with small hands,” Colbert responded with “they win Florida.”

Colbert did close with how Rubio, from District Thirsty, could still get the nomination, because “really, anything’s possible at this point.
