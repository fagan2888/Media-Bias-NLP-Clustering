An earlier version of this post incorrectly said St. Vincent bought a minority stake in the OrthoIndy practice, but the two organizations remain entirely separate.\n\nOrthoIndy is getting in the urgent care business.\n\n\n\nThe large practice of orthopedic surgeons is spending $3.8 million over three years to open seven urgent care clinics specializing in orthopedic-related injuries.\n\n\n\nFour of those will be enhancements of OrthoIndy\u2019s existing facilities in Brownsburg, Fishers, and the northwest and south sides of Indianapolis. Three of them will be new locations, probably in Westfield and Plainfield, and possibly downtown.\n\n\n\nThe idea is that patients who suffer an injury to their bones or joints might want more expertise in those areas than is typically available at most urgent care centers, but also might want to skip the sky-high bills that come from a visit to a hospital emergency room.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are so many people that have injuries and problems that are kind of in between,\u201d said Dr. John Dietz, a spine surgeon who chairs the OrthoIndy committee spearheading the urgent care expansion. \u201cThey\u2019re not bad enough for the emergency room, they can\u2019t see their primary care physician till Monday, and I [an orthopedic specialist] can\u2019t see them for three weeks.\u201d\n\n\n\nDietz also said the urgent care centers will help OrthoIndy deal with two big changes coming from health care reform.\n\n\n\nFirst, hospitals and doctors have consolidated, which means the hospitals encourage the physicians they now employ to refer patients inside their hospital network, rather than to independent providers such as OrthoIndy.\n\n\n\nAlso, OrthoIndy isn\u2019t entirely independent anymore. It sold a 20 percent stake in its Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital in 2009 to St. Vincent Health, which ultimately led to a reduction in OrthoIndy\u2019s relationship with the competing Indiana University Health hospital system.\n\n\n\nOrthoIndy already gets more than half its patients via self-referral. And it continues to get referrals from physicians in multiple hospital systems. But with hospital systems increasingly hiring their own orthopedic surgeons, Dietz said, OrthoIndy can\u2019t be sure that will continue forever.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve actually seen a substantial decline in primary care physicians referring to us,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you look over the horizon, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe second factor is that patients have more and more decision-making power in health care. This comes from the proliferation of high-deductible health plans, which have 49 percent of Hoosiers with employer-sponsored insurance shouldering deductibles of at least $2,500.\n\n\n\nThose plans have grown steadily in prevalence since Congress granted them tax-favored status in 2003. But their growth has also been spurred by employers' trying to keep their health plans from triggering Obamacare\u2019s Cadillac tax, which will kick in in 2018. Also, high-deductible plans dominate on the Obamacare\u2019s health insurance exchanges for individuals and small businesses.\n\n\n\nThose factors have driven growth in urgent care of all types. For example, IU Health is working to open 12 urgent care centers around the city this year and next.\n\n\n\nIn orthopedics, Methodist Sports Medicine offers a walk-in clinic at its Carmel location from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., Monday through Saturday. Methodist Sports Medicine, which has a partnership with IU Health but is separate from it, touts that patients can see a physician on every visit.\n\n\n\nBut OrthoIndy\u2019s approach to urgent care will rely on physician assistants and non-surgical physicians.\n\n\n\nOrthoIndy created a training program about a year ago to help physician assistants with an interest in orthopedics be able to diagnose patients\u2019 problems quickly, either treating them immediately, calling in the appropriate physician specialist to handle it, or recognizing that it\u2019s more serious and requires a trip to the ER.\n\n\n\nTo back up the 12 physician assistants who are staffing the four urgent care centers now, OrthoIndy hired Dr. James Jagger, the former team physician to the University of Kentucky men\u2019s basketball program. Jagger, whose career began as an ER doctor at Methodist Hospital, might even bring on additional physicians with similar skills, if patient volume demands it.\n\n\n\nDietz said that was the biggest hurdle for OrthoIndy\u2019s leaders\u2014to get comfortable with the idea that they could deliver the same level of quality in their care that has built the OrthoIndy brand over the past 50 years. He said he\u2019s now confident they can.\n\n\n\n\u201cReally, the most valuable thing about this group is the relationships with the families in the communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we get people in to OrthoIndy, we tend to keep them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Because of changes coming from health care reform, OrthoIndy felt it needed a new front door.
