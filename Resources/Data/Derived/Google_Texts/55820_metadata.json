To answer these questions, journalist, activist and political commentator Phyllis Bennis connects the dots between the fall of Iraq, the U.S. \u201cWar on Terror,\u201d and oil.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 ISIS is not a guerrilla organization that popped up out of nowhere, figured out how to hold onto territory, and take on the Iraqi and Syrian armies all by themselves, says Phyllis Bennis, director of the New Internationalism Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive multi-issue think tank in Washington.\n\nISIS is powerful, she argues, because the group enjoys political and military support from the Sunni communities in Iraq that were left defenseless against the Shiite-dominated government the United States put into power following its occupation of Iraq in 2003.\n\n\u201cThe Sunni, who are a large minority, around 20 to 25 percent, have been kind of isolated from any kind of access not only to major power but to any part of [Iraqi] society,\u201d Bennis said in July at Busboys and Poets, a restaurant and community organizing spot in Washington.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a great deal of antagonism towards the government, and for a lot of people there\u2019s a sense of, \u2018Look I don\u2019t like these guys, but maybe they can be the one force that can fight back,\u2019\u201d she said during a discussion of her new book, \u201cUnderstanding ISIS and the New Global War on Terror: A Primer,\u201d which asks and addresses basic questions about ISIS and the U.S. \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d\n\nAs MintPress News reported in a February analysis of the terrorist group, ISIS emerged as one of a number of Sunni organizations fighting the American occupation of Iraq.\n\nHowever, in 2008 al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), as it was then known, was in a state of \u201cextraordinary crisis\u201d as a result of Sunni tribes joining coalition forces during the Anbar Awakening movement.\n\nIt was reported in April 2010 that AQI\u2019s top leaders, Abu Ayyub al-Masri and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, were killed by U.S. troops.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who had been radicalized while imprisoned in Camp Bucca, a U.S. prison in Iraq, was appointed the new leader of the group the following month. It is at this point that Bennis launches into her exploration of the group\u2019s power.\n\nA diversified economy\n\nIllustrating Phyllis Bennis\u2019 point that ISIS has the support of former state officials, is that, unlike al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, ISIS gets its funds not only from donations from abroad, but from a diversified economy.\n\nGeorge Kiourktsoglou, visiting lecturer at the University of Greenwich in London, told MintPress that the group represents the next evolutionary step in global jihadism. While al-Qaida was primarily funded by donors, he said, \u201cISIS is a different beast.\u201d\n\n\u201cISIS does receive donations, but it\u2019s practically a syndicate of crime bankrolling an ideology, smuggling crude oil, antiquities, human trafficking, weapons trafficking, extortion, everything you can think of,\u201d Kiourktsoglou explained, emphasizing that ISIS\u2019 economic strength comes from a variety of sources.\n\nKiourktsoglou and his colleague Alec D. Coutroubis, principal lecturer at the University of Greenwich, wrote \u201dISIS Export Gateway to Global Crude Oil Markets,\u201d a paper about one source of ISIS\u2019 funding, smuggled oil, which is possibly being sold on the global market.\n\nTheir research into ISIS\u2019 oil smuggling took place between July 2014 and February 2015. They looked into the extraction, transportation, and sales of oil on the black market by the terrorist group.\n\nThey found that ISIS, in the best-case scenario, is selling about 30,000 barrels of oil a day. At current market rates of approximately $50 a barrel, that equals roughly $1.65 million daily, though it is widely believed that ISIS sells oil below market rates.\n\nAdditionally, they report that oil exports from Ceyhan, Turkey, routinely spike whenever ISIS is fighting in an area that holds oil assets. Kiourktsoglou and Coutroubis wrote: \u201cThis may be attributed to an extra boost given to crude oil smuggling with the aim of immediately generating additional funds, badly needed for the supply of ammunition and military equipment.\u201d\n\nAl-Baghdadi and former Baath Party military support\n\nIn March, MintPress was in Lebanon, where we spoke with Ali Hashem, who had recently finished an investigative documentary about ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Hashem is the chief correspondent for Al Mayadeen, a pan-Arab news channel based in Beirut, and his investigation backed up Phyllis Bennis\u2019 claims.\n\nHe described al-Baghdadi\u2019s ascent to power as linear and logical. He also said that his investigation runs contrary to conspiratorial theories surrounding the organization that involve the U.S. and Israel. Facts, he said, do not support those claims.\n\n\u201cPeople, especially in the Middle East, do not want to believe they have such people among them,\u201d Hashem told MintPress. \u201cThey always want to blame it on the West or on Israel.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Washington in July, Bennis also explained that ISIS gets massive military support from Saddam Hussein\u2019s disbanded army generals, who the U.S. dismissed from their positions upon occupying the country in 2003.\n\nIn a process known as \u201cde-Baathification,\u201d the U.S. fired everybody in the military and the civil service, she explained.\n\n\u201cAll of these people were sent home with no job, no money, [and] no way to support their family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what happens, they\u2019ve been waiting for 10 years or more to figure out a way to get back at this government that they hate, and they have become the military leaders of ISIS.\u201d\n\nIndeed, almost all of ISIS\u2019 top leadership are former Iraqi officers, according to Ahmed S. Hashim, associate professor of Strategic Studies and deputy coordinator in the Military Studies Program at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nIn a December 2014 policy paper, he wrote: \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi thus allowed Iraqis, mostly from the military and security establishments of the former Ba\u2019thist regime, to fill in the top layers of ISIS and then of the IS.\u201d\n\nLikewise, an investigative report by The Independent in April explained that Baghdadi spearheaded the initiative to revive ISIS by recruiting former Baath party officials.\n\nThe newspaper reported: \u201cTasked with rebuilding the greatly weakened insurgent organization after 2010, Baghdadi embarked on an aggressive campaign to woo the former officers, drawing on the vast pool of men who had either remained unemployed or had joined other, less extremist insurgent groups.\u201d\n\nDiscrimination against Sunnis\n\nPhyllis Bennis told the audience at Busboys and Poets that it\u2019s important to note that the Iraqi government does not simply discriminate against the Sunni minority and privilege the Shiite majority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that their discrimination against Sunnis has been so profound that it included mass killings in the streets, the bombing of a Sunni protest camp killing who knows how many people, [and] the arrest on a massive scale of Sunni activists of various sorts,\u201d she said, emphasizing that people have been suffering enormously at the hands of the government.\n\nIn 2014, then-Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki was forced out of office because of his radical opposition to Sunnis, as well as many of the human rights violations mentioned by Bennis. With the support of both the U.S. and Iran, Haider al-Abadi took over as prime minister. But, according to Bennis, he\u2019s not much different than his predecessor.\n\n\u201cThe new prime minister sort of talks a much better talk than his predecessor,\u201d Bennis said. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t walk the walk,\u201d she asserted, signaling that the reshuffling of Iraq\u2019s government won\u2019t make much difference to Sunnis who support ISIS out of a sense of desperation.\n\nInstitutionalized sectarianism in Iraq\n\nThe extreme sectarianism that poisons Iraq, Phyllis Bennis argues, is the result of the American occupation and its institution of a sect-based political system.\n\nReferring to the Americans, she said: \u201cThey created a whole new political system that was based on new parties that were established not on the basis of people that had different ideas or something, but based on the basis of religious identity, sectarian identity.\u201d\n\nParties were set up to represent \u201cthe Sunnis\u201d and \u201cthe Shiites,\u201d as if all Sunnis or all Shiites have one interest, or as if class and other issues are of little consequence.\n\n\u201cWhat it did was to institutionalize a level of sectarianism in Iraq that had not been a feature of Iraqi society for a century,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s shocking that \u2026 what the U.S. puts into place is designed to divide people along sectarian lines.\u201d\n\nAnd it is precisely this political system that has led to the rise of ISIS, Bennis says. In February, she described to MintPress that three important constituencies in Iraq support ISIS, contributing to the group\u2019s rise and empowerment. The first group is made up of Sunni generals, who lost their jobs; the second is Sunni tribal leaders, who are also angry about sectarianism; and the third is ordinary Sunnis, who are upset by ethnic cleansing, mass arrests, and neglect of basic services, such as electricity, in their communities.\n\nAmerican hegemony in the Middle East\n\nAs far as the U.S. is concerned, Phyllis Bennis told the audience at Busboys and Poets, conflict in the Middle East is not so much about who wins and who loses, it\u2019s about how to maintain the United States\u2019 position as a global superpower.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is supporting the Shia government in Iraq, and opposing the Shia Alawite government in Damascus,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does that mean? How does that work?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s confusing, she says, because it\u2019s not really about which faction or which sect is in power in any particular place, it\u2019s about maintaining U.S. power.\n\n\u201cThe Middle East is the one part of the world where if you control the territory you can attack three continents. You can go after Africa, you can go after Asia, you can go after Europe from that very strategic place,\u201d she said.\n\nReferring to Syria, Iraq and Yemen, she urges vigilant thinking about the situations in those countries, which she says are more than civil wars between the government and opposition forces.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of ways in which the wars that are being fought right now have far less to do with the people of Syria, the people of Iraq, [and] the people of Saudi Arabia, than it does about elites fighting it out,\u201d Bennis said.\n\nShe gave as an example that part of what\u2019s going on in Syria relates to a conflict between the U.S. and Russia over the control of sea lanes and naval bases.\n\nDisarming the US and its allies\n\nIn order to figure out what can be done not only to stop ISIS but also U.S. militarism in the Middle East and all over the world, Phyllis Bennis urges that people ask one critical question: \u201cWho benefits?\u201d\n\nThe answer, according to Bennis, is the CEOs of the corporations that produce the bullets, the bombers, the planes, the drones and the bombs that are used in these wars.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making a killing, literally,\u201d commented Andy Shallal, the moderator of last month\u2019s discussion and owner of Busboys and Poets.\n\nAccording to an Institute for Policy Studies study of war profiteers between the years of 2001 and 2004, following the onset of the Iraq War, CEOs at defense manufacturers in the U.S. raked in a 200-percent pay raise while their counterparts at average large companies averaged 7 percent.\n\nOne CEO, David H. Brooks of DHB Industries, got a 3,349-percent pay raise between those years, when the company was manufacturing what were supposed to be bulletproof vests for American troops. His pay in 2004 was $70 million.\n\n\u201cSome might argue that Brooks is worth every penny if his products are saving lives in Iraq. But in May, the Marine Corps recalled 5,277 DHB Interceptor armored vests after questions were raised about the vests\u2019 ability to stop 9-mm pistol rounds. By that time, Brooks had personally pocketed $250 million-plus in war windfalls,\u201d wrote Sarah Anderson, the author of the IPS report.\n\nBrooks has since been sentenced to 17 years in prison for insider trading, fraud, lying to auditors, and obstruction of justice.\n\nBennis says it is the war profiteers who work for Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and other defense contractors who need to be called out. They need to be \u201cnamed and shamed,\u201d she urged.\n\nPeople need to call Congress, she says, but first and foremost there needs to be outreach to the mainstream public to educate everyday citizens about what\u2019s really going on.\n\n\u201cThat means we have to be writing letters to the editor, calling into radio talk shows, doing all the stuff that you think, \u2018Oh my God, do I have to do that again?\u2019 The answer is, yes you do,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have to reach people in the schools,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe need to change the curriculum of how our children are educated so they grow up looking at what role the U.S. could play as a bastion of disarmament, not just non-proliferation, starting with our own arms, our own disarmament.\u201d\n\nDisarming ISIS\n\nAs far as disarming ISIS and creating a more stable situation in the Middle East overall, Phyllis Bennis argues that Washington has to take to heart the Hippocratic Oath, which states, \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama said last year: \u201cThere is no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq.\u201d\n\nReferring to this statement, Bennis says the U.S. should make good on this claim and stop trying to find military solutions to the problems in the Middle East. She argues that the U.S. should withdraw the troops, stop the drones, and put an end to everything that\u2019s killing and antagonizing people in the region.\n\nThe U.S. also needs to return to diplomacy, she says. While that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean talking to ISIS, it means talking to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Turkey, and everyone else who is allied with the U.S. and selling weapons to various opposition forces, including ISIS and al-Qaida, she added.\n\n\u201cYou need to have serious negotiations with those people to say, \u2026 \u2018We need an arms embargo. We need to stop flooding the region with arms,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nIf that happens, she says, the U.S. can then go to Russia and Iran, and tell them to stop arming the Assad government in Syria. But until then, she concludes, the U.S. has no credibility when negotiating with those powers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What gave rise to ISIS and how is the group holding onto power?
