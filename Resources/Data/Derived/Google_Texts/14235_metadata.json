The telecast cuts from hole to hole, often joining a player just as he is about to hit a shot.\n\nThat timing is being upended for this year\u2019s U.S. Open, and new broadcaster Fox is imposing that on itself.\n\nAs part of its pitch to the USGA to wrest the event away from NBC, Fox promised innovation. Upon winning a 12-year-contract in August 2013, network executives found themselves in the unusual \u2014 but helpful \u2014 position of a very long lead-up before airing the tournament for the first time.\n\nA year and a half of planning has resulted in plenty of technological bells and whistles, though the executives behind them hope they don\u2019t come across as bells and whistles but soon leave golf fans wondering how they ever lived without them.\n\nThe gizmos include the Rangefinder, where the live shot of the golfer is overlaid with graphics showing how far he is from not just the hole but the bunkers. There is also the Shaded Green system, which creates virtual shadows to show the undulations. Cameras will capture the action from new angles \u2014 including drones \u2014 and glide up and down or alongside the course for shifting viewpoints.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about golf is it\u2019s a different canvas from a flat football field or a flat tennis court,\u201d said Mark Loomis, the coordinating producer of Fox\u2019s U.S. Open coverage.\n\nLoomis had previously produced 3-D coverage of the Masters, and while 3-D broadcasts of sports never took off, golf proved to be one of the best fits. The slope of the green, the distance to the hole \u2014 perspective that was lost in two dimensions \u2014 could suddenly be seen at home.\n\nTechnological add-ons now offer the chance to capture those details on a television screen. That Chambers Bay, site of this year\u2019s tournament, is such a new course could also make the gadgets and graphics especially useful because fans are so unfamiliar with it.\n\nIts layout is a good fit, too.\n\n\u201cChambers Bay has been a perfect starting point,\u201d Loomis said. \u201cThere are so many different ups and downs, twists and turns.\u201d\n\nMichael Davies, Fox Sports\u2019 senior vice president of field and technical operations, said that brainstorming new ideas started with the premise of \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if \u2026\u201d\n\nThe first hurdle was finding out if the items on the network\u2019s wish list could be accomplished by its vendors, said Zac Fields, Fox Sports\u2019 vice president of graphics and technology. But just because something was doable technically didn\u2019t mean it was feasible to use on a broadcast.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From drones to distances, Fox takes tech to US Open coverage", "title": "From drones to distances, Fox takes tech to US Open coverage", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From drones to distances, Fox takes tech to US Open coverage", "title": "From drones to distances, Fox takes tech to US Open coverage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/13/from_drones_to_distances_fox_takes_tech_to_us_open_coverage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/us-open-tv-tech-golf.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From drones to distances, Fox takes tech to US Open coverage", "title": "From drones to distances, Fox takes tech to US Open coverage", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/us-open-tv-tech-golf.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rachel Cohen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88c0\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsProducing a golf tournament has a certain rhythm to it.\nThat timing is being upended for this year\u2019s U.S. Open, and new broadcaster Fox is imposing that on itself.\nThe telecast cuts from hole to hole, often joining a player just as he is about to hit a shot.\nAs part of its pitch to the USGA to wrest the event away from NBC, Fox promised innovation.\nCameras will capture the action from new angles \u2014 including drones \u2014 and glide up and down or alongside the course for shifting viewpoints."}
