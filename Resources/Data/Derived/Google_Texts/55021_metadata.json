One that will give you an unbiased, no-spin comparison of candidate positions on key issues? That's what our Campus Election Engagement Project guide will give you! We are a national nonpartisan initiative working with college and university administrators, faculty, and student leaders to increase student participation in America's elections. For the 2014 elections we have created and distributed voter guides to campuses in more than 20 states so they can provide their communities with accurate information for informed voting. Because these guides have been so well received and are useful for all voting citizens who want to be better informed, we are also posting them here.\n\nWe developed our guides by analyzing information from trusted resources such as www.votesmart.org, www.ontheissues.org, www.ballotpedia.com, www.politifact.com, www.factcheck.org, www.vote411.org and from candidate websites, public debates and interviews, and statements in major media outlets. We also showed them to groups like campus Young Republicans and Young Democrats at the schools we work with to verify their fairness and lack of bias.\n\nSo here are the issue-by-issue stands for Pat Quinn, Bruce Rauner and Chad Grimm, with additional links at the bottom for each candidate if you'd like to dig deeper.\n\n----------\n\nEducation: Do you support increasing funding for K-12 education?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No\n\nGrimm: Unknown\n\nEducation: Do you support providing vouchers to parents to send their children to private schools with public money?\n\nQuinn: No\n\nRauner: Yes\n\nGrimm: Unknown\n\nEducation: Do you support increasing funding for higher education?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: Unknown\n\nGrimm: Unknown\n\nElections: Do you support requiring registered voters to present a photo-ID in order to vote?\n\nQuinn: No\n\nRauner: No\n\nGrimm: Unknown\n\nElections: Do you support increasing restrictions on campaign donations?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No\n\nGrimm: Yes\n\nEnvironment: Do you believe that human activity is a major factor contributing to climate change?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No. Has funded major think tanks that argue against human-caused climate change.\n\nGrimm: Unknown\n\nEnvironment: Do you support taking government action to limit the levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No\n\nGrimm: No\n\nEnvironment: Do you support government mandates and/or subsidies for renewable energy?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No. Does support oil and gas subsidies\n\nGrimm: Unknown\n\nGay Marriage: Do you support gay marriage?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No\n\nGrimm: Yes\n\nGun Control: Do you support enacting more restrictive gun control legislation?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No\n\nGrimm: No\n\nHealthcare: Do you support the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No\n\nGrimm: Unknown\n\nHealthcare: Should your state accept federal funds so Medicaid will cover people earning up to 138% of the federal poverty line?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: No\n\nGrimm: Unknown\n\nMarijuana: Do you support efforts to decriminalize and/or legalize marijuana?\n\nQuinn: Supports medical marijuana\n\nRauner: Supports medical marijuana\n\nGrimm: Yes\n\nMinimum Wage: Do you support raising the minimum wage?\n\nQuinn: Yes\n\nRauner: History of strong opposition shifting to current limited support.
