Gov. Chris Christie owes a fellow fantasy football league competitor $500, according to the New York Post's Page Six.

Citing sources, the report says Christie joined a fantasy league associated with the WFAN sports show "Boomer and Carton" and stiffed the league's winner, Broadway actor Constantine Maroulis.

A former American Idol star, Maroulis is a fellow Jersey native who grew up in Wyckoff.

Maroulis was suppose to win $6,000 but walked away with only $2,000 after several league members failed to pay up their share of the $500 buy-in, according to the report.

Christie was cited among "a group of deadbeat celebs" that included sports host and Verona native Jay Mohr, actor Robert Wuhl and Food Network star Bobby Flay.

The only famous person who made good on their word and paid up was "Entourage" actor Kevin Connolly, the report said.

Christie previously talked about joining the fantasy league organized by Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton and said "Aaron Rodgers (of the Green Bay Packers) is my quarterback in that league."

The fantasy league ended on the Super Bowl, just two days after the Republican governor came under intensified scrutiny for the George Washington Bridge scandal after ex-Christie ally David Wildstein's attorney said in a letter that "evidence exists" tying Christie to knowledge of the lane closures as massive traffic jams snarled Fort Lee.
