In the same election, 20 percent of 18- to 29-year-old voters actually voted. This was the worst voter turnout in 72 years, it said, and the lowest turnout for young voters on record.\n\n\u201cGenerally, right now, there is definitely a lack of interest and excitement, especially among young people, in politics,\u201d Brandon Klugman, an American University senior who is Vote16USA campaign coordinator, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u2018Foolish Idea\u2019?\n\nOrganizers calculate that lowering the voting age would drive schools to approach civic education more effectively.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be lowering the voting age if we\u2019re not also teaching young people to participate,\u201d Warren said.\n\nThe movement is not without critics.\n\n\u201cThis is a foolish idea,\u201d said Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow for The Heritage Foundation, who manages the think tank\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative.\n\n\u201cSixteen- and 17-year-olds have neither the experience, the judgment, or the maturity to make decisions in the voting area,\u201d von Spakovsky said. He added:\n\nIf they [Generation Citizen] believe individuals that young are mature enough to make such decisions, then obviously that same group must also believe that the drinking age should be lowered to that age, and that the age at which folks can volunteer to join the military and fight for their country should also be lowered. If they don\u2019t agree to that, then their position makes no sense. If you are mature enough to vote, then you must be mature enough to make other decisions like this about drinking and military service.\n\nWarren said it\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope argument\u201d to compare the appropriate ages for driving, voting, military service, and so on.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that lowering the voting age to 16 makes sense, given the fact that we want more people to participate, given the fact that we want to educate young people to become citizens,\u201d the Generation Citizen leader said. \u201cFor me, this is really about how do we get young people excited about politics.\u201d\n\n\u2018A City Issue\u2019\n\nThe campaign to lower the voting age spread to San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and organizers are exploring other cities around the country.\n\n\u201cWe think that this is a city issue,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to be federal government telling states and cities what to do. We want cities to decide this on their own.\u201d\n\nWarren said 16- and 17-year-olds participating in local elections makes sense, but that he is not a \u201chuge fan\u201d of voters that age participating in federal elections.\n\n\u201cThere are 10 states where local cities can change their laws so that 16- and 17-year-olds can vote in local elections,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to pursue right now.\u201d\n\nGeneration Citizen has identified these 13 states as having cities that most feasibly could change their voting laws, usually through a city charter amendment: California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nVote16USA cites two Maryland towns, Takoma Park and Hyattsville, as examples of places that have lowered the local voting age to 16 in recent years.\n\nHeritage\u2019s von Spakovsky points out that Takoma Park is also a place that allows non-citizens to vote. \u201cIt is not an example I would urge anyone to follow,\u201d he said.\n\nThe voting age in the United States was lowered from 21 to 18 with ratification of the 26th Amendment in 1971.\n\nOne Family\u2019s Experience\n\n\u201cThe issues on the local and the state and the federal levels\u2014all those issues affect young kids,\u201d Darrell Beauchamp, a father of two, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThey can take an interest in those issues and learn about them without necessarily having to vote.\u201d\n\nBeauchamp\u2019s two children, ages 16 and 12, take a keen interest in politics. During summer vacation this past year, the family became actively involved in learning about the political process firsthand.\n\nThey\u2019ve traveled to see 17 senators, governors, and other politicians speak. On multiple occasions, they jumped in their car and logged over 330 miles from their hometown of Wales, Wis., to attend events all over Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of ways that people of any age can be engaged [in the political process.] \u2026 You don\u2019t have to vote just to be involved in it,\u201d Beauchamp said. \u201cI think my kids are a real good example of that.\u201d\n\nHaving some doubts about 16-year-olds voting, Beauchamp said he is in favor of keeping the voting age at 18:\n\nI would be concerned with it, just knowing where I was at when I was 16. Kids at that age are just so impressionable. I would be bothered by having kids that young voting. I think it raises some interesting issues for teachers, probably, too. If you get an unethical teacher, they might start trying to influence kids more in the classroom and try to directly influence their votes. I think it creates a lot of different problems and potential conflicts in that regard.\n\nBeauchamp\u2019s 16-year-old son, John, has a different opinion on the voting age.\n\n\u201cI think that the people who are really interested in politics, like me, should have some sort of say in this,\u201d John told The Daily Signal. \u201cBecause it\u2019s frustrating how we have to pay taxes and we get to work, but we can\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nJohn, who pays taxes on his wages as an employee of Goodwill, said he would like to be able to participate in local elections.\n\n\u201cI definitely am looking forward to being able to vote,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"What we\u2019re saying is that lowering the voting age to 16 makes sense given the fact that we want more people to participate,\" a leader of the effort says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"What we\u2019re saying is that lowering the voting age to 16 makes sense given the fact that we want more people to participate,\" a leader of the effort says.", "title": "Should 16-Year-Olds Vote?
