If passed, Amendment 69 will set ColoradoCare into motion.\n\nMr. Hudson\u2019s series ended with: \u201cMany hands make for light work. Pooling our healthcare resources together might be the right choice for Colorado.\u201d\n\nMr. Hudson also, on the same day as his series conclusion, posted a letter from Arden Buck of Nederland, in support of ColoradoCare. Mr. Buck of Boulder County has no physical or financial interest in Archuleta County. So now I wonder if the Pagosa Daily Post will become a magnet for the liberal pro-ColoradoCare Boulderites and other Front Rangers who are working tirelessly to change what used to be a Colorado that valued individual freedom, into the Socialist State of Colorado.\n\nWe can all agree that the current health care system is broken, and is largely driven by big insurance and big Pharma profits. But this social experiment, ColoradoCare, is too radical and has the capability to devastate the Colorado economy.\n\nAn acquaintance of mine \u2013 a successful businessman educated in economics \u2013 has stronger words for ColoradoCare:\n\n\u201cThis would be a disaster of epic proportions, and once in place would be almost impossible to dismantle.\u201d\n\nYou can download the full text of the amendment here.\n\nI had a conversation with Marilyn Bouldin, who apparently is the Salida public relations lead for ColoradoCare. In that position, one would think that she could answer my questions. She answered some, but couldn\u2019t answer all of them. Some of my questions have no answers, and won\u2019t until (and if) ColoradoCare (Amendment 69) is passed. This is reminiscent of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s infamous quote in support of ObamaCare, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that we can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy.\u201d\n\nI did learn from my conversation with Ms. Bouldin that, according to her numbers, between 15 \u2013 20 percent of Coloradans will end up paying more for their health care than they currently pay if Amendment 69 is passed.\n\nWho is in the group that will pay more \u2013 as much as $35,000 for individual coverage under ColoradoCare \u2013 so that every person who intends to reside in Colorado is granted equal health care? There is no U.S. citizenship requirement, or legal address requirement. An individual must only \u201cintend\u201d to reside in Colorado to become a beneficiary of ColoradoCare.\n\nIt\u2019s my hunch that two of the groups that will pay more are the comfortable retirees who decided to make Colorado their home and will now have to pay an additional 10% tax on all of their investment income, and the small businesses who don\u2019t pay health care insurance for their employees, but will now have to pay a new 6.67% payroll tax for ColoradoCare, plus an additional 10% of their individual income.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of wiggle room on the bottom line for many Colorado businesses. Colorado is tax-unfriendly to business, as though they are the enemy and not a driver of a thriving economy. For example, the commercial property tax rate is three times the residential property tax rate. ColoradoCare taxes just might tax many businesses out of existence.\n\nAnd how many retired Coloradans will enjoy the new mandatory 10% Premium Tax, making Colorado the state with the highest income tax rate (14.63 percent) in the nation. How will that impact retirement decisions by future retirees? Will they become second homeowners in Colorado instead of residents? Or invest elsewhere altogether?\n\nBut hold on to your wallet, because the new 10% Premium Tax to pay for ColoradoCare is just the starting point. Taxes may be raised annually as necessary and as approved by the voting majority that voted for ColoradoCare in the first place \u2013 if that is what the future holds for us.\n\nA week ago, when I first learned the skimpy details of ColoradoCare, I lost a night\u2019s sleep. My gut told me that this scheme would break the state\u2019s economy. But I\u2019m not an economist, so I\u2019ve researched the experts\u2019 opinion on ColoradoCare.\n\nI want to know why Colorado State Treasurer Walker Stapleton (Republican) and former Governor Bill Ritter (Democrat), and Governor John Hickenlooper (Democrat) are opposed to Amendment 69 \u2013 ColoradoCare. I don\u2019t think they would be opposed if they thought it was good for Colorado.\n\nHere are three thoughtful articles to digest in your quest to learn about ColoradoCare, and to see past the rose-colored glasses worn by proponents:\n\nColoradoCare: An Independent Analysis (Colorado Health Institute)\n\nAmendment 69: What You Need to Know about ColoradoCare Single Payer Health Care Measure (Independence Institute)\n\nFoes say health care proposal would devastate Colorado (Denver Post)\n\nThe experts ask many of the same questions I\u2019ve asked about ColoradoCare. Can the questions be adequately addressed prior to the November 3 vote?\n\nI was told by Marilyn Bouldin that the new taxes levied to finance ColoradoCare will free up the $30 billion that the state currently pays for all health care programs.\n\nI am not aware that any of that \u201cfreed-up\u201d $30 billion will be allocated to ColoradoCare. It\u2019s freed-up money allocated to what? Dust in the wind? More government waste?\n\nI\u2019ll end this piece where I started \u2013 with the quote from Daily Post editor Bill Hudson about ColoradoCare:\n\n\u201cMany hands make for light work. Pooling our healthcare resources together might be the right choice for Colorado.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d like to point out to Mr. Hudson that each individual has two hands to work with. We should each strive to use our two hands to the best of our ability to do our share of the work.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pagosadailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16LogoPDP_120.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Some of my questions have no answers, and won\u2019t until (and if) ColoradoCare (Amendment 69) is passed.\nWe can all agree that the current health care system is broken, and is largely driven by big insurance and big Pharma profits.\nI am alarmed by Daily Post editor Bill Hudson\u2019s conclusion to his Five Part editorial, \u201cDeath and Taxes\u2026 and ColoradoCare.\u201dColoradans will vote this November on Amendment 69.\nI want to know why Colorado State Treasurer Walker Stapleton (Republican) and former Governor Bill Ritter (Democrat), and Governor John Hickenlooper (Democrat) are opposed to Amendment 69 \u2013 ColoradoCare.\nIf passed, Amendment 69 will set ColoradoCare into motion."}
