But not this year. My father, a Vietnam veteran, recently died of health complications related to his combat PTSD. For nearly 20 years, my family and I tried without success to prevent his self-destruction. We spent three years attempting to identify what plagued him, six years convincing him to get help, two years fighting to get him treatment from Veterans Affairs, and another eight years navigating the byzantine VA system. Yet in just 10 minutes we obtained VA approval for his burial in a national cemetery.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t surprising. Lawsuits filed in April against VA over disability claims, coupled with the Justice Department\u2019s 2014 criminal investigation of VA facilities nationwide, highlight the chronic obstacles veterans face in obtaining treatment. Less obvious is the reality that, absent an effective VA system, it is families who are fulfilling the government\u2019s responsibility to care for our vets. They face their own daunting challenges and desperately need support.\n\nCongress has long acknowledged this but has taken minimal action. In a little-publicized 2008 congressional hearing, the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs discussed changing the paradigm of veteran care. Committee members and experts who testified argued that families play a pivotal role in the veteran recovery process. Care, therefore, should focus on the family as a whole \u2014 not the veteran in isolation. But seven years later, this shift hasn\u2019t occurred.\n\nDuring the hearing, congressional members recognized that families are often first to detect combat-related problems. My father\u2019s PTSD surfaced 30 years after his deployment. Seemingly overnight he morphed from a successful businessman and community leader into someone who struggled to hold a job, abused alcohol and avoided human contact. Then more distinctly service-related symptoms emerged. Returning home from high school basketball practice one night, my brother found himself staring down the barrel of a rifle. In the midst of a flashback, my father had mistaken his son for a Viet Cong soldier.\n\nIn retrospect, though, subtle signs of illness had existed for years. Had we known what to look for we could have intervened sooner. While VA has added educational tools and resources to its Web site, that\u2019s not enough. Lifelong communication and outreach with the veteran and family members are crucial.\n\nCommittee members also cited VA\u2019s lack of \u201ccohesiveness\u201d in ensuring families receive adequate support. Because incorrect financial eligibility criteria were used in evaluating my father\u2019s VA application, he was initially denied services. It took two years of petitioning VA, plus our local representative\u2019s personal intercession, before this mistake was rectified. And once into the system, we encountered a fragmented organization that placed the onus of care coordination on veterans and their families. Each time my father entered a new VA program, we felt like we were starting over. One set of social workers handled PTSD inpatient treatment, another set primary care outpatient and yet others substance abuse. A navigator \u2014 someone assigned to every veteran\u2019s family to coordinate entry into and continuity of care within the VA system \u2014 would have helped immensely.\n\nThis navigator could also direct families to the appropriate resources. This year alone, I have spoken with VA Medical Center, Vet Center, Veterans Crisis Line and Caregiver Support staff, inquiring about family counseling and support services. While committed to helping veteran families, VA staff often lacked awareness of the resources available, provided conflicting guidance or routed me back to Web sites containing generic information. Families need a single point of contact who can offer a holistic approach to care.\n\nBeyond bearing the burden of care, the House committee hearing also addressed the \u201csecondary trauma\u201d families experience when witnessing a loved one\u2019s unraveling. Due to my father\u2019s unemployment, we had to sell our home. As he acquired DUIs, we dealt with the legal consequences. And each time alcohol withdrawal sent him to the intensive-care unit, we braced ourselves for the end. Given this overwhelming stress, I sought out counseling with VA but was told I had to find help on my own.\n\nWithin the VA system, family treatment is currently tied to the veteran. Families can\u2019t access services until the veteran chooses to seek help, enters treatment and provides permission for family members to obtain care. But when an ill veteran doesn\u2019t recognize his own problems let alone those of his family, this cooperation is unattainable. Unless the current law governing services for veteran family members is amended, families will struggle to access the affordable and specialized treatment they need.\n\nIf Congress and VA are truly committed to changing the paradigm of veteran care, families need to be front and center. Goals and metrics on family-centered programs should be incorporated into VA\u2019s strategic plan and monitored for performance. Last year\u2019s VA Performance and Accountability Report contained nine pages on burial service metrics, but none on family-focused programs. For veteran families like mine it\u2019s about the quality of care while our veterans are alive, not the quality of the headstone when they die.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "meredith ludlow, world war II, v-e day, vietnam war, veterans, veterans administration, veterans affairs, ptsd, va treatment, veterans affairs treatment,", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Families are fulfilling the government\u2019s responsibility to care for our vets.", "title": "The front lines of care for our veterans", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-front-lines-of-care-for-our-veterans/2015/05/24/c1d16e1a-fe54-11e4-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/05/23/Local/Images/weather_4801432417870.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-front-lines-of-care-for-our-veterans/2015/05/24/c1d16e1a-fe54-11e4-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "meredith ludlow, world war II, v-e day, vietnam war, veterans, veterans administration, veterans affairs, ptsd, va treatment, veterans affairs treatment,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "c1d16e1a-fe54-11e4-833c-a2de05b6b2a4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Families are fulfilling the government\u2019s responsibility to care for our vets."}, "article_summary": "In a little-publicized 2008 congressional hearing, the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs discussed changing the paradigm of veteran care.\nA navigator \u2014 someone assigned to every veteran\u2019s family to coordinate entry into and continuity of care within the VA system \u2014 would have helped immensely.\nIf Congress and VA are truly committed to changing the paradigm of veteran care, families need to be front and center.\nFor veteran families like mine it\u2019s about the quality of care while our veterans are alive, not the quality of the headstone when they die.\nAnd once into the system, we encountered a fragmented organization that placed the onus of care coordination on veterans and their families."}
