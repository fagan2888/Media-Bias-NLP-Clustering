Rejoice Colbert Nation!\n\nStephen Colbert took a victory lap on Monday\u2019s edition of \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d gloating that the technical problems that are hampering the rollout of Obamacare are validating Republican opposition to the legislation.\n\n\u201cThings are going pretty well for conservatives and we\u2019ve handled this sudden good fortune with our trademark grace and humility,\u201d Colbert said, cutting to a string of far right commentators saying, \u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare\u2019s failure means liberalism is dead,\u201d Colbert added.\n\nTo prove his point, Colbert did a stunning re-enactment in which he channeled a kale munching, Birkenstock sporting member of the far left.\n\nAlso read: Jon Stewart on Healthcare.Gov: Stop the Hurricane Katrina Comparisons (Video)\n\n\u201cJust got back from the social justice rally, which I attended because I believe that all citizens share responsibility and human rights regardless of race, class, creed or orientation,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWait, what\u2019s this? I can\u2019t log on to Obamacare. Burn the gays. Burn them.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the implementation of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law has been so poorly handled that it\u2019s rehabilitating the reputation of a certain Minnesota congresswoman with a colorful interpretation of facts.\n\n\u201cThe Obamacare roll out is so bad that by comparison Michele Bachmann is a genius,\u201d Colbert said.\n\n\u201cBottom line: we were right about Obamacare therefore we were right about everything,\u201d he added. \u201cHe was born in Kenya. He\u2019s a secret muslim.\u201d\n\nWhat a great day for Colbert Nation.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nThe Colbert Report\n\nGet More: Colbert Report Full Episodes,Video Archive", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/colbert-150x150.png", "sailthru.author": "Brent Lang", "description": "Liberal ideals take a beating.
