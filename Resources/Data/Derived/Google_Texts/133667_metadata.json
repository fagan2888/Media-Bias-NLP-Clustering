Ted Cruz speaks with congressional members to discuss the IRS scandal of targeting the Tea Party.Getty\n\nTea Party groups once had their hopes on Sen. Marco Rubio to carry the torch in the Beltway for conservatism.\n\nBut his star faded fast among his base after he played a central role in drafting a bipartisan immigration reform bill in the Senate that would, among other things, tighten enforcement and provide a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThey saw him as a turncoat for supporting this approach, which they say would hurt Americans by giving them competition for jobs and reward lawbreakers by giving them amnesty.\n\nBut as the Florida Republican's glow dimmed this year, another lawmaker's star rose. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's high-profile condemnation of President Obama's health care plan \u2013 capped by a 21-hour marathon speech on the Senate floor Wednesday that infuriated some in his own party \u2013 drew praise from Tea Party groups and other conservatives who wanted someone to stand up to status-quo Washington.\n\n\u201cThis is a galvanizing event,\u201d said FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\n\u201cNothing has happened this week outside the norm. These are the rules of the Senate that allows a senator to stand up on the floor and to speak until they don\u2019t want to give the floor up.\u201d - Sen. Marco Rubio\n\nFreedomWorks, a Tea Party group and major supporter of Cruz, has vowed to see to it that any lawmaker who allowed the vote for the health care plan to proceed Friday would pay for it later.\n\nWhen U.S. Sen. John Cornyn refused to join Cruz in his mission to defund President Obama's health care reform plan, he sparked the wrath of Tea Party groups.\n\nCruz is concerned that a House budget plan that would keep the government funded, avoid a shutdown, but not fund the health care plan will be at risk in the Democrat-controlled Senate of having the defunding provision stripped.\n\nCornyn joined other Republicans who oppose risking a government shutdown and have expressed their disapproval of Cruz\u2019s aggressive moves to fight the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSen. Bob Corker accused Cruz of launching the 21-hour marathon speech to grandstand and pander to conservatives.\n\n\u201cYou want the American people and the outside groups that you\u2019ve been in contact with to be able to watch us tomorrow,\u201d said Corker, a Tennessee Republican, on the Senate floor, according to published reports. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re waiting is that y\u2019all have sent out releases and emails and you want everybody to be able to watch. And it just doesn\u2019t seem to me that that\u2019s in our nation\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nAnd in a reference to Cruz, Cornyn said that merits of policies \u2013 not political calculations \u2013 influenced how he made decisions, said The Dallas Morning News.\n\nSupporters of the Affordable Care Act say that it will give the millions of Americans who lack health coverage a chance to be insured and get access to health care. Cruz, as well as some opponents of the plan, say it will not improve health care and may prompt employers to cut back workers' hours or fire them if they're forced to participate in the plan.\n\nRubio often found himself under attack this year by Tea Party groups and other conservatives; some even staged protests outside his offices in Florida, accusing him of being a turncoat.\n\nThey said that Rubio had abandoned conservative principles.\n\nAfter the Senate passed the immigration bill in June, Rubio turned his attention to Obama's health care plan and other White House policies he opposes.\n\nOn Thursday, for instance, Rubio defended the fight against the Affordable Care Act in an interview with Fox.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, this isn\u2019t about shutting down the government. This is about shutting down Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who are trying to make it, who are trying to start a business, or if you\u2019re working full time and now are being moved to part time, or if you\u2019re working part time and now you\u2019re losing your hours, these are the people that are really going to be hurt by this. And it isn\u2019t fair. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nHe also defended Cruz, denying he was engaging in theatrics \u2014 his marathon speech, he said, was meant to draw attention to the flaws of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cNothing has happened this week outside the norm. These are the rules of the Senate that allows a senator to stand up on the floor and to speak until they don\u2019t want to give the floor up,\u201d he said.\n\nA Washington Post story noted: \"Rubio, who spoke on the floor three times during Cruz\u2019s marathon talk, appeared particularly eager to shore up his credentials with the Tea Party... In addition to railing against Obama\u2019s health care law, he blocked the nomination of a gay black judge from Miami to the federal court, which some interpreted as a nod to social conservatives.\"\n\nSal Russo, a co-founder of the Tea Party Express, said his group still supports Rubio and views him as a viable presidential candidate in 2016. Cruz would be too if he chose to run, he said.\n\n\u201cI think Marco Rubio still has great respect and admiration,\u201d he said, adding that Tea Party groups hold diverse views on various subjects, though they all generally oppose big government, and U.S. tax policies.\n\n\u201c[Ted Cruz] is clearly emerging as a leader,\u201d Russo said. \u201cTed didn\u2019t have a good chance of winning [regarding the health care vote], but he fought the good fight. You might not win votes, but you can win the hearts and minds of Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Ted does is put the issue out there,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz\u2019s high-profile condemnation of Obama\u2019s health care plan, some experts say, may boost what some have said is the Tea Party\u2019s fading influence.\n\nA recent Gallup Poll showed that adults nationwide who said they supported the Tea Party fell to 22 percent from 32 percent in 2010. Among Republicans, the drop went to 38 percent from 65 percent in the same period, among Independents it fell to 25 percent from 30 percent, and among Democrats it went to 6 percent from 8 percent.\n\nCruz\u2019s firm opposition to the health care plan is energizing Texas\u2019 grassroots conservatives that helped him rise from electoral longshot to national star. It may ultimately prove a boon for other Tea Party-backed candidates waiting to follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhile no one is expecting an army of Cruz clones, he may be a model for a certain type of confrontational conservatism back home.\n\nImplications of that would stretch far beyond its own borders since Texas is the nation's richest GOP donor state. It also has repeatedly been a cradle for Republican presidential candidates \u2014 perhaps even Cruz himself in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis speech wasn't just historic - what Ted Cruz did was epic,\u201d said Tea Party Express chair Amy Kremer Kremer in a statement. \u201cHe made good on his promises and displayed courage rarely seen in modern politics. Cruz's commitment to conservative principles is why he is one of the leading conservative voices in America today.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.
