Growing up poor in Chicago, Irons remembers, \u201cYou heard the term \u2018starving artist\u2019, and I didn\u2019t want to be a starving artist.\u201d So she shelved her passion and got a Masters in Social Work and a PhD in Sociology, telling herself, \u201cI\u2019ll just write as a hobby.\u201d\n\nBut she couldn\u2019t stick to that plan.\n\n\u201c[A]ll the while I was writing,\u201d Iron says of the years between 2004 and 2012 when she ran A Touch of Grace, living between the flagship hospice in Chicago and the second one she opened in Nashville, Tennessee in 2009. \u201cThis passion would not die,\u201d Irons explained over the phone, speaking from Los Angeles where she is now based.\n\nToday, she is the CEO of Manasseh and Ephraim Studios, the banner under which she has written and produced the short Shame, about a man suffering domestic violence, and the pilot for upcoming web series Choysez, which follows a working class teenager navigating life in Los Angeles.\n\nShe told us how she\u2019s leveraging her passion and entrepreneurial acumen to introduce edifying content specifically aimed at women and viewers of color.\n\nMadameNoire: How did you make the transition from healthcare to film and television?\n\nJennifer Irons: I started taking creative writing courses and other courses on writing, and then I actually decided to apply to film school\u2026 Even though it\u2019s two totally different industries, the business sense of it, I have.\n\nThe hospice that we opened\u2026 was focused on serving underserved families [that] were largely African-American and Latino. So me looking at what areas are missing in a particular industry is what I\u2019m accustomed to.\n\nMN: What did you find missing in the film and television industry?\n\nJI: \u2026After I went to film school, I learned that as writers, what happens is you write a great script, they cut you a check. And if you\u2019re a great writer, you might get a little bit of money on the back-end. But then after that, it\u2019s no longer yours.\n\nYou get credit for it, but then the whole process of making sure that the script ends up being what you envisioned, and that you retain creative control, and that you tell the story the way you want to tell it only happens when you\u2019re actually in a position to produce them. So it was that that made me decide that I wanna do more than just write. I wanna maintain control over my own products and projects.\n\nMN: What does you average production budget look like?\n\nJI: [O]ur first budget production was about $11,000\u2026[for] a 10-minute short. We\u2019re currently producing a pilot episode for YouTube TV\u2026and the pilot budget is about $10,000.\n\nMN: How do you fund your projects?\n\nJI: Everything is funded out-of-pocket. \u2026I made money from the sale of my first company. But with this new project that we\u2019re working on\u2014Choysez\u2014we are going to do crowdfunding for it, to help produce the remaining first season.\n\nMN: What\u2019s your long-term plan for sustainability?\n\nJI: [I wrote] a one-hour legal drama that I posted on The Blacklist\u2026 The reviews consistently say \u2018Unique characters that have unique voices; solid and well-written pilot script.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna help put us in a position to do our first mainstream, if you will, project, and help generate revenue.\n\nMN: Your scripts have a moral imperative. Why is that important to you?\n\nJI: I believe there is space for us to tell well-written stories that don\u2019t damage our viewer. And I believe because the stories are well-written, and because people are looking for that and [aren\u2019t] satisfied with the same storyline, I think that we are actually gonna be well-received. People want it, we just have to give it to them.\n\nNana Ekua Brew-Hammond is the author of Powder Necklace.
