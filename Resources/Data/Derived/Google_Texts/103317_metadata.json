KTRK\n\nA Houston woman is upset after finding that her belly button was removed during a tummy tuck and hernia repair operation, reportedly without her knowledge or consent.\n\nLast December, Lori Jones underwent a tummy tuck procedure and an operation to remove a herniated umbilical cord to help repair some damage she had sustained from having multiple C-sections, The Daily Mail reported. According to Medical News Today, umbilical hernia occur when fatty tissue pokes through the area near the belly button, and is more common in women who have had multiple pregnancies. The 45-year-old mother told KTRK that she also wanted the tummy tuck to get rid of some \u201cbaby fat\u201d and get her into shape for the summer. However, it was not until several weeks after the operation when Jones removed the bandages that she realized the true extent of her procedure. The operation had left her completely without a belly button.\n\n\u201cI said well damn. Wait, where is my belly button?\u201d Jones told KTRK. \u201cI went in with the belly button and I'd like to know what you did with it? What happened to it? Did you throw it in the trash? Where is it?\u201d\n\nAccording to The BBC, losing a belly button during an operation to repair an umbilical hernia is not an uncommon occurrence. However, Jones claims she was only told that her belly button would need to be repositioned due to the scar tissue that covered the area. The Texas mother still maintains she was never made aware of the risk that she might completely lose her belly button.\n\nJones\u2019 surgeon, Dr. Younan Nowzardan, is a renowned Houston plastic surgeon and is internationally known for his appearances on the TLC series \"My 600 Lb Life\" as a gastric bypass surgeon. According to Nowzardan, he had discussed the possibility of losing the belly button with Jones prior to the operation. Once he began working on her stomach he realized there was nothing he could have done to save the area and that completely removing her belly button was inevitable.\n\n\u201cWe can call Hollywood and get an Oscar nomination for her,\u201d Nowzardan told KTRK, insinuating that her ignorance was an act.\n\nAlthough Nowzardan told Jones that he would be able to create a new belly button for her once the scars had healed, Jones told KTRK that she\u2019d rather settle her complaint in court. Jones claimed to have already contacted an attorney and plans to sue Nowzardan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it, and for them to act like it's nothing, that\u2019s what\u2019s really bothering me,\u201d said Jones.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tummy, tuck, gone, wrong, texas, woman, plans, sue, after, procedure, left, her, without, belly", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Texas woman plans to sue her doctor after a tummy tuck and a procedure to fix a hernia left her without a belly button.", "title": "Tummy Tuck Procedure Leaves Texas Woman Without A Belly Button", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tummy-tuck-without-belly-button-texas-374076", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/18/belly.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Texas woman plans to sue her doctor after a tummy tuck and a procedure to fix a hernia left her without a belly button.", "title": "Tummy Tuck Procedure Leaves Texas Woman Without A Belly Button", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tummy-tuck-without-belly-button-texas-374076", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/18/belly.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/18/belly.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2016-02-18T14:43:06-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T14:43:05-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Texas woman plans to sue her doctor after a tummy tuck and a procedure to fix a hernia left her without a belly button."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cff\"", "article_summary": "The Texas mother still maintains she was never made aware of the risk that she might completely lose her belly button.\nWait, where is my belly button?\u201d Jones told KTRK.\n\u201cI went in with the belly button and I'd like to know what you did with it?\n\u201cWe can call Hollywood and get an Oscar nomination for her,\u201d Nowzardan told KTRK, insinuating that her ignorance was an act.\nAlthough Nowzardan told Jones that he would be able to create a new belly button for her once the scars had healed, Jones told KTRK that she\u2019d rather settle her complaint in court."}
