Such is the case with 8-year-old Tyler Doi, a young boy with autism whose affinity for wind chimes has brought out his unique ability to differentiate their sounds \u2014 which, for many people, usually sound the same.\n\nStudies have shown that people with autism, while deficient in some areas of cognitive function, excel in others. In May last year, researchers from Vanderbilt University found that children with autism were able to track which direction a set of quickly-moving bars moved better than kids without autism. Another study found that adults with autism were more likely to have synesthesia, a condition in which brain connections are mixed, causing one sensory perception to trigger another \u2014 a sound causing a person to see colors too, for example.\n\nFor Tyler, these enhanced neural connections manifested in the ability to decipher different sounds among wind chimes. Although he initially had an interest in stars and bird feeders, a failed attempt at finding them once resulted in him being introduced to wind chimes. From there, his interest exploded and now he owns up to 100 of them \u2014 manufactured mostly by Woodstock Chimes. To show how good he was at identifying each chime, he went up against Woodstock Chime\u2019s owner Garry Kvistad in the \u201cName-That-Chime Challenge,\u201d which you can see in the rather heartwarming video below.\n\nWoodstock Chimes also decided to dedicate a brand new chime to those with ASD, called \u201cWoodstock Chimes for Autism.\u201d The company also committed to donating 100 percent of the profits from the chime to research and treatment. It is decorated with a colorful puzzle piece to symbolize the mystery that still surrounds the causes and effects of ASD. Some of the latest statistics pins one out of every 68 children with ASD, nearly 37 times more common as it was 30 years ago.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "autism, autism and brain function, tyler doi, wind chimes, tyler doi wind chimes, woodstock chimes, autism spectrum disorder", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One 8-year-old boy with autism and an extraordinary hearing ability is using his affinity for wind chimes to further research and treatment.
