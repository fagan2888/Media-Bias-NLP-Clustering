Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced that he is planning a \u201cmajor speech\u201d to explain to the American people what \u201cDemocratic Socialism\u201d is really all about. \u201cI think we have some explaining and work to do,\u201d Sanders told a crowd in Iowa, conceding that the S-word has long made many Americans \u201cvery, very nervous.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly a century of red-baiting and anti-socialist propaganda, this will happen. But today is a much better time to run as a socialist than in the past, and Sanders could be just the man to open up our political playing field to future socialists \u2014 or Democratic Socialists, to be more accurate \u2014 if he can finally remove the stigma from the word. Of course, communism fell a quarter-century ago, and for many millennials who grew up in a post-Cold War period, the word socialism actually evokes a more positive response than capitalism, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. This is certainly a good sign for the future of socialist politics; however, the majority of Americans today are not millennials, and there is great deal of ignorance when it comes to these words, which tend to elicit a whirlwind of emotions.\n\nThere seem to be two common, yet very different, thoughts that come to the minds of many Americans when they hear the word socialism. For some, it automatically means 20th century communism, i.e. a Stalinist or Maoist dictatorship where the state controls all ways of life and plans the entire economy while enslaving all dissenters. On the other hand, it is thought of as a massive bureaucratized welfare state, where citizens are lazy and rely on the government for \u201cfree stuff.\u201d In America, this view has always had a racial undertone, with a narrative that it is African Americans or Hispanic immigrants who are getting the free stuff off of the hard work of white people. Today, this dog-whistle strategy is alive and well, as we see in one of Donald Trump\u2019s recent tweets: \u201cNotice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS.\u201d\n\nNow, it is important for Sanders to explain to the people what he is and what he is not. Sanders calls himself a Democratic Socialist, and does not argue when reporters leave out the first word, as they tend to. But in reality, Sanders is less a Democratic Socialist and more a \u201cSocial Democrat.\u201d The Scandinavian countries that Sanders rightfully praises, such as Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, are Social Democracies. These countries have strong welfare states (another term that has been demonized through dog-whistle politics), which means universal healthcare, free college tuition, a well regulated market, etc. These countries are still very much capitalist societies, just with rules that create a more even playing field. Democratic Socialism, on other hand, is the belief that both the political and economic spheres should be run democratically. It is important to note that Democratic Socialism does not want to replace corporate ownership with state ownership, and is critical of state bureaucracy as well as corporate bureaucracy. On the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) website, this is explained in further detail:\n\n\u201cToday, corporate executives who answer only to themselves and a few wealthy stockholders make basic economic decisions affecting millions of people. Resources are used to make money for capitalists rather than to meet human needs. We believe that the workers and consumers who are affected by economic institutions should own and control them. Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible\u2026 Democratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sanders has taken the Democratic primary by storm, a feat that would have been unprecedented until very recently", "author": "Conor Lynch", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sanders has taken the Democratic primary by storm, a feat that would have been unprecedented until very recently", "title": "The truth about Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialism\u201d: Everything you need to know about the candidate\u2019s mould-breaking political philosophy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/21/the_truth_about_bernie_sanders_socialism_everything_you_need_to_know_about_the_candidates_mould_breaking_political_philosophy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/bernie_sanders24.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sanders has taken the Democratic primary by storm, a feat that would have been unprecedented until very recently", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/bernie_sanders24.jpg", "title": "The truth about Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialism\u201d: Everything you need to know about the candidate\u2019s mould-breaking political philosophy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The truth about Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialism\u201d: Everything you need to know about the candidate\u2019s mould-breaking political philosophy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Bernie Sanders, Democratic Socialism, political philosophy, Social Democrat, Socialism, The Democratic Primary", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible\u2026 Democratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned.\nDemocratic Socialism, on other hand, is the belief that both the political and economic spheres should be run democratically.\nThere seem to be two common, yet very different, thoughts that come to the minds of many Americans when they hear the word socialism.\nSanders calls himself a Democratic Socialist, and does not argue when reporters leave out the first word, as they tend to.\nBut in reality, Sanders is less a Democratic Socialist and more a \u201cSocial Democrat.\u201d The Scandinavian countries that Sanders rightfully praises, such as Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, are Social Democracies."}
