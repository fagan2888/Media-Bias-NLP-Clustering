To the Editor:

Thank you for noting the cognitive dissonance that finds many Americans lavishing love on tens of millions of dogs and cats, even as we allow the grotesque slaughter of close to nine billion farm animals a year (“Exposing Abuse on the Factory Farm,” editorial, Aug. 9).

There is no moral difference between abusing and eating a pig or a dog, a cat or a chicken. In fact, as your editorial points out, our pets are generally treated well and have legal protections, while farm animals are treated horribly and have virtually no protection from abuse.

So if one’s goal is to cause the least possible cruelty to animals, it would actually be ethically preferable to eat a well-treated dog or cat rather than an abused chicken or pig. The choice for all of us who oppose cruelty is clear: We should not be eating any animals.
