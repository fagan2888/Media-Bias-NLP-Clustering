There were said to be five bidders, and the winner remains anonymous.\n\nAt the same sale, a Giacometti sculpture, \u201cL\u2019homme au doigt,\u201d went for a total of more than $141 million.\n\nOn May 5, at the first major auction of the spring selling season, Sotheby\u2019s pulled in $368 million. It was the second-highest sale of Impressionist and modern art in the history of the auction house, according to The New York Times. The top seller was van Gogh\u2019s \u201cL\u2019all\u00e9e Des Alyscamps,\u201d which fetched $66.3 million.\n\nRelated: 6 Traits of an Emerging Millionaire. Are you one?\n\nThe haul represented a 67 percent increase over Sotheby\u2019s spring sale a year earlier, according to Bloomberg, which noted that many of the buyers were Asian.\n\nThe May 5 auction was only the second-highest because Sotheby\u2019s held a sale last November that took in $422 million.\n\nAnd tonight at a Sotheby\u2019s auction of contemporary art, a painting entitled \u201cThe Ring (Engagement)\u201d by the Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein could sell for as much as $50 million, the Times said.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind all those staggering numbers?\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, the columnist Felix Salmon (then at Reuters, now at Fusion) ruminated about whether there was a bubble, which he defined as often driven by FOMO (fear of missing out), or a speculative bubble, one fueled by flippers, in the art market. His conclusion: the art market bubble was definitely not speculative.\n\n\u201cThe people spending millions of dollars on trophy art aren\u2019t buying to flip\u2026,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for Another Real Estate Bubble\n\nStill, Salmon said he was seeing signs that the market could be turning speculative. But they may have been false signals.\n\nRecently, The Wall Street Journal wrote: \u201cSpurred by the momentum of several successful sale seasons and an influx of newly wealthy global bidders, the major auction houses\u2026say demand for status art is at historic levels and shows no signs of tapering off.\u201d\n\nBut why?\n\nIn an April 17 article, the global news website Worldcrunch asked Financial Times journalist Georgina Adam, who wrote the 2014 book Big Bucks\u2014The Explosion of the Art Market in the 21st Century, why so much money is rolling around the art market and driving up prices.\n\n\u201cRich people used to be rich in terms of estate or assets, but not so much in terms of cash, like they are today,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis growing billionaire population from developed or developing economies has money to spend and invest,\u201d said the Worldcrunch article by Catherine Cochard. \u201cFor many of them, art \u2014 in the same way as luxury cars or pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter \u2014 is an entry pass to a globalized way of life accessible through their wealth.\u201d\n\nThat is a development that the keen eyes at the auction houses haven\u2019t missed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/12/180-million-Picasso-What-s-Making-Art-Market-Sizzle", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The art market is hotter than a hoisted Rembrandt.
