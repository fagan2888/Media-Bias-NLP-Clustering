(WANE) \u2013 Indiana is known for many things: the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Garfield, and a whole lot of corn. Monday, some new findings from the 2015 \u201cKids Count\u201d study were released and a lot of it is nothing to be proud of. One of the most shocking findings deals with Hoosier teens and suicide. The other: Indiana comes in second in the nation for having the most parents who have served hard time.\n\n\u201cIt was interesting to us as we shared this finding with different folks in law enforcement that they were surprised by it as well,\u201d Indiana Youth Institute President and CEO Bill Stanczykiewicz said.\n\nIndiana Youth Institute President and CEO Bill Stanczykiewicz says according to the agency\u2019s new \u201cKids Count\u201d report, 11 percent of Hoosier parents have been behind bars. Indiana ranks number two behind Kentucky. Oklahoma, Ohio, and Michigan are also in the top five.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we don\u2019t have a reason why Indiana\u2019s rate is so much higher compared to the rest of the country. Our friends in law enforcement have speculated that a lot of folks are being incarcerated on drug offenses. It could have to do with the way Indiana is wrestling with the challenges related to meth.\n\nIndiana ranks first when it comes to the number of teens considering suicide. The state ranks second when it comes to teens who have attempted suicide.\n\n\u201cYou need to be watching their behaviors. When kids are just overly down for long periods of time\u2026 really when they are blue and depressed for weeks at a time.\u201d\n\nOther health concerns for teens that climbed from last year \u2013 the use of e-cigarettes. Some contain nicotine. That\u2019s why they\u2019re banned for those under 18 in Indiana. Still, e-cigarette use among Hoosier teens went up by about 20 percent.\n\n\u201cIt just makes it look cool and hip and you are very popular if you are using an e-cigarette. The kids hear about the flavors and it\u2019s fruit and it\u2019s bubblegum and it\u2019s chocolate and it\u2019t mint and gosh it is at the mall in the kiosk. It\u2019s so easy to obtain online. That\u2019s why there\u2019s this fear that more and more kids are going to obtain this product.\u201d\n\nClick here to see the full report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana is known for many things: the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Garfield, and a whole lot of corn.
