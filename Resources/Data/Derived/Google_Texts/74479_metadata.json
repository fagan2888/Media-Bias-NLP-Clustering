After all, it\u2019s a reliably red state in the Deep South.\n\nInstead, polling now suggests an extremely tight contest, raising the possibility of a runoff election in January if neither candidate can get 50 percent of the vote a week from today\u2013and perhaps leaving control of the Senate in doubt.\n\nIt\u2019s a marquee race between two familiar Georgia names without major political experience: Republican David Perdue, 64, and Democrat Michelle Nunn, 47.\n\nPerdue\u2019s first cousin, Sonny, is a former governor of Georgia. Nunn\u2019s father, Sam, is one of the last Georgia Democrats to serve a full term in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have this crazy runoff law, and the race is close enough that I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll get an answer in November or January,\u201d says Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime GOP strategist and fundraiser who was chairman of Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in Georgia in both 2008 and 2012.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, polls show a third-party candidate, Libertarian Amanda Swafford, pulling 5 percent of the vote Nov. 4.\n\nWhen Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, announced his retirement last year, few thought his Georgia seat would remain in play a week before Election Day.\n\nBut today, an air of uneasiness follows Georgia, the state with the nation\u2019s highest unemployment rate.\n\nGeorgia has the nation\u2019s highest unemployment rate.\n\nKeith Mason, the head of a pro-Nunn Super PAC, Georgians Together, says it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d a candidate will win the Senate seat without a runoff.\n\n>>> 9 Senate Races That Could Tip the Balance of Power\n\nMason and Tanenblatt, who shared their perspectives on the Nunn-Perdue contest with The Daily Signal, are Atlanta-based political operatives with opposing views. They both work at the same law firm: McKenna Long & Aldridge.\n\nAttack on Outsourcing\n\nIn recent weeks, Perdue, who campaigns as an outsider with experience leading businesses, has been forced to defend that supposed strength as the Nunn campaign criticizes his record on outsourcing jobs.\n\nTanenblatt calls those claims \u201ctwisted\u201d and predicts the race will turn on whether Democrats can turn out minority voters.\n\nPerdue, a former chief executive of Reebok and Dollar General, told reporters two weeks ago that he was \u201cproud\u201d of using outsourcing as a tactic to turn around troubled companies.\n\nNunn\u2019s attacks focus on Perdue\u2019s work for Pillowtex, a North Carolina-based textile company that he led shortly before it went out of business, laying off thousands of workers.\n\nHer argument gained momentum in early October when Politico published a 2005 deposition Perdue gave in lawsuits stemming from the Pillowtex closure.\n\nAsked about his \u201cexperience with outsourcing,\u201d Perdue replied: \u201cYeah, I spent most of my career doing that.\u201d\n\nMason, whose Super PAC has run ads attacking Perdue for his views on equal pay and other \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d issues, says Perdue\u2019s business record represents a character flaw.\n\n\u201cPerdue doesn\u2019t care about people like me and you, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d says Mason, who worked for Al Gore\u2019s presidential campaign in 2000 and volunteered for Sam Nunn while in middle school. \u201cThat is, unless they\u2019re bringing him a cup of coffee. Ordinary people don\u2019t view him as an ally.\u201d\n\nKeith Mason says David Perdue \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about people like me and you.\u201d\n\n>>> Why Fishing Rights and Genetically Modified Salmon Might Determine Senate Control\n\nThe Stealth Democrat\n\nBlunt accusations aside, the rhetoric hasn\u2019t been overly partisan because both candidates lack voting records.\n\nNunn has branded herself as a bipartisan candidate whose experience running a nonprofit founded by a Republican president, George H.W. Bush, shows she can work with both sides of the political divide.\n\nDespite Nunn\u2019s work with Points of Light, the service organization he established, the elder Bush endorsed Perdue. The former president\u2019s team has asked her to stop citing their connection.\n\nMason says:\n\n\u201cMichelle [Nunn] has been more clear about committing to bipartisan solutions. Perdue sounds like every Republican candidate with no hint of a desire to cooperate. He is all about continuing another fight.\u201d\n\nTanenblatt counters: \u201cMichelle has tried to run as a bipartisan consensus builder. But she can\u2019t be deceptive. She\u2019s a Democrat.\u201d\n\nThe Key: Who Will Vote?\n\nBeing a Democrat might be enough for Nunn.\n\nAccording to Yahoo! News, new voter registration figures show the overall electorate in Georgia is slightly smaller than in 2012, with whites making up 58 percent of the roughly 6 million voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Mason says, two-thirds of new registered voters are black. He estimates that blacks make up about 30 percent of the electorate.\n\n>>> On the Campaign Trail: \u2018Ground Zero\u2019 in North Carolina and the GOP Chase for College Kids\n\nNunn makes direct appeals to black voters, supporting a hike in the minimum wage and campaigning at targeted churches and community events. Tanenblatt says:\n\n\u201cDemocrats have had a very organized effort the last few years to register new voters among minorities. The question, and the key to the race, is: Do they turn out to vote?\u201d\n\nNunn, he argues, also will have to woo independents and moderate Republicans, two groups that may interpret her message differently than do black Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for Nunn is to get them [black voters] energized, while also appealing to independents,\u201d Tanenblatt says. \u201cBlack voters are one of the few groups still sticking with the president, but independents are not. So she\u2019s walking a fine line.\u201d\n\nMichelle Nunn is \u201cwalking a fine line\u201d trying to woo black voters, independents and more liberal Republicans, says @ericjtanenblatt.\n\nFather Time\n\nCharlie Harper, editor-in-chief of Peach Pundit, a Georgia-based politics website, says Nunn has a two-pronged strategy that aims to take advantage of her father\u2019s popularity.\n\nSam Nunn features prominently in his daughter\u2019s campaign ads. Harper says:\n\n\u201cPeople are being reminded that they like that Nunn guy. Nunn was popularly seen as the last of the conservative Democrats. It gives her credentials as a centrist, old Southern Democrat, even if she runs more in line with how the mainstream party wants.\u201d\n\nThe link helps Nunn reach beyond her Democratic base and appeal to independents and more liberal Republicans. But can she appease each of those constituencies?\n\n\u201cThere are two parts to her strategy: To motivate the traditional voter who only shows up during presidential years, together with openly branding herself as very moderate,\u201d Harper says. \u201cWhich Michelle Nunn is she?\u201d\n\nIf Democrats do get their desired turnout, Tanenblatt, Mason and Harper agree the race will be decided in a runoff.\n\nIn that case, Mason thinks Nunn will win, but Tanenblatt favors Perdue.\n\nHarper won\u2019t pick a favorite.\n\nIt all adds up to uncertainty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A close race in Georgia between Republican David Perdue and Democrat Michelle Nunn may go to a runoff -- and determine control of the Senate.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A close race in Georgia between Republican David Perdue and Democrat Michelle Nunn may go to a runoff -- and determine control of the Senate.", "title": "How a 'Crazy' Runoff in Georgia Could Decide Senate Control", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/GeorgiaRunoff_Feature.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-28T22:41:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xBc0H7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A close race in Georgia between Republican David Perdue and Democrat Michelle Nunn may go to a runoff -- and determine control of the Senate.", "title": "How a 'Crazy' Runoff in Georgia Could Decide Senate Control", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/GeorgiaRunoff_Feature.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Front Page", "tag": "Elections 2014,politics", "published_time": "2014-10-28T16:30:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-28T22:41:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Georgia, Senate, Michelle Nunn, David Perdue, Mitt Romney, Reebok, Dollar General, George H.W.
