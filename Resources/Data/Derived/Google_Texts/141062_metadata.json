They point to signs such as UnitedHealth Group\u2019s decision to stop offering plans in many state markets as proof that the law\u2019s economics are collapsing.\n\n\u201cI think that Obamacare is going to be a huge issue in this campaign. The next couple of months in particular are going to be quite tough for the law,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, a Hoover Institution fellow who advised 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on health care.\n\nWhether Republicans will capitalize, though, is in doubt.\n\nObamacare exchange customers don\u2019t have to begin signing up for next year\u2019s coverage until Nov. 1, so rate shock won\u2019t hit until days before the election at the earliest.\n\nAlso, Republicans\u2019 pledge to come up with a replacement plan for Obamacare could be hitting the skids.\n\nHouse Republicans are working on an alternative as part of Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s series of task forces to build a \u201cbold, pro-growth agenda\u201d for the party to take into the November elections.\n\n\u201cWe are on track,\u201d Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck said. \u201cThis law continues to demonstrate that is a failure, and we will offer the country a better way to provide a patient-centered health care system.\u201d\n\nYet de facto Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Thursday that he is \u201cnot ready to support\u201d Mr. Ryan\u2019s agenda, a frosty rebuke to the House speaker\u2019s acknowledgment to CNN that he wasn\u2019t ready to back the real estate mogul as his party\u2019s standard-bearer.\n\nThe two men are scheduled to meet at Republican National Committee headquarters on Thursday.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has vowed to scrap Obamacare, his previous support for single-payer health care has unnerved some conservatives, and he has already broken with Mr. Ryan over health care entitlement reform through changes to Medicare.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge with Trump is he has not really told us what it is he would do with health care,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cHe would do very well if he adopted whatever plan Speaker Ryan comes up with.\u201d\n\nIt is also unclear how many votes will hinge on health care reform. A Kaiser poll from April says registered voters want the presidential candidates to talk about the economy and jobs, national security, and immigration and border control before they discuss health care.\n\nOn Obamacare, the poll said more than half of Republican voters (56 percent) want full repeal, while a majority of Democrats (51 percent) want to expand the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there will be a huge number of voter conversions on the issue,\u201d said G. Terry Madonna, a politics professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe approach by Republicans on the rising cost will have a marginal effect \u2014 not a bad strategy, but more important will be their plan and its pros and cons, since that\u2019s likely to be a major bone of contention.\u201d\n\nRep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has said the Republican approach will reduce costs and increase choices for patients, bolster competition among insurers and help vulnerable Americans with targeted assistance, while scrapping Obamacare\u2019s mandates and Byzantine coverage requirements.\n\nDemocrats and their supporters say whatever Republicans propose, it won\u2019t cover all 20 million Americans who have gained coverage through Mr. Obama\u2019s law.\n\n\u201cWhile Donald Trump and Paul Ryan fight it out and get nothing done, Democrats are focused on continuing the success of the Affordable Care Act and working to make it better. No one will fight harder than [Democratic presidential front-runner] Hillary Clinton to do that,\u201d said Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the progressive Priorities USA group that already plans to attack the Trump campaign with $91 million in television advertising.\n\nIn the meantime, the Department of Health and Human Services has tried to temper any blowback from insurers\u2019 2017 rate requests by releasing a report that \u201cdebunks the myth\u201d that initial filings are a good indicator of what consumers actually pay. Exchange coverage cost just 4 percent more, on average, in 2016 than 2015 among customers who qualified for taxpayer subsidies.\n\n\u201cAverages based on proposed premium changes are not a reliable indicator of what typical consumers will actually pay because tax credits reduce the cost of coverage for the vast majority of people, shopping gives all consumers a chance to find the best deal and public rate review can bring down proposed increases,\u201d HHS spokesman Benjamin Wakana said.\n\nThose caveats haven\u2019t stopped Republican candidates from using rate shock as a weapon against their opponents.\n\nFlorida businessman and Republican Senate contender Carlos Beruff challenged two of his potential Democratic rivals, Reps. Alan Grayson and Patrick Murphy, to explain the expected increases last week, even though the state\u2019s party primaries are months away.\n\n\u201cVoters in Florida deserve to know how the Democratic candidates for Senate defend these rate increases,\u201d Mr. Beruff said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Obamacare is not working.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurers are preparing for Obamacare customers double-digit rate increases to be announced in coming months, handing Republicans a key talking point as they try to persuade voters to accept a repeal of the 2010 health care law.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Insurers are preparing for Obamacare customers double-digit rate increases to be announced in coming months, handing Republicans a key talking point as they try to persuade voters to accept a repeal of the 2010 health care law.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s expected double-digit rate increases boost Republicans\u2019 repeal efforts", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/8/obamacares-expected-double-digit-rate-increases-bo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/08/5_8_2016_aca-new-customers8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/08/5_8_2016_aca-new-customers8201.jpg", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s expected double-digit rate increases boost Republica", "description": "Insurers are preparing for Obamacare customers double-digit rate increases to be announced in coming months, handing Republicans a key talking point as they try to persuade voters to accept a repeal o", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "\u201cVoters in Florida deserve to know how the Democratic candidates for Senate defend these rate increases,\u201d Mr. Beruff said.\nInsurers are preparing for Obamacare customers double-digit rate increases to be announced in coming months, handing Republicans a key talking point as they try to persuade voters to accept a repeal of the 2010 health care law.\n\u201cI think the challenge with Trump is he has not really told us what it is he would do with health care,\u201d Mr. Chen said.\n\u201cHe would do very well if he adopted whatever plan Speaker Ryan comes up with.\u201dIt is also unclear how many votes will hinge on health care reform.\n\u201cThat could result in many insurers having rate increases that exceed 10 percentage points,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, associate director of health care reform and private reform at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation."}
