Veterans who served at the U.S. Marine Corps base in North Carolina have been getting sick for decades. So have their children.\n\nNow we have Fort McClellan, the Army chemical school in Alabama, and the stories are coming out: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), radiation, depleted uranium, mustard gas and more \u2014 leading to cancer, arthritis, autoimmune disease, diabetes, heart disease, fibromyalgia and multiple miscarriages. And it\u2019s hitting the second generation, the children of those veterans. Reading the veterans\u2019 stories on Internet, a common theme emerges: Their civilian doctors can\u2019t figure out the cause of their strange combination of illnesses, but say they appear to be caused by exposure to chemical toxins.\n\nFort Mac was mothballed in 1999 and is considered a superfund site.\n\nFor years, small pockets of information surfaced around the country, but the Department of Veterans Affairs wasn\u2019t listening, if the stories of veterans are accurate. As is standard, it was left to the veterans to try to prove they were sick because of toxin exposure at Fort Mac. Hearing those stories, Congressman Paul Tonko tried and failed numerous times to get the Fort McClellan Health Registry Act passed. He\u2019s going to try again.\n\nIdeally, the VA would share information on its website about toxic exposure at Fort Mac. It would be a step, but the Fort Mac illnesses likely will go the way of Agent Orange: years of pushing to get it called presumptive. Don\u2019t hold your breath on getting notification from the VA, at least not until Tonko\u2019s bill is passed.\n\nIf you were stationed at Fort Mac and are sick, go here: www.fortmcclellantoxicexposure.com, or search online for Fort McClellan toxins.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "We have another Camp LeJeune on our hands.
