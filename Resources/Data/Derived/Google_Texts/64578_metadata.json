So when people began predicting that the Obamacare exchanges might not get off to such a great start, he was there to correct them.\n\n\u201cI wanted to once again take the opportunity to lay down a marker and say once again that Obamacare implementation is going to be a huge political success,\u201d he wrote in July on his blog.\n\nBut so far, the implementation of Obamacare\u2019s online exchanges have gone anything but swell. Even liberals like former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs and Jon Stewart have noted as much. Liberal Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein straightforwardly called Obamacare\u2019s launch \u201ca failure.\u201d\n\nNow, everybody gets things wrong \u2014 I certainly have. But Yglesias\u2019 smugness on Twitter has engendered a lot of animus. So as you might imagine, Yglesias\u2019 Twitter haters are out in full force to remind him of his failed prediction. They\u2019ve even come up with a Twitter hashtag so they can imagine other failed predictions Yglesias may have made throughout history.
