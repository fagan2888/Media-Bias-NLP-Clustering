can pick one of 36 private insurance plans that the Obama administration says, on average, will cost around $286 a month.\n\nFor many that is still a lot of money, but Beth Heeb of the Consumer Health Coalition says there is some financial help for those making under $46,000 a year.\n\nUnder a somewhat complicated formula, those taxpayers will have their premiums reduced and \u201can individual can elect to take their credit in advance and have it go directly to the insurance company monthly to help pay for their monthly premium or they can elect to take it when they do their taxes in the form of a refund,\u201d Heeb told KDKA money editor Jon Delano.\n\nThere\u2019s even more help called cost-sharing for those who make under $29,000 if they choose the so-called silver plan of coverage.\n\nAll these subsidized premiums are expected to make health insurance more affordable.\n\nThat\u2019s key for many healthy young people who may want to skip signing up altogether.\n\n\u201cYoung adults sometimes get a bad rap because they make poor decisions,\u201d notes Heeb. \u201cOur hope is that individuals will realize that this is important, regardless of how old they are.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the law.\n\nFailure to have an insurance plan by March 31 means a penalty of $95 per adult or $47.50 per child, up to $285 per family \u2014 OR \u2014 one percent of family income, whichever is greater.\n\nWhile there are exceptions for those eligible for expanded Medicaid and those with religious or conscientious objection, for most, those penalties jump in 2016.\n\nThe penalty that year for failing to have health insurance is $695 dollars per adult, $347.50 per child, up to $2,085 per family \u2014 OR \u2014 2.5 percent of family income, whichever is greater.\n\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nHealth Exchanges Kick In Next Week (9/25/13)\n\nMore Reports by Jon Delano", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Tuesday, Pennsylvanians without health insurance can
