Even though most Americans are planning on using debit cards or cash in order to limit their spending or avoid building debt, it\u2019s a good idea to check out these promotions before casting aside your credit cards for the entire holiday season. Most of the companies are offering cashback or other types of rewards if you shop at a specific retailer or spend a certain amount.\n\nRelated: 12 Best Credit Cards for Travelers\n\nBelow are the promotions that the largest credit card issuers are offering this holiday season:\n\nAmerican Express\n\nCard members who enrolled in Membership Rewards can purchase an item worth at least $50 from Best Buy through the American Express Membership Rewards site; they\u2019ll receive a Best Buy e-gift card. The value of the cards range from $15-$300 and depend on the purchase made.\n\nPlatinum and Centurion Carb Members can also use Membership Rewards points for Once in a Lifetime experiential rewards and various products thru the end of the year.\n\nAlso, for the first time, Amazon is allowing American Express customers to purchase Amazon products with AMEX points.\n\nCapital One\n\nCardholders who are feeling the holiday spirit can use their rewards to donate to charities via Capital One\u2019s Giving Site. Capital One covers the transaction costs for every gift, so 100 percent of the donation goes to the charity.\n\nAny Uber rider that pays with a Capital One Quicksilver or QuicksilverOne card receives 20 percent back on all rides from now through April 20, 2016. Even though the deal isn\u2019t holiday-specific, it\u2019s a way to save money when getting around during the busy holiday season.\n\nChase\n\nUp until Dec. 31, all Chase Freedom cardholders will earn five percent cash back on up to $1,500 in combined purchases at Amazon.com, Zappos.com, audible.com, and diapers.com.\n\nCardholders of Chase Amazon.com Rewards Visa earn three percent back at Amazon.com, two percent back at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores and one percent back on all other purchases.\n\nRelated: Why That Store Credit Card Could Cost You Dearly\n\nCiti\n\nAfter card members purchase an eligible item with their Citi Price Rewind card, they can register the item on citi.com/pricerewind. Citi will look for 60 days after a purchase for a lower price. If it finds a lower price, card members must submit a claim and receipt for approval. Once the claim is approved, card members will receive a statement credit for the difference in price up to $300 per item and $1,200 per year.\n\nDiscover\n\nUp until the end of the year, enrolled card members can receive a 5 percent cashback bonus on up to $1,500 on combined purchases at Amazon.com, department stores and clothing stores. The bonus can be redeemed at any time for retail gift cards, a donation to a charity, a statement credit, an electronic deposit, or it can be used at a store checkout.\n\nWells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo Rewards customers can redeem points at the Earn Mall Mall and can earn up to 10 times bonus rewards if they buy goods there.
