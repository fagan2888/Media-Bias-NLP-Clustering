Scary moment for Australian surfer Mick Fanning at World Surf League’s J-Bay Open final in South Africa Sunday.

The 34-year-old was sitting on his board when a shark attacked him (Watch the video). Luckily, he escaped unharmed. Finalist Julian Wilson was also in the water, but both surfers were picked up by nearby safety boats.

WSL cancelled the event after the shark attack and released this statement:

“We are incredibly grateful that no one was seriously injured today. Mick’s composure and quick acting in the face of a terrifying situation was nothing short of heroic and the rapid response of our Water Safety personnel was commendable — they are truly world class at what they do.

“The safety of our athletes is a priority for the WSL and, after discussions with both Finalists, we have decided to cancel the remainder of competition at the J-Bay Open. We appreciate the ongoing support we have in South Africa and once again want to express our gratitude to the Water Safety Team.”
