Photo: Brett Hemmings\n\nOne of Sydney's most hotly anticipated New Year's Eve events was shelved at the last minute following major management failures and security oversights.\n\nAn investigation by Fairfax Media can reveal that, far from falling victim to technical difficulties or public transport issues as previously claimed, the event at Wet'n'Wild was cancelled six hours before its starting time after the venue failed to provide an adequate crowd safety management plan to police.\n\nIt's been a farce ... Unimet has never had the resources to cope.\n\nAs Village Roadshow and promoters One Cube prepared to lock horns in a legal blame game on Tuesday, a senior NSW Police source confirmed a ''risk assessment'' had identified ''deep concerns'' about event staffing and security.\n\nPretence: The message to Unimet Security staff, prompting them to act as though they didn't know who Brad Kisbee was. Photo: Supplied\n\nFair Trading investigators were also assessing information on the Prospect theme park's security supervisor Brad Kisbee, who played a role in a tender process that last October saw a lucrative on site contract awarded to Unimet Security, a company with which he had been involved for several years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Mr Kisbee said he was ''unable to say'' whether he had declared any ties when he helped Wet'n'Wild appoint contractors.\n\n''It's irrelevant,'' he said. ''Yes, I was involved in the interview process and final meetings. But I can assure you, I had no say on the actual selections.''\n\nMr Kisbee at last year's Unimet Christmas party.

Mr Kisbee, a former Blacktown Westfield security supervisor, was appointed.\n\nA tender invitation was also advertised by Village Roadshow for a security company, with appropriate expertise, to provide all-hours services across the theme park.\n\nThe scope of the tender included roaming patrols, VIP hosting and managing crowds of between ''15,000 to 20,000'' people. Although Unimet's traditional work involved static guard work at pubs and dog patrols in western Sydney and Wollongong, it bid for the tender.\n\nOne prominent security company owner, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ''I know of at least 30 companies, including a few big ones, who submitted a detailed tender for this.''\n\nHe said a fortnight after the October 11 closing date, he received a letter signed by Wet'n'Wild operations manager Bianca Sammut advising him the application was unsuccessful.\n\nMr Kisbee confirmed that, in the days that followed, he helped interview, and gave his ''opinions'' on, the five shortlisted companies. This included Unimet, which was awarded a contract with Reddawn, a company with which Unimet regularly shared jobs and staff.\n\n''There have been several formal complaints lodged to authorities about the process,'' one bidder said.\n\n''When this fellow's [Mr Kisbee] name surfaced as being the security manager at Wet'n'Wild and then it emerged who had won the contract \u2026 it became the talk of the industry.''\n\nWith contracts signed, Unimet appointed an operations manager, Darren Barrett, to assist in the transition of staff to the theme park.\n\nIn a message to employees on November 24, the eve of their induction training, Mr Barrett stated: ''Meet at the entry gate \u2026 it is highly important that they remember this is the first time that you are meeting the W&W security manager Mr Brad Kisbee. NO one has met him prior to the induction. Please respond to this message to ensure you have received and understood the above.''\n\nA Unimet source confirmed eight staff attended the following day and ''pretended'' never to have met Mr Kisbee. ''It's been a farce ever since,'' he said. ''Unimet has never had the resources to cope with the contract it received \u2026 and several staff left under the pressure.''\n\nOn Friday, Unimet director Natalie Eggenhuizen initially claimed Mr Kisbee had no connection with the company. But when told Fairfax Media had a Unimet business card displaying his name and current phone number, she said: ''He is not a silent partner \u2026 he was a consultant some time ago.''\n\nOf the message sent by Mr Barrett, who could not be reached by Fairfax Media, she said: ''I'm not Darren but I always tell staff that when you're meeting someone for the first time \u2026 to always be on your best behaviour.''\n\nVillage Roadshow spokesman Darrin Davies said final decisions were made by the general manager and operations manager of the park after ''a thorough and competitive tender process'' that included ''third party independent advice''.\n\nHe said Unimet was not appointed as part of the original tender process but in ''a secondary security role''.\n\nMr Kisbee said: ''Village Roadshow has told me not to speak further. But when my contract is up in April, I'll give the full story.''\n\nNearly 9000 ticket holders paid between $110 and $200 to attend the cancelled New Year's Eve party.\n\nDo you know more? eduff@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "One of Sydney's most hotly anticipated New Year's Eve events was shelved at the last minute following major management failures and security oversights.", "title": "Security alarm went off before Wet'n'Wild NYE party", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/security-alarm-went-off-before-wetnwild-nye-party-20140111-30nmh.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/n/w/f/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.30nmh.png/1389456000000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/n/w/f/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.30nmh.png/1389456000000.jpg"}, "description": "One of Sydney's most hotly anticipated New Year's Eve events was shelved at the last minute following major management failures and security oversights.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Security alarm went off before Wet'n'Wild NYE party"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "When the theme park selected a company to be responsible for its security, it immediately became the talk of the industry."}, "article_summary": "Pretence: The message to Unimet Security staff, prompting them to act as though they didn't know who Brad Kisbee was.\nMr Kisbee confirmed that, in the days that followed, he helped interview, and gave his ''opinions'' on, the five shortlisted companies.\nAdvertisementOn Friday, Mr Kisbee said he was ''unable to say'' whether he had declared any ties when he helped Wet'n'Wild appoint contractors.\nMr Kisbee said: ''Village Roadshow has told me not to speak further.\n''When this fellow's [Mr Kisbee] name surfaced as being the security manager at Wet'n'Wild and then it emerged who had won the contract \u2026 it became the talk of the industry.''"}
