While the figures are similar to polls in the 1990s and 2000s, Americans are sleeping much less now than during the 1940s. Today, on average, we get 6.8 hours of sleep a night, down more than an hour from 1942.\n\nOn top of that, a new study indicates that sleep patterns can directly impact longevity. When researchers examined the link between sleep and diet on mortality among the elderly, they found that while sleep is critical to men\u2019s longevity, women\u2019s diets impact longevity more. They studied nearly 2,000 people and found that for both sexes, a lack of quality sleep can lead to a poor diet and a decreased sense of well being.\n\nRelated: 10 Ways Sleep Is Now Big Business\n\n\u201cPoor sleep has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease,\u201d researcher Mark Wahlqvist of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said in a statement.\n\nOur chronically tired society has created a lucrative industry, which is why the American sleep economy recently climbed to $32.4 billion a year.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible, of course, for most of us to overhaul our nighttime sleep habits in the blink of an eye \u2013 that generally takes a dedicated, sustained effort, often with the help of professionals. Yet there\u2019s one relatively simple thing we can do to begin to pay down our sleep debt and, in the process, fix our productivity: Take a nap.\n\nWhile brief daytime naps won\u2019t completely compensate for inadequate or poor nighttime sleep, taking a regular snooze of 20 to 30 minutes can help improve our mood, alertness and performance, say the experts. If you\u2019re feeling sleepy during the day, \u201ca 20-minute nap can work wonders,\u201d said sleep specialist Patty Tucker of the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nRelated: A Good Night\u2019s Sleep Gives You An Edge at Work\n\nDr. Amanda Beck, a professor of sleep medicine at the University of New Mexico, said taking a nap \u201cis a good idea. Put a note on the door and nod out for 15 minutes. In a lot of ways, having a nap is a lot better than a cup of coffee,\u201d she told ABC News.\n\nNaps can be classified in three ways, according to the National Sleep Foundation:\n\nPlanned napping is taking a nap before you\u2019re sleepy, such as when you know you\u2019ll be up later than usual. It can be used to ward off tiredness later.\n\nEmergency napping is when you\u2019re suddenly so tired you can\u2019t continue with your current activity. This nap can help combat drowsy driving or fatigue brought on by physical labor.\n\nHabitual napping is taking a nap at the same time every day, such as naps taken by young children or naps by older adults right after lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany employers are becoming savvy to the benefits of napping and are looking anew at tiny closets or other seldom used spots and remodeling them into functional nap rooms. This is boosting a relatively new segment of the sleep industry.\n\nRelated: The Power of Positive Sleep Persuasion\n\nA company called MetroNaps, founded in 2003 to provide workplaces with \u201crest facilities,\u201d has installed specially designed sleep pods for such companies as Google, Huffington Post, the Arizona Diamondback baseball teams, and other organizations. After Wesleyan University in Connecticut put the company\u2019s \u201cenergy pods\u201d in its main library and science library, the feedback rolled in: \u201cThey\u2019ve been a huge hit,\u201d librarian Patricia Tully reported.\n\nStudents liked that the pods provided \u201cprivacy in a public space\u201d while letting them rest and recharge without having to trudge back to their dorms. \u201cThese \u2018energy pod\u2019 things might look like the hibernation capsules from the movie \u2018Alien,\u2019 but they provide a timeless napping experience,\u201d student Adam Keller wrote in The Wesleyan Argus, a campus publication.\n\nThere\u2019s also the \u201chappier worker\u201d issue. When Yarde Metals of Bristol, Conn., added nap rooms to new buildings, employee morale and productivity rose, \u201cespecially among shift workers,\u201d ABC News reported.\n\nExperts say letting workers take a quick nap doesn\u2019t have to be a big production. Even ultra-short six-minute naps can yield handsome benefits: They help improve declarative memory, allowing employees to recall key facts and knowledge more readily \u2013 not a bad thing at all.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Lose just one hour of sleep a night and you compromise your well-being, productivity,", "title": "The One Quick Way to Boost Worker Productivity", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/05/One-Quick-Way-Boost-Worker-Productivity", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07162012_sleep_nap_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/05/One-Quick-Way-Boost-Worker-Productivity", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07162012_sleep_nap_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Lose just one hour of sleep a night and you compromise your well-being, productivity,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc82b\"", "article_summary": "Lose just one hour of sleep a night and you compromise your well-being, productivity, and ability to think clearly, sleep experts say.\nWhen Yarde Metals of Bristol, Conn., added nap rooms to new buildings, employee morale and productivity rose, \u201cespecially among shift workers,\u201d ABC News reported.\nExperts say letting workers take a quick nap doesn\u2019t have to be a big production.\nYet there\u2019s one relatively simple thing we can do to begin to pay down our sleep debt and, in the process, fix our productivity: Take a nap.\nToday, on average, we get 6.8 hours of sleep a night, down more than an hour from 1942."}
