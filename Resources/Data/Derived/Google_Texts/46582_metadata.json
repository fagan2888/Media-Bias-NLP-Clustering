Enter the URL of the original Daily Dot story.\n\nLoverboy may have told us that we\u2019re \u201cworking for the weekend,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case with retail employees, who are on the clock seven days a week at all hours to accommodate demanding shoppers. This week, New York\u2019s attorney general is looking into \u201con call\u201d scheduling practices; meanwhile, across the nation in Alameda County, Calif., Walmart is facing wage theft charges. It\u2019s not a fun time to be one of the roughly 4.6 million retail workers in the United States.\n\nFortunately, the Internet is starting to change that, as many smart awareness campaigns like the Retail Action Project and Fight for $15 have taken to the Web to lobby for support. Such organizations are taking advantage of the Internet\u2019s capacity for pushing for social change to put pressure on retailers and generate awareness of the problems that plague the American workforce.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cGamestop will soon start selling classic games\u201d\n\nHere are seven of the biggest issues currently facing America\u2019s workers.\n\n1) Low pay\n\nIn 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported average wages of $10.29 per hour for retail workers. This above federal minimum wage but still below the minimum wages in some areas, like Seattle and San Francisco, both of which have approved $15 minimum wages; San Francisco is gradually escalating until it reaches $15 in 2018. However, this falls far below the so-called \u201cliving wage,\u201d the amount of money workers need to survive comfortably in a given region.\n\nFast food workers have been heavily involved in the Fight For $15 campaign, but retail workers need living wages, too. Without fair pay, people are driven to work multiple jobs to support themselves. That means more stress and less time at home, especially when combined with issues like abusive scheduling practices and limited employee benefits. In particular, action campaigns related to pay have utilized Twitter to particular effect for organizing via hashtags to create mass in-person rallies across the U.S.\n\n2) Part-time scheduling\n\nThe abuse of part-time employment and scheduling practices is a perennial problem in the retail industry. Hiring multiple part-time employees tends to be less costly than hiring full-timers, especially if a company offers benefits; keeping hours just below the part-time limit ensures that an employee isn\u2019t entitled to health care subsidies, sick days, and other benefits options. In regions where municipalities haven\u2019t moved to aggressively promote employee benefits\u2014San Francisco\u2019s mandatory health care for employees is an example\u2014retail employees are often forced to spread themselves thin across several workplaces to make ends meet.\n\nEmployment in multiple locations adds considerable stress, and cuts into time at home and interpersonal relationships. A worker running between two or more jobs is less able to focus on tasks outside the workplace\u2014including organizing for better working conditions. It\u2019s hard to lobby for workers\u2019 rights if you don\u2019t have the time because you\u2019re juggling three jobs.\n\n3) Anti-organizing practices\n\nMany major corporations are involved in union suppression and anti-organizing practices, such as misleading employees about what can happen under unionization and intimidating organizers. Walmart is one major offender, and the company is in the news not just because of the Alameda County suit, but because during the years Hillary Clinton sat on Walmart\u2019s board, she said little on the subject of its anti-union activities. Instead, she watched the company suppress labor organizing. That could become a contentious issue in the election, as Democrats have historically relied on union support.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cThe first \u2018Batman v Superman\u2019 trailer just leaked\u201d\n\nThis is a particular acute problem in \u201cright to work\u201d states, which claim that unions pressure employees to join and pay dues if they want to remain employed. The issue has become particularly high profile in Wisconsin, where Republican contender Scott Walker has overseen a number of regressive employment reforms in recent years. Contrary to the name, \u201cright to work\u201d isn\u2019t about the right to employment at all, but it does weaken labor unions, as Jim Zarroli reports at NPR. Such laws, Business Insider\u2019s Rick Ungar notes , perpetuate the myth of the closed shop\u2014a workplace where new hires \u201cmust become a member of the union within a stated period of time or lose their job.\u201d\n\n4) Wage theft\n\nIn Walmart\u2019s case, the firm is avoid paying part-time workers by shifting additional work onto assistant managers, thus depriving part-timers of pay. Because these workers are paid on a salaried and not hourly basis, they accrue overtime without receiving overtime wages, representing a significant savings to the corporation. This is just one among many tactics used to squeeze unpaid hours out of workers, and as Steven Greenhouse reports at the New York Times, workers are fighting back. Critically, he noted, regulatory agencies \u201cassert that more companies are violating wage laws than ever before, pointing to the record number of enforcement actions they have pursued.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "From wage theft to anti-organizing practices, our largest employers are shafting their workers at every turn VIDEO", "title": "It\u2019s worse than Wal-Mart: 7 ways retail jobs exploit (and steal) from their employees", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From wage theft to anti-organizing practices, our largest employers are shafting their workers at every turn VIDEO", "title": "It\u2019s worse than Wal-Mart: 7 ways retail jobs exploit (and steal) from their employees", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/18/its_worse_than_wal_mart_7_ways_retail_jobs_exploit_and_steal_from_their_employees_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_186861932.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From wage theft to anti-organizing practices, our largest employers are shafting their workers at every turn VIDEO", "title": "It\u2019s worse than Wal-Mart: 7 ways retail jobs exploit (and steal) from their employees", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_186861932.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "s.e. smith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Capitalism, Labor, Labor unions, the daily dot, Unions, Video, wage theft, Walmart, workforce", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb987\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Capitalism, Labor, Labor unions, the daily dot, Unions, Video, wage theft, Walmart, workforce, Business NewsThis article originally appeared on The Daily Dot .\nIt\u2019s not a fun time to be one of the roughly 4.6 million retail workers in the United States.\nFast food workers have been heavily involved in the Fight For $15 campaign, but retail workers need living wages, too.\n1) Low payIn 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported average wages of $10.29 per hour for retail workers.\nLoverboy may have told us that we\u2019re \u201cworking for the weekend,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case with retail employees, who are on the clock seven days a week at all hours to accommodate demanding shoppers."}
