Drake, a 28-year-old Toronto native, has said he was deeply affected by a news report on the challenges faced by the Philadelphia students.\n\nAlthough the studio was finished last summer, Principal Linda Cliatt-Wayman said budget problems and the school\u2019s reputation for violence made it hard to find an instructor. At long last, part-time music teacher Ben Diamond arrived in early February.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were going to be ready to go in September. They\u2019ve been dying to get in\u201d to the studio, Wayman said of the students.\n\nDrake became involved after ABC News aired a program focusing on Wayman\u2019s tough-love efforts to improve the school, which serves one of the city\u2019s poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods. Campus assaults have dropped dramatically since Wayman arrived two years ago, but academics and resources remain a struggle. Less than a quarter of Strawberry Mansion students perform at grade level in math and reading.\n\nWhen Drake came to Philadelphia during a concert tour in October 2013, he invited members of the school community to a private gathering before the show. There, he surprised them by announcing the gift.\n\n\u201cThis is about you. This is about your principal. This is about your future,\u201d Drake said as his guests screamed with joy. \u201cI love you. I care about you. I want to see you succeed.\u201d\n\nBuilding the studio meant purchasing new keyboards, acoustical accessories and other equipment, plus cleaning and painting long-disused sound booths at Strawberry Mansion. Members of Drake\u2019s crew completed the work over the summer, according to Wayman.\n\nYet the gear sat untouched throughout the fall, she said. And when Diamond finally began teaching studio production last month, interest was lukewarm - until Wayman used the school\u2019s public address system to broadcast the debut song recorded in the facility.\n\nThat made students realize the long-rumored equipment actually existed, she said. About 50 teens signed up.\n\n\u201cYou have to prove everything to them,\u201d said Wayman. \u201cSo many people disappoint them.\u201d\n\nJosiah Showell, a junior who specializes in beats, teamed up with freshman Zalmir Deputy on keyboards and senior rapper Jerrick Fripps to record a tune within days of first entering the studio.\n\nPreviously, Showell had only composed music on his phone - and he never shared the tracks with anyone. But, he said, \u201cthe studio inspired me to bring out the love of music that I have inside me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout the studio, no one would still know I do music,\u201d said Showell, 17.\n\nThe equipment isn\u2019t fancy or expensive, nor was it intended to be, according to Wayman. It offers basic music technology and guidance to a population that might not otherwise have access to it.\n\n\u201cMany of them don\u2019t have very many other reasons to be excited about coming to school,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cTo be able to give them an outlet for things they want to express is very special.\u201d\n\nDeputy, 15, thanked Drake for his generosity and hopes the performer might visit one day.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate it \u2026 because this is what we needed,\u201d Deputy said.\n\nRepresentatives for Drake, whose new album \u201cIf You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late\u201d came out Feb. 13, did not return requests for comment. The rapper is also featured on the song \u201cAmen\u201d by Strawberry Mansion alum Meek Mill.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kathy Matheson at www.twitter.com/kmatheson", "article_metadata": {"description": "A troubled city high school has finally heard the sound of music coming from a recording studio donated by Drake after a monthslong search for a teacher to run it.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A troubled city high school has finally heard the sound of music coming from a recording studio donated by Drake after a monthslong search for a teacher to run it.", "title": "Students begin using recording studio donated by Drake", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/10/students-begin-using-recording-studio-donated-by-d/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/10/e9d9206e1dd85e0b700f6a7067005ebe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/10/e9d9206e1dd85e0b700f6a7067005ebe.jpg", "description": "A troubled city high school has finally heard the sound of music coming from a recording studio donated by Drake after a monthslong search for a teacher to run it.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Students begin using recording studio donated by Drake"}, "Author": "KATHY MATHESON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc00c\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019ve been dying to get in\u201d to the studio, Wayman said of the students.\nLess than a quarter of Strawberry Mansion students perform at grade level in math and reading.\nThe Grammy-winning rapper gave $75,000 to help create the space at Strawberry Mansion High School, district officials said.\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - A troubled city high school has finally heard the sound of music coming from a recording studio donated by Drake after a monthslong search for a teacher to run it.\nThe rapper is also featured on the song \u201cAmen\u201d by Strawberry Mansion alum Meek Mill."}
