This car crash death happened to coincide with the timing of Jenner\u2019s transgender announcement and already, some are mocking the new lawsuit saying it is simply a case of Jenner \u201cdriving like a woman.\u201d\n\nIn a related report by the Inquisitr, Bruce Jenner\u2019s car crash was caught on video. According to reports, Jenner was not using his cell phone and he was not speeding, but it appears as though Jenner saw slow moving traffic in front of him and steered his Cadillac Escalade in order to avoid the traffic jam. Unfortunately, the car accident caused a chain reaction and Kim Howe\u2019s vehicle was propelled into oncoming traffic and she was hit head-on by a Hummer.\n\nAs of this publishing, Bruce Jenner\u2019s suit has not received any comment, although Jenner had previously released a statement apologizing for the Malibu car crash.\n\n\u201cMy heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident,\u201d Jenner said in the statement according to KTLA. \u201cIt is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, some have used Bruce Jenner\u2019s lawsuit as an occasion for forced levity. Over on Twitter, some people have begun repeating the same type of joke.\n\n\u201cLooks like Bruce Jenner already driving like a woman.\u201d \u201cBruce Jenner got in a car crash and someone died? Already driving like a woman I see.\u201d \u201cBruce Jenner\u2019s transformation is almost complete! He\u2019s already driving like a woman. (RELAX PEOPLE JUST A BAD JOKE)\u201d\n\nWriting for The Federalist, a former transgender person named Walt Heyer claims Bruce Jenner\u2019s sex change in combination with the lawsuit and other factors will only lead to regret years down the road.\n\n\u201cNo one knows how Jenner\u2019s story will end. Two deaths, a gender transition, divorce, and a pending trial could psychologically derail the best of us. The odds are that Jenner\u2019s life, like that of many transvestites who transition, will experience the euphoria of extraordinary highs in the beginning followed years later by a downward spiral\u2026. We should all be concerned for Jenner. A whopping 41 percent of transgenders report attempting suicide.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, Bruce Jenner\u2019s suit is seeking unspecified damages and the cost of the lawsuit. Although the accident involved four vehicles, the family of Kimberly Howe claims she was not at fault in any manner. The car accident remains under investigation by police.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bruce Jenner's suit from the family of Kimberly Howe alleges that the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was \"careless and negligent\" when he crashed his", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Bruce Jenner\u2019s suit from the family of Kimberly Howe alleges that the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was \u201ccareless and negligent\u201d when he crashed his", "title": "Bruce Jenner Suit Mocked For \u2018Driving Like A Woman\u2019 After Car Crash Death", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2059896/bruce-jenner-suit-mocked-for-driving-like-a-woman-after-car-crash-death/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bruce-Jenner-Suit-Mocked-For-Driving-Like-A-Woman-After-Car-Crash-Death.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T11:33:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-02T11:41:55+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bruce-Jenner-Suit-Mocked-For-Driving-Like-A-Woman-After-Car-Crash-Death.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-05-02T11:33:07+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "bruce jenner,celebrity news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bruce-Jenner-Suit-Mocked-For-Driving-Like-A-Woman-After-Car-Crash-Death.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bruce Jenner\u2019s suit from the family of Kimberly Howe alleges that the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was \u201ccareless and negligent\u201d when he crashed his"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLooks like Bruce Jenner already driving like a woman.\u201d \u201cBruce Jenner got in a car crash and someone died?\nI will continue to cooperate in every way possible.\u201dUnfortunately, some have used Bruce Jenner\u2019s lawsuit as an occasion for forced levity.\nAs of this publishing, Bruce Jenner\u2019s suit has not received any comment, although Jenner had previously released a statement apologizing for the Malibu car crash.\nA whopping 41 percent of transgenders report attempting suicide.\u201dAccording to reports, Bruce Jenner\u2019s suit is seeking unspecified damages and the cost of the lawsuit.\nAlready driving like a woman I see.\u201d \u201cBruce Jenner\u2019s transformation is almost complete!"}
