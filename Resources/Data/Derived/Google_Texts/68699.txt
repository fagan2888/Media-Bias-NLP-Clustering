President Obama on Tuesday went out on the stump to, once again, sell his signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act. As TheBlaze’s Eddie Scarry pointed out, that means, namely, reaching out to Republicans who “watch the wrong newscast” and other friends who aren’t paying attention, “because they’re on one of the other channels that has ‘Real Housewives’ or something.”

It’s relieving to know the Democrats at least have a plan.

But leave it to President Obama to dismiss one group of voters as uninformed while showing just how uninformed he is himself.

Does he know that Bravo, the network responsible for the ‘Housewives’ franchises, is the 9th most watched network among 25-54 year olds? This year, the Real Housewives of Atlanta gave Bravo its most watched night ever, averaging more than 4.5 million viewers, 2.7 of which were in the coveted 18-49 demo. That means that in one night, more people watched the Real Housewives than have signed up for Obamacare.

But most importantly, young people have made Bravo wildly popular, and they are the very demographic the President needs to make Obamacare work.
