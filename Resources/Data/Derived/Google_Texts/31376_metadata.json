Make no mistake: advancing democracy and respect for human rights is central to our foreign policy. It\u2019s what our history and our values demand, but it\u2019s also profoundly in our interests.\u201d\n\nSeveral Catholic dioceses in the United States, private companies and non-profit groups are suing the Obama administration over the Obamacare mandate requiring requiring insurance to provide free coverage of abortion-inducing drugs, contraception and sterilization.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case from two family-owned companies, the Oklahoma-based arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby and the Pennsylvania-based Conestoga Wood Specialties Store Corp., both of which argue that paying for employee-based coverage of these drug violates their religious freedom.\n\nRice mentioned abuses of freedom to worship in China, at a time when Vice President Joe Biden is visiting the country.\n\n\u201cWhen ethnic and religious minorities\u2014such as Tibetans and Uighurs\u2014are denied their fundamental freedoms, the trust that holds diverse societies together is undermined,\u201d Rice said. \u201cSuch abuses diminish China\u2019s potential from the inside.\u201d\n\nA White House news release to mark the Rice speech highlighted the administration\u2019s human rights record that referenced problems abroad that are certainly more severe than complaints in the United States regarding freedoms stated in the First Amendment freedoms.\n\nThe White House release states the State Department spends $10 million per year on foreign assistance programs to promote religious freedom by tackling discriminatory material in Middle Eastern school textbooks and trying increase understanding of religious minorities.\n\nFurther, the White House release states that \u201cU.S. officials press foreign governments at all levels to advance religious freedom, including through advocacy on specific cases, such as the case of Saeed Abedini\u2014an Iranian-American pastor imprisoned in Iran\u2014and Rimsha Masih\u2014a Christian child accused of blasphemy in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nIt also touted an aggressive pushed for Internet freedom, stating there have been about $120 million in Internet freedom grants from the State Department since 2008.\n\n\u201cThe United States helped to organize the Freedom Online Coalition, a cross-regional group of 21 governments that collaborate on Internet freedom,\u201d the news release said. \u201cThe U.S. and the Freedom Online Coalition worked to pass, by unanimous consensus, a landmark 2012 resolution in the U.N. Human Rights Council affirming that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online.\u201d\n\nStill, the Obama Justice Department has been criticized since May for labeling Fox News reporter James Rosen a \u201cco-conspirator\u201d in a leak investigation and for obtaining phone records from Associated Press journalists.\n\nJust last month, the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and several news organizations issued a letter to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney about blocking news photographers from events, and increasing the number of official White House-approved photos for public consumption. The letter said, \u201cTo exclude the press from these functions is a major break from how previous administrations have worked with the press.\u201d\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Amid domestic litigation over religious liberty at home regarding the Obamacare contraception mandate, the Obama administration touted its defense of freedom to worship abroad.
