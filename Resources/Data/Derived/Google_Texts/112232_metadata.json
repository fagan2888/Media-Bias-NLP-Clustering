Lifeguards then used \"Jetski\"-type watercraft to tow the kayaks back to shore at about 9 a.m.\n\n2014 SoCal Images in the News\n\nThe rescue was a joint operation of lifeguards from Ventura and Los Angeles counties, and California State Parks.\n\nParamedics examined the kayakers at Countyline Beach and pronounced them fine. Lifeguards said the people had been fishing just west of the Los Angeles-Ventura county line.\n\nWinds had been calm in western Malibu at 7 a.m., but were blowing at up to 50 miles per hour at Leo Carrillo Beach, straight out to sea, when the rescue occurred.\n\nIn Malibu, power lines were reported down on Latigo Canyon Road, one mile uphill from Pacific Coast Highway. Traffic was getting through in the area, a deputy said, and no fire was reported.\n\n\"When the winds are blowing offshore, it's a bad time to kayak,\" observed LA County Lifeguards Capt. Dan Murphy. \"Make sure to have a signal device, and a personal flotation device.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, four paddleboarders were reported in distress to LA County lifeguards at around 11:30 a.m.\n\nThey were out in sustained 45 mph winds that stopped them from paddling back to shore, so the Malibu watch boat picked them up.\n\nThe hurricane-force, 81 mph wind gust was reported at a Mesonet weather station operated by a homeowner near Saddle Peak, at the 1,500 foot elevation. It was reported on the National Weather Service website at 10:15 a.m. That was not an official NWS reading, however.\n\nAlong the beach, palm fronds, eucalyptus branches and tumbleweeds were observed blowing across PCH at 8 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six kayakers were blown a mile out to sea, and rescued by squid fishing boat crews, as 50 mile per hour Santa Ana winds cropped up suddenly in Malibu Sunday.", "title": "Kayakers Blown Out to Sea Rescued by Squid-Fishing Boats", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "Six kayakers were blown a mile out to sea, and rescued by squid fishing boat crews, as 50 mile per hour Santa Ana winds cropped up suddenly in Malibu Sunday.", "title": "Fishermen Save Kayakers from Windy Odyssey", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Kayakers-Blown-Out-to-Sea-Rescued-by-Squid-Fishing-Boats-283637131.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/squid-boat.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Six kayakers were blown a mile out to sea, and rescued by squid fishing boat crews, as 50 mile per hour Santa Ana winds cropped up suddenly in Malibu Sunday.", "title": "Fishermen Save Kayakers from Windy Odyssey", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Kayakers-Blown-Out-to-Sea-Rescued-by-Squid-Fishing-Boats-283637131.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/squid-boat.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "los angeles, la news, la breaking news, breaking news in la, la local news, la, news la, news in la, news, latest news, southern california, nbc", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c41\"", "article_summary": "Six kayakers were blown a mile out to sea, and rescued by squid fishing boat crews, as 50-mile-per-hour Santa Ana winds cropped up suddenly in Malibu Sunday.\nSquid-fishing boats are lit up in this file photo from 2010 from Broad Beach in West Malibu.\nEarlier in the day, four paddleboarders were reported in distress to LA County lifeguards at around 11:30 a.m.\nAt least two of the kayaks were snared by the squid fleet to prevent them from being blown further out to sea.\n\"When the winds are blowing offshore, it's a bad time to kayak,\" observed LA County Lifeguards Capt."}
