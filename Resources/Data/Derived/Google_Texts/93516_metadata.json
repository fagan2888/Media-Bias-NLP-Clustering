Again, this is all according to European news sources, not based on any perceptions thathas been known to occasionally employ.As the town watched, the Costa Concordia struck big underwater rocks which turned the ship on its side meaning half the lifeboats could not be launched, forcing passengers to jump into the sea.So what did this grand ship master do? He quickly abandoned ship before his passengers were safe, to save his own hide first, according to media reports. Thirty two people died.

Indeed, if one leaves in less than a year, that same gigantic pension goes to them for life, from our taxpayer money, as veterans are dying for lack of the medical care they were promised.told of a truck carrying condoms that overturned on a highway going intoAn account of the driver and loss of thousands of condoms that spilled out on the highway stated:Another recent CC Times headline got a snicker fromReally? The man didn't just lock himself in that trunk? Especially since the man was dead with signs of trauma to his body. Superb analytical thinking.The best reports of all come from. One based in New York told us of a transsexual who flamboyantly glided into the plane with a flair.
