Hospital leaders said the new clinic is necessary to address a longstanding shortage of access to non-critical health care for Islanders.\n\nIn a conversation with The Times on Wednesday, Tim Walsh, hospital CEO, and Dr. Jeffrey Zack, director of emergency medical services, discussed this newest addition to an expanding scope of services that the hospital now offers.\n\nThe hospital officials said the addition of a walk-in clinic would provide an alternative to the emergency room and become part of a continuum of care that includes emergency care, primary care and inpatient care overseen by hospitalists, all linked by a system of electronic medical record keeping under the umbrella of the hospital\u2019s parent organisation, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which now provides the Vineyard hospital with radiology, anesthesiology and oncology services.\n\nIn March 2007, Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital became an affiliate of Massachusetts General Hospital and a member of Partners HealthCare.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a system-wide overhaul that we\u2019ve been doing over the last few years to better accommodate the needs of our patients on the medical end and also the financial end,\u201d Dr. Zack said. \u201cThe goal here is to design a system that can cover from the very sickest to the non-critical patients, and the walk-in facility has been a big hole in our delivery system.\u201d\n\nDr. Zack said all too often, patients utilize the emergency room (ER) because they may not have a primary care doctor. \u201cEmergency medicine is here for the sickest of the sick, yet over the last 10, 20 years we\u2019ve started to take care of everybody. We do a lot of primary care, especially here on the Island. It isn\u2019t the most cost-effective way to deliver quality care. This [walk-in clinic] fills that need of \u2018not too sick but can\u2019t wait for an office visit in a week.\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Zack said that the walk-in clinic will also help manage the surge in patients when there\u2019s an outbreak of the flu or a virus like the one currently spreading in the midwest. \u201cHistorically this overflow would go into the ER, which diverts resources and is a costly way to practice medicine. But up until now, there\u2019s been very little options for folks on the Island.\u201d\n\nStaffing and hours\n\nThe medical personnel staffing the walk-in clinic will be a mixture of physicians and mid-level providers, such as physician\u2019s assistants and nurse practitioners. Mr. Walsh said the hours of operation will be tailored to demand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to study and figure out the hours as we go along,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a need to stay open after hours, we\u2019ll see what we can build around that. We\u2019re hoping to play off the community. If there\u2019s a real need to keep it open, say, until 7pm at night, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019re open to figuring that one out.\u201d\n\nLong range benefits\n\nIn addition to the benefits in patient care and cost containment, Mr. Walsh said the clinic will help balance the books in the long term as well.\n\n\u201cLooking down the road at the Affordable Care Act, and where they\u2019re trying to go, it\u2019s really about population health management,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a given population you\u2019re responsible for everything that happens to them. We\u2019re rethinking how you do it. They want to do global payments in the future, for every person that comes into your system they\u2019ll pay you $25,000 a year \u2014 you take care of the health care. Right now, it\u2019s about volume, the more you do, the more you make. That\u2019s going to change to: the more you do, the more your expenses are. So you\u2019re not making more money. That\u2019s where a walk-in clinic can save money. A $300-dollar visit to the ER can be done instead for $100.\u201d\n\nMr. Walsh said the goal is to make the walk-in clinic operational by next summer at the latest. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can get it in by next February, but we got sidetracked with repairs to the air handling system in Wing 1 in the beginning of the summer. Replacing a new unit costs over $700,000. The next move will be to install air transfer in the old ER It\u2019s interesting times around here.\u201d\n\nIncreased demand\n\nThe walk-in clinic is the latest in a series of improvements and upgrades. These include the addition of a new MGH oncology unit, the recently completed $2 million transfer to electronic record keeping, and a $1 million investment in hiring hospitalists, doctors who solely treat hospital inpatients and thus provide consistent care and free up overwhelmed primary care doctors.\n\nThe expanding system was put to the test this summer, which according to hospital statistics, was the busiest in the hospital\u2019s history. Patient days in acute care were up 28 percent, and patient days in skilled nursing facilities (SNF) were up 74.4 percent.\n\n\u201cWe were busting at the seams,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cBecause of our expanded services like the hospitalists, we were able to hold on to more patients here and not transfer off-Island. The ICU was much busier. It\u2019s stunning how much volume we did. We were boarding in the ER, which is unusual for us. We had it happen in the past but not to this extent. Not even close.\u201d\n\nOne goal is to avoid transfers to mainland hospitals when possible. \u201cI don\u2019t think the number of patients went up significantly; it\u2019s the number of people we\u2019re keeping in the system,\u201d Dr. Zack said. \u201cThat\u2019s the overall goal here. Our patients don\u2019t want to go to Boston. They want to stay here with their families. So we\u2019re adding more resources one bit at a time so we\u2019re able to do that. Now looking at the big picture, we need to address the lower acuity stuff.\u201d\n\nDoc docs\n\nThe recent conversion to electronic records will enable the growing departments within the hospital, and partner hospitals off-Island, to instantly access critical medical information within the Partners Healthcare network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an all-in-one system,\u201d Dr. Zack said. \u201cThere\u2019s no fishing around at 2 am trying to find information \u2014 it\u2019s there. That time can be important, and maybe life-saving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you go from here to Mass General, they see the primary care records, the ER records, they see everything. And vise versa: when the patient comes back, we see everything they did in Boston,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. If the hospital shows \u201cmeaningful use\u201d of the electronic records system, according to an upcoming Medicare evaluation, it will receive a significant rebate to defray the cost of the system.\n\nChoice is good\n\nMr. Walsh and Dr. Zack said the recent sale of Vineyard Medical Services, presently the only walk-in clinic on the Island, had no bearing on today\u2019s announcement. \u201cThis has been on my radar for two years,\u201d Dr. Zack said. \u201cFor us the hospitalist program was more important to get up and running; so that took precedence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI talked to Dr. Jacobs several times over the years about buying his practice as a satellite facility,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cI like Dr. Jacobs, he\u2019s a great guy. We\u2019ve always had a really good relationship. The problem is the licensures. When you\u2019re talking about a hospital satellite, you have to meet hospital code, and the standards are brutal, as they should be. The air-exchanges demands are extremely high. I don\u2019t think any house could meet them.\u201d\n\nMr. Walsh is supportive of the new walk-in venture. \u201cIt\u2019s good for people to have choice. It\u2019s on us to deliver a good product,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Martha's Vineyard Times", "description": "The Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital has begun renovating the no-longer-used emergency room in the old hospital building for use as a walk-in clinic.
