KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) â€” Martin Truex Jr. raced to the front of the Sprint Cup race at Kansas Speedway on Saturday night before a band of rain brought out the yellow flag with 169 laps to go.

The 267-lap race was delayed just after a caution came out for Jeb Burton, who got loose and slid sideways for the second time. Most leaders went to the pits, but many drivers who were a lap down remained on the track to get back on the lead lap.

Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch, Kasey Kahne and Kyle Larson rounded out the top five.

Pole-sitter Joey Logano, who had been running near the front, was shuffled to the back due to a penalty for one of his crew members going over the pit wall early.
