Jurors on Friday returned with a guilty verdict after hours of deliberating the fate of a Tulsa man.

Tyrone Woodfork was found guilty on all seven counts he faced in the case of 84-year-old Nancy Strait, who he raped and killed, as well as the beating of her husband during a home invasion robbery two years ago.

Woodfork broke into the Strait's home off of East Virgin Street, stole their belongs and car.

Jurors were behind closed doors for hours when they returned finding Woodfork guilty of felony murder, burglary, two counts of robbery, assault with a dangerous weapon and two counts of first-degree rape against Nancy Strait in March 2012.

Bob Strait later died from his injuries.

Attorneys spent much of Friday interviewing detectives and a medical examiner who conducted the investigation.

The jury found Woodfork not guilty on a lesser charge of attempted rape.
