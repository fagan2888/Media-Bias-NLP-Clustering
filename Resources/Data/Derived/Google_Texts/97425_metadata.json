It moved the storied house in a younger direction.\n\nBut the sparkling celebrities and clothes were, alas, victim to the biggest fashion upstaging of the season. The culprit: one a gargantuan prima donna that will outlive them all - the brand-new, hundred-million dollar Louis Vuitton Foundation art museum and cultural center.\n\nHere are the highlights and show reports of the final day of spring-summer 2015 shows, including Miu Miu, Carine Roitfeld\u2019s party with Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber, and designer Christophe Lemaire\u2019s final show for Hermes.\n\nLOUIS VUITTON FOUNDATION UNVEILED FOR 1ST TIME\n\nGlistening in the morning sun in west Paris - with billowing glass casing and white concrete panels - the near-12,000 square meter building designed by Frank Gehry had guests stopping in their tracks, mouths open.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, it really is,\u201d said one guest, Long Nguyen, who stopped to take a photo.\n\nAt a cost of well over 100 million euros ($126 million) the edifice, which has been compared to an iceberg or giant sailboat took over a decade to make. It will have 11 gallery spaces of different sizes and opens officially at the end of October.\n\nThe man behind it is billionaire Bernard Arnault, France\u2019s richest man and head of the world\u2019s biggest luxury group, Louis Vuitton parent company, LVMH.\n\nArnault commissioned it to house his vast contemporary art collection. The building, decorated with \u201cL\u2019s\u201d and \u201cV\u2019s,\u201d has been branded a tycoon\u2019s \u201cvanity project\u201d by the media.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s one of the most exciting, avant-garde Parisian architectural projects in years.\n\nLOUIS VUITTON\u2018S NEW CHAPTER IS YOUNG AND FUN\n\nThe collection opened with great classic \u201860s white lace, high neck mini dresses - with a sporty feel - and looks that had black ribbons round the neck.\n\nThe Swinging Sixties-musing continued elsewhere in some nice velvet looks and a pair of enviable russet cropped pants.\n\nThere was also a nod to this on-trend Balkan, ethnic look in zigzag detailing, Grecian embroidery and thick lacing down the torso - that has been on high rotation this season. Those were the hits.\n\nThe several misses included looks with sometimes-clashing colors and textures - such as a garish, shiny eel skin mini dress in thick orange and black stripes.\n\nWhat\u2019s apparent is that Ghesquiere\u2019s vibe is much younger and much more \u201cfun\u201d than that of Jacobs.\n\nThe question is: will this please Vuitton\u2019s older (and more monied) clientele?\n\nSTYLIST CARINE ROITFELD WEARS SHADES AFTER LATE NIGHT\n\nFormer editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris, Carine Roitfeld was seen wearing big, dark shades at the Vuitton early morning show.\n\nLate the night before, the stylist with the gold contacts book had been partying at the launch of her latest project, \u201cCR Fashion Book 5.\u201d\n\nIt was the most glamorous night of the Paris season with a surprise DJ set by Paris Hilton.\n\nThe guest list was a roll call of stars.\n\nKim Kardashian, in a revealing black tuxedo, posed with a coiffed Justin Bieber.\n\nWhile upcoming model, and Kardashian sibling, Kendall Jenner sipped drinks with her mom, Kris Jenner, near Karl Lagerfeld and Baz Luhrmann.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if Kris spoke to Lagerfeld about the fact she was seated on the back row of Tuesday\u2019s Chanel show.\n\nHERMES DESIGNER\u2019S SWAN SONG\n\nIt was an emotional farewell for Christophe Lemaire - the man at the creative helm of jet-set powerhouse Hermes since 2010, who has successfully pushed the brand in the direction of pared-back elegance.\n\nThe French-born designer played it safe for his swan song, in a collection that played with wrapping.\n\nA gentle, sleeved long classical gown in off-white opened the show which softly moved into an enviable scarf-wrap silhouette.\n\nA voluminous jersey in mustard yellow possessed a graceful kinetic upward sweep as the fabric swirled around the neck and hung down.\n\nThe loose, printed and patterned dresses didn\u2019t quite hit the same mark.\n\nBut Lemaire finished his cadence at one of the world\u2019s most iconic houses on a harmonious cadence.\n\nMIU MIU\u2018S MAGIC COLOR SUBSTITUTION\n\nMiuccia Prada\u2019s show for Prada\u2019s little sister brand, Miu Miu, was all about playful - and colorful - substitution.\n\nThe formula for the first looks: unfitted coat, ruffled silk blouse, knee length skirt. The colors rotated.\n\nThe skirt was beige, the coat white; you blinked - and like a magic trick, the skirt became white, the coat beige. The same for the red and black shirts.\n\nMistress of subtle details, Madama Prada was winking at guests throughout the whole show.\n\nIn the silhouette, midriffs were often exposed, with plunging necklines and cool tulle boob tubes.\n\nBlown up colorful tartan worked a treat, especially near the \u201850s-tinged finale with white circular lapel coats.\n\nA lovely collection.\n\n___\n\nThomas Adamson can be followed at http://Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louis Vuitton's show caused traffic chaos early Wednesday with photographers clambering to get the must-have shot of guests Jennifer Connelly, Selena Gomez, Sofia Coppola and Michelle Williams.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Louis Vuitton\u2019s show caused traffic chaos early Wednesday with photographers clambering to get the must-have shot of guests Jennifer Connelly, Selena Gomez, Sofia Coppola and Michelle Williams.", "title": "Bieber, Kardashian, Vuitton $100M venue wrap Paris", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/1/louis-vuitton-100m-venue-outshines-show-celebs/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/01/1b49580397804126610f6a706700a60d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/01/1b49580397804126610f6a706700a60d.jpg", "description": "Louis Vuitton's show caused traffic chaos early Wednesday with photographers clambering to get the must-have shot of guests Jennifer Connelly, Selena Gomez, Sofia Coppola and Michelle Williams.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bieber, Kardashian, Vuitton $100M venue wrap Paris"}, "Author": "THOMAS ADAMSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Paris, Christophe Lemaire, Miu Miu, Louis Vuitton, Hermes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b8b\"", "article_summary": "MIU MIU\u2018S MAGIC COLOR SUBSTITUTIONMiuccia Prada\u2019s show for Prada\u2019s little sister brand, Miu Miu, was all about playful - and colorful - substitution.\nHere are the highlights and show reports of the final day of spring-summer 2015 shows, including Miu Miu, Carine Roitfeld\u2019s party with Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber, and designer Christophe Lemaire\u2019s final show for Hermes.\nThe skirt was beige, the coat white; you blinked - and like a magic trick, the skirt became white, the coat beige.\nLate the night before, the stylist with the gold contacts book had been partying at the launch of her latest project, \u201cCR Fashion Book 5.\u201dIt was the most glamorous night of the Paris season with a surprise DJ set by Paris Hilton.\nThe culprit: one a gargantuan prima donna that will outlive them all - the brand-new, hundred-million dollar Louis Vuitton Foundation art museum and cultural center."}
