We\u2019re calling it the New College Compact. Here are the basics:\n\n\n\n-Under the New College Compact, no student should have to borrow to pay tuition at a public college.\n\n-Schools will have to control their costs and show more accountability to their students.\n\n-States will have to meet their obligation to invest in higher education.\n\n-The federal government will increase its investment in education, and won\u2019t profit off student loans.\n\n-And millions with student debt will be able to refinance it at lower rates.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s my plan. It\u2019s ambitious?\u2014?and we should be ambitious. But it\u2019s also achievable. And it would make a big difference in people\u2019s lives.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Scott Walker took notice.\n\n.@HillaryClinton I\u2019ve frozen in-state tuition rates for four years, while you charged colleges $225K+ just to show up. -SW \u2014 Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) August 11, 2015\n\nWalker is referencing Clinton's habit of charging public universities a $225,000 (at least) speaking fee after she left the State Department. Between 2014 and 2015 Bill and Hillary Clinton raked in more than $25 million in speaking fees from public universities, non-profits and businesses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Boom. .05/27/2016 8:41:34AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Boom.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Scott Walker to Hillary: While You Charged Universities $225,000 to Show Up, I Froze Tuition Rates", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/08/11/scott-walker-to-hillary-while-you-charged-universities-225000-to-show-up-i-froze-tuition-rates-n2037592", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/202/723d2097-5d4d-4b0a-8a3a-0384b1193b7b.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Boom.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Scott Walker to Hillary: While You Charged Universities $225,000 to Show Up, I Froze Tuition Rates", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/08/11/scott-walker-to-hillary-while-you-charged-universities-225000-to-show-up-i-froze-tuition-rates-n2037592", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/202/723d2097-5d4d-4b0a-8a3a-0384b1193b7b.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Scott Walker to Hillary: While You Charged Universities $225,000 to Show Up, I Froze Tuition Rates, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "-SW \u2014 Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) August 11, 2015Walker is referencing Clinton's habit of charging public universities a $225,000 (at least) speaking fee after she left the State Department.\nHere are the basics:-Under the New College Compact, no student should have to borrow to pay tuition at a public college.\nBetween 2014 and 2015 Bill and Hillary Clinton raked in more than $25 million in speaking fees from public universities, non-profits and businesses.\nRepublican presidential candidate Scott Walker took notice.\n@HillaryClinton I\u2019ve frozen in-state tuition rates for four years, while you charged colleges $225K+ just to show up."}
