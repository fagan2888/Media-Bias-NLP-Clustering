You bet. I\u2019ve said that from the start,\u201d she told NBC\u2018s Andrea Mitchell. \u201cBut the site actually works. And the great thing is, there\u2019s a market behind the site that works even better. People have competitive choices and real information for the first time ever in this insurance market.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rollout of the Affordable Care Act was flawed from its Oct. 1, 2013 launch date, mostly because of technical glitches and web outages affecting the federal Healthcare.gov site. Republicans cite the flawed launch as further evidence that the Affordable Care Act represents unacceptable government overreach. But despite the poor rollout, the number of enrollees in healthcare plans under the law ended up exceeding the Obama administration\u2019s target of 7 million people.\n\nSebelius also partially attributed the technical failures to the fact that the administration didn\u2019t know until 6 months before enrollment which states would be building their own sites and which would be using the federal site, calling the web development \u201ca moving target.\u201d\n\nThe former Secretary also said she didn\u2019t think the White House oversold the program, but instead said that the problem of reforming health insurance was so thorny it defied easy solutions. \u201cI think what we said from the outset was, you know, this was fixing a very broken market\u2013 where individuals really were on their own,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you were healthy and wealthy, you could get coverage. If you weren\u2019t, you were pretty much on your own\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether her resignation was voluntary or whether she had been ousted, Sebelius said she had been planning to leave at the end of the first term but didn\u2019t want to jump ship before the health care rollout was complete.\n\n[NBC]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius speaks frankly just days after her resignation about the botched introduction of the Affordable Care Act, saying original estimates of its timetable were \"flat-out wrong\"", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius speaks frankly just days after her resignation about the botched introduction of the Affordable Care Act, saying original estimates of its timetable were \"flat-out wrong\"", "title": "Sebelius Owns Up to Botched Obamacare Rollout", "url": "http://time.com/61395/kathleen-sebelius-obamacare-rollout/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/484086279.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/484086279.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius speaks frankly just days after her resignation about the botched introduction of the Affordable Care Act, saying original estimates of its timetable were \"flat-out wrong\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sebelius Owns Up to Botched Obamacare Rollout"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "affordable care act, health care, kathleen sebelius, medicaid, meet the press, obamacare, rollout", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, health care, kathleen sebelius, medicaid, meet the press, obamacare, rollout"}, "article_summary": "Republicans cite the flawed launch as further evidence that the Affordable Care Act represents unacceptable government overreach.\nSebelius attempted to stay positive while acknowledging the failures of the rollout.\nBut despite the poor rollout, the number of enrollees in healthcare plans under the law ended up exceeding the Obama administration\u2019s target of 7 million people.\nAnd the great thing is, there\u2019s a market behind the site that works even better.\nFormer Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius called the rollout of the government\u2019s healthcare reform law \u201cterribly flawed\u201d and said the administration\u2019s original predictions about its timetable were \u201cflat-out wrong\u201d in a Sunday interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press following her resignation last week."}
