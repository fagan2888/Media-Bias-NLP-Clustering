After two commenters posted references to the Bible in response to a story about the detrimental effects of marijuana on the brain, a bureau employee engaged them in a theological argument.\n\nJoshua Lewelling, a medical marijuana legalization activist and retired Air Force veteran who lives in Inola, Okla., posted a reference to Genesis 1:29: \u201cAnd I give you every seed-bearing plant to use for food for it is good.\u201d\n\nThe response to Lewelling\u2019s initial response rankled Lewelling because he believed the bureau was lecturing him about his own Christian faith.\n\n\u201cI was talking about the obvious benefits of ingesting marijuana, not smoking it to get high,\u201d Lewelling said. He works for Green the Vote, an organization that recently petitioned the state government to legalize medical marijuana.\n\nThe agency\u2019s response seemed to go beyond simple discussion of drug policy into sermonizing about the merits of the Bible. After writing that the verse in Genesis is \u201cabout God\u2019s plan to provide food to sustain life,\u201d the bureau employee wrote, \u201cYou can\u2019t cherry-pick scripture to find verses that fit your argument. You must take the Bible for all its worth.\u201d\n\nMark Woodward, a spokesman for the agency, said it regularly responds to people commenting on the Facebook page.\n\n\u201cOur answer was based on research and interpretation, and we replied with what we believe is accurate information,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cWe\u2019re not endorsing religion. We would respond to comments about the Quran or the NFL playbook if they were referenced.\u201d\n\nLM/MG END HORTON", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Institutions, Bible, Bureau of Narcotics, Christian, marijuana, marijuana legalization, Oklahoma", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "OKLAHOMA CITY (RNS) After two commenters posted references to the Bible in response to a story about the effects of marijuana on the brain, a bureau employee engaged them in a theological argument.", "title": "Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics jumps into Bible, pot debate", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/03/oklahoma-bureau-narcotics-jumps-bible-pot-debate/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/shutterstock_157734158.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/03/oklahoma-bureau-narcotics-jumps-bible-pot-debate/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/03/oklahoma-bureau-narcotics-jumps-bible-pot-debate/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "OKLAHOMA CITY (RNS) After two commenters posted references to the Bible in response to a story about the effects of marijuana on the brain, a bureau employee engaged them in a theological argument."}, "article_summary": "OKLAHOMA CITY (RNS) The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics briefly used its official Facebook page on Aug. 26 to debate marijuana and the Bible.\nHe works for Green the Vote, an organization that recently petitioned the state government to legalize medical marijuana.\nAfter two commenters posted references to the Bible in response to a story about the detrimental effects of marijuana on the brain, a bureau employee engaged them in a theological argument.\nThe agency\u2019s response seemed to go beyond simple discussion of drug policy into sermonizing about the merits of the Bible.\n\u201cI was talking about the obvious benefits of ingesting marijuana, not smoking it to get high,\u201d Lewelling said."}
