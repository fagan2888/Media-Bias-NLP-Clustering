From New York to Chicago to Rio de Janeiro, metropolitan centers around the world are looking for new ways to be \u201csmart\u201d \u2013 to become more sustainable, improve the efficiency of public services and citizens\u2019 quality of life.\n\nForward-thinking civic and business leaders are experimenting with massive amounts of data \u2013 and the tools and technologies to compile and examine it \u2013 in order to improve how efficiently and effectively cities are managed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the explosion of data is not without obstacles. According to the research firm, Gartner, it may take a full decade or more before the maximum utility of government open data is realized.\n\nSo-called, \u201csmart cities\u201d require more than data alone \u2013 they require technologies to collect and analyze huge amounts of information and they require cross-sector solutions that can be scaled to size. \u201cSmart cities\u201d require leaders to use Big Data for good \u2013 to make better decisions, drive smart growth and benefit society as a whole.\n\nThe true smart cities will use Big Data to enable the preemption and prediction of urban issues, improving efficiency and quality of city services from healthcare to traffic management. If used properly, and in conjunction with tools that deliver actionable insights, smart cities will transform the lives of urban residents.\n\nThe timing of this transformation couldn\u2019t be better. The number of people living in cities worldwide is expected to increase to 6.3 billion by 2050 \u2013 up from 3.6 billion in 2010. To meet the demands of growing urban populations, more and more cities are taking up data-smart initiatives. In fact, at the state and local levels of government, alone, spending on information goods and services is projected to grow at a 3.3 percent rate between now and 2019, increasing to $70 billion.\n\nThe initiatives vary in scope and focus, but the drive is the same \u2013 improve efficiency, save costs and generally improve the urban experience.\n\nIn New Orleans, for example, leaders are responding to ongoing fiscal challenges with NOLAlytics \u2013 a unit spanning multiple departments focused on using data to improve the city\u2019s services. The unit\u2019s first project aims to reduce fire causalities and save costs. The Targeted Smoke Alarm Outreach program \u2013 a door-to-door smoke alarm campaign leverages data from the Fire department, Census and American Community Survey and the New Orleans Fire Department to prioritize outreach in neighborhoods that are least likely to have smoke alarms.\n\nMeanwhile in Singapore, leaders are building a network of sensors to collect and analyze data at bus stops, public parks, traffic intersections and other areas to improve public services with the goal of making them not only more responsive, but anticipatory of needs.\n\nAnd the General Service Administration has figured out a way to save $13 million annually in energy costs by using a proprietary data algorithm to monitor 180 buildings for malfunctioning exhaust fans.\n\nAt Experian, we are also embracing the potential of Big Data to improve society and support smart cities. We are using data assets to glean insights and help consumers, financial institutions, healthcare organizations, automotive companies, retailers and governmental organizations make more informed and effective decisions.\n\nFor example, with rising insurance costs, deductibles and copays, some people struggle to afford the out-of-pocket expense that can come with seeking medical treatment. Because of this, some consumers decide not to seek treatment, which could have negative effects on their health and overall well-being. Experian works with hospitals, medical offices and clinics to provide unique data and analytics to provide insight into each patient\u2019s financial situation. By leveraging healthcare-specific predictive models, Experian enables healthcare organizations to easily and efficiently determine which patients qualify for financial assistance programs or help them set up a payment plan that fits within their current budget.\n\nAnd in Orange County, California, for instance, Experian worked with local officials to verify the county\u2019s list of 260,000 inactive voters \u2013 those who had not cast a ballot in the last four years \u2013 against our extensive database of known addresses. Once Orange County had the proper addresses they were able to send out post cards for residents to either update their contact information or confirm that they had moved out of the county. The process saved the county $80,000 in the next election.\n\nAnd in our DataLabs, teams of data scientists with experience in machine learning and analytics are using data for good in bold new ways, developing data-driven solutions and pinpointing previously undetected strategies. By leveraging technologies, such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive and advanced machine learning techniques, we are able to crunch through massive amount of information and discover new insights to help local businesses and governments understand their customer and constitution base to provide better services.\n\nFor example, the DataLabs is working with social media and de-identified data to better understand and predict consumer activity. By analyzing this data, our DataLabs can identify the generalized daily travel patterns of consumers, which can in turn be used in combination with the government\u2019s open data to improve public services, from transportation planning to land use and public safety in large crowds.\n\nWith the abundance of data, we have the potential to improve the efficiency of government and build smarter cities. To achieve such goal, we need to encourage data sharing, standardization of data, and the application of the data science to use Big Data for good and truly transform urban life.\n\nChen is the vice president of Analytics and chief scientist for Experian\u2019s North American DataLab.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The true smart cities will use Big Data to enable the preemption and prediction of urban issues.", "description": "The true smart cities will use Big Data to enable the preemption and prediction of urban issues.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The true smart cities will use Big Data to enable the preemption and prediction of urban issues.", "title": "Smart cities of the future", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/250581-smart-cities-of-the-future", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/250581-smart-cities-of-the-future", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-10T18:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Kevin Chen", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-10T18:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/250581-smart-cities-of-the-future", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The true smart cities will use Big Data to enable the preemption and prediction of urban issues.", "card": "summary", "title": "Smart cities of the future"}, "dcterms.title": "Smart cities of the future"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSmart cities\u201d require leaders to use Big Data for good \u2013 to make better decisions, drive smart growth and benefit society as a whole.\nIf used properly, and in conjunction with tools that deliver actionable insights, smart cities will transform the lives of urban residents.\nSo-called, \u201csmart cities\u201d require more than data alone \u2013 they require technologies to collect and analyze huge amounts of information and they require cross-sector solutions that can be scaled to size.\nAt Experian, we are also embracing the potential of Big Data to improve society and support smart cities.\nThe true smart cities will use Big Data to enable the preemption and prediction of urban issues, improving efficiency and quality of city services from healthcare to traffic management."}
