On his NewsOne radio show Friday morning, host Roland Martin confronted Dr. Ben Carson over recent comments comparing Obamacare to slavery, words the neurosurgeon and author did not back away from.

“Obamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,” Carson said early this month while speaking at the Values Voter Summit.

Noting that atrocities like Jim Crow arose after slavery, Martin asked him, “Did you go too far?”

“That’s my opinion,” Carson responded. “First of all, I recognize that slavery was a horrible thing. He then pointed out that some say he has no idea what slavery was like, before accurately stating “none of us actually do.”

“I realize how horrible it was … I didn’t say this is “as bad” as slavery, I said this is the worst thing since slavery.”

“Which includes Jim Crow,” Martin interrupted.

“Yes, absolutely,” Carson answered. “This nation was founded on the principle that it would be a new type of nation, that was for, of, and by the people.”

“A constitution was put in place that would assure that the people remain at the pinnacle of power and that the central government would never reach the point where it had control of the people,” he continued. [Obamacare] fundamentally changes the relationship.”

Martin pushed back with standard Democratic talking points that make the preposterous claim that government controlled healthcare “empowers the individual.”

Carson said the Affordable Care Act “places the government at the pinnacle. Now it’s placed on a road to control your health … and I think most of us are asleep at the wheel. We don’t realize what’s happening.”

“This is only the beginning,” Carson warned. “What you will see is that a lot of the insurance companies will begin to fold… Ultimately we’ll have a single-payer system if we don’t stop this from happening.”

Which has been the ultimate goal all along for President Obama and the now decidedly far-left Democratic Party.
