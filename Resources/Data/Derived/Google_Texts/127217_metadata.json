(Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images)\n\n4636770\n\nPresident Barack Obama set the stage late Thursday for yet another bitter battle in Congress by sending the Senate an after-hours nomination of a healthcare executive with huge conflict of interest problems to head the government agency running Obamacare.\n\nAndy Slavitt, already the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is Obama\u2019s choice for the official appointment. The White House listed Slavitt\u2019s nomination along with three others, none of which are for positions of comparable prominence or importance.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch promptly issued statements previewing the battle royale to come as Slavitt\u2019s nomination goes forward in the Senate, assuming it does. Their statements made clear that, whenever it starts, the debate will be as much about Obamacare as Slavitt\u2019s fitness for the position.\n\n\u201cThe head of the agency that oversees Medicare and Medicaid should be focused on what the American people expect him to do: administer these important programs, not allow his attention to be diverted instead to the implementation of some gigantic, unworkable health care law that hurts hardworking Americans,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n\u201cWhile Andy Slavitt\u2019s nomination will receive thorough consideration in the Senate, it has long been clear that no one can successfully manage a law as unworkable as Obamacare. The sole focus of CMS should be to look out for our nation\u2019s seniors and the many vulnerable Americans who use these programs, without the distraction of Obamacare,\u201d McConnell said. McConnell is a Kentucky Republican.\n\nHatch was somewhat more direct, pointing to Slavitt\u2019s career as a top executive at United Health Group, one of the healthcare industry\u2019s biggest firms and one that has a giant stake in how the Obamacare program is administered.\n\n\u201cMr. Slavitt\u2019s conflicted history in the medical services industry has produced mixed results and raised a number of serious concerns. As such, he will be expected to demonstrate that he is up to the challenge and capable of successfully leading the agency through the monumental tasks that lie ahead,\u201d Hatch said.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, Mr. Slavitt will need to answer a number of tough questions regarding his former employer and their relationship with the agency,\u201d the Utah Republican added.\n\nEarlier this year, the Daily Caller reported exclusively that \u201cwhen Andy Slavitt reported for work as deputy administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last June 10, he pocketed at least $4.8 million in tax-free income from major health-care companies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s according to financial disclosure forms obtained by The Daily Caller, now published for the first time. On June 27, he sold additional stock he personally held, raising his total windfall from the health industry to $7.2 million. United Health Group was Slavitt\u2019s most recent private sector employer.\u201d\n\nThe low-key White House announcement of a nomination for one of the most important jobs in the Obama administration prompted one knowledgeable Senate source to suggest that neither McConnell nor Hatch\u2019s committee will be in any hurry to take up the Slavitt issue.\n\nFollow Mark on Twitter.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
