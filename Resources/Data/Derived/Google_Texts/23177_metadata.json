The program makes up to $12.5 billion in loan guarantees for projects such as the building of small modular reactors or upgrades to existing facilities.\n\nOfficials said Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear is needed because facilities needed to conduct nuclear research are expensive to build and maintain, making them beyond the financial ability of many innovators.\n\nAlso, officials said, companies hoping to access government facilities can face a federal labyrinth that\u2019s difficult to navigate. The Idaho National Laboratory could help solve that problem.\n\n\u201cLabs are open for business,\u201d said Peters, who took over as the Idaho National Laboratory director last month. \u201cThis is the opportunity I\u2019ve been waiting for for a couple of decades.\u201d\n\nThe announcements concerning nuclear energy are part of the Obama administration\u2019s goal of reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cNuclear power is central to President Obama\u2019s all-of-the-above energy strategy and will advance our efforts to reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Energy Department Deputy Secretary Liz Sherwood-Randall said in a statement. \u201cWe want to ramp up investment in innovative technologies to ensure that future generations have access to reliable, low-carbon electricity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Department of Energy has selected the Idaho National Laboratory to play a key role in a new initiative intended to lead to the building of new or advanced nuclear reactor designs that can be brought to the commercial market.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/6/feds-tap-idaho-national-lab-in-push-for-advanced-r/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The U.S. Department of Energy has selected the Idaho National Laboratory to play a key role in a new initiative intended to lead to the building of new or advanced nuclear reactor designs that can be brought to the commercial market.", "title": "Feds tap Idaho National Lab in push for advanced reactors"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The U.S. Department of Energy has selected the Idaho National Laboratory to play a key role in a new initiative intended to lead to the building of new or advanced nuclear reactor designs that can be", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds tap Idaho National Lab in push for advanced reactors"}, "Author": "KEITH RIDLER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy John Kotek made the announcement Friday at the White House Summit on Nuclear Energy.\nThe Idaho National Laboratory could help solve that problem.\n\u201cLabs are open for business,\u201d said Peters, who took over as the Idaho National Laboratory director last month.\nIdaho National Laboratory Director Mark Peters took part in the announcement and said the program creates what he calls an ecosystem that national labs are excited to support.\nAlso on Friday, the Department of Energy said its Loan Programs Office will clarify eligible costs in its Advance Nuclear Energy Projects loan program."}
