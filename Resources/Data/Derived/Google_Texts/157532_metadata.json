The provision in question is actually called \u2018risk corridors,\u2019 which is a mechanism for compensating health insurers in case their actual costs are at least 3 percent higher than their projected costs. But it\u2019s only temporary, until they get better data on who their customers are. And if their costs are lower than they expected, they actually pay the government. And besides \u2026 \u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYou see the problem.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nThe last thing Democrats want to do, with a law as complicated and full of moving parts as the Affordable Care Act, is explain what the law actually does.\n\nAnd yet, they\u2019re going to have to come up with something to answer the Republicans\u2019 latest line of attack. The program that\u2019s causing all the trouble is supposed to help insurers get through the first few years of Obamacare if their costs are higher than they thought. And it\u2019s not an emergency measure \u2014 it was built into the law all along.\n\nBut the \u201cinsurer bailout\u201d charge is already lighting fires on conservative talk radio, and if House Republicans move ahead with plans to attach a repeal of the provision to the next debt ceiling increase, the charge could draw attention way beyond the conservative base \u2014 even if the repeal ultimately gets stripped out.\n\nThe debate got another showcase on Wednesday, when Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 one of the main Republicans making the charge \u2014was the star witness at House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa\u2019s hearing, \u201cObamacare: Why the Need for an Insurance Company Bailout?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the president and Secretary [Kathleen] Sebelius and for Obamacare supporters to level with taxpayers about the fact that their hard-earned tax dollars will soon be needed to bailout the Obamacare exchanges,\u201d Rubio told the panel.\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Marco Rubio?)\n\nIt\u2019s a strategic problem that\u2019s going to plague Democrats every time a fight flares up over a complicated part of the law. The website was actually a simple problem, as embarrassing as it was for the Obama administration: broken website, fix it. But when the fight moves on to the most complicated mechanisms in the law, the Democrats know they\u2019ll lose the argument if they get drawn into the weeds.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect illustration of the problem Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota captured when Congress was debating the law in 2010: \u201cOur bumper sticker has \u2014 it\u2019s just way too many words. And it says, \u2018Continued on next bumper sticker.\u2019\u201d\n\nOr, as Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis puts it now: \u201cIf you get into the weeds of things, you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats actually got some good news on Tuesday that could help: The Congressional Budget Office said the provision will save the government $8 billion, not cost money. That\u2019s because the money can flow both ways. If insurers priced their premiums too high, and their costs are lower than they thought, they pay the government.\n\nBut rather than get into a big explanation of all of that, Democrats are more likely to hit the Republicans back with a couple of catchier political points: If you take this out, premiums will rise and it will be your fault.\n\nAnd by the way, you put the same thing in Medicare Part D, and you didn\u2019t complain about it then.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obamacare and jobs: CBO fuels the fire)\n\n\u201cThey were for risk corridors before they were against them,\u201d said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nTop Democrats are already making use of the one-two punch.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are attacking a program they have supported in the past that is specifically designed to stabilize the insurance market and keep costs down for families,\u201d Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cRepealing this program would disrupt coverage for millions of Americans who have now gained it thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and would punish families across the country with more uncertainty and higher prices.\u201d\n\nSo is the risk corridors program really a \u201cbailout\u201d for insurers? It\u2019s more like a \u201cshock absorber,\u201d as health care experts put it \u2014 a three-year program that will cushion the blow for health plans because of all the uncertainty about their costs.\n\nAt the moment, though, there\u2019s no absolute guarantee that it won\u2019t cost the government money in the short term, or that the costs have to balance out over the long run. In fact, before Tuesday\u2019s CBO report, some analysts worried that the risk has increased since President Barack Obama allowed health insurers to extend policyholders\u2019 pre-Obamacare health plans, because that\u2019s likely to throw off the insurers\u2019 calculations of their costs even more.\n\nObama administration officials, however, insist they\u2019re going to implement it in a way that doesn\u2019t cost money in the long term. The provision \u201cwas estimated to be budget neutral, and we intend to implement it as designed,\u201d said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The \u201cinsurer bailout\u201d charge is already lighting fires on conservative talk radio.", "title": "The Obamacare bailout battle", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/obamacare-insurer-bailouts-103134.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/05/140205_rubio_testify_shinkle_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Bailouts,Affordable Care Act,Health Insurance", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The \u201cinsurer bailout\u201d charge is already lighting fires on conservative talk radio.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd423\"", "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO The Obamacare bailout battleThe latest Republican attack on Obamacare is powerful and simple: \u201cno insurer bailouts.\u201dBut never fear, Democrats are ready with a response: \u201cWell, that\u2019s not really what it is.\nThe program that\u2019s causing all the trouble is supposed to help insurers get through the first few years of Obamacare if their costs are higher than they thought.\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)The last thing Democrats want to do, with a law as complicated and full of moving parts as the Affordable Care Act, is explain what the law actually does.\nObama administration officials, however, insist they\u2019re going to implement it in a way that doesn\u2019t cost money in the long term.\nIf insurers priced their premiums too high, and their costs are lower than they thought, they pay the government."}
