One of the few exceptions is for people who are members of what\u2019s called \u201chealth care sharing ministries.\u201d The two largest sharing ministries \u2013 Samaritan and Medi-Share \u2013 have both nearly doubled their membership in Texas since the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe KERA Radio story.\n\nDiane Cozart has strong beliefs. Among them, that there should be freshly-baked cinnamon bread around the holidays, and a fully-decorated Christmas tree in the living room.\n\nShe also believes the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and in between home-schooling her six kids, she taught each of them to make healthy choices. So when Cozart and her husband found out about the Christian health sharing ministry called Medi-Share 15 years ago, they signed up the whole family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more than insurance, it\u2019s a great piece of mind and it really feels like ministry too,\u201d she says.\n\nEvery month Cozart contributes $550 \u2013 that\u2019s for her husband and two youngest kids \u2013 to a Member Share Exchange run by a credit union. That credit union transfers funds from one member\u2019s bank account to another\u2019s when there\u2019s a medical need that\u2019s covered.\n\nSharing Ministries aren\u2019t insurance \u2013 there\u2019s no guarantee a bill will be covered. They\u2019re a collection of like-minded individuals who agree to share in each other\u2019s medical bills. Think about it like passing the collection plate at church on Sundays, only at a much larger scale.\n\nThere are some additional requirements under the biblical model of sharing, among them: members have to attend church, abstain from extramarital sex and avoid alcohol and drug abuse.\n\n\u201cI like knowing there\u2019s an organization that sees how important it is that I first make healthy choices. Then I like that my insurance dollars are not going to folks who live alternate lifestyles and maybe they do things that are not healthful,\" Cozart says. \"I feel confident I\u2019m not paying for another person\u2019s bad choices. So my premiums stay down.\u201d\n\nMedi-Share participants do pay less on average than they might for traditional insurance -- 30 percent less for according to a 2009 study by the industry trade group the Association of Health Insurance Providers.\n\nRead more about health care sharing ministries on KERA\u2019s Breakthroughs blog.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health/Science", "description": "Under Obamacare, nearly every American has to have health insurance or pay a penalty.
