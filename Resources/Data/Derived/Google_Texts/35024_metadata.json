[\u2026] \u201cOur free stuff today is being paid for by taking money from our children and borrowing from China,\u201d she said at the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition\u2019s fall fundraiser at the State Fairgrounds Saturday night. \u201cWhen that money comes due \u2013 and this isn\u2019t racist, but it\u2019ll be like slavery when that note is due. We are going to beholden to the foreign master.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to start with rhetoric as nonsensical as this. Do we note that the deficit is already shrinking at its fastest pace since World War II? Or maybe highlight the fact that the U.S. was poised to pay off the national debt until Republicans put two wars, two tax cuts, and a Wall Street bailout on the national charge card?\n\nDo we mention that no sentence can end well if it starts, \u201cThis isn\u2019t racist, but\u2026\u201d? Or perhaps the inconvenient detail that China only holds about 8% of the national debt?\n\nIs it worth remembering that focusing on debt reduction in a weak economy is ridiculous? Or how about the fact that the same policymakers who claim to be obsessed with debt reduction refuse to consider compromises that would actually reduce the debt?\n\nWe could ask any of those questions, of course, but let\u2019s instead make a more straightforward observation: comparing a government\u2019s national debt to slavery is ridiculous and needlessly offensive. Slavery is a unique crime against humanity and a stain on history, not a rhetorical device to be used by lazy ideologues complaining about issues they don\u2019t fully understand.\n\nAnd yet, this seems to come up quite a bit. A month ago, it was Fox News personality Ben Carson delivering a speech in which he argued health care reform is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\nThe same week, George Will drew a parallel between the Affordable Care Act and the Fugitive Slave Act. In September, a New Hampshire Republican drew the same comparison\n\nFox\u2019s Hugh Hewitt compared defunding the Affordable Care Act to repealing slavery on the air last month, and two weeks prior, Rush Limbaugh also equated \u201cObamacare\u201d and slavery.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Comparing a government's national debt to slavery is ridiculous and needlessly offensive.
