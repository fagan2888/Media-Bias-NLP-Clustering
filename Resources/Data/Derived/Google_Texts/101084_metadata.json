When the IRS scandal broke, one man decided enough was enough \u2014 and he hasn\u2019t paid taxes since.\n\nDaily Caller reporter Patrick Howley has refused to pay taxes since the public learned about the IRS targeting conservatives. On the 500th day after the news hit, he reviewed what we\u2019ve learned about what happened in the IRS (precious little) and what has happened in our country in the meantime. Here\u2019s just a sampling:\n\nThe government shut down because of Obamacare and Republicans got blamed.\u2026 ISIS beheaded three Western journalists.\u2026 Vladimir Putin seized Crimea. Guatemalan children poured across the border. John Kerry let Iran keep having nuclear power plants. War raged between Israel and Hamas. Armed federal agents stole a rancher\u2019s cattle and then it was all okay because the rancher said something racist. Ebola broke out. A Malaysian plane got lost. Racial tensions spilled over in Ferguson.\n\nIn short, the IRS scandal is just one among other events that have ruined the morale of our country. But it\u2019s not nothing. In fact, it\u2019s one of the worst scandals of our time. The IRS has been caught red-handed, admitting at the highest levels to targeting, harassing, and intimidating tea party, Christian, pro-Israel, and other conservative groups. Their intimidation has undermined the ability of ordinary Americans to freely participate in the democratic process and must be stopped. Howley explains:\n\n500 days ago, we learned that the most powerful tax-collecting agency in the United States has been turned into a political weapon and their enemy is average hardworking American citizens. When people find out such a thing, it tends to lead to feelings of hopelessness. It makes people cynical. Important institutions have been corrupted and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it because they claim that the computers crashed and that\u2019s the end of it? And 500 days later, we still don\u2019t have the emails?\n\nThough I obviously can\u2019t endorse people withholding taxes, it is refreshing to see someone stand up and point out the unfairness of the tax system. I agree with him that 500 days is quite long enough for Americans to wait for answers. Howley says it\u2019s time to get louder and demand \u201cbasic information out of our government so we can have just one tiny fragment of justice and decency and common sense back in our lives.\u201d Of course, I don\u2019t see this happening anytime soon.\n\nAs time passes, people are more inclined to shrug off the frustration and accept that they may never get answers. The government\u2019s corruption, evidenced chiefly by the IRS, is one of the more demoralizing acts of the federal government, because it \u201ccast a hopeless pall over this great but troubled country and its great but jaded people.\u201d\n\nBut we must not let that happen. As Edmund Burke said, \u201cAll that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.\u201d If justice is to be served, if the truth is to be uncovered, it will clearly have to come from the citizens. Federal investigations are taking their time and getting nowhere.\n\nOver 500 days later, we are not letting up.\n\n(Mr. Meckler is the head of the Sue the IRS Project, the only class action lawsuit on file against the federal government.)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0255\"", "article_summary": "Daily Caller reporter Patrick Howley has refused to pay taxes since the public learned about the IRS targeting conservatives.\nI agree with him that 500 days is quite long enough for Americans to wait for answers.\nOver 500 days later, we are not letting up.\nAnd 500 days later, we still don\u2019t have the emails?\nWhen the IRS scandal broke, one man decided enough was enough \u2014 and he hasn\u2019t paid taxes since."}
