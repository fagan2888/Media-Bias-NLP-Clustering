While she questions how some of the facts were misrepresented early on in the case (a phenomenon not unique to sexual assault cases or the social media age) and the motivations behind some of the individuals leading the online campaign for accountability, Levy\u2019s extensive reporting uncovers the same facts reached during the trial. Namely, that Trent Mays and Ma\u2019lik Richmond penetrated a teenage girl who couldn\u2019t consent to such an act. That a rape occurred that night.\n\nLevy also goes to great lengths to communicate that rape culture is not \u201can empty term or imaginary phenomenon,\u201d and that the persistence of sexual violence against women and girls \u201cwould be impossible without a culture that enables it: a value system in which women are currency, and sex is something that men get \u2014 or take \u2014 from them.\u201d\n\nCohen seems to have missed both points \u2014 or willfully ignored them to advance a ridiculous and deeply misogynistic column that connects Levy\u2019s reporting to Miley Cyrus\u2019 performance at last week\u2019s Video Music Awards.
