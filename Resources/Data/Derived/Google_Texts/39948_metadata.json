Ryan won\u2019t rule out rider to defund Planned Parenthood in next funding bill\n\nposted at 8:41 pm on November 3, 2015 by Allahpundit\n\nThe government runs out of money on December 11th and the most pro-abortion president in history has vowed not to sign any bills that make funding the government contingent upon defunding Planned Parenthood. Surely this is the moment for a Republican Speaker to crap away any leverage he might have by vowing to prevent a shutdown at all costs, right?\n\nNot this time.\n\n\u201cThis is the legislative branch and the power of the purse rests within the legislative branch and we fully expect that we\u2019re going to exercise that power,\u201d Ryan told reporters Tuesday morning. That statement marks a break with Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John Boehner, who developed a habit of pledging not to pass funding bills that would risk a government shutdown by provoking a presidential veto. The new, firmer stance could potentially put Ryan at odds with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who has also sworn to avoid government shutdowns. But it could also help Ryan mollify the conservative backbenchers who have accused GOP leaders of preemptively surrendering to Obama.\n\nOne of the demands the Freedom Caucus made of Ryan was for a return to regular order, i.e. letting bills originate in committee and amending them as the majority desires instead of having the Speaker\u2019s office drop a prefab bill on the conference at the last second and asking them to approve it as is. If Ryan meets that demand, he could be stuck: The House\u2019s GOP majority could vote to add a rider to a funding bill, all but guaranteeing a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. If he doesn\u2019t meet that demand, though, he could also be stuck. It\u2019d be a bad start to his Speakership if he blinked at a shutdown fight over a bill that\u2019s highly popular with cultural conservatives.\n\nUnless, that is, the House\u2019s conservatives cut him some slack on it. Hmmmm.\n\nA few dozen hardline conservatives were ready to shut down the government last month over Planned Parenthood. But after new Speaker Paul Ryan remarked over the weekend that defunding the group probably isn\u2019t going to happen, several of the conservative firebrands greeted the remark with a shrug\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely committed to it,\u201d said Rep. Trent Franks, one of the most outspoken critics of Planned Parenthood. \u201cI think Paul is as committed to protecting the unborn\u2026.as much of any of us. The problem is he is as capable as any of us at mathematical addition and subtraction.\u201d\u2026 Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said as long as Ryan gives Republicans a chance during committee votes to attempt and defund the health care organization, the Wisconsin Republican won\u2019t draw the ire of hardliners.\n\nIn theory, a clean process here might solve Ryan\u2019s political problem. If he lets conservatives amend the funding bill to attach a rider defunding Planned Parenthood and brings it to a vote, maybe they\u2019ll reward him by voting for a clean bill once the Senate shoots down the first one. But then, maybe not. One of the main knocks on Boehner was that he wasn\u2019t willing to play chicken with Obama by tolerating a shutdown apart from the brief one in 2013. If conservatives think they can win a political fight with O over PP and the sting videos, why not demand that Ryan force a shutdown and see how that shakes out? Is it because they \u2026 don\u2019t think they would win that battle? Or is it because they know as well as Ryan does that a shutdown in the middle of a presidential campaign could be a big problem for the nominee next fall?\n\nOr is it because Ryan\u2019s in the middle of making other concessions that will make the Freedom Caucus happy enough that they won\u2019t want to go to war with him (yet)?\n\nIn his first extended meeting with House Republicans, Ryan made clear that he would make some changes, according to lawmakers present. One of those changes: He would alter the makeup of the House Steering Committee before Thanksgiving \u2014 a key demand of conservatives who want more say in the decision-making process. That panel, typically dominated by the speaker\u2019s office, makes important decisions on assigning members to plum committee spots, but Ryan has privately said he would install a more diverse group of members to help dole out those assignments.\n\nHere\u2019s Ryan this morning at his first presser as Speaker suggesting that nothing is off the table and this weekend on CNN making it sound like he\u2019s awfully reluctant to make any obviously futile moves against Planned Parenthood. Curious to see how this circle will be squared.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThe power of the purse rests within the legislative branch and we fully expect that we\u2019re going to exercise that power.\u201d", "title": "Shutdown coming?
