Steve Scalise said today he would like to bring back discussion over the controversial National Flood Insurance Program that expires next year.\n\nIn 2014, Congress put off reforms officials said would have made flood insurance rates unaffordable for many local residents and others in flood-prone areas across the U.S. The program remains in debt by an estimated $24 billion.\n\n\u201cI want to see something done to help the people of south Louisiana,\u201d the House majority whip said in an interview after addressing legislative issues at the South Central Industrial Association's monthly meeting at Cypress Columns in Gray.\n\nScalise also hopes for progress on bills that would aid the ailing oilfield industry. Some experts now project the price of crude oil, which reached as high as $114 in summer 2014, could drop as low as $20 this year.\n\nBills that have passed through the House would open restricted parts of the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf to oil and gas exploration and lift the revenue sharing cap on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, or GOMESA.\n\nGOMESA turns oil and gas royalties into coastal restoration dollars across Gulf states starting next year, with Louisiana expected to receive about $150 million to $170 million annually. But the program is capped at $500 million, which has drawn the ire of Republican congressmen.\n\nDuring his address to the SCIA, Scalise took shots at President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to defeat ISIS, the president's economic policy and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSmall business owners are having trouble hiring people,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cWe sent a bill to the president that guts Obamacare and defunds Planned Parenthood. The president vetoed it and we\u2019ll have a veto override on that next week.\u201d\n\nLooking back at 2015, Scalise told the group he was proud of efforts to lift a decades-old ban on exporting crude oil and a six-year transportation bill, championed by U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, that puts projects such as the elevated La. 1 and I-49 South in line to receive federal dollars.\n\n\u201cWe had some really good wins for our region, and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to build on that,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very exciting in 2016.\u201d\n\nScalise offered only a broad picture of what\u2019s to come this year with a shortened session because of a presidential election.\n\nHe said he hopes real solutions present themselves during the race to replace the term-limited Obama. He compared campaigns to date to \u201cchampionship wrestling\u201d with candidates just trying to scream the loudest.\n\n\u201cHopefully we see a broader national debate,\u201d he said.\n\nSenior Staff Writer Jacob Batte can be reached at 448-7635 or jacob.batte@dailycomet.com.
