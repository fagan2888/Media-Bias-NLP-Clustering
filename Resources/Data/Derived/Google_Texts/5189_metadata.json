When asked if they showed up at the factory today, he said, \"The employees know what their schedule is and what to expect.\"ATI said it began formal negotiations with the USW in May for contracts that expired June 30, and \"presented its last, best and final offer\" to the union on Aug. 4, asking the union accept it by Aug. 10.The company said the USW negotiating committee has not accepted the company's offer or let ATI employees vote on it.ATI said the company proposal includes $4,500 in lump-sum payments over the four-year agreement and continued incentive programs for ATI Flat Rolled Products employees, who averaged $94,000 in earnings in 2014.It also included affordable solutions for continued family health care, at about half of the cost that the average American worker pays, the company said.\"WHILE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE during contract negotiations on some issues, significant differences remain in critical areas including: health care benefits for current employees, the structure of benefits for employees hired after June 30, 2015, and updates to subcontracting and scheduling rules,\" Bob Wetherbee, executive vice president of ATI Flat Rolled Products, said in the release. \"It is disappointing that the company has been placed in this position, but this step allows us to continue to meet customer demands while we continue our efforts to finalize a new contract with the USW.\"Wetherbee said ATI's \"last, best and final proposal puts a workable solution on the table,\" but the union committee has taken no action on it, despite ATI's request to accept it by Aug. 10 and vote on it.\"In the meantime, our challenges continue to grow, and our operations become more unstable,\" he said. \"We look forward to finalizing a fair, more competitive and responsible agreement with the USW and getting our employees back to work as soon as possible.\"ATI said it approved a $1.2 billion investment in new state-of-the-art facilities in Brackenridge, Pa., in 2008, but since then, foreign and domestic competitors \u2014 including China \u2014 have flooded the global market with standard stainless steel.As a result, market prices have fallen more than 30 percent in recent years, the company said.At the same time, ATI Flat Rolled Products' wage and benefit costs continued to rise, the company said. Employees under the recently expired contract average almost $70 per hour in total pay and benefits.ATI SAID ITS OFFER TO THE UNION maintains current employee compensation levels and pension benefits for current employees and existing retirees and surviving spouses.USW said Friday that it \"condemned\" ATI's decision to lock out 2,200 workers at 12 plants in six states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Pennsylvania.USW said ATI started hiring outside consultants to recruit replacement workers in January \u2014 months before contract negotiations began in May. USW also said the company forced union members to sit through captive-audience meetings aimed at intimidating them into accepting concessions.\"It's outrageous that the company has chosen this destructive path, but it is clear that ATI intended to lock these workers out since day one,\" said USW International President Leo W. Gerard. \"From the beginning, the company has bargained in bad faith to dictate the terms of an agreement.\"Throughout the process the union presented ATI management with proposals that would save the company millions of dollars, but management consistently rebuffed the union's efforts to work with the company to address challenges in the market.\"We remain ready and willing to bargain toward an agreement that is fair to both sides, and today we informed the company that our June 30 offer to remain at work while negotiations continue still stands,\" USW International Vice President Tom Conway said.A call to USW Local 134, which represents ATI's union workers at the Waterbury plant, was not returned.Contact Michael C.
