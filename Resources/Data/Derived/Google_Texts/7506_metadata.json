Megyn Kelly asked why the president did not tackle the immigration issue early on in his presidency when he had a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Rivera was dismissive of the past and applauded Obama\u2019s bold action:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant to me. Charles [Krauthammer] is absolutely right. The president could have done it. It really made me angry that he chose to go with Obamacare rather than immigration reform, even though he had told the Latino community and the Asian-American community that immigration reform was his priority, but it doesn\u2019t matter tonight. What matters tonight is he is doing, finally, the right thing. He may be doing it for awful, base reasons, political reasons, I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care. I care that he is finally doing the right thing for law-abiding, otherwise law-abiding family immigrants who have been here five years or more, who have in every other way followed the law. These are people that are the seeds of the earth. These are people who make America strong. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s done it.\u201d\n\nKelly pointed out to her colleague that President Obama, himself, has said no less than 25 times that he does not have the authority to pass amnesty without Congress. Geraldo repeated himself that he doesn\u2019t care.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cThis is legal. It is legal. It may be hypocritical. It may be done for the worse reasons, but it is legal. I guarantee you. Ask 100 constitutional scholars.\u201d\n\nRivera blamed the House for their inaction, saying \u201cthey had it coming.\u201d He said the House Republicans have blamed the illegal immigrants for ISIS and Ebola. Rivera went on to say that Republicans would make the undocumented immigrants scapegoats for climate change \u201cif they believed in it.\u201d\n\nRivera explained to Kelly that the people who benefit are the law-abiding families who are seeking a better life.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cYou see them on the bicycles delivering pizza. You see them caring for children, mowing lawns. You see them working in factories and in fields. Those are the people who benefit.\u201d\n\n(h/t: Mediaite)\n\nImage credit: Fox News screenshot\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care.\"", "author": "Tom Hinchey", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care.\"", "title": "Watch: What Geraldo Just Said About Obama\u2019s Immigration Order Made Megyn Kelly Lose It- \"He\u2019s Dead To Rights!\u201d", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kelly-rivera.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-20T10:24:23-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/rivera-obamas-actions-maybe-hypocritical-maybe-worse-reasons-legal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care.\"", "title": "Megyn Kelly, Geraldo Rivera Do Battle On Immigration", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kelly-rivera.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-21T12:48:14-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "Illegal Immigration", "published_time": "2014-11-21T12:48:14-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T10:24:23-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "geraldo rivera, obama's executive amnesty, megyn kelly, charles krauthammer, , amnesty, barack obama, illegal immigration, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Advertisement - story continues belowFox News Senior Correspondent Geraldo Rivera was an in-studio guest on The Kelly File Thursday night after President Barack Obama\u2019s speech outlining his executive action plan on immigration.\nHe may be doing it for awful, base reasons, political reasons, I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care.\nMegyn Kelly asked why the president did not tackle the immigration issue early on in his presidency when he had a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\nRivera was dismissive of the past and applauded Obama\u2019s bold action:\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant to me.\nThose are the people who benefit.\u201d(h/t: Mediaite)Image credit: Fox News screenshotAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below"}
