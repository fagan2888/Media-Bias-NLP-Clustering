Researchers from Queen\u2019s University published their findings in PLOS One, which unlocked how exercise and relaxation activities, such as yoga, can actually change the way people perceive the world. These findings could prove to be an important new therapy approach for people with mood and social anxiety disorders.\n\nResearchers used a dotted outline of a human \u2014 essentially just a series of dots, each one depicting a major joint on the body \u2014 for their study. Someone with social anxiety disorder tends to look at the image and believe it\u2019s facing them, which indicates a threat. \u201cWe wanted to examine whether people would perceive their environment as less threatening after engaging in physical exercise or after doing a relaxation technique that is similar to the breathing exercises in yoga (called progressive muscle relaxation),\u201d said Dr. Adam Heenan, a candidate in Clinical Psychology at Queen\u2019s University said in a press release.\n\nHowever, the ambiguous figure seemed to turn around for the 64 college participants who had the disorder, after they experienced exercise, which meant the dotted outline no longer resembled a threat and their environment as a whole became less threatening. Their anxiety levels went from extreme disorder categories to levels of anxiety a normal person would experience.\n\nIf the figure posed less of a threat, the researchers said, then people with social anxiety disorders would find the things around them less threatening. This was because their feelings of being threatened by the dotted figure would then be transferred to other objects, throwing them into a maddening cycle.\n\n\u201cWe found that people who either walked or jogged on a treadmill for 10 minutes perceived these ambiguous figures as facing towards them (the observer) less often than those who simply stood on the treadmill,\u201d Heenan said. \u201cThe same was true when people performed progressive muscle relaxation.\u201d\n\nThose who suffer from social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, have an irrational fear of being scrutinized and judge by others in social or performance situations. It takes a severe toll on their personal relationships and makes it difficult to form any friendships or romantic relationships, leaving them feeling powerless, alone, and even ashamed.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million American adults diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, and it typically begins to show during the early stages of their teenage years, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Easing the fear and anxiety for people whose lives are so influenced by this disorder just by exercising or practicing meditation and yoga, can play a powerful role in future therapy treatments. \u201cThis is a big development because it helps to explain why exercising and relaxation techniques have been successful in treating and mood and anxiety disorders in the past,\u201d Heenan said.\n\nSource: Heenan A and Troje NF.
