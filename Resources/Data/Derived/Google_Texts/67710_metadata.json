Reuters reports:\n\nJudge Gerard Lynch, one of three judges who heard the arguments, said it was \"hard for me to imagine\" Congress had envisioned such a sweeping effort when it passed an expansion of anti-terrorism powers known as the Patriot Act after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Stuart Delery, a lawyer for the Justice Department, told Lynch in response that Congress was fully informed when it voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act twice. The two other judges, Robert Sack and Vernon Broderick, also expressed skepticism about the program's legality, although it can be difficult to infer judges' eventual rulings from questions at oral argument. The panel could take several months to issue a decision.\n\nNote that this case only covers telephone metadata, not online metadata, e-mail information or anything else the government calls metadata, though the judges expressed concern that the government\u2019s arguments could be expanded to other areas like financial records. In August, the documents snagged by Edward Snowden introduced us to ICREACH, the search engine the federal government created to help agencies navigate all the information they\u2019ve been collected. We discovered through these documents that the feds have added dozens of new forms of metadata, like passport information, visa application records, and cellphone location data, to the list of information it is collecting. But as this case winds its way toward the Supreme Court\u2014and let\u2019s face it, eventually the Supreme Court is going to have to tackle this issue (another reason to thank Edward Snowden)\u2014the nature of the court\u2019s ruling could affect more than just phone metadata collection.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got two hours to spare, the hearing was televised on C-Span and can be watched here.\n\nBelow, Lily Tomlin breaks it all down:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A trio of judges Tuesday heard the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s challenge that the federal government\u2019s mass collection of telephone metadata", "title": "Mass NSA Phone Metadata Collection in Federal Appeals Court Crosshairs", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/09/03/mass-nsa-phone-metadata-collection-in-fe", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14097591021682.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A trio of judges Tuesday heard the American Civil Liberties\nUnion\u2019s challenge that the federal government\u2019s mass collection of\ntelephone metadata is unconstitutional.\nMedia outlets have been quick to point out the \nskepticism of the judges\u2014from the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals in\nNew York\u2014that it was lawful for the National Security Agency (NSA)\nto engage in the mass collection of telephone metadata from people\n(including American citizens) under no suspic", "creator": "@sshackford", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14097591021682.jpg", "title": "Mass NSA Phone Metadata Collection in Federal Appeals Court Crosshairs", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Phones", "published_time": "2014-09-03T16:05:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/scott-shackford"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "A trio of judges Tuesday heard the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s challenge that the federal government\u2019s mass collection of telephone metadata is unconstitutional.\nNote that this case only covers telephone metadata, not online metadata, e-mail information or anything else the government calls metadata, though the judges expressed concern that the government\u2019s arguments could be expanded to other areas like financial records.\nIf you\u2019ve got two hours to spare, the hearing was televised on C-Span and can be watched here.\nMedia outlets have been quick to point out the skepticism of the judges\u2014from the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals in New York\u2014that it was lawful for the National Security Agency (NSA) to engage in the mass collection of telephone metadata from people (including American citizens) under no suspicion of criminal or terrorist activity.\nStuart Delery, a lawyer for the Justice Department, told Lynch in response that Congress was fully informed when it voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act twice."}
