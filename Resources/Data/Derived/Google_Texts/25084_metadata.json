As a result, it means second-year point guard Erick Green\u2019s bid to make the roster was a success.\n\nAll the while, the Nuggets\u2019 final roster spot was down to which of the duo played better. Johnson had the added advantage of having a guaranteed contract, which almost always means that player will stay on the roster over one that doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut Green, who has steadily improved since being drafted by the Nuggets in 2013, was good in summer workouts and was even better in the preseason. He\u2019ll be the team\u2019s third point guard.\n\nMeanwhile, if Johnson isn\u2019t claimed by another team, the Nuggets are on the hook for the guaranteed portion of his salary, which is $1.825 million. That means team president Josh Kroenke and general manager Tim Connelly valued the on-court performance over simply saving a buck. It also means the team kept no players acquired from Houston in the July trade for Ty Lawson.\n\nThe Nuggets also waived Devin Sweetney and Oleksiy Pecherov.\n\nThe team practiced Saturday, but rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay was not among them. He is resting a strained left hamstring.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel is still fighting his injury, trying to get right,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201c(Sunday), we\u2019ll get him on the court pre-practice \u2026 get him loose, see how he looks. And then integrate him into practice and slowly build him up Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, where he\u2019s hopefully getting through a full practice.\u201d\n\nShooting guard Randy Foye (hamstring) returned to practice after missing two weeks. Also returning to practice was big man Joffrey Lauvergne (low back strain).\n\n\u201cBut guys are headed in the right direction,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI have complete confidence in the training staff to get these guys back healthy. The good thing is we don\u2019t play until Wednesday.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets choose to keep Erick Green for final roster spot", "title": "Nuggets choose to keep Erick Green for final roster spot", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/24/nuggets-choose-to-keep-erick-green-for-final-roster-spot/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150120_114553_erick-green.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150120_114553_erick-green.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T16:20:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:11:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Nuggets waived guard Nick Johnson, in addition to two other players Saturday, bringing the Nuggets\u2019 roster to 15 players, the maximum allowed by the NBA.\nAs a result, it means second-year point guard Erick Green\u2019s bid to make the roster was a success.\nAll the while, the Nuggets\u2019 final roster spot was down to which of the duo played better.\nThat means team president Josh Kroenke and general manager Tim Connelly valued the on-court performance over simply saving a buck.\nHe\u2019ll be the team\u2019s third point guard."}
