[Screenshot]\n\nAppearing on Fox News, former neurosurgeon and Tea Party favorite Dr. Ben Carson, described the scandal currently enveloping the Department of Veterans Affairs as a \u201cgift from God.\u201d\n\nUsing the problems at the VA, involving backlogged waiting lists full of veterans seeking medical care, Carson attempted to link the scandal to the Affordable Care Act which he opposes.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s happening with the veterans is a gift from God to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider,\u201d Carson explained. \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t get it right, with the relatively small number of veterans, how in the world are you going to do it with the entire population?\u201d\n\nCarson previously called Obamacare, \u201c\u2026the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\nSaying he was speaking to both Democrats and Republicans, Carson said, \u201cStop, and think about the people. You know, you guys are servants, you\u2019re not rulers. So, first of all, get that out of your mind. And think about what we can do with the problems we have to solve in this nation, which are substantial. Some of which threaten to destroy our nation; our fiscal responsibility. We can deal with these things, quite easily.\u201d\n\nIn Carson\u2019s book, America The Beautiful, he wrote that Americans should accept a two-tiered system of healthcare.\n\n\u201cEveryone has different needs and we do not have to have a one-size-fits-all system. Because one person drives a Chevrolet and another drives a Mercedes, it doesn\u2019t automatically mean that the Chevrolet driver is deprived or needs some supplement, \u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fact is, he can get to the same place as a Mercedes driver with perhaps slightly less comfort. People have different medical needs and some can afford the Chevrolet plan while others can afford the Mercedes plan. We should leave it at that and not try to micromanage people\u2019s lives as long as the care is adequate.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from Media Matters:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nbc_mtp_carson_slavery_140518g-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Tea Party favorite Dr. Ben Carson calls Veteran Affairs waiting list scandal a \u2018gift from God\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9536\"", "article_summary": "[Screenshot]Appearing on Fox News, former neurosurgeon and Tea Party favorite Dr. Ben Carson, described the scandal currently enveloping the Department of Veterans Affairs as a \u201cgift from God.\u201dUsing the problems at the VA, involving backlogged waiting lists full of veterans seeking medical care, Carson attempted to link the scandal to the Affordable Care Act which he opposes.\nPeople have different medical needs and some can afford the Chevrolet plan while others can afford the Mercedes plan.\nAnd think about what we can do with the problems we have to solve in this nation, which are substantial.\n\u201cThe fact is, he can get to the same place as a Mercedes driver with perhaps slightly less comfort.\nWe can deal with these things, quite easily.\u201dIn Carson\u2019s book, America The Beautiful, he wrote that Americans should accept a two-tiered system of healthcare."}
