Unfortunately, the GAO audit found that for the 19th consecutive year, the government\u2019s books were in such disarray that the agency could not render an opinion on Uncle Sam\u2019s financial statements.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this is that the Department of Defense \u2014 which, according to GAO, \u201crepresented 30 percent and 15 percent of the government\u2019s reported total assets and net costs, respectively\u201d \u2014 continues to defy attempts to audit its books. In fact, since 1996, the first year all federal agencies were required to undergo annual audits, the Pentagon\u2019s financial statements have never been in an auditable condition. GAO said the department has \u201cserious financial management problems\u201d that extend far beyond cleaning up its books, including \u201cinconsistent and sometimes unreliable reports to Congress,\u201d an \u201cinability to ensure that obligations and expenditures are properly recorded and do not exceed statutory levels of control,\u201d and \u201cprovid[ing] reasonable assurance of accountability for its property, plant, and equipment.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Agriculture, which together represent an additional four percent of both total assets and net costs, also could not be audited for 2015.\n\nAnother major obstacle to a full audit of the feds\u2019 finances is \u201cthe government\u2019s inability to adequately account for and reconcile a significant amount of intragovernmental activity and balances between federal entities,\u201d GAO found. Simply put, if one agency purchases a good or service from another agency, the balance sheets on both sides of the transaction should register the same amount of money as either a debit or a credit, respectively; but they often do not. GAO found \u201chundreds of billions of dollars in differences\u201d between agencies involved in such transactions.\n\nImproper payments \u2014 those that should never have been made and those that were made in the wrong amounts \u2014 \u201care a significant and pervasive governmentwide issue,\u201d GAO reported. Since 2003, when certain agencies were first required to report improper payments, the government has shelled out over $1 trillion more than it should have. Last year, agencies reported over $136.7 billion in improper payments, an increase of $12 billion over the prior year. GAO attributed most of the growth to \u201can increased error rate in Medicaid.\u201d Though the agency did not speculate on the reason for the increased error rate, it is likely a result of the program\u2019s expansion under ObamaCare, which has lacked sufficient controls from the outset.\n\nIn addition, GAO cited \u201cthe government\u2019s ineffective process for preparing the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements\u201d as an impediment to audits.\n\n\u201cThe government-wide financial statements that GAO audits should tell us what came in to the government\u2019s coffers and what went out; what the government owns, and what it owes; and if its operations are financially sustainable,\u201d Budget Committee Chairman Senator Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) said in a statement. \u201cBut GAO\u2019s recent audit calls into question the reliability of this underlying financial data.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be disastrous for a publicly-owned company to be unable to prove to auditors that it had a handle on how much inventory was held in its own warehouses, what condition its property is in, or the extent to which it is on the hook for potential liabilities,\u201d Enzi added. Yet the very same entity that is plagued by such mismanagement has the audacity to micromanage private companies\u2019 accounting practices via such laws as Sarbanes-Oxley and to demand that individuals, organizations, and businesses alike maintain scrupulously detailed records of their income and expenditures in case they are audited by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThere is little doubt that the U.S. government is in serious financial straits. GAO said it was difficult to assess the government\u2019s fiscal outlook because of \u201csignificant uncertainties,\u201d primarily concerning the growth of Medicare spending. Almost everyone, however, agrees that, as GAO put it, \u201cabsent policy changes, the federal government continues to face an unsustainable long-term fiscal path.\u201d Estimates of Uncle Sam\u2019s debt including unfunded liabilities such as Medicare and Social Security run from $65 trillion to $210 trillion. Good luck paying for all that without ruinous levels of taxation or inflation (or both).\n\nThe problem, as always, is not revenue but spending. Politicians have frittered away future generations\u2019 dollars in search of present political gain. Voters, believing they are getting something for nothing, have, for the most part, ratified this course of action by reelecting these spendthrifts.\n\nSpending must be slashed if the United States is not to go the way of other formerly prosperous nations that have been bankrupted by the welfare state. Anyone looking for direction as to what exactly should be cut need turn to only one brief document: the U.S. Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "national debt, GDP, comptroller general, Gene Dodaro", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/congress/item/22948-national-debt-will-soon-eclipse-gdp-says-comptroller-general", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/067e6317774a9ff96eb044e77851b973_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The U.S. government will soon owe more than the entire economy produces, Comptroller General Gene Dodaro told the Senate Budget Committee recently.
