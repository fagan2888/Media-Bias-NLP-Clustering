Barbara Boxer is teaming with potential Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul to promote a plan they say will fix crumbling roads but which many experts describe as a uniquely bad idea: a tax holiday on the foreign earnings of U.S.-based multinational corporations.\n\nThe California Democrat called the idea \u201ca win-win for our economy and our country.\u201d Paul, of Kentucky, said, \u201cThe whole point of this is to bring money home.\u201d\n\nBoxer has been pushing repatriation bills since she passed a one-time tax holiday through Congress in 2004. That law allowed U.S. multinationals to bring home profits they had parked abroad at a one-time tax rate of just 5.25 percent instead of the regular 35 percent corporate tax rate.\n\nThe results were widely studied and found to be a bonanza for Silicon Valley\u2019s technology giants, but of scant benefit to U.S. workers or the federal Treasury. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the U.S. Treasury and the Congressional Research Service were among those that found no evidence the holiday boosted the gross domestic product.\n\nOpposite effect\n\nIn fact, the tax holiday encouraged multinationals to park even more money abroad in tax havens, in hopes that another tax holiday might be in the offing. The overseas cash stockpile now has reached roughly $2 trillion, according to the White House. California technology companies have become particularly adept at using subsidiaries in Ireland, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and other havens to escape U.S. corporate taxes.\n\nFor this tax holiday, Boxer wants to use a one-shot revenue boost from \u201crepatriated foreign earnings\u201d to fill the highway trust fund that pays for new construction and maintenance on highways, bridges and mass transit. The proposal she and Paul are pushing would impose a one-time, 6.5 percent tax on profits parked overseas.\n\nAlthough Boxer projects a windfall as companies bring money home at the reduced rate, the plan could actually lose revenue. The Joint Committee on Taxation, which makes formal revenue estimates for Congress, said last year that another tax holiday would cost the Treasury $96 billion over the next decade, with revenue spiking in the first two years but then dropping sharply.\n\nGaining momentum\n\n\u201cIt is a terrible idea, and I\u2019d guess that most others in tax policy would feel the same way,\u201d said Joseph Bankman, a tax expert at Stanford University Law School.\n\nThe tax holiday \u201cwould probably be one of the largest single tax breaks ever,\u201d Bankman said, and would \u201cincrease the level of inequality in the nation.\u201d\n\nDespite such misgivings, Boxer\u2019s plan is gaining momentum. Republicans are desperate for a way to replenish the Highway Trust Fund, set to run out of money at the end of May, without raising the gasoline tax. The gas tax is the main source of highway funds and has been parked at 18.4 cents a gallon since the Clinton administration.\n\nIn its budget last week, the White House proposed a mandatory one-time, 14 percent tax on foreign earnings held overseas and a 19 percent rate on future overseas profits. Those rates are much higher than the Boxer/Paul proposal, but still represent a big cut from the current 35 percent corporate tax rate.\n\nPresident Obama would also use the revenue for infrastructure, making the idea one of the few areas of possible bipartisan agreement between him and the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nBoxer retains significant influence on the infrastructure debate as the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, the panel she chaired until Republicans took control of the Senate. The current chairman, GOP Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, works closely with Boxer on infrastructure legislation and said he would look at the corporate tax holiday because \u201cBarbara likes it.\u201d\n\nBoxer framed her tax holiday as a way to jump-start negotiations over the highway trust fund. Even some conservatives are cool to the idea, however, including Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan, rightward-leaning budget watchdog group.\n\nThe group opposes the tax holiday, said Vice President Steve Ellis, in part because of \u201cthe bad signal it sends\u201d to companies looking to shift operations overseas.\n\nPolitics in play\n\nOne conservative enthusiastically on board is Paul, a Tea Party libertarian on the opposite end of the political spectrum from Boxer. He mounted a vigorous defense of Cupertino giant Apple Computer\u2019s overseas tax avoidance schemes in 2013.\n\nAfter Apple chief executive Tim Cook was called to testify before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about the company\u2019s use of untaxed Irish subsidiaries, Paul said the panel should apologize to Apple for convening a hearing \u201cto bully one of America\u2019s greatest success stories.\u201d\n\nDonald Marron, a former economic adviser to former President George W. Bush who is now at the bipartisan Tax Policy Center, said while a tax holiday could create a short spike in revenue, \u201cfrom an overall budget point of view, it\u2019s difficult to see how we pay for new infrastructure with a provision that, at least according to (the Joint Committee on Taxation), loses revenue over time.\u201d\n\nMarron said it would \u201cmake sense to raise the gas tax,\u201d but lawmakers are \u201cin this place where the political desire not to raise the gas tax is as strong as ever, the pressure for money is high, and so they\u2019re in the market for ways to thread the politics\u201d of paying for highways.\n\nCarolyn Lochhead is The San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s Washington correspondent.
