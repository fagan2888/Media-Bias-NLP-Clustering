Firefighters said they are unsure of the cause of a fire in Irving late Friday that destroyed an apartment building.

No one was injured in the blaze, which occurred a 5013 Courtside Drive. The building was fully in flames by the time firefighters arrived on the scene around 9:52 p.m. Some residents have been displaced from the building, though the extent of the damage is still unknown. The blaze took about 1 hour and 30 minutes to extinguish.

The incident was the second significant fire that firefighters in Irving battled on Friday. They also responded to an apartment fire on 10417 North MacArthur Boulevard at around 1:45 p.m. No one was injured in that blaze, either, and the cause is unknown.
