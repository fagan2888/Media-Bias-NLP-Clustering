In an exclusive interview for the Dr. Phil show, Veronica's birth mom is speaking out about the ongoing custody dispute.

Christinna Maldonado says Dusten Brown was always clear he was giving up his parental rights and urged him to hand over Veronica to her adoptive parents.

"Six months into my pregnancy, I text him and I asked him if he wanted to be in her life and whenever I got a text back, he let me know that he wanted to sign his rights away and that he had spoken to his family and they had all agreed that it would be best for him if that's what he did," said Christinna Maldonado.

Maldonado says she has saved that text message.

Christinna Maldonado says she chose Matt and Melanie Capobianco because they would be "awesome" parents. She now hopes Dusten Brown will honor her wishes and let the South Carolina couple take care of Veronica.

"I would just love for him to hand her over to them and let her live a normal happy life that I chose for her," said Christinna Maldonado.

Dr. Phil plans to feature Maldonado's interview in an upcoming show.

The Dr. Phil show airs Monday thru Friday on News On 6 at 4 p.m.
