Provided\n\nWhen Sebastien Thuriere returned to the Battery\u2019s practice field this week after a month-long stint with the Haitian national soccer team, head coach Mike Anhaeuser could sense a difference in the young midfielder.\n\nComing up WHO: FC Montreal vs. Charleston Battery When: Saturday, 7:30 p.m. Where: MUSC Health Stadium Records: Montreal 4-12-1 (14 points); Battery 9-4-7 (34 points) Tickets: 971-4625\n\nThere was a certain confidence to Thuriere\u2019s demeanor that wasn\u2019t there before he left to be a part of the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament with the Haitian national team. It wasn\u2019t arrogance per se \u2014 just a little extra swagger in Thuriere\u2019s step when he returned to the training grounds with his Battery teammates.\n\n\u201cI think anytime a player gets to play on a national team and gets some international experience, it\u2019s going to help him,\u201d Anhaeuser said. \u201cNot everyone is able to get that experience. Sebastien came back from the Gold Cup with a glow about him. There was a little bit different look in his eye. He\u2019s been playing at a very high level for the past month against some great competition, so he\u2019s very confident right now.\u201d\n\nThe Charleston Battery, who are in the midst of a 14-month USL home unbeaten streak, will face FC Montreal on Saturday at the newly renamed MUSC Health Stadium at 7:30 p.m.\n\nThuriere, 25, appeared in all four matches for the Haitian national team. Despite being born in St. Petersburg, Fla., Thuriere is allowed to play for Haiti because his mother is a Haitian native.\n\nThuriere spent the last month crisscrossing the United States as the squad prepared for and played in the Gold Cup. The travel was exhausting, but the experience was one that Thuriere said he won\u2019t soon forget.\n\n\u201cWe went to eight different cities in a month and I don\u2019t think we spent more than three days in the same hotel,\u201d Thuriere said. \u201cEven with all the travel, it was an experience of a lifetime, one I\u2019m not going to forget. It was a huge honor to get called up by your country. The Gold Cup is a huge event for our country. It\u2019s an experience that I think everyone who plays soccer would love to have, You want to represent your country and play on the biggest stage possible.\u201d\n\nThe Haitians were in the same group as the United States, Panama and Honduras. It was considered the toughest group in the entire tournament. The Haitians tied Panama, 1-1; defeated Honduras, 1-0 and lost the U.S. 1-0.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely the group of death,\u201d Thuriere said. \u201cYou had to bring your A-game every match. There was almost no margin for error fo us.\u201d\n\nThuriere, who is an American citizen, said the highlight of the tournament was playing against the United States at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., in front of more than 40,000 fans. Thuriere came off the bench and played 20 minutes and nearly scored against the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt was a great atmosphere and I think that\u2019s biggest crowd I\u2019ve ever played in front of,\u201d Thuriere said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge Haitian community in Boston, so we actually had plenty of support. It was almost like playing at home in Haiti. They brought their carnival spirit to the game enough though we lost.\n\n\u201cMy parents were able to make the match and I know it took them something like 90 minutes to get out of the parking lot because all the Haitian fans were having such a good time. I got a pretty good scoring chance in that match, but I was just a bit unlucky.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to the tournament, Thuriere had been a starter for the Haitians during their four exhibition matches. Johnny Placide, Jean-Jacques Pierre, Jeff Louis and Donald Guerrier were all imported from their clubs in Europe for the tournament to bolster their lineup.\n\n\u201cWe have a few big-name players,\u201d Thuriere said. \u201cThose guys have a ton of international experience and have played in a few Gold Cups before this one. I learned a lot from those guys. I\u2019m still young, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal (coming off the bench). Hopefully, this is just the first of many appearances for (me with) Haiti.\u201d\n\nThe Haitians made it out of the group stage, but lost to Jamaica, 1-0, in the quarterfinals. Jamaica upset the United States in the semifinals before losing to Mexico in the finals.\n\n\u201cI thought we played well enough to beat Jamaica, but we were a bit unlucky,\u201d Thuriere said.\n\nThuriere returned to Charleston\u2019s lineup this past weekend, started and played a full 90 minutes for the Battery during their 1-0 loss to Toronto FC II.\n\n\u201cAfter the month with the (Haitian) national team, I\u2019m playing with a lot of confidence,\u201d Thuriere said. \u201cI was playing with some very good players and we played every day. We didn\u2019t have a day off the entire month, so I feel like my game is pretty sharp right now.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Thuriere has been finding his nitch in the Battery\u2019s lineup. He\u2019s been used as an outside midfielder on occasion, but has played mostly as a central defensive midfielder.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about Sebastien is that he\u2019s versatile so I can use him in a lot of different ways,\u201d Anhaeuser said. \u201cHe can come in and be a defensive stopper or I can put him up top and he\u2019s very good at getting forward and creating scoring chances. He\u2019s a guy we want to get on the field because we know what we\u2019re going to get from him every time he steps on the field.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Experience with Haitian national team paying dividends for Battery\u2019s Thuriere, Sports, \r\nSportsCharleston Battery, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Charleston Battery,Haitian National Soccer Team,Mike Anhaeuser,Sebastien Thuriere,USL Soccer", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "When Sebastien Thuriere returned to the Battery\u2019s practice field this week after a month-long stint with the Haitian national soccer team, head coach Mike Anhaeuser could sense a difference in the young midfielder.", "title": "Experience with Haitian national team paying dividends for Battery\u2019s Thuriere", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150801/150809881/experience-with-haitian-national-team-paying-dividends-for-battery-x2019-s-thuriere", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC20/150809881/AR/0/AR-150809881.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC20/150809881/AR/0/AR-150809881.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When Sebastien Thuriere returned to the Battery\u2019s practice field this week after a month-long stint with the Haitian national soccer team, head coach Mike Anhaeuser could sense a difference in the young midfielder.", "title": "Experience with Haitian national team paying dividends for Battery\u2019s Thuriere", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC20/150809881/AR/0/AR-150809881.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150809881}}, "keywords": "Experience with Haitian national team paying dividends for Battery\u2019s Thuriere , Sports, \r\nSportsCharleston Battery, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Charleston Battery,Haitian National Soccer Team,Mike Anhaeuser,Sebastien Thuriere,USL Soccer", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-01T13:06:30Z", "modified_time": "2015-08-01T13:06:00Z", "author": "Andrew Miller"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "When Sebastien Thuriere returned to the Battery\u2019s practice field this week after a month-long stint with the Haitian national soccer team, head coach Mike Anhaeuser could sense a difference in the young midfielder."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb387\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAfter the month with the (Haitian) national team, I\u2019m playing with a lot of confidence,\u201d Thuriere said.\nCharleston Battery midfielder Sebastien Thuriere (left) returns to the club after a month-long stint with the Haitian national team in the 2015 Gold Cup.\n\u201cI think anytime a player gets to play on a national team and gets some international experience, it\u2019s going to help him,\u201d Anhaeuser said.\nProvidedWhen Sebastien Thuriere returned to the Battery\u2019s practice field this week after a month-long stint with the Haitian national soccer team, head coach Mike Anhaeuser could sense a difference in the young midfielder.\nDespite being born in St. Petersburg, Fla., Thuriere is allowed to play for Haiti because his mother is a Haitian native."}
