All were contracted outside the country, and none are in pregnant women.\n\nVolusia County Dr. Pamela Carbiener was among those on Thursday\u2019s conference call with the CDC.\n\n\u201cThey just are trying to be proactive I think, and get on the front side of this in a way I don\u2019t think they feel like we necessarily got on the front side of the Ebola thing in year\u2019s past,\u201d Carbiener said.\n\nCarbiener said one of her patient\u2019s husband returned home from a trip with the virus.\n\n\u201cAs physicians, our data is absolutely being flooded,\u201d Carbiener said. \u201cBetween the CDC and health organizations and local departments of health, everyone is looking for us to make sure we\u2019re aware of this and to ask the correct questions.\u201d\n\nThe Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly, a condition where a baby\u2019s brain and head don\u2019t fully develop in-utero.\n\nFlorida Gov.
