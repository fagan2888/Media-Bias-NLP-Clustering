Send requests to permission@vnews.com.\n\nValley News Staff Writer\n\nLebanon \u2014 The title \u2014 Unraveled: Prescriptions to Repair a Broken Health Care System \u2014 provides an apt description of a new, self-published book by Chief Executive James Weinstein and physician William Weeks of Dartmouth-Hitchcock.\n\nSet aside the buzzwords that occasionally get past their laudable striving for plain speaking, and the good doctors\u2019 prescriptions for American health care include strong and repeated doses of informed consumers, robust competition by providers and pricing that reflects real costs and social impacts.\n\nThat\u2019s of particular interest to readers in the Upper Valley, where D-H is the dominant player in the health care industry. As Weeks said in an interview, D-H is \u201ctrying to lead the nation in providing population health that is patient-centered and high-value to its service area.\u201d Those aspirations lay at the heart of the hospital\u2019s \u201cimagine\u201d theme, which is widely promoted to patients and employees through the hospital\u2019s publications, web pages and wall postings.\n\nUnraveled goes beyond the familiar glossy images. \u201cThe book is trying to get the word to the consumer in language they understand,\u201d Weinstein said in an interview. \u201cWhat should a doctor\u2019s appointment be like? What should you look for? How do you get engaged in shared decision-making? Does that hospital have any information about their outcomes and their costs?\u201d\n\nThe formula laid out in Unraveling elaborates on ideas that have emerged from research and analysis done by the authors and many others at the Dartmouth Institute of Health Policy and Clinical Practice.\n\nThe Dartmouth Institute, or TDI, occupies some of the just-opened, $105 million Williamson Translational Research Building, and was founded in 1988 by John Wennberg, the creator of the influential Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care.\n\nThat atlas used data on Medicare spending during the last years of patients\u2019 lives to document large regional variations in health care costs. In 2007, Weinstein succeeded Wennberg as head of the institute. And, Weinstein said in an interview, it was his work and role at TDI that led then-Dartmouth College President Jim Kim to encourage him to take the D-H CEO job in 2011.\n\nTDI has been an important source of ideas for advocates for health care reform in the United States and beyond. During the debate that preceded passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, TDI\u2019s research and the Dartmouth Atlas were often cited to support the claim that about $700 billion, or one-third of annual U.S. spending on health care, could be saved by eliminating waste.\n\nThat claim has been disputed by critics, who say it didn\u2019t account for variations in the quality of health care or for the impact of poverty and regional living costs on Medicare spending. The authors of Unraveled don\u2019t restate the $700 billion claim, but still see waste as a critical problem in health care. \u201cIf things are futile, it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend money on them,\u201d Weeks said in an interview. In the book, they seek to translate into consumer-friendly language the ideas developed at TDI that are being put into practice, to varying degrees, at D-H.\n\nThe book scans an array of health care interactions, arguing that emphases on preventive and primary care make health and economic sense and that diabetes, asthma and other chronic diseases and care for the dying can be managed with greater humanity at less cost. It examines medical bills and electronic health records, and finds glasses half full with possibility where others end up perplexed and thirsting for relief from aggravation.\n\nTheir aim is to root out what Weeks describes as \u201cperverse incentives\u201d \u2014 prices that induce providers and patients to make wasteful and unhealthy decisions \u2014 embedded in the health care market, including those that discourage provision of preventive care. \u201cSince interventions for acute-care needs generally are reimbursed more than those for preventive care, these acute-care services \u2018squeeze out\u2019 the availability of preventive care services,\u201d the book says.\n\nWeeks and Weinstein look to consumers \u2014 patients and their families \u2014 to step up to help reduce waste. They write: \u201cIf reimbursement were modified to encourage access to \u2014 and use of \u2014 preventive, non-hospital care, and if health care utilization, costs, and outcomes were transparently reported, consumers could make informed decision about whether and where to obtain particular health care services.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Weinstein spelled out how that would work. \u201cYou should be able to walk into any hospital system and understand how many heart surgeries do they do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have the outcomes been? What\u2019s the average cost? What\u2019s the average length of stay? What\u2019s the complication rate? What\u2019s the readmission rate? Those things should be available to a patient who\u2019s having to make that decision.\u201d\n\nWhile the premise of the book is the possibility of operating health care more rationally and humanely, the authors acknowledge some challenges to developing a system that measures and rewards the health of the population served rather than the quantity of services delivered.\n\nFor one thing, even if changed incentives can squeeze waste out of the system, some individuals may also feel squeezed. As the book puts it: \u201cWhile performance management systems help drive higher-value care, their mostly blind application has the potential to undermine care for individual patients.\u201d\n\nAlso, some of the services that improve population health may be delivered outside the health care system. \u201cOther countries spend substantially less on health care but they actually spend more on social services including health-related social services,\u201d said Weeks. The simple solution is to shift spending to where it will do more good. \u201cWe already know the money we\u2019re spending now,\u201d Weeks said. \u201cGive us that money, and we\u2019re going to redeploy it in a way that will produce more health.\u201d\n\nBut such resource-redirection strategies have sometimes run aground on the shoals of politics. For example, a multi-decade effort to shut down massive hospitals that warehoused mentally ill patients and shift resources into community treatment and support sputtered after community services were cut to balance budgets.\n\nAt the core of the health care system envisioned by Unraveled, according to Weeks, is \u201cinvolvement of patients in an objective, shared decision-making process.\u201d But markets don\u2019t always reinforce the growth of such processes. \u201cOne of the challenges with the competitive market is that there\u2019s not enough clout for individuals,\u201d said Weeks.\n\nIn fact, decades of health care reform efforts provide many cautionary tales of the clout of vested and powerful interests \u2014 pharmaceutical and insurance companies, hospitals and even doctors\u2019 organizations \u2014 that defend the status quo. And Unraveled provides no vision for structural change, fundamental reform or \u2014 with apologies to Bernie Sanders \u2014 political revolution to accomplish the reforms it describes.\n\nDespite its limitations, Unraveled seeks to continue a constructive argument about health care which, in addition to touching all of our lives, now comprises about one-sixth of economic activity in the U.S. What type of system is needed? What is sustainable?\n\nAnd Weeks and Weinstein have earned a hearing from the public. Weeks, 52, is a psychiatrist who is now in France on a Fulbright-Tocqueville fellowship lecturing on how the methodology of the Dartmouth Atlas can be applied there. Weinstein, 65, has been at D-H for 23 years, headed up TDI for four years and became D-H\u2019s chief executive in 2011. \u201cI think the credibility of the book is because I am a physician, I have lost a daughter from cancer and I now run a major health system that\u2019s trying to change the world,\u201d Weinstein said.\n\nThe book is an accessible and, at 129 pages, concise description of the vision for a better health care system \u2014 not to mention the thinking that seeks to shape D-H, the region\u2019s largest employer and dominant health care system.\n\nBut the book is still seeking an audience. On Friday it ranked 69,218 among books on health, fitness and dieting, and 566,614 overall, on the website of Amazon, which provided publishing services to the authors.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stilled authors\u2019 efforts to be heard. \u201cWe\u2019re giving away a lot of books, trying to get this into medical school libraries (and) nursing schools,\u201d said Deb Kimbell, who worked with the authors on the book\u2019s publication.\n\nUnraveled is \u201ca first attempt,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the book I will eventually write.\u201d\n\nRick Jurgens can be reached at rjurgens@vnews.com or 603-727-3229.\n\nCorrection\n\nDartmouth-Hitchcock's board of trustees selected and hired Dr. James Weinstein as the CEO and president of the D-H system in 2011.
