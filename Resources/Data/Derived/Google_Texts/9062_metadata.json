There\u2019s always a Christmas deadline, they will extend it by 30 days, 60 days, so people don\u2019t seem to be focusing on this yet. The debt ceiling is where the rubber meets the road. Jack Lew says earlier in October they run out of cash. it\u2019s a cash flow problem. If things are attached to that debt ceiling and we start looking at another downgrading of the US economy, that\u2019s really serious stuff. That\u2019s your 401(k). MADDOW: That\u2019s stuff that doesn\u2019t get reversed even if retroactively fixed. when we had a credit downgrade as a nation, minor and controversial one, that\u2019s something that has consequences in a way that takes years, maybe decades to grow out of. You look back at the way Ronald Reagan inveighed in the \u201980s against messing with the debt ceiling. Really messing with it? Just taking Reagan\u2019s arguments alone about the harm to the nation ought to be convincing to anybody on any part of the political spectrum as long as you love this country and as long as you don\u2019t want to wantonly inflict harm that\u2019s very hard to grow out of. The shutdown thing, I believe that\u2019s going to happen. I realize that\u2019s not a conventionally held view. I think the shutdown will happen and when we get close to the debt ceiling having shut down government we\u2019ll be in a crisis mode. That will be an adult moment for the nation.\n\nThere is a lot of talk about the politics of this situation, but messing with the debt ceiling is dangerous because it is directly screwing with the entire economy. People could see their retirement accounts, which are just starting to rebuild after the last Republican caused economic collapse, get wiped out again. People aren\u2019t taking this seriously yet, because a sort of crisis conditioning that has taken hold in this country.\n\nThe Republican have created and caused so many crisis that the American people have become desensitized when a new one pops up. People assume that Republicans will eventually back down, and they probably will, but their lack of leadership and direction could tank the economy before this is resolved. The longer House Republicans take to get their act together, the greater the risk for the American people.\n\nNot all Republicans want to go down this path, but the House is in chaos. There is no leadership. Nobody on the Republican side listens to Boehner or Cantor. There is no unity, and absolutely no urgency to do what is right.\n\nWhen the government shutdown in 1995, the economy suffered a 1% temporary drop in GDP. Combine that temporary drop with the economic impact of not raising the debt ceiling, and it will be a devastating body blow to the working men and women of this country.\n\nWhile we have been distracted by the Ted Cruz circus and Obamacare, Republicans are this close to destroying our economy.\n\nIt\u2019s time to buckle up and pay attention, because things are about to get bumpy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On MSNBC today, Rachel Maddow explained how House Republicans are about to destroy the economy with their insistence that Obamacare be defunded.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "On MSNBC today, Rachel Maddow explained how House Republicans are about to destroy the economy with their insistence that Obamacare be defunded.", "title": "Rachel Maddow Explains How House Republicans Are About to Destroy The Economy", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/26/rachel-maddow-explains-house-republicans-destroy-economy.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/maddow-mitchell-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-26T17:48:51+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Rachel Maddow,rachel maddow debt ceiling,rachel maddow government shutdown,republicans destroy the economy,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-09-26T17:48:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-26T17:48:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Rachel Maddow, rachel maddow debt ceiling, rachel maddow government shutdown, republicans destroy the economy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9461\"", "article_summary": "On MSNBC today, Rachel Maddow explained how House Republicans are about to destroy the economy with their insistence that Obamacare be defunded.\nThe longer House Republicans take to get their act together, the greater the risk for the American people.\nIf things are attached to that debt ceiling and we start looking at another downgrading of the US economy, that\u2019s really serious stuff.\nThe debt ceiling is where the rubber meets the road.\nYou look back at the way Ronald Reagan inveighed in the \u201980s against messing with the debt ceiling."}
