You might have to go to agencies to help pay lights, water, gas but that's not enough money to feed our families,\" said worker Theresa Boyd.\n\n\n\n\n\nHours after the protests, a local McDonald's owner-operator sent the following statement:\n\nAt McDonald\u2019s we respect everyone\u2019s right to peacefully protest. The topic of minimum wage goes well beyond McDonald\u2019s - it affects our country\u2019s entire workforce. McDonald\u2019s and our independent franchisees support paying our valued employees fair wages aligned with a competitive marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my restaurants wages are set according to local and federal laws, the competitive marketplace and job level. We believe that any minimum wage increase should be implemented over time so that the impact on owners of small and medium-sized businesses is manageable and feasible. Additionally, we believe that any increase needs to be considered in a broad context, one that considers, for example, the impact of the Affordable Care Act and its definition of \u201cfull time\u201d employment, as well as the treatment, from a tax perspective, of investments made by businesses owners.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thursday's demonstrations were among 160 \"Fight for 15\" protests across the country.", "og": {"site_name": "ARKANSASMATTERS", "description": "Thursday's demonstrations were among 160 Fight for 15 protests across the country.", "title": "Fast Food Workers Protest in LR/NLR for Higher Pay", "url": "http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/news/fast-food-workers-protest-in-lrnlr-for-higher-pay", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/arkansasmatters/photo/2014/12/04/Story_3966532_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 697714093708694}, "google-site-verification": "Z_P4LryacEsJyHM4crEcugDuRt5Tq977UP7ZyGT4NrY", "keywords": "facebook,news", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "facebook, news", "published_time": "2014-12-05T00:05:10+0000", "modified_time": "2014-12-05T00:05:10+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "NORTH LITTLE ROCK, AR - Dozens of fast food workers protested this morning at McDonald's restaurants in Little Rock and North Little Rock.\n\"Fight for 15\" protestors marched inside the North Little Rock location, waving signs and shouting chants.\nIn my restaurants wages are set according to local and federal laws, the competitive marketplace and job level.\nThe workers also marched outside the McDonald's in downtown Little Rock.\nHours after the protests, a local McDonald's owner-operator sent the following statement:At McDonald\u2019s we respect everyone\u2019s right to peacefully protest."}
