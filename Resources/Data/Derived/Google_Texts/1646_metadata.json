Sendero\u2019s break with the Seton Healthcare Family means the Sendero network no longer includes 11 Seton hospitals and four outpatient facilities.\n\nSendero serves Central Texans, including residents of Travis, Williamson and Hays counties, through its Medicaid HMO, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and IdealCare, a plan under the Affordable Care Act. Those enrollees were notified that, as of Nov. 1, they were no longer covered at Seton facilities, including University Medical Center Brackenridge, a public safety-net facility that Seton runs, and the region\u2019s only comprehensive children\u2019s hospital, Dell Children\u2019s Medical Center.\n\nOfficials connected to Sendero said its Medicaid and CHIP enrollees will be able to get care at other facilities in the region, including 10 hospitals, six of which are part of St. David\u2019s HealthCare.\n\nThey also said that, despite the contract termination, patients can still receive emergency care at Seton, as well as other Seton services not available elsewhere. Other demands for a Seton facility will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, they said.\n\n+ Central Health is Travis County\u2019s hospital district, which oversees programs for health care services for the county\u2019s poor, uninsured and underinsured ... read more \u00d7\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re very disappointed that Seton is not in our network,\u201d said Lynne Hudson, a Sendero board member. \u201cI want to assure our members, with the transition plan put in place, our goal is not to harm or cause any inconvenience to a member.\u201d\n\nHudson also serves on the board of Central Health, which chose to create Sendero as a way to cover more indigent patients with health insurance. The board envisioned a broad expansion of Medicaid under the health care law to increase a pool of potential customers. But it didn\u2019t happen when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out.\n\nConsequently, the health plan has struggled financially since it opened for business in March 2012. To date, Central Health has transferred $45.9 million in taxpayer money into Sendero \u2014 far more than officials ever envisioned.\n\n+ Central Health Patricia Young Brown Central Health \u00d7\n\nThe disagreement over how much money Sendero would pay Seton for care had been brewing for months. Over the summer, officials on both sides downplayed the issue, with Central Health President and CEO Patricia Young Brown saying such negotiations are common between insurers and health care providers.\n\nThis time, those negotiations broke down.\n\nThe situation is an unusual one for Central Health, Travis County\u2019s taxing authority for health care services to low-income and uninsured county residents. Central Health and Seton are close partners. They created a nonprofit aimed at transforming health care delivery, and they cooperate on providing care to needy county residents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Greg Hartman, a Seton executive, said of the contract termination. \u201cWe really do need to arrive at a good solution here. We offered to partner with Sendero in a lot of different ways \u2026 and we really want to get this fixed. It\u2019s not good for the community, and it\u2019s not good for any of the providers in town.\u201d\n\nYoung Brown said that while discussions with Seton are ongoing, she believes St. David\u2019s and the other hospitals can adequately care for Sendero\u2019s enrollees.\n\nShe said children can be hospitalized at St. David\u2019s North Austin Medical Center, which has a small children\u2019s hospital inside of it. That facility has 10 emergency beds, eight medical/surgical inpatient beds and six intensive-care beds.\n\nState insurance industry regulators haven\u2019t yet decided whether the network is adequate, Texas Department of Insurance spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said Tuesday.\n\nDespite the dust-up, Hartman and Young Brown said their organizations continue to have a strong working relationship. But it\u2019s complicated.\n\nAdding to the complexity is Seton\u2019s Medicaid HMO, which competes with Sendero. Two larger health plans also offer managed care services to adults on Medicaid and children on CHIP in Central Texas. The competition cut into potential profits.\n\nIn 2011, John Stephens, then-Central Health\u2019s chief financial officer, said he thought the maximum losses if the HMO failed was $10 million to $12 million. In a worst-case scenario, losses could be up to $23.4 million, he said, adding that wouldn\u2019t happen because the board would first pull the plug. Stephens said he expected the HMO to break even in 2017, though a former Sendero CEO said that would happen during the health plan\u2019s third year of business.\n\nNo one is making such predictions now.\n\nThe $45.9 million from taxpayers has been used to pay claims and satisfy state requirements for Medicaid HMO balances, officials have said. In the current budget year, Central Health has pledged an additional $5 million, if Sendero needs it. Central Health officials don\u2019t disclose financial details, including rates, for competitive reasons, Young Brown said.\n\nAsked if it was time to pull the plug, Central Health Chairwoman Katrina Daniel said the board still values Sendero.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a community-based health plan that provides an element of continuity for the folks Central Health serves,\u201d said Daniel, a former associate commissioner at the Texas Department of Insurance. \u201cThe board, obviously, watches it closely.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A money-losing health plan kept afloat by Travis County taxpayers has ended its agreement with Austin\u2019s largest health system, cutting in half the number of hospitals available to the needy adults and children in the plan.", "author": "By Mary Ann Roser - American-Statesman Staff", "og": {"url": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/taxpayer-backed-health-plan-in-austin-breaks-with-/npP54/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/11/17/22/b0/HiRes-Trish_Young-7028-Edit.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A money-losing health plan kept afloat by Travis County taxpayers has ended its agreement with Austin\u2019s largest health system, cutting in half the number of hospitals available to the needy adults and children in the plan.", "title": "Central Texas health plans severs ties with Seton in rate dispute"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/11/17/55/d0/FullSizeRender_1.jpg", "description": "A money-losing health plan kept afloat by Travis County taxpayers has ended its agreement with Austin&rsquo;s largest health system, cutting in half the number of hospitals available to the needy adults and children in the plan.", "card": "summary", "title": "Taxpayer-backed health plan in Austin breaks with Seton over rates"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myaas", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/taxpayer-backed-health-plan-in-austin-breaks-with-/npP54/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3141004/news/news/taxpayer-backed-health-plan-in-austin-breaks-with-/npP54/", "keywords": "williamson county,statesman,local news,health,hays county,Travis County,City of Austin,Bastrop County", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The situation is an unusual one for Central Health, Travis County\u2019s taxing authority for health care services to low-income and uninsured county residents.\n+ Central Health Patricia Young Brown Central Health \u00d7The disagreement over how much money Sendero would pay Seton for care had been brewing for months.\nAbout 10,000 Central Texas households are covered by Sendero Health Plans and will need to get care elsewhere.\nThe Texas Department of Insurance is now reviewing whether the network offered by Sendero Health Plans is adequate to serve its members in 10,000 households across eight Central Texas counties.\nThey created a nonprofit aimed at transforming health care delivery, and they cooperate on providing care to needy county residents."}
