But this year, at least, the pastor has resolved not to.\n\nFor the next 12 months, Bell says he will live as if there is no God.\n\nHe will not pray, go to church, read the Bible for inspiration, trust in divine providence or hope in things unseen. He\u2019s taking the opposite of a leap of faith: a free fall into the depths of religious doubt.\n\nBell\u2019s \u201cintellectual experiment,\u201d which began January 1, has already borne dramatic consequences.\n\nIn less than a week, he lost two jobs teaching at Christian schools near his home in Los Angeles. He\u2019s 42 and has been a pastor or in seminary for most of his adult life. Now he faces the prospect of poverty and taking odd jobs to feed his two daughters, 10 and 13.\n\n\u201cThere have been times, usually late at night and early in the morning, when I think: What have I done? It really undermines the whole structure of your life, your career, your family,\u201d Bell said.\n\nBut just as the man of God began to despair, he found help from an unlikely source: atheists.\n\n'Suspending belief '\n\nThe seeds of Bell\u2019s journey were planted last March, when he was asked to resign as pastor of a Seventh-day Adventist congregation in Hollywood.\n\nHe had advocated for the church to allow gay and lesbian leaders, campaigned against California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban and disputed deeply held church doctrines about the End Times.\n\nEventually, his theological and political liberalism became more than leaders in the denomination could bear, and he lost his career of 19 years. His faith was shaken, and for a while Bell became a \u201creligious nomad.\u201d\n\nOn the positive side, losing his church job gave him the freedom to question the foundations of his religious belief without fear of troubling his congregation.\n\n\u201cI could finally pursue those questions that had been bouncing around my head,\u201d he said, while earning money from teaching, speaking and consulting jobs.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Behold, the six types of atheists\n\nThen, after lunch with a friend last year, he thought: What if he tried out atheism, and lived with no religion at all for a year?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to a movie and you suspend disbelief for three hours to get inside the story,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI\u2019m suspending my belief in God to see what atheism is all about.\u201d\n\nBell, who still holds ministerial credentials in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, thought it would be a neat little intellectual experiment.\n\nHe would interview atheists, attend gatherings of nonbelievers and read through the canon of skeptics: Friedrich Nietzsche, Baruch Spinoza, Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, among others.\n\nWhen friends got sick, instead of praying, as was once his immediate response, Bell said, he would \u201cdo something tangible and practical and supportive for them.\u201d\n\nHe would start a blog, \u201cYear Without God,\u201d and write about his faithless journey. Bell thought maybe a few people would read his posts, follow along and offer advice or criticism.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize, even four days ago, how difficult it would be for some people to embrace me while I was embracing this journey of open inquiry into the question of God\u2019s existence,\u201d Bell wrote on Saturday.\n\n\u2018We need to talk\u2019\n\nThe first signs of trouble came around the turn of the new year, just days after Bell announced his experiment online.\n\nTexts and e-mails arrived from friends, family and colleagues with the ominous phrase, \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d\n\nKurt Fredrickson, a friend of Bell\u2019s and associate dean of ministry at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, sent one of those messages.\n\nBell, a graduate of Fuller, had taught in the school\u2019s doctorate development program for the past year. But Fredrickson told his friend that his sabbatical from faith meant a sabbatical from the seminary as well.\n\n\u201cFrom an academic standpoint, and even as a personal journey, I\u2019m really excited about what Ryan is doing,\u201d Fredrickson said.\n\n\"There is no honest person of faith who doesn\u2019t have doubts, and Ryan is being courageous enough to take a step back and assess his life. This is bold stuff.\u201d\n\nBut Bell\u2019s job at Fuller was to help students through their doctoral dissertations, a particularly stressful time, Fredrickson said, when seminarians need to lean on a person with strong faith.\n\n\u201cThey are flying solo for the first time, and we want to not only teach, but to nurture souls as well,\u201d Fredrickson said. \u201cRyan saying he\u2019s going to be an atheist for a year is a little contradictory to that.\u201d\n\nFuller would be happy to talk to Bell when his experiment is over, the dean added.\n\nMORE ON CNN: What Oprah gets wrong about atheism\n\nAzusa Pacific University, where Bell had taught intercultural communication since 2011, also declined to renew his contract.\n\nRachel White, a spokeswoman for the school, wouldn\u2019t comment, saying it was an internal personnel matter. But she said all school and faculty are expected to sign a statement of faith outlining their belief in Christianity.\n\nAlso this year, Bell lost a consulting job with a Seventh-day Adventist Church in Glendale, California.\n\nBell said he bears no ill will toward the church or the schools that let him go, though he wishes they would tolerate, if not support, his atheism experiment. The loss of income has led to some family stress, he said.\n\n\u201cI have kids to support and utilities to pay and the rent is due,\u201d Bell said. \u201cAt this point I\u2019m willing to do almost anything.\u201d Bell said he and his wife are divorcing, though not because of his atheist experiment.\n\nMeanwhile, the phone calls, e-mails and texts from friends and family worried about the fate of his soul continue to pour in.\n\n\u2018A beautiful gesture\u2019\n\n\u201cHe learned what it\u2019s like to be an atheist real fast,\u201d said Hemant Mehta, a prominent atheist blogger and schoolteacher in Illinois.\n\nMehta said he knows many atheists who fear that \u201ccoming out of the closet\u201d will jeopardize their jobs and relationships, just as in Bell\u2019s experience.\n\nMehta said he doesn\u2019t exactly agree with the premise of Bell\u2019s experiment. How does someone pretend to be an atheist? It\u2019s not like a hat you wear to see if it fits. Faith taps into deeply held beliefs and emotions. Even during his experiment with atheism, won't there still be a nagging suspicion in the back of Bell\u2019s mind that God exists?\n\n(For the record, Bell describes his current theological views as agnostic - somewhere between belief and atheism. But he's trying to put that aside for the year to live and think like an atheist.)\n\nMehta said he admired Bell\u2019s pluck and sympathized with his plight. Though he had never spoken with the pastor, Mehta set up an online fundraiser for Bell on Tuesday. In just one day, nearly 900 people donated more than $19,000 to help \u201cthe pastor giving atheism a try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think more than anything else, people appreciate that this guy is giving atheism a shot,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cI mean, he lost three jobs in the span of a week just for saying he was exploring it.\u201d\n\nBell said he knows Christians and agnostics who have contributed to his fundraiser as well, so it\u2019s not an all-atheist effort.\n\nStill, he\u2019s impressed that nonbelievers have flocked to help fund his experiment\n\n\u201cIt really validates that the (atheist) community is really all about the search for truth,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThey know that I might not even end up as an atheist at the end of my search, but it doesn\u2019t matter to them. It\u2019s such a beautiful gesture.\u201d\n\nWill the support tip Bell toward atheism? The pastor is agnostic about that, too \u2013 for now.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Can atheist churches last?", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, Belief Blog Co-editor (CNN) -- In the past, at times like these, when his life foundered and frayed around the edges, Ryan Bell often prayed for help.
