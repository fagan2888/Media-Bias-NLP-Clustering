We can't let politics get in the way of all these positive trends. More Alaskans have health care, and most people are happy with the plans they have. We've reduced the growth in health care costs, and a majority of people say their lives are better since implementation of the Affordable Care Act. I think we owe a debt of gratitude to the Alaska nonprofits that have worked hard to help Alaskans enroll in new plans. Let's keep moving forward and not let politics reverse any of the progress we've made.
