(AP) - CenturyLink, the largest public company headquartered in Louisiana, is eliminating 1,000 jobs companywide.\n\nThe Times (http://bit.ly/1DCYRp2 ) reports the company had not released a list as of Friday of the communities or states where the layoffs will occur.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have specific impacts by community and/or by state at this time,\u201d spokesman Annmarie Sartor said Friday in an email to the newspaper.\n\nCenturyLink employs about 2,700 workers in Louisiana with about 2,500 of them at the corporate headquarters in Monroe. The company has a local annual payroll exceeding $120 million.\n\nThe company employs 44,000 globally.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reaching out to company officials to better understand how the recently announced plans might impact employment in Louisiana,\u201d Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Steven Grissom said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAt this time, the company appears to still be assessing the distribution of the reductions across the company\u2019s footprint. CenturyLink\u2019s new 300,000-square-foot Technology Center of Excellence in Monroe was completed earlier this year, and we will continue working with the company on its headquarters expansion efforts in Louisiana,\u201d he said.\n\nCenturyLink has committed to create 800 new jobs by next summer in Monroe or the rest of the state.\n\nSartor said the company is on track on its headquarters expansion. The state committed about $20 million in incentives connected to that 2011 agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are on target with our hiring commitment in Monroe,\u201d he said.\n\nCenturyLink\u2019s layoffs come on the heels of a disappointing second quarter earnings report announced Wednesday that fell below company and analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nDuring the second quarter, CenturyLink made $143 million, or 26 cents per share, on operating revenue of $4.4 billion. Last year, the company reported net income of $193 million, or 34 cents per share, on revenue of $4.5 billion.\n\nThe company said the results were primarily due to continued pressure on wholesale revenues and higher employee and benefit costs.\n\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed with the financial results for this quarter, we are positioning CenturyLink to drive stronger sales, strategic revenue growth and improved operating cash flow in the months ahead,\u201d Glen Post, CenturyLink\u2019s chief executive officer and president, said in a statement.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times, http://www.shreveporttimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "CenturyLink, the largest public company headquartered in Louisiana, is eliminating 1,000 jobs companywide.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/8/centurylink-plans-1000-job-layoff-companywide/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "CenturyLink, the largest public company headquartered in Louisiana, is eliminating 1,000 jobs companywide.", "title": "CenturyLink plans 1,000-job layoff companywide"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "CenturyLink, the largest public company headquartered in Louisiana, is eliminating 1,000 jobs companywide.", "card": "summary", "title": "CenturyLink plans 1,000-job layoff companywide"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "During the second quarter, CenturyLink made $143 million, or 26 cents per share, on operating revenue of $4.4 billion.\n\u201cWe are currently reaching out to company officials to better understand how the recently announced plans might impact employment in Louisiana,\u201d Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Steven Grissom said in a statement.\n(AP) - CenturyLink, the largest public company headquartered in Louisiana, is eliminating 1,000 jobs companywide.\nCenturyLink employs about 2,700 workers in Louisiana with about 2,500 of them at the corporate headquarters in Monroe.\nCenturyLink has committed to create 800 new jobs by next summer in Monroe or the rest of the state."}
