Sioux Falls, SD

Construction Season 2015 starts off with major road closures on Cliff Avenue Monday, April 6.

Cliff Avenue will be closed from 61st Street to 85th Street for construction that includes underground utility upgrades, adding lanes to Cliff Avenue, and median and sidewalk construction.

Traffic will be detoured to Minnesota Avenue via 69th Street and Lincoln Co. Highway 106. Businesses on Cliff Avenue south of 69th street will remain open during construction.

Travelling will be whittled down to one lane in each direction along 69th Street and along Cliff Avenue north of 69th Street during the project.

"This project will have a major impact on commuters entering Sioux Falls from Harrisburg and other points south of Sioux Falls," City Engineer Chade Huwe said in a press release about the project. "We appreciate everyone’s patience as we work to expand this roadway to handle not just today’s traffic, but traffic well into the future."

The expected completion date for the project is November 6, 2015.

Drivers are always urged to use caution and slow down when travelling down construction sites.
