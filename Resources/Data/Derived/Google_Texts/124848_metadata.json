Cheaper gasoline helped offset price increases for other goods and services from rent to restaurant meals.\n\nAfter factoring out volatile food and energy prices, the so-called \"core\" consumer inflation rate rose 0.2 percent, still tame by historical standards.\n\nBut the impact of lower pump prices has apparently run its course. Crude prices have stabilized and pump prices have even bumped up a bit in many parts of the country.\n\nThe uptick comes as refiners cope with isolated production bottlenecks and a monthlong strike by refinery workers.\n\nRelated: Oil Refinery Strike Continues with No Steps Toward Settlement\n\nThe subzero deep freeze gripping much of the East Coast this month has complicated life for operators of about two-thirds of the region's refining capacity, hampering production. Among other setbacks, a partial freeze of the Delaware River snarled deliveries and interrupted the cooling systems refineries in Philadelphia, according to Reuters.\n\nElsewhere in the country, thousands of refinery workers remained off the job this week as part of a monthlong strike, the industry's biggest in 35 years. Some 6,500 members of the United Steelworkers union at 12 refineries covering about a fifth of U.S. capacity began the work stoppage after talks broke down over a new three-year contract. The impasse centers on the use of non-union maintenance workers, Reuters reported.\n\nSo far, the refineries\u2014in Texas, California, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Washington\u2014have kept operating at near normal levels by lining up replacement workers to maintain operations. That means the strike also hasn't yet had a major impact on gasoline supplies, in part because stockpiles are at their highest levels in years.\n\nRefinery output also typically slows this time of year as companies schedule maintenance when demand is lowest. They also rely on stocks of gasoline blended specially for winter months before switching over to begin stockpiling summer formulations.\n\nThat could change if the strike spreads to additional locations or if refineries shut down for maintenance run into problems restarting, a not uncommon source of bottlenecks at this time of year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC.\n\nRead more at CNBC:\n\nRegulator warns of 'Armageddon' cyberevent\n\nHandy & Harman posts 4Q profit\n\nOil storage in US close to running out: Pro", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It looks like the steep slide in gasoline prices is over, at least for now.", "title": "Gas Prices Edge Up - So Fill That Tank Now", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/28/Gas-Prices-Edge-So-Fill-Tank-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-gasoline-demand_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/28/Gas-Prices-Edge-So-Fill-Tank-Now", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-gasoline-demand_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It looks like the steep slide in gasoline prices is over, at least for now.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It looks like the steep slide in gasoline prices is over, at least for now.\nCrude prices have stabilized and pump prices have even bumped up a bit in many parts of the country.\nLast month, gas prices fell to their lowest level in five years, to a national average of $2.03 a gallon, according to AAA.\nThe uptick comes as refiners cope with isolated production bottlenecks and a monthlong strike by refinery workers.\nThe sharp drop in crude prices since last summer has brought down the prices of gasoline across the country, saving consumers billions of dollars when they fill up at the pump."}
