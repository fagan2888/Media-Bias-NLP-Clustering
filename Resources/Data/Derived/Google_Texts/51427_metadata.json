Right rages at McConnell\n\nConservative groups ripped into Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, accusing him of earmarking $2 billion for a famously troubled lock-and-dam project that would benefit his home state as part of the bill to reopen the government and avert a debt default.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Kentucky Kickback,\u201d the Senate Conservatives Fund, which is considering backing McConnell\u2019s primary opponent, wrote in a blog post. \u201cIn exchange for funding Obamacare and raising the debt limit, Mitch McConnell has secured a $2 billion earmark. This is an insult to all the Kentucky families who don\u2019t want to pay for Obamacare and don\u2019t want to shoulder any more debt.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office said he had no role in securing the language, which was authored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). Versions of the water project measure passed both the House and Senate earlier this year.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 great shutdown quotes)\n\n\u201cThe provision was requested by the (Energy and Water Appropriations) subcommittee\u2014as they have made clear,\u201d a spokesman for McConnell said.\n\nThe measure, which is supported by the White House and doesn\u2019t actually spend any money, would raise the amount authorized for the Olmsted Lock and Dam project to $2.9 billion from $775 million.\n\nRedState editor Erick Erickson also said on Twitter that McConnell had \u201ccarved out an earmark for himself,\u201d and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) blasted the provision.\n\n\u201cThese people are like alcoholics. They can\u2019t resist taking a drink. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. It should have gone through the normal legislative process,\u201d McCain told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their legislative reputation even more and makes it even more difficult for me to vote for the overall bill\u2014-which I will. It shows that there are people in this body are willing to use any occasion to get an outrageous pork barrel project done at the cost of millions and millions of dollars. It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Olmsted project is located about 20 miles from the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers near where the borders of Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri meet. It was originally authorized a quarter-century ago and was only expected to cost $775 million. After decades of delays, engineering mistakes and cost overruns, the Army Corps of Engineers now expects to spend $2.9 billion on the project.\n\n( QUIZ: How well do you know Mitch McConnell?)\n\nAlexander, the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that funds water projects, said he and Feinstein, the committee\u2019s chair, were responsible for the provision.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Army Corps of Engineers, 160 million taxpayer dollars will be wasted because of canceled contracts if this language is not included,\u201d Alexander said in a statement. \u201cSen. Feinstein and I, as chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, requested this provision. It has already been approved this year by the House and Senate.\u201d\n\nThe Senate\u2019s version of the Water Resources Development Act, passed in May, included more complicated language that had the same impact. It passed 83-14. The House\u2019s version of the water appropriations bill included the same language and passed 227-198, with all but nine House Republicans supporting it.\n\nWhile McConnell might not have written the provision, he is a long-time champion of the dam. Before Congress\u2019 earmark ban started in 2009, McConnell requested hundreds of millions for the project.\n\nAuthorization doesn\u2019t directly provide any additional money for the project but would make it eligible for inclusion in appropriations bills. The Army Corps of Engineers has a multibillion-dollar backlog of authorized projects that were never completed.\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund doesn\u2019t seem to care.\n\n\u201cMcConnell may try to blame someone else for this, but he wrote the bill and it\u2019s not the first time he has sought funds for this project,\u201d the blog post read. \u201cHe also requested $100 million for it in 2010. This is what\u2019s wrong with Washington and it\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Mitch McConnell.\u201d\n\nIf the $2.9 billion is ever actually appropriated, half would come from general funds and half would come from a 20-cents-per-gallon fuel tax paid by barge owners under current law. However, provisions in both the House and Senate version of the Water Resources Development Act change that funding formula, meaning taxpayers could end up stuck with a much bigger portion of the cost.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "They criticize him for a provision in the deal.", "title": "Right rages at McConnell", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/conservatives-mitch-mcconnell-kentucky-kickback-spending-deal-98428.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/08/11/mitch_mcconnell_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republicans (4077),Senate (1887),Mitch McConnell (973),Conservatives (375),Kentucky (184)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "They criticize him for a provision in the deal.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0e3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn exchange for funding Obamacare and raising the debt limit, Mitch McConnell has secured a $2 billion earmark.\n( QUIZ: How well do you know Mitch McConnell?)\nBefore Congress\u2019 earmark ban started in 2009, McConnell requested hundreds of millions for the project.\n( PHOTOS: 25 great shutdown quotes)\u201cThe provision was requested by the (Energy and Water Appropriations) subcommittee\u2014as they have made clear,\u201d a spokesman for McConnell said.\nRight rages at McConnellConservative groups ripped into Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, accusing him of earmarking $2 billion for a famously troubled lock-and-dam project that would benefit his home state as part of the bill to reopen the government and avert a debt default."}
