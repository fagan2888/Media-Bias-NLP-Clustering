There were no follow-up questions about the role of Trump\u2019s \u2014 so public it was front-page news \u2014 affair with second wife, Marla Maples, in the breakup of his first marriage.\n\nI understand CNN\u2019s rationale for staging one-on-one interviews in lieu of a debate to give the public a peek at the more personal side of each GOP hopeful. As a journalist, I appreciate the delicate balancing act of trying to ask probing questions without being so confrontational that you become part of the story. But Cooper shouldn\u2019t have let Trump turn his airtime into an infomercial.\n\nI sympathize with the plight of any journalist who interviews the reality TV star. Trump tells so many whoppers that the relentless moderator would have to challenge practically everything he says. On Sunday, I watched CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace ask Trump about something he said at the CNN town hall: \u201cI like the mandate,\u201d Trump had said, even though he wants to repeal Obamacare. That Sunday, Trump ran from that quote, saying that he and Cooper were talking at the same time. \u201cThere\u2019s no mandate, no mandatory anything,\u201d Trump told Tapper. In fact, Trump had volunteered to Cooper that he supported the mandate, because he supports health care for all.\n\nTapper and Wallace are no pushovers, but eventually they let it slide and moved on. That\u2019s how Trump gets away with his endless fabrications. He is such a constant and shameless liar that there\u2019s no way to pin him down without throwing out interview decorum.\n\nIn South Carolina on Friday, Trump told the story of an American general who is said to have captured 50 Muslim prisoners and ordered his troops to shoot 49 of them. The general told the 50th, \u201cGo back to your people and you tell them what happened.\u201d There were no problems for 25 years, Trump concluded.\n\nThat seems to be the template for his strategy with TV news. Trump famously went after Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly for asking him about comments \u2014 fat pigs, dogs, slobs \u2014 which \u201cThe Donald\u201d made about women. To retaliate against Kelly for reporting what he said, Trump waged a Twitter war, boycotted her Fox News show, and even passed on a later debate because Kelly was a moderator.\n\nWatch other shows and you see the \u201cMegyn Kelly Effect.\u201d It sure seems as though some TV newsers shrink from pinning down Trump because they fear his fire, while others play up to Trump to boost their ratings. Le Show\u2019s Harry Shearer aired audio of off-air banter in which Trump teased Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski: \u201cYou get all the ratings and a raise. Me, I get nothing.\u201d Actually, he gets guests and hosts who marvel at his ability to break the rules without breaking his campaign.\n\nI think back to the 2008 media feeding frenzy that bloodied GOP runningmate Sarah Palin. She didn\u2019t have the gravitas to be on the ticket, critics asserted. It was the media\u2019s job to expose her shortcomings for the good of the country. Where she was greeted with disdain, Trump enjoys accolades. It turns out Palin\u2019s biggest weakness was not that she was unworthy, but that she wasn\u2019t as good as Trump at kicking back.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2016 CREATORS.COM", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "article_summary": "Trump famously went after Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly for asking him about comments \u2014 fat pigs, dogs, slobs \u2014 which \u201cThe Donald\u201d made about women.\nWatch other shows and you see the \u201cMegyn Kelly Effect.\u201d It sure seems as though some TV newsers shrink from pinning down Trump because they fear his fire, while others play up to Trump to boost their ratings.\nIn South Carolina on Friday, Trump told the story of an American general who is said to have captured 50 Muslim prisoners and ordered his troops to shoot 49 of them.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no mandate, no mandatory anything,\u201d Trump told Tapper.\nTo retaliate against Kelly for reporting what he said, Trump waged a Twitter war, boycotted her Fox News show, and even passed on a later debate because Kelly was a moderator."}
