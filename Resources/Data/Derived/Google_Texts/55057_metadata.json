Sandwiched in between the two was a laundry list of current hit-making acts, from Phantogram, Bastille and Fitz and the Tantrums, to the Neighbourhood and Foster the People, as well as Beck in the requisite icon slot.\n\nKROQ Weenie Roast 2014 Photos: Avicii, Beck, Fall Out Boy, Foster The People & More\n\nAnd what this year\u2019s array of talent showed is how much alternative is being swayed by the dance music scene.\n\n\n\nOpener Cherub was the first of many acts on the day to infuse their energetic hook-laden sounds with dance beats, with the smash \u201cDoses and Mimosas\u201d being an obvious crowd-favorite. But the infectious, if adolescent-minded \u201cxoxo,\u201d with its refrain of \u201cFuck that bitch,\u201d was equally well received.\n\n\n\nAlso going over well on the side stages, set up in a parking lot of the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine, Calif., were Bleachers, the current side project from Fun.\u2019s Jack Antonoff, and American Authors, whose Zac Barnett told Billboard following its set how the show was special to him because of childhood memories he had of growing up part time in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool because I split my time between California and Minnesota growing up, so I used to grow up listening to KROQ and I grew up coming out to Weenie Roast actually, so it\u2019s very cool to be here today,\u201d Barnett said.\n\n\n\nPhantogram wrapped up the side stage with a set anchored by the gorgeous \u201cFall In Love,\u201d a song that may not make crowds shake their collective asses, but anyone familiar with the trip-hop boom of the mid-\u201990s is very aware how the lush female vocals over an atmospheric melody fits right in with the dance music scene.\n\n\n\nThe dance boon continued over on the main stage with Capital Cities, one of the most successful acts of the last year to blend alternative hooks and dance beats. The band, whose \u201cSafe and Sound\u201d has been a ubiquitous presence on alternative, top 40 for the last year and is not slowing down, has its own dance, the Capital Cities shuffle, that it blends into every show.\n\n\n\nDespite playing in the afternoon sun, Capital Cities got fans up and moving to songs like \u201cKangaroo Court,\u201d as well as jumping and singing the refrain to the ridiculously upbeat and fun \u201cI Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo.\u201d\n\n\n\nFitz and the Tantrums had an equally successful set, with songs like \u201cMoney Grabber, \u201cFool\u2019s Gold\u201d and \u201cThe Walker\u201d proving to be crowd favorites.\n\n\n\nAs day turned into night, Bastille, the Neighbourhood, who mixed radio hits like \u201cSweater Weather\u201d and \u201cAfraid\u201d with new \u201cshit,\u201d and Fall Out Boy, which got the crowd going with older hits like \u201cSugar (We\u2019re Goin Down),\u201d \u201cDance, Dance\u201d and the closing \u201cLight \u2018Em Up,\u201d set things up for the night\u2019s biggest acts, starting with Foster the People.\n\n\n\nThe group, who were joined at one point by Capital Cities\u2019 Spencer Ludwig on trumpet, jumped right into the hits with \u201cPumped Up Kicks\u201d coming in the second slot. Of the new stuff \u201cBest Friends\u201d and \u201cComing Of Age\u201d were the predictable favorites, providing the perfect soundtrack for the kaleidoscope visuals that accompanied the act\u2019s 45-minute set.\n\n\n\nAs one of the first artists to mix beats and alternative songs, the man with \u201ctwo turntables and a microphone,\u201d Beck, was a perfect choice (with Depeche Mode not touring right now) to fill the nostalgic portion of the night. Opening with \u201cLoser,\u201d he delivered a masterful set that was both fun and funny. Beck dedicated \u201cE Pro\u201d to actor Will Ferrell, because he used to be an usher there, covered \u201cBillie Jean,\u201d got the sold-out throng going with \u201cWhere It\u2019s At\u201d and just generally showed why he is a consummate professional.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a tough act for anyone to follow, especially a relative newcomer like Swedish DJ Avicii, but with so much of the crowd there to see him, as evidenced from the moment he came out with \u201cHey Brother,\u201d he had no difficulty winning over the young audience.\n\n\n\nDancing as he worked the board, which could be seen against the backdrop of steady strobes and movie-esque visuals, Avicii turned Weenie Roast into a giant rave. It was something that a lot of purists railed against when the lineup was announced, but Avicii has crossed over to alternative radio with both \u201cHey Brother\u201d and \u201cWake Me Up,\u201d and say whatever you want about change, but the vast majority of the more than 15,000 or so stayed throughout his whole set and danced while waving their glow sticks proudly.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Given L.A. radio station KROQ\u2019s lofty status in the broadcasting pantheon, its annual Weenie Roast concert is usually a pretty strong barometer of the current state of alternative music.
