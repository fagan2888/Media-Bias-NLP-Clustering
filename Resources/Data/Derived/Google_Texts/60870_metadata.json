It\u2019s hard work, she said, but she enjoys it, despite the fact that her feet often hurt after a long shift.\n\nIt\u2019s something she\u2019s willing to put up with, she said, but in September, she had just quit a job she had held for five years and was about to start a new one when she began having excruciating pain in her side.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even get to start the new job,\u201d she said.\n\nCicero said her doctors couldn\u2019t figure out the cause of her pain. They diagnosed her with shingles, even though she didn\u2019t have the characteristic rash, and sent her home with pain and antiviral medications and told her she couldn\u2019t work because her illness was contagious.\n\nWhen the pain persisted, she went back, and a CT scan uncovered a cyst on the lining of her heart. These types of lesions are benign, and Cicero said her doctors didn\u2019t seem overly concerned. They did, however, take her off of her pain meds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if it was ever shingles at all,\u201d she said.\n\nA few days later, the pain got worse, and Cicero went back to the ER and insisted on a chest X-ray.\n\n\u201cI knew something was really, really wrong,\u201d she said. Her doctors then discovered two broken ribs on her left side.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how that happened,\u201d she said. She can\u2019t recall ever being injured there.\n\nBy October, Cicero was feeling the same pain on her right side, but didn\u2019t have another appointment for a while and didn\u2019t know if those ribs there were broken, too.\n\nCicero was frustrated by the slow pace of the process of diagnosing her pain, and was worried that it might be something serious.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wake up one day and have my kids find me dead,\u201d she said. In the meantime, she had no means of supporting herself and two of her children \u2014 a 19-year-old and a 9-year-old.\n\nWhen the medical bills started coming in, she could barely look at them. One invoice alone was for $4,000. There\u2019s no way she can pay them, she said. \u201cMy credit is shot.\u201d\n\nWhen she\u2019s working, Cicero puts in 35 hours a week and brings home about $1,500 a month. After the Affordable Health Care Act was passed, she knew she needed to get coverage, so she tried applying for Medicaid, but was turned down because she earns too much. Cicero then tried to get a policy through a health exchange, but even the premiums for the cheapest one were more than she could afford.\n\nBeing uninsured, she has failed to comply with the law, so a penalty was assessed against her income tax return this year. That penalty was later withdrawn, she said, because her income was so low.\n\n\u201cHow can I make too much money to get Medicaid, but not enough to pay the penalty?\u201d she wondered.\n\nAlthough Cicero has had no income since September, she is not eligible for any benefits, aside from a one-time emergency payment of $200 from her local social services department.\n\nBy the end of October, she was behind with her electric bill. The social services department referred her to Roanoke Area Ministries, where she received a grant through the Emergency Financial Assistance Program, which is supported by the Roanoke Times\u2019 Good Neighbors Fund.\n\nRAM could not cover the entire bill, so Cicero also got help from her mother and a friend, she said.\n\nAt the time she applied for the grant, Cicero was determined to go back to work, even though she is in too much pain to lift heavy trays.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to. I hope I\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nShe is grateful that her employer has left her job open, even though she had never actually worked for them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really blessed that they\u2019ve kept me,\u201d she said.\n\nCicero has an older son who is out of the house and working on his own, but she won\u2019t allow her 19-year-old daughter, a student at Virginia Western Community College, to earn any more than it takes to cover her part of the family\u2019s phone bill.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s extremely smart,\u201d Cicero said, and is studying to become a nurse. Cicero herself had to start work at an early age. She doesn\u2019t want balancing a job with going to school to affect what she hopes will be a brighter future for her daughter than the one she had.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "Rachelle Cicero, 38, has worked as a waitress most of her adult life.
