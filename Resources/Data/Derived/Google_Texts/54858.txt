A juvenile has died following a crash Saturday morning involving an off-road utility terrain vehicle.

It happened just after 10:30 a.m. in a pasture just south of the town of Russell. Sheriff John Fletcher with the Russell County Sheriff's Office said when deputies responded to the crash, they found the juvenile had been thrown off the UTV and was trapped underneath it. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

A second juvenile was also ejected from the UTV in the crash. He has been treated for his injuries and released.

Sheriff Fletcher said the names and ages of the victims will not be released until their family members are notified.
