Insurance carriers have said that they would restore coverage for all of those customers retroactive to Januanry 1. And the state has pledged to improve the website.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, Colorado resident Steven Roussel told Carlson that he was \u201csigned up for a plan that I did not want\u201d because of the confusion.\n\n\u201cSo, before I ask you what happened next, can you just give us a little background here?\u201d Carlson asked. \u201cWere you happy or dissatisfied with your healthcare before Obamacare?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have any healthcare before the Affordable Healthcare Act went in,\u201d Roussel explained. \u201cAnd it was because of that, that I was actually able to afford it. However, this year with the premiums jumping up, I have to make a little bit more of a tighter budget to figure out how to pay for the extra premiums that are coming my way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you were the guy they passed Obamacare for,\u201d Carlson concluded. \u201cYou had your policy canceled, you were signed up for something you didn\u2019t want, you had never heard of, never asked for.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you should go on a national TV show and like complain about it,\u201d the Fox News host quipped. \u201cHave you thought about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI called back on Friday, and I was on hold for 30 minutes, and nobody picked up,\u201d Roussel said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Carlson giggled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m laughing bitterly and I\u2019m on your side, of course. So, how do you feel about the whole Obamacare experiment?\u201d\n\nRoussel argued that healthcare reform was \u201ca little bit of a fail\u201d in his case.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not necessarily the president\u2019s fault,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s more the CEOs fault that knew about the glitch in the system and did nothing about it. And now, he\u2019s backpedaling in order to figure out exactly how to fix it for the 3,700 Coloradoans that no longer have insurance.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from Fox News\u2019 Fox & Friends, broadcast Feb. 1, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fox_ff_carlson_obamacare_150201a-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "\u2018I didn\u2019t have healthcare before\u2019: Tucker Carlson\u2019s anti-Obamacare interview goes off the rails"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m laughing bitterly and I\u2019m on your side, of course.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Carlson giggled.\n\u201cWere you happy or dissatisfied with your healthcare before Obamacare?\u201d\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have any healthcare before the Affordable Healthcare Act went in,\u201d Roussel explained.\nSo, how do you feel about the whole Obamacare experiment?\u201dRoussel argued that healthcare reform was \u201ca little bit of a fail\u201d in his case.\n\u201cSo, before I ask you what happened next, can you just give us a little background here?\u201d Carlson asked."}
