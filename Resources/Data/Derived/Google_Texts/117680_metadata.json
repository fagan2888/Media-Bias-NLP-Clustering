An all-volunteer organization at the time, the precursor to the hospital\u2019s current board of directors gathered in 1905 to establish the building blocks of a community hospital.\n\nAt the time, various committees were formed, including one tasked with exploring how to convert the hospital \u2014 originally housed in a former residence \u2014 into a place where people could come for health care services.\n\nMore than a century later, Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport is on the verge of joining one of Long Island\u2019s largest health care systems. Its board of directors voted unanimously July 9 to begin the process of affiliating with Stony Brook University Hospital, merging the small, rural facility with an organization that boasts a $1.1 billion annual budget and hosts Suffolk County\u2019s only level-one trauma center and academic medical center.\n\n\u201cIt was not a tough call to make,\u201d said ELIH board chairman Thomas Murray. \u201cAt least, in the final weeks it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nELIH\u2019s decision to merge with Stony Brook comes months after Riverhead\u2019s Peconic Bay Medical Center voted to start its own process of joining North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, one of the nation\u2019s largest health organizations, and about six months after Southampton Hospital also voted to affiliate with Stony Brook. Although ELIH was the last of the three East End hospitals to enter into an agreement with a larger organization, it had been in negotiations with both SBU and North Shore-LIJ for years.\n\nThe move comes at a time when, according to Harvard Medical School, \u201call across America, hospitals are merging.\u201d\n\nAn annual report on hospital mergers and acquisitions compiled by health care research group Irving Levin Associates shows that the volume of hospital deals rose by 14 percent in 2014 over the previous year.\n\nThat growth, the study remarked, \u201creflected the growing impact of the Affordable Care Act, and the shift in reimbursement models, toward value-based payments.\u201d\n\nOn the East End and elsewhere across the nation, that trend has left smaller hospitals unable to leverage the reimbursement rates from insurance companies they once could.\n\n\u201cELIH doesn\u2019t have the size or revenue base\u201d to get the reimbursement rates that larger health systems get, said its CEO and president, Paul Connor. \u201cSo we need to join an entity that has the financial resources.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, those involved with the merger noted that a number of valuable services can now be brought to ELIH while maintaining the community feel of which the Greenport facility is so proud.\n\n\u201cWe can provide significant support from the staff at Stony Brook University. In areas such as information systems \u2014 which is something so critical to hospitals right now \u2014 we can do things at considerably lesser costs than if they were to do it themselves,\u201d said SBU\u2019s CEO Dr. Reuven Pasternak, who is also vice president of health systems. \u201cThe same applies to compliance, finance \u2014 all of the regulatory functions in which hospitals now have to operate have gotten incredibly complex and well beyond the scope of what a smaller institution used to be able to do. That\u2019s something we can bring together as a combined entity.\u201d\n\nAdministrative services aside, Dr. Pasternak pointed out that affiliation with a larger entity will also permit the expansion of medical services at ELIH, including vascular procedures, oncology, general surgery, urology, neurosurgery, gynecological surgery and behavioral health.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s bring the patient care to the patient,\u201d said Dr. Ken Kaushansky, dean of the SBU School of Medicine and senior vice president of health sciences. \u201cIf we have a procedure that can be perfectly well done at ELIH \u2014 if they need a specialist who can do the procedure there and the patient can feel more comfortable close to home \u2014 that\u2019s terrific.\u201d\n\nGregory Garrett, executive vice president at Peconic Landing in Greenport, said he\u2019s \u201clooking forward to the services Stony Brook can provide the community.\u201d Peconic Landing itself is in the process of a $45 million expansion that will include a new memory care facility and acute rehabilitation unit.\n\n\u201cBoth of those areas, I feel, could be a great opportunity for our organization and a research institution like Stony Brook University,\u201d Mr. Garrett said.\n\nNeither Mr. Connor nor Mr. Murray would specify what tipped the scales in SBU\u2019s favor, but both offered praise for North Shore-LIJ, with which ELIH nearly partnered with 12 years ago. At that time, both Mr. Connor and Andrew Mitchell, CEO of PBMC, supported joining the same parent network.\n\nBut the health care industry has changed since then.\n\nIn 2006, the state\u2019s Berger Commission report recommended that five of Suffolk County\u2019s easternmost hospitals gather under the Stony Brook umbrella and that the sixth, St. Charles Hospital in Port Jefferson, run by Catholic Health Services, be closed. Although that never occurred, the report noted that if those hospitals were to \u201ccome together with the University Hospital, their strength and more importantly, their long-term viability increases exponentially rather than in an additive manner.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Berger Commission report, ELIH, PMBC and Southampton Hospital formed the East End Health Alliance. But the Affordable Care Act \u2014 better known as Obamacare \u2014 has \u201cmade the effort toward focusing on the patient and the facility around the patient rather than the patient around the system,\u201d said Mr. Connor. Mergers have since ensued nationwide and the EEHA is being officially dissolved.\n\nStony Brook University Hospital and ELIH will now develop a \u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d that will lay out all the legal obligations each organization has to the other.\n\nWhile that accord is being finalized, the facilities are already moving forward together on the North Fork. According to Dr. Pasternak, the hospitals are considering the establishment of operations in Mattituck to complement those in Greenport and Riverhead. In addition, Stony Brook hopes to bring primary care physicians who aren\u2019t currently affiliated with the organization under its umbrella.\n\n\u201cThis is part of an East End strategy we have long planned on doing,\u201d Dr. Pasternak said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to execute it, now with more focus.\u201d\n\nFollowing ELIH\u2019s merger decision, only two Suffolk County hospitals \u2014 Brookhaven in East Patchogue and Mather in Port Jefferson \u2014 remain unaffiliated with larger health care organizations.\n\n[email protected]\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to reflect the version printed in the July 16 issue of The Suffolk Times.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2015/07/60442/eastern-long-island-hospital-opts-to-partner-with-stony-brook/", "image": "http://media.timesreview.com.s3.amazonaws.com/suffolktimes/files/ELIH-web.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One month from Thursday, July 16,\u00a0will mark the 110th anniversary of the Eastern Long Island Hospital Association\u2019s first meeting.
