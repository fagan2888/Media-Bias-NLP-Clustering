He has no job security and little hope for career advancement. He gets paid around $23,000 a year, enough for \u201ca man of simple means\u201d like himself but not enough to start a family or buy a home.\n\nBut Mark isn\u2019t a fast food worker, although he might be better off as one. He is a lecturer at Penn, and he could be your professor.\n\nThe replacement of tenure-track faculty positions with adjunct, or contingent, faculty positions at universities has gained significant public attention in the past year. Democrats of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce released a report in January on the trend in higher education of replacing tenure-track positions with \u201ccheap labor\u201d in the form of contingent faculty.\n\nNow, two organizations are targeting the perceived inequity that contingent faculty are facing. The Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers are both seeking to organize the estimated 15,000 adjuncts in the Philadelphia area.\n\n\u201cAdjunct professors are a part of the growing low-wage workforce in this country, and they do an incredibly important job,\u201d AFT president Randi Weingerten said. \u201cWe say all kids should have a college degree, but the people who are the backbone of that degree don\u2019t have health care, rarely have a voice.\u201d\n\nCalling contingent faculty \u201csome of the most exploited professionals in America,\u201d Weingerten is hoping that by organizing together, adjuncts will be able to negotiate better working conditions and pay. A 2010 survey by the Coalition on the Academic Workforce found that unionized adjuncts earn, on average, 25 percent more per course than non-unionized adjuncts.\n\nWhen Mark, who asked to use a pseudonym, got his Ph.D. from Penn, he never imagined that his advanced degree at an Ivy League university would lead to a disheartening string of temporary lectureships as he searched for a tenure-track position \u2014 which would mean benefits, a pension and a middle-class income.\n\nFaculty not on the tenure track often lack many of the resources needed to teach and conduct research, Mark said. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of trapped in the cycle as an adjunct. It\u2019s getting increasingly difficult to do the things you need to do to get the tenure-track job,\u201d he said.\n\nTenure is a unique institution in academia which, when granted to a faculty member, prevents their dismissal without just cause and a faculty hearing. \u201cA lot of academics are drawn to a career as a professor because tenure does offer that stability, not just of a paycheck, but freedom of speech to pursue genuine inquiry,\u201d said Andrew Babson, a lecturer in the Graduate School of Education. However, tenure-track positions have become increasingly rare. Today, adjuncts make up half of all higher education faculty, up from 20 percent in 1970.\n\n\u201cIt leaves professionals pretty exhausted and underpaid. In addition, the students themselves are not getting what they should,\u201d Babson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only exploitative, but it also takes away from the overall mission and ethos of a college education culture.\n\nMark, like many others, counts himself lucky to have gotten a job at Penn. He gets paid $5,700 per course at Penn, while the median pay per course for adjuncts in the U.S. is estimated to be around $2,700, according to the Coalition on the Academic Workforce. He also gets notified if he is teaching a course several months beforehand so he can prepare and has his own office.\n\nWhile these perks might seem like basic resources necessary to successfully teach college courses, they are often nonexistent at other colleges and universities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taught at other schools where I use the food court at the student union for my office,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the class starts at 1:45, you come in at 1:40, you deliver the lecture and you\u2019ve got to run right out to go to your next teaching gig. You don\u2019t get integrated into the culture in the school.\u201d\n\nThe conditions for contingent faculty at Penn are better than at many schools, Mark added.\n\nIn response to requests for interviews with Provost Vincent Price and Vice Provost for Faculty Anita Allen for this story, the Provost\u2019s Office sent a statement confirming Penn\u2019s support for its adjuncts.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to our non-standing faculty,\u201d the statement, attributed to Allen, read. \u201cThe University is steadfastly dedicated to ensuring a productive working environment for everyone teaching Penn students.\u201d\n\nHowever, not all contingent faculty at Penn feel supported by the university, particularly with regards to health care.\n\nJerry Drew has been a lecturer in the Department of History at Penn for seven years \u2014 since he got his doctorate here at age 52. \u201cI\u2019m not a disappointed academic. I\u2019m a pleased academic because I consider myself lucky to have this job,\u201d he said. But he said his case is unique because of his age. \u201cIf I was 30, I wouldn\u2019t have the same view of lecturing here. I would feel like a second-class citizen,\u201d he added. \u201cYou sort of feel, as a lecturer, like an afterthought.\u201d\n\nHe spent the past six years as a senior lecturer, which allowed him to get health coverage. However, faculty are prevented from working more than four years as a senior lecturer without special permission from their department heads. Drew got permission for an additional two years, but this year, he is officially just a lecturer, and lecturers do not get health coverage and are not permitted to buy University health care. Drew estimates that if he were able to buy University health coverage, he would save around $8,000 to $9,000 this year.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, large employers will be required to provide affordable health care to employees working 30 or more hours per week \u2014 which has led to many universities capping adjunct hours below 30. To address this issue, the Obama administration in February began requiring schools to calculate contingent faculty hours \u201creasonably,\u201d suggesting a guideline of adding one hour and 15 minutes for every hour of teaching.\n\nAt Penn, lecturers are counted as part-time workers, though many spend additional time mentoring students or attending meetings, which can bring their hours to over 30 a week.\n\nThe low cost of hiring lecturers and adjuncts to teach courses has made increasing financial sense for schools. \u201cWhen you make the commitment to give someone tenure, you\u2019re making a multi-milllion dollar commitment,\u201d said Mary, an adjunct professor who asked to use a pseudonym.\n\nAt Penn, what are called \u201cadjunct\u201d professors must be appointed by the Provost\u2019s Office and receive health insurance and a pension \u2014 as opposed to lecturers, who do not need to be formally appointed and receive fewer, if any, benefits. As an adjunct professor, Mary does much of the same work as tenure-track professors like teaching and research, only with less pay, less job security and less hope for career advancement.\n\n\u201cThe whole adjunct crisis has raised a lot of serious questions about what we mean by quality education and what we mean by equity in education,\u201d she said.\n\nTo address the issue of equity, the AFT and the SEIU are seeking to unionize adjuncts, but the two groups are still in the early stages of doing so in Philadelphia.\n\nBabson, the GSE lecturer, decided to join the United Academics of Philadelphia, a union within the AFT, because it promised to offer opportunities for professional development. \u201cWhat the UAP means for me is meeting other people like me from other institutions,\u201d he said, echoing a common complaint that contingent faculty are often alienated from their schools and each other.\n\nSpeaking with fellow contingent faculty made Babson conclude that the adjunctification of higher education needed to be changed, he said. \u201cI think theres almost a moral obligation ... to work to make the system better.\u201d\n\nHe argued that universities have little incentive to treat contingent faculty better without active outside pressure from contingent faculty, tenure-track faculty and students.\n\nOne example is the University of Oregon, where both tenure and non-tenure-track faculty unionized through the AFT last October, leading to university administrators agreeing to more consistent raises, job stability and higher salaries for all of the faculty. At Georgetown University, adjuncts unionized through the SEIU, which was aided by the fact that the university decided not to oppose the unionization.\n\nMark, though, said he thinks the problems in higher education are too big for unions to solve. Many point to the fact that investment in tenure-track faculty jobs is simply not a priority for most universities. The average ratio of faculty and staff per administrator decreased by around 40 percent between 1990 and 2012, the American Institutes for Research reported in February.\n\nMany schools have also put money into new dormitories and recreational facilities in order to attract students. \u201cThese are the things that students and parents want to see when they visit,\u201d Mark said. \u201cIf prospective students made it known that [faculty is] a priority for them, then the school would respond to that.\u201d\n\nFacing the prospect of becoming stuck in the \u201crut\u201d of teaching as a lecturer, Mark is now considering leaving academia. \u201c[A tenure-track position] hasn\u2019t happened yet, and I\u2019ve been trying three years now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get off the hamster wheel.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The replacement of tenure-track faculty positions with adjunct, or contingent, faculty positions at universities has gained significant public attention in the past year.\u00a0Now, two organizations are targeting the perceived inequity that contingent faculty are facing.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.thedp.com/article/2014/05/adjuncts-in-philadelphia-attempt-unionization", "image": "http://d1q35ni5859stt.cloudfront.net/20160226Xkg5f5RbLb/dist/img/fb-hidden-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "The replacement of tenure-track faculty positions with adjunct, or contingent, faculty positions at universities has gained significant public attention in the past year.\u00a0Now, two organizations are targeting the perceived inequity that contingent faculty are facing.", "title": "For adjuncts, a disappointing academic experience"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "robots": "noindex, nofollow", "fb": {"pages": 6356558804}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce103\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think theres almost a moral obligation ... to work to make the system better.\u201dHe argued that universities have little incentive to treat contingent faculty better without active outside pressure from contingent faculty, tenure-track faculty and students.\nThe replacement of tenure-track faculty positions with adjunct, or contingent, faculty positions at universities has gained significant public attention in the past year.\nAt Georgetown University, adjuncts unionized through the SEIU, which was aided by the fact that the university decided not to oppose the unionization.\nA 2010 survey by the Coalition on the Academic Workforce found that unionized adjuncts earn, on average, 25 percent more per course than non-unionized adjuncts.\nMany point to the fact that investment in tenure-track faculty jobs is simply not a priority for most universities."}
