Market: In addition to the self-guided walking tour, there will be a marketplace with live entertainment, food trucks, artists and vendors by the tour\u2019s last stop, Biddle\u2019s Escape, 401 Biddle Ave. at South Trenton Avenue.\n\nIt is easy to see why the couple fell for this Colonial beauty. The four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath home boasts more than 4,400 square feet of living space and is on a lovely tree-lined street. Built in 1925, it features a porte-cochere on the side and a stunning front entry.\n\nThey had lived in the house for several years before they started on the overgrown landscaping. The couple wanted to be eco-friendly and are in the Nine Mile Run watershed. So they contacted the watershed association and its Stormworks affiliate for help in reducing the amount of runoff from their property into storm sewers. Designer Sara Madden designed a rain garden filled with native plants that does the job beautifully, with rain barrels that water vegetables and roses and Eco-Tek permeable pavers that allow rainwater and snow to seep through the driveway instead of running into the sewers. There is a bridge, too.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a lot of rain, it fills up underneath like a little moat,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cYou need the bridge to cross over. In a couple of hours, it has all been absorbed into the ground.\u201d\n\nInside, the home has many original features, including a large foyer with original wainscoting, bannisters and hardwood floor. The sun room and formal living room have crown molding, French doors, brass hardware and big, beefy fireplace mantels.\n\n\u201cWe have a young kids so our goal was to make it a modern family home and keep it intact,\u201d he said.\n\nThe formal dining room has been converted to a TV room and the breakfast room into a dining room. Upstairs, the old music room is now an office. The previous owners updated the kitchen with a center island.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much in the macaroni and cheese and pizza family stage right now,\u201d Mr. Hill said, laughing.\n\nThat leads to the reason they most love their home.\n\n\u201cThis is a fantastic, family friendly neighborhood in every respect. We walk to Frick Park, Whitney Park is just down the hill and the neighbors are great.\u201d\n\nRosa Colucci: rcolucci@post-gazette.com, Twitter, PGRosa_Colucci.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wilkinsburg shows off its hidden gems today with its second annual house and garden tour.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Wilkinsburg holds its second annual house and garden tour today.\u00a0For those who think there isn\u2019t much to see,\u00a0just ask Brian Hill.
