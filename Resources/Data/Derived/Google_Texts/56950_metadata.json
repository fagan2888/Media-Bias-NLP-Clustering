His specific quote was:\n\n\u201cOn this device in five years will be applications that will allow me to manage my health care in ways that five years ago were not even possible. I\u2019ll have the ability, someone will, you know, because of my blood sugar, there\u2019ll be a wireless, there\u2019ll be, someone will send me a signal. It\u2019ll come here, I\u2019ll get a double beep saying, \u2018You just ate a butterscotch sundae\u2019 or something like that. \u2018You went way over the top. You\u2019re a diabetic, you can\u2019t do that,\u2019 whatever. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to guide our own health care decisions in a way that will make us healthy. And ultimately, we have to get to a health system, away from a disease system.\u201d\n\nYou can watch him say it here.\n\nOk, ok, Uncle. I have come to agree that wearables may actually matter for healthcare, not just fitness. I have seen evidence of some pretty cool ideas and even actual products that could offer real medical advances and make meaningful improvements for people with some serious medical conditions. Heart disease, cancer, Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 all potentially amenable to a better patient experience through wearables.\n\nBut fix healthcare? Nope, not buying it. Let\u2019s just overlook the fact that engaging consumers in their own health has very little to do with how insurance actually operates and whether it is necessary for medical or financial reasons. I do not imagine that United Healthcare or Aetna or the folks running Medicare are worrying too much about being replaced by a watch.\n\nAnd for all the good that the Apple Watch and other wearables may, theoretically, achieve, you have to have patients who want to engage in order for change to happen. At the moment, most wearables are still monitoring the inside of bedside table drawers within 6 months of purchase.\n\nThere are definitely signs that some patients actually do care about their health, and both of those people are already healthy. Well, maybe it\u2019s more than two people, but so far we haven\u2019t seen widespread meaningful adoption among the population of people who are already suffering from chronic health conditions and who could most benefit from ongoing monitoring, measuring and medical badgering. Hopefully that will begin to evolve as the more serious applications take hold, on the Apple Watch or elsewhere.\n\nIn the meantime, I still think most of the fanfare on the wearables front is directed towards the already impossibly fit and those wannabes who shroud themselves in lycra and hope, by doing so, they can pass for one of the former. I laughed out loud at this story from The Onion, which tells the (allegedly) satiric story of a new exercise app that tells users they ran 5 miles no matter what they did. According to The Onion, \u201cWith ProMiler, achieving your exercise goals is as simple as turning on your device in the morning and being notified that you\u2019ve already run five miles.\u201d\n\nWish I\u2019d thought of that.\n\nAnd in one of those life imitating art moments, Joe Boxer, the underwear company, has launched a real live wearable, which they have dubbed an \u201cinactivity tracker,\u201d that rewards users for doing nothing. The product\u2019s motto is \u201cthat couch isn\u2019t going to sit on itself.\u201d God I love these people and others who know how to laugh at all of our collective silliness.\n\nI definitely agree that monitoring patients/consumers who have serious or potentially serious medical conditions and helping them understand how to take better care of themselves is a laudable and important goal. At a minimum we can at least cause someone else who cares to help intervene with patients who are spiraling downward, even when they themselves aren\u2019t able to focus on it for whatever reason.\n\nAs I have written before, by far the most successful wearable of all time is eyeglasses, which provide both instant gratification (solve the problem of being unable to see right now) and have become a fashion statement all their own. Certainly the Apple Watch and others have recognized the importance of the fashion aspect of something that is strapped to you at all times. This is one of the reasons people hate hearing aids and neck-hung PERS devices\u2014they couldn\u2019t be less fashionable and tend to make the wearer feel old rather than hip. And yet those two items solve meaningful problems for users, proving that this is not enough. Only Flavor Flav can carry off that huge pendant form factor with style.\n\nHopefully we will soon start to see the effective incorporation of wearables into meaningful medical use, but let\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s a cure-all for the healthcare system, which is, after all, a system, and thus complex and comprised of many parts.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on how ticked off everyone one was (totally justifiably, by the way) that they couldn\u2019t enroll in Obamacare on demand but are willing to wait two months to get an Apple Watch because it feels \u201cexclusive.\u201d Perhaps the HHS people should take a page from that marketing handbook next time they roll out something new!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Within six months of purchase, most health wearables monitor the inside of a bedside table drawer.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Within six months of purchase, most health wearables monitor the inside of a bedside table drawer.", "title": "Apple Watch, Jeb Bush and the best health wearable ever", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/joeboxer.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-05T01:03:18-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/05/health-wearable-apple-watch/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/joeboxer.jpg", "description": "Within six months of purchase, most health wearables monitor the inside of a bedside table drawer.", "card": "summary", "title": "Apple Watch, Jeb Bush and the best health wearable ever - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Apple, Apple Watch, Health Wearables, OB, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Convergence", "tag": "OB", "published_time": "2015-05-19T08:30:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-05T01:03:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3206\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to guide our own health care decisions in a way that will make us healthy.\nCertainly the Apple Watch and others have recognized the importance of the fashion aspect of something that is strapped to you at all times.\nHopefully that will begin to evolve as the more serious applications take hold, on the Apple Watch or elsewhere.\nHis specific quote was:\u201cOn this device in five years will be applications that will allow me to manage my health care in ways that five years ago were not even possible.\nAnd for all the good that the Apple Watch and other wearables may, theoretically, achieve, you have to have patients who want to engage in order for change to happen."}
