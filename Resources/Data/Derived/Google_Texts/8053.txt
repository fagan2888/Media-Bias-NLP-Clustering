The USDA is poised to fine schools that disobey the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which affects student lunch programs and is the brainchild of first lady Michelle Obama.

The Washington Free Beacon reports the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service is clamping down on schools that have "egregious or persistent disregard" for government-imposed salt and calorie limits, prohibited white grains and the use of only milk that is nonfat or 1 percent fat. the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service is clamping down on schools that have "egregious or persistent disregard" for government-imposed salt and calorie limits, prohibited white grains and the use of only milk that is nonfat or 1 percent fat.

According to the Beacon, the fines would only apply to schools, school food authorities, and state agencies that have engaged in "severe mismanagement" or repeatedly flaunted the nutrition rules.

The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act was enacted in 2010 and set new nutrition standards for schools. Mrs. Obama championed the program as a way to fight childhood obesity.
