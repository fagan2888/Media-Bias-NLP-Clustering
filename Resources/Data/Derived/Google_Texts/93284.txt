Congressional staffers favor Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, for president but are disappointed in Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican and Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, according to the Washingtonian magazine’s latest “Best and Worst of Congress” list, published Thursday.

Staffers surveyed for the list rated Mr. Paul the biggest rising star on Capitol Hill and one of the best public speakers, along with Mr. Rubio.

But Mr. Cruz seems to have fallen out of favor on the hill, ranking as the No. 1 biggest disappointment, with Mr. Rubio coming in second.

Mr. Cruz was also named the biggest “showhorse,” second-most clueless senator and second-most partisan behind Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat.

Staffers also seem to be ready for a change in Senate leadership, listing Mr. Reid as the meanest senator and the worst orator. But House Speaker John Boehner, Ohio Republican, was named funniest and one of the hardest-working congressmen.

Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, garnered high marks for his work ethic both in and out of office as the No. 1 “biggest workhorse,” and one of the top “gym rats” in the House. Mr. Ryan was also named one of the most likely congressman to become the next speaker of the House.

Staffers were also asked to name the most attractive male and female politicians, and chose Sen. Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire Republican, over Kirsten Gillibrand, New York Democrat, among Senate women. In fact, Republicans took the top spot in all four categories, with Rep. Kristi Noem topping House women, Sen. John Thune triumphing among Senate men, and Rep. Aaron Schock rated the hottest House male.
