Gary Peters, D-Mich., knows all about this dilemma. The right\u2019s derp Howitzer spray-fired at Peters all weekend, because his lawyers sent threatening letters to station managers in Michigan who are running an Americans for Prosperity ad featuring Julie Boonstra, whose Obamacare \u201chorror story\u201d isn\u2019t supported by the facts.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Representative Peters would sic his legal team on a Michigan mother battling cancer to muzzle her tells you everything you need to know about his record of putting politics over people,\u201d reads a statement from AFP\u2019s Michigan state directer Scott Hagerstrom. \u201cJulie Boonstra was brave enough to tell her story about how Obamacare is making her life worse and instead of offering compassion and solutions, Rep. Peters responded with intimidation \u2026 This attack on her credibility is disgusting, unwarranted, and inexcusable. Congressman Peters and his indecent campaign team should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nPeters is running for retiring Sen. Carl Levin\u2019s Senate seat, so it\u2019s of considerable interest to him not to create the perception that he\u2019s bullying an innocent cancer patient. And of course he\u2019s not. But the facts at the center of the controversy over Boonstra\u2019s ad suggest a better way to expose the scam AFP is perpetrating.\n\nBoonstra clearly doesn\u2019t like the law. And she doesn\u2019t have to like the law. But any other woman suffering with the exact same medical condition, and experiencing the exact same interactions with Obamacare \u2014 but minus a motivated hatred of the law \u2014 would be ecstatic about the savings and the new protections the law provides, and we would all be very happy for her.\n\nSo think about that hypothetical woman, and then think about AFP\u2019s ultimate goal, which is the complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, this woman is saving about $6,350 this year on premiums, which coincidentally is the most an insurance company can require an individual beneficiary to pay annually in out-of-pocket expenses. In other words, the worst-case financial outcome for her is a total wash. Almost to the dollar. But that doesn\u2019t account for everything else the law has put in place to protect her from past insurance company practices, which will ultimately redound both to her personal and financial health. Her carrier can no longer rescind her plan under any circumstances. It can\u2019t invoke a lifetime cap on outlays, which would easily leave a leukemia patient effectively uninsured. And it can\u2019t hike her premiums on the basis of her health status, because that kind of discrimination is now illegal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP-aligned groups are now exploiting innocent people who need Obamacare -- by having them campaign for its demise", "title": "The right\u2019s sociopathic new scam: Using Americans to harm their own health plans", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "GOP-aligned groups are now exploiting innocent people who need Obamacare -- by having them campaign for its demise", "title": "The right\u2019s sociopathic new scam: Using Americans to harm their own health plans", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/24/the_rights_sociopathic_new_scam_encouraging_americans_to_oppose_their_health_benefits/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/AP9471103817551-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP-aligned groups are now exploiting innocent people who need Obamacare -- by having them campaign for its demise", "title": "The right\u2019s sociopathic new scam: Using Americans to harm their own health plans", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/AP9471103817551-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Americans for Prosperity, Barack Obama, Editor's Picks, Gary Peters, GOP, healthcare, Obamacare, Pre-existing conditions, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So think about that hypothetical woman, and then think about AFP\u2019s ultimate goal, which is the complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd it can\u2019t hike her premiums on the basis of her health status, because that kind of discrimination is now illegal.\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, this woman is saving about $6,350 this year on premiums, which coincidentally is the most an insurance company can require an individual beneficiary to pay annually in out-of-pocket expenses.\nBut the facts at the center of the controversy over Boonstra\u2019s ad suggest a better way to expose the scam AFP is perpetrating.\nIt can\u2019t invoke a lifetime cap on outlays, which would easily leave a leukemia patient effectively uninsured."}
