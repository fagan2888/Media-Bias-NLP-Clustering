Subtitled \u201cWhat I Saw at Indie Rock\u2019s Failed Revolution,\u201d the book tells how a handful of outcasts came together to form an indie subculture all over America, spending time on rainy campuses (the group began at Oberlin), in quirky record stores, beer-stained clubs and foul-smelling vans. Fine offers both a close-up of being in a band on the road \u2013 there is a slow-motion car crash scene nearly as lyrical as something by Denis Johnson \u2013 as well as a big picture look at the \u201880s and the tribe that clustered around post-hardcore and alternative rock.\n\nWritten with both anthropological detachment and deep romanticism about the making of music, Fine\u2019s book belongs on the shelf alongside Michael Azerrad\u2019s \u201cOur Band Could Be Your Life.\u201d\n\nWe spoke to Fine in New York, where he is executive editor of Inc. Magazine.\n\nThere have been a number of books about indie over the last few years. What part of the story did you think hadn\u2019t been told?\n\nOne thing I was interested in \u2013 and continue to be interested in \u2013 is the culture. But it\u2019s not about Nirvana, Fugazi, Mudhoney \u2013 it\u2019s about, what\u2019s it like for a band on the road, every night, getting paid $200, $250 a night, that\u2019s pretty out there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d consider Fugazi mainstream, but they sold a lot of records. I wanted to tell the stories of the bands that were a level below that, like on a good night they pack the equivalent of the old 930 Club, or maybe not even that.\n\nSo the interesting thing for me is the culture, that moment in time. Clearly, I have a lot of complicated feelings about it. But I don\u2019t have any question that this was incredibly significant, culturally: It basically killed off hair metal, so I\u2019ll love it forever for that. And I tried to be provocative with the title, but in 1980 there was basically nothing, and by the end of the decade there was something. And there\u2019s something still. And that\u2019s not nothing, man. It takes a lot to build a circuit.\n\nWhat was the indie rock tribe, which you joined when you were in college in the mid-\u201980s? What did these people have in common \u2013 the bands, the audiences, the record-store clerks, the \u2018zine writers, the college-radio folk\u2026 What brought them together?\n\nPretty much it was smart misfits. Generally, the smart misfit outcasts in all their hometowns\u2026 Disaffected, and, I don\u2019t mean this in any grand way, but carrying some kind of trauma \u2014 a chip on their shoulders or a sense of being wounded. You could see both playing out in various ways in this music. I don\u2019t mean to get too meta on you, but Michael Azzerad quotes Bob Mould saying, \u201cI was at Macalester College, talking to guys who were wearing suits and ties to class every day and telling me how great Reagan was, and I thought, \u2018This is fucked.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere was a general sense of dissatisfaction. More often than not it was intellectual, though not always. More often than not it was collegial, though not always. More often than not it was left-leaning, though if you scratched the surface, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt was varying strains of this stuff going around, and there weren\u2019t a lot of outlets. I graduated college in 1989 \u2013 the post-Reagan economic doldrums. The idea that you could make a lot of money in a vaguely cool way was nonexistent. There just weren\u2019t a lot of jobs out there. I went to Oberlin, where nobody gave a single thought to a career \u2013 you got out and temped and tried to figure it out.\n\nFor me this was the arena where I grew up: Slowly, imperfectly, with a fair amount of collateral damage. This is my hometown, and the hometown of a lot of other people.\n\nBy the time Bitch Magnet came along \u2013 in 1986 \u2013 we\u2019d seen a few years of alt-rock, college-radio infrastructure building, and the development of a club circuit. But \u201cNevermind\u201d hadn\u2019t happened yet; indie rock hadn\u2019t broken through. What was that period like?\n\nMy generation of bands was really fortunate \u2013 we were coming into it just after the really difficult battles had been fought. Bands like Black Flag, Dead Kennedys and the Ramones had carved out the circuit and they toured, along with bands like Mission of Burma, at a time when people would get violently upset at weird music. They didn\u2019t know how to react.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Your Band Sucks\" by Bitch Magnet's Jon Fine looks at the pleasures and perils of \"indie rock's failed revolution\"", "title": "\u201cIt\u2019s not about Nirvana\u201d: The real story of the music uprising which upended corporate rock and killed hair metal", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Your Band Sucks\" by Bitch Magnet's Jon Fine looks at the pleasures and perils of \"indie rock's failed revolution\"", "title": "\u201cIt\u2019s not about Nirvana\u201d: The real story of the music uprising which upended corporate rock and killed hair metal", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/your_band_sucks_author_jon_fine_indie_killed_off_hair_metal/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/jon_fine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Your Band Sucks\" by Bitch Magnet's Jon Fine looks at the pleasures and perils of \"indie rock's failed revolution\"", "title": "\u201cIt\u2019s not about Nirvana\u201d: The real story of the music uprising which upended corporate rock and killed hair metal", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/jon_fine.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Timberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1980s, bitch magnet, Books, Hair metal, indie-rock, jon fine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c6a\"", "article_summary": "What was the indie rock tribe, which you joined when you were in college in the mid-\u201980s?\nBut \u201cNevermind\u201d hadn\u2019t happened yet; indie rock hadn\u2019t broken through.\nBut I don\u2019t have any question that this was incredibly significant, culturally: It basically killed off hair metal, so I\u2019ll love it forever for that.\nMy generation of bands was really fortunate \u2013 we were coming into it just after the really difficult battles had been fought.\nTopics: 1980s, bitch magnet, Books, Hair metal, indie-rock, jon fine, Entertainment NewsThe story of the indie rock era has rarely been told as well as it has in \u201cYour Band Sucks,\u201d the new chronicle by Bitch Magnet guitarist Jon Fine."}
