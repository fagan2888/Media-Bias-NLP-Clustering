Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe sense that Washington is hopelessly gridlocked has become a source of national despair.\n\nApproval ratings for both Obama and Congress continue to tumble. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday found that only 22 percent of voters are inclined to give their own representatives another term \u2014 a record low for that poll.\n\nDespite this disapproval, though, a stalemate might not be all bad.\n\nIt's not just Congress that's split \u2014 the public is divided on nearly every issue, too. So, if Washington were, in fact, able to act, it's possible Americans might be even angrier than they are now.\n\n\"If the federal government were passing a constitutional amendment restricting abortion, or if they were passing a national gay marriage act, you'd actually find much more unhappiness,\" says Lara Brown, a political scientist at George Washington University.\n\nIs Gridlock Good?\n\nFailure to deal with the nation's serious problems is a righteous source of frustration. But \u2014 absent majority support in the country for nearly any policy approach \u2014 voters might be even more unhappy if Congress were to act in any robust way, Stanford University political scientist Morris Fiorina suggested recently on the Washington Post's popular Monkey Cage blog.\n\nGridlock may be maddening, in other words, but the alternatives might be worse.\n\n\"Gridlock is good,\" says William Connelly, a political scientist at Washington and Lee University. \"I'm not the first person to say it.\"\n\nNeither party is happy when the other attempts to ram through one-sided legislation. Democrats didn't like it in 2005 when President George W. Bush wanted to privatize parts of Social Security, and Republicans have never stopped complaining that Democrats were able to take advantage of their congressional majorities in 2010 to push through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans may have been playing politics by withholding any support for Obamacare, but the health care law certainly hasn't gained popularity since its passage.\n\n\"Passing it without any Republican support was problematic, at best, and paved the way for the contentiousness and doggedness of Republicans now in aiming to repeal and replace it,\" Connelly says. \"The system is not meant to be simple majority rule, where a fleeting majority, as measured by public opinion polls, dictates legislation.\"\n\nThe Need For Consensus\n\nBy contrast, most major pieces of legislation in the 20th century \u2014 the creation of Social Security back in the 1930s and the interstate highway system in the 1950s, or the civil rights laws of the 1960s \u2014 received bipartisan congressional support in the end, reflecting consensus in the country. In that regard, Obamacare was a departure.\n\nThere's no such consensus now on changes to tax policy or immigration law or education. If Congress were to push through major legislation on a regular basis, it would invite a backlash, much as Obamacare did, suggests Brown, the George Washington political scientist.\n\nAmericans might hate inactivity, but they'd like finished products even less, according to Brown. That may be one reason why power has kept seesawing in elections over the past decade, as the two parties have taken turns winning and then overreaching.\n\n\"People are polarized, it's so clear on just about every issue,\" she says. \"It is just a fact that we don't have the public consensus that once existed.\"\n\nNo Chance For Compromise\n\nDemocrats can make a fair case that Republicans had no interest in negotiating when it came to the health care law \u2014 or just about anything else that's come up during Obama's time in office.\n\nWhen power is divided, there's no alternative to negotiation and compromise, says Lee Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat who served in the House from 1965 to 1999. That's the way the American system of government was set up.\n\nBut today's politicians often seem more interested in scoring points and waiting for the next election than coming up with a deal.\n\nCongress passed hardly any laws in 2013. This year threatens to be even less productive.\n\n\"The premise when I was there, and for 200 years in the Congress, was that we have to reach an agreement,\" Hamilton says. \"Today, I'm not sure that premise exists.\"", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "With Congress unable to pass much of anything, voters want to send most of Washington packing.
