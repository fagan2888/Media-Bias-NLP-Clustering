The third-year Rockies\u2019 manager continues to see promise in their potential. Injuries, he believes, scuttled the team\u2019s chances last year.\n\nAll his praise, though, was lip service until the winter months.\n\nThere was no indication more clear that the Rockies believe in their roster than a look at their offseason moves. Or, rather, the lack of them. The Rockies return a roster largely unchanged from the team that went 67-95.\n\n\u201cWith position players, we feel like we\u2019re as talented as anybody,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re talented enough to compete in this division.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies have one of the best lineups in baseball, led by Troy Tulowitzki, Carlos Gonzalez and Justin Morneau. They have two Gold Glove infielders, third baseman Nolan Arenado and second baseman DJ LeMahieu. They have a potential all-star outfielder in slugger Corey Dickerson.\n\nIf only they can put together a pitching staff. Their starting rotation was one of the worst in baseball last season, made worse by a ragged bullpen and a slew of injuries. The Rockies started 15 pitchers in 2014.\n\n\u201cAnd we have some young pitchers starting to establish themselves and some young pitchers on the cusp of being here and being impactful,\u2019 \u201d Weiss said. \u201cThose guys have to grow up quick.\u201d\n\nMuch of the offseason work done by new general manager Jeff Bridich, with input from Weiss, was aimed at bolstering the Rockies\u2019 depth in case injuries batter the team once again.\n\nRockies new GM Jeff Bridich joined Woody Paige and Les Shapiro, on The Sports Show.\n\nWATCH: Rockies GM Jeff Bridich on team\u2019s offseason decision-making process\n\nWATCH: What\u2019s the difference between Jeff Bridich and Dan O\u2019Dowd?\n\nWATCH: Jeff Bridich on what he believes the Colorado Rockies need to change\n\nWATCH: What is Jeff Bridich\u2019s goal for the Colorado Rockies?\n\nWATCH: Will there be a 100-pitch count for the Colorado Rockies this year?\n\nHere is a position-by-position look at the Rockies\u2019 roster heading into spring training\n\nFirst base\n\nWhen Justin Morneau held on to win the National League batting title, outlasting Pittsburgh\u2019s Josh Harrison over the final weekend, a predictable storm of criticism followed. Morneau\u2019s a Coors Field product, they said.\n\nBut Morneau has an easy retort. His league-leading .319 batting average was accomplished as much away from Denver as it was at Coors. His home-road splits, .327/.309, were by far the best on the Rockies.\n\n.363 vs. .364: Morneau actually had a higher on-base percentage on the road than at home. He walked 21 times on the road, just 13 at home.\n\nSecond base\n\nDJ LeMahieu doesn\u2019t look like a second baseman. His 6-foot-4 frame is more suited for a first baseman, or a small forward. But his size \u2014 and a corresponding range \u2014 boosted him toward a Gold Glove last year.\n\nLeMahieu, ranked by defensive wins above replacement, was the seventh-best defensive player in the NL, regardless of position. It\u2019s one reason why he earned his first Gold Glove award. The Rockies can live with his .267 batting average, which tied for last among regular Rockies starters, due to his outstanding glove work.\n\n.991: LeMahieu\u2019s fielding percentage actually dipped two points from 2013. But he saw significantly more action. He turned 676 chances (up from 442) into nearly double the number of double-plays (99, up from 57).\n\nShortstop\n\nTroy Tulowitzki was the second-best player in baseball last season, until he was hurt. He was playing at a Mike Trout-level for the first third of the season. And, not coincidentally, the Rockies were tied for first place a month into the season.\n\nBut Tulowitzki finished the season with just 91 games played after a hip injury led to surgery. Still, his 5.1 WAR last season, even over just half a season, ranked as the 22nd best in baseball. He was playing that well.\n\nIf he reaches that level again, the Rockies have a chance to contend. But if he\u2019s playing that well, and the Rockies start sliding, get ready for another avalanche of New York-based trade rumors.\n\n1.035: Tulowitzki\u2019s on-base plus slugging percentage. It was the Rockies\u2019 first four-digit OPS mark since Matt Holliday was at 1.012 in 2007.\n\nThird base\n\nNolan Arenado, depending on your perspective, was the Rockies\u2019 second-best player in 2014. His 4.1 WAR trailed only Tulowitzki. He won a second Gold Glove award in his second big-league season.\n\nThe next step for Arenado is joining the NL elite. For Arenado to sidle up next to Washington\u2019s Anthony Rendon, Milwaukee\u2019s Aramis Ramirez, Pittsburgh\u2019s Josh Harrison and Cincinnati\u2019s Todd Frazier, he needs to get on base more. Arenado\u2019s .500 slugging percentage (behind 18 homers) ranked third among Rockies starters. But his .328 on-base percentage was sixth. He must become more patient at the plate.\n\n.828: Arenado\u2019s OPS last season, off a .287 average, .328 OBP, .500 slugging percentage, was up more than 100 points from his rookie season. And he made significant increases across the board, against left-handers and right-handers, at home and on the road.\n\nCatcher\n\nIn early January the Rockies signed veteran catcher Nick Hundley to a two-year, $6 million deal.\n\nThat means the Rockies have three catchers competing for two spots, with Wilin Rosario and Michael McKenry the backups. Or, perhaps the Rockies have two catchers and a utility infielder in Rosario who can sub in for spot duty behind the dish. Or maybe McKenry or Rosario won\u2019t make it out of spring and will be traded.\n\nWhatever the outcome, the position is unsettled. Rosario will continue working as a back-up first baseman during spring, while also keeping his catcher\u2019s gear at the ready.\n\n3.34: The Orioles\u2019 team ERA in the 50 games Hundley caught for them last season was 10 points lower than their season ERA. He also helped guide Baltimore pitchers to a 2.64 strikeout-to-walk ratio, compared to a 2.49 mark overall.\n\nOutfield\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 crowded outfield last season \u2014 they had six at the position, when all were healthy \u2014 loosened when Michael Cuddyer signed with the Mets during the off-season.\n\nThe Rockies will start spring with a penciled-in outfield of Corey Dickerson in left field, Charlie Blackmon in center and Carlos Gonzalez in right. It\u2019s a formidable trio \u2014 Gonzalez and Blackmon have all-star years on their resumes and Dickerson would have been among the NL batting title contenders with a few more plate appearances last year.\n\nSpeedy Drew Stubbs will be the backup in center field and Brandon Barnes can spell all three spots. The Rockies, playing in the biggest land mass in the major leagues, have a competent and settled crew tending the outfield.\n\n24: Dickerson\u2019s home run total last season, over just 131 games, led all Rockies. He\u2019s a new-age Dante Bichette, a budding Blake Street Bomber. Any defensive liability he carries in left likely is overcome by an ability to hit to all fields.\n\nStarting rotation\n\nJhoulys Chacin\u2019s name should be whispered at spring training. When he injured his shoulder early in spring last season, it foreshadowed a spiral of injuries suffered by the Rockies pitching staff.\n\nIf Chacin can return to form \u2014 he went 14-10 with a 3.47 over 197-plus innings in 2013 \u2014 the Rockies will have the one-two punch they lacked last year. Jorge De La Rosa is the staff. If Chacin rebounds, it would also help take a lot of pressure off second-year lefty Tyler Matzek and Jordan Lyles, who broke his hand last year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing great,\u201d Walt Weiss said of Chacin. \u201cHe\u2019s been throwing and working out really hard. He\u2019s had a really good offseason.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies go into spring training with better pitching depth than they had a year ago. Newly-acquired David Hale might fight into the rotation and Eddie Butler and Jon Gray are close to becoming big-league regulars.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\nBut for now, a rotation of De La Rosa, Chacin, Matzek, Lyles and Kyle Kendrick looks likely. Barring injuries, of course.\n\n5.40: Chacin\u2019s ERA in 11 games before he was shut down in June.\n\nBullpen\n\nThe only question that won\u2019t be asked of the Rockies\u2019 bullpen in Arizona is: who\u2019s the closer? That job, again, will fall to LaTroy Hawkins, the 42-year-old veteran. He\u2019s in the final year of his career after announcing in December he\u2019ll retire after the 2015 season.\n\nThe bullpen in front of Hawkins, though, is a series of questions. Can Rex Brothers rebound from a disastrous 2014 (5.59 ERA) that looked a lot like a case of the yips? Is Boone Logan healthy after suffering through elbow issues? Can Tommy Kahnle, a rookie bright spot last year, step into more responsibility? Does Adam Ottavino and his put-away slider have the makings of a future closer? Can Jairo Diaz, acquired by trade from the Angels, actually through 100 mph?\n\nWhatever the questions, the answers need to be an improvement. The Rockies\u2019 bullpen had an NL-worst 4.79 ERA last year. As Colorado\u2019s starters fell to injuries, the relief corps was leaned on. They were overworked and punched around the yard. It was a vicious circle.\n\n62: Home runs allowed by Rockies relievers last year, the most in the majors.\n\nBench\n\nWhile the Rockies kept most of their regular roster in place, they will enter this season with a very different bench. Where Colorado was young and inexperienced a year ago, they are settled with veterans.\n\nDaniel Descalso, signed as a free agent away from St. Louis, can sub in at any infield spot. He\u2019s a steady insurance policy in case Tulowitzki or Arenado are injured again.\n\nStubbs will again see near-regular time rotating in the outfield along with Barnes. And Charlie Culberson will battle with Rafael Ynoa and Cristhian Adames, two late-season call-ups, for a backup spot.\n\n$3.6 million: Descalso\u2019s two-year contract is a significant investment for a utility infielder. But he can play any position on the field, including catcher and outfielder.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "A position-by-position breakdown of the 2015 Colorado Rockies", "title": "A position-by-position breakdown of the 2015 Colorado Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/13/a-position-by-position-breakdown-of-the-2015-colorado-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150213_082958_troy-tulowitzki-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150213_082958_troy-tulowitzki-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-13T20:08:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T01:10:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bd3\"", "article_summary": "WATCH: Jeff Bridich on what he believes the Colorado Rockies need to changeWATCH: What is Jeff Bridich\u2019s goal for the Colorado Rockies?\nWATCH: Rockies GM Jeff Bridich on team\u2019s offseason decision-making processWATCH: What\u2019s the difference between Jeff Bridich and Dan O\u2019Dowd?\nWalt Weiss said \u2014 over and over, through the tumult of a summer gone south \u2014 that he liked his Rockies team.\nWhen he injured his shoulder early in spring last season, it foreshadowed a spiral of injuries suffered by the Rockies pitching staff.\nThe Rockies can live with his .267 batting average, which tied for last among regular Rockies starters, due to his outstanding glove work."}
