The pontiff will make his first visit to the US in September 2015 at the World Meeting of Families, part of the lengthy conversation about the pastoral direction of the Catholic Church that officially began with the Extraordinary Synod last month. Rome Reports has the video of the announcement, thankfully with subtitles for the Italian-challenged, which still includes me:\n\nWhen I was in Rome last month, this was already assumed to be on the calendar. Vatican officials had been talking about it openly for months, and reporters there were planning around it. The World Meeting of Families is the largest Catholic event for family life and only meets every three years, plus the connection to the synod topic would have been irresistible.\n\nNBC reports that Philadelphia is pretty excited by the confirmation:\n\n\u201cI am overjoyed by Pope Francis\u2019 announcement that he will join with us for the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia next year,\u201d said [Philadelphia Archbishop Charles] Chaput. \u201cA hallmark of his papacy has been a keen focus on the many challenges that families face today globally. His charisma, presence and voice will electrify the gathering.\u201d It will be the Pope\u2019s first visit to the United States since he was elected to lead the Catholic church in March 2013. The last time a pope visited Philadelphia was in October 1979 when John Paul II to deliver mass along the Parkway. The World Meeting of Families will be held from Sept. 22 to Sept. 27 in 2015 in Philadelphia. Held every three years, the World Meeting of Families is a celebration of families, love and life. It\u2019s also the world\u2019s largest Catholic gathering of families. Archdiocese spokeswoman Donna Farrell said that Francis is expected to arrive Sept. 25. Besides the Parkway mass, the Pontiff is also expected to attend the intercultural Festival of Families on Sept. 26, according to the archdiocese. The Vatican will reveal detailed plans in spring or summer of 2015.\n\nIt will be an exciting event, but not likely one that will tip much of the hand on the direction of the Catholic Church in its review of pastoral policies. That will wait for the ordinary Synod that will take place the month after Francis\u2019 first visit to the US. The timing for the conference in Philadelphia will stoke interest in the meeting at the Vatican that will complete the process begun last month there, but that process will be driven \u2014 at least to start \u2014 by the bishops. The Extraordinary Synod tasked them with using the final relatio as a springboard for research and introspection within the dioceses, and with gathering a best-practices list (as well as what\u2019s not working) in order for the entire episcopate to make decisions on the improvements needed in Catholic practice as it relates to family. If the Pope has a direction in mind (a point of endless speculation at the Vatican as well as everywhere else), it won\u2019t become obvious until October.\n\nOne point to watch on the Pope\u2019s trip will be whether he gets to Washington or not. John Boehner formally invited Pope Francis to address a joint session of Congress during that time, and as a visiting head of state, Barack Obama will almost certainly ask Francis to visit the White House as well. Obama needs to burnish his image these days \u2014 a lot, especially with Catholics, who flipped to the GOP this past election by almost double digits (54/45). There wouldn\u2019t be any particular reason for Francis to refuse either request, but his choice of topic and emphasis in either or both venues might be very interesting indeed.\n\nMeanwhile, Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley made waves today in an interview with CBS News about Catholic teaching on vocations and ordination. If he was starting his own religion, O\u2019Malley tells Norah O\u2019Donnell, he\u2019d be happy to have women as priests. Since O\u2019Malley serves the church that Jesus founded, though, it\u2019s not going to happen:\n\nIn an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on CBS that producers said took more than a year for them to persuade him to do, O\u2019Malley seemed troubled by reporter Norah O\u2019Donnell\u2019s question as to whether the exclusion of women from the Church hierarchy was \u201cimmoral.\u201d O\u2019Malley paused, then said, \u201cChrist would never ask us to do something immoral. It\u2019s a matter of vocation and what God has given to us.\u201d \u201cNot everyone needs to be ordained to have an important role in the life of the Church,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen run Catholic charities, Catholic schools \u2026. They have other very important roles. A priest can\u2019t be a mother. The tradition in the Church is that we ordain men. \u201cIf I were founding a church, I\u2019d love to have women priests,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cBut Christ founded it, and what he has given us is something different.\u201d\n\nWith everything else happening in the church \u2014 the interview was actually about the controversy surrounding Bishop Finn \u2014 one has to wonder why O\u2019Donnell brought up this topic with O\u2019Malley. Did she expect O\u2019Malley to have anything different to say than the rest of the Catholic Church on this topic? Wasn\u2019t there more pressing and interesting topics for O\u2019Malley, especially given the length of time it took CBS to get him to give the interview in the first place, than another rehashing of ordination doctrine?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Family business.", "title": "Video: Pope Francis confirms September 2015 visit to US", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/11/17/video-pope-francis-confirms-september-2015-visit-to-us/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wCkyVd2OzKI/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/wCkyVd2OzKI/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Catholic Church, Philadelphia, Pope Francis, Sean O'Malley, synod,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-17T18:31:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-17T23:07:52+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea11\"", "article_summary": "Video: Pope Francis confirms September 2015 visit to USposted at 1:31 pm on November 17, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyAlthough it had been well known for months, Pope Francis made his travel plans official this morning.\nThe World Meeting of Families will be held from Sept. 22 to Sept. 27 in 2015 in Philadelphia.\nHeld every three years, the World Meeting of Families is a celebration of families, love and life.\nDid she expect O\u2019Malley to have anything different to say than the rest of the Catholic Church on this topic?\nJohn Boehner formally invited Pope Francis to address a joint session of Congress during that time, and as a visiting head of state, Barack Obama will almost certainly ask Francis to visit the White House as well."}
