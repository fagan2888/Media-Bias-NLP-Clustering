Elected with 39.7 percent of the vote, Lincoln told a big lie in his inaugural address of 1861.\n\n\u201cI have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists,\u201d he said, reaching out to the breakaway South. \u201cI believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\u201d\n\nHe was saying to a Confederacy that would enshrine owning another human being in its new constitution: If you like the slaves you\u2019ve got now, you can keep them. It was a lie in the sense that Lincoln made a promise, changed by circumstances, that he broke less than two years later -- and probably never meant to keep.\n\nThe comparisons of President Obama to Lincoln fade with every day of the shrinking modern presidency. As for the broken-promise scale: Lincoln said an entire section of the country could continue to enslave more than one in three of its people. Obama wrongly assured about five million people that they could keep their bare-bones health plans if they liked them (later amended when it turned not to be true).\n\nAs inapt as those comparisons are, what is distressingly similar today is how the South is once again committed to taking a backward path. By refusing to expand health care for the working poor through Medicaid, which is paid for by the federal government under Obamacare, most of the old Confederacy is committed to keeping millions of its own fellow citizens in poverty and poor health. They are dooming themselves, further, as the Left-Behind States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd they are doing it out of spite. Elsewhere, the expansion of Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, has been one of the few success stories of Obamacare. It may be too complicated for the one-dimensional Beltway press. Either that, or it doesn\u2019t fit the narrative of failure.\n\nBut in the states that have embraced a program that reaches out to low-wage workers, almost 500,000 people have signed up for health care in less than two months time. This is good for business, good for state taxpayers (because the federal government is subsidizing the expansion) and can do much to lessen the collateral damages of poverty, from crime to poor diets. In Kentucky, which has bravely tried to buck the retrograde tide, Medicaid expansion is projected to create 17,000 jobs. In Washington, the state predicts 10,000 new jobs and savings of $300 million in the first 18 months of expansion.\n\nBeyond Medicaid, the states that have diligently tried to make the private health care exchanges work are putting their regions on a path that will make them far more livable, easing the burden of crippling, uninsured medical bills -- the leading cause of personal bankruptcy.\n\nAnd those states aren\u2019t going to turn back the clock and revert to the bad old days, no matter how Republicans try to kill health care reform in the wake of the federal rollout. Many are refusing to accept Obama\u2019s \u201cfix\u201d of allowing people to keep sketchy health care policies. If they follow the pattern of Massachusetts -- where a mere 123 people enrolled in the first month of Romneycare, after which it gradually took off -- the progressive states could end up with more than 95 percent of their residents insured.\n\nWhat we could see, 10 years from now, is a Mason-Dixon line of health care. One side (with exceptions for conservative Midwest and mountain states) would be the insured North, a place where health care coverage was affordable and available to most people. On the other side would be the uninsured South, where health care for the poor would amount to treating charity cases in hospital emergency rooms.\n\nTexas, where one in four people have no health care and Gov. Rick Perry proudly resists extending the Medicaid helping hand to the working poor, would be the leading backwater in this Dixie of Despair. In the 11 states of the old Confederacy, only Arkansas and Tennessee are now open to Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe South, already the poorest region in the country, with all the attendant problems, would acquire another distinction -- a place where, if you were sick and earned just enough money that you didn\u2019t qualify for traditional Medicaid, you might face the current system\u2019s version of a death panel.\n\nThe only good news is that a handful of political leaders down South have grasped the utter stupidity of refusing to help their own people, or even giving the state exchanges a chance. In this month\u2019s recent special election for a congressional seat in a solidly Republican Louisiana district, a pragmatic businessman, Vance McAllister, beat a Tea Party candidate with the full Obama derangement syndrome. The winner said Obamacare was the law of the land and might as well be applied in Louisiana, the nation\u2019s third poorest state. (It didn\u2019t hurt that he had the backing of a \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star.)\n\nBut most of the South is defiant -- their own Lost Cause for the 21st century.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20131121194657, "twitter": {"description": "What we could see in 10 years is a Mason-Dixon line of health care, with the poor on one side treated as charity cases in hospital emergency rooms.", "title": "The South\u2019s New Lost Cause", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/opinion/egan-the-souths-new-lost-cause.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002565129"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/egan-circular/egan-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/opinion/egan-the-souths-new-lost-cause.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002565129", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/opinion/egan-the-souths-new-lost-cause.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 21, 2013", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Medicaid,Obama  Barack,Southern States (US),Health Insurance and Managed Care", "news_keywords": "Medicaid", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Timothy Egan", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/egan-circular/egan-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By TIMOTHY EGAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "What we could see in 10 years is a Mason-Dixon line of health care, with the poor on one side treated as charity cases in hospital emergency rooms.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/egan-circular/egan-circular-thumbStandard-v2.png", "description": "What we could see in 10 years is a Mason-Dixon line of health care, with the poor on one side treated as charity cases in hospital emergency rooms.", "CN": "timothy-egan", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 21, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/timothy_egan/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-01-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2013-11-21", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Southern States (US)", "slug": "22egan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160101195052, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/opinion/egan-the-souths-new-lost-cause.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/egan-circular/egan-circular-superJumbo-v2.png", "type": "article", "description": "What we could see in 10 years is a Mason-Dixon line of health care, with the poor on one side treated as charity cases in hospital emergency rooms.", "title": "The South\u2019s New Lost Cause"}, "pdate": 20131121, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/timothy-egan", "tagline": "The environment, the American West and politics.", "uri": "/column/timothy-egan", "display-name": "Timothy Egan", "identifier": "timothy-egan", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000002565129, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The South\u2019s New Lost Cause", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9109\"", "article_summary": "But most of the South is defiant -- their own Lost Cause for the 21st century.\nWhat we could see, 10 years from now, is a Mason-Dixon line of health care.\nTexas, where one in four people have no health care and Gov.\nElsewhere, the expansion of Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, has been one of the few success stories of Obamacare.\nMany are refusing to accept Obama\u2019s \u201cfix\u201d of allowing people to keep sketchy health care policies."}
