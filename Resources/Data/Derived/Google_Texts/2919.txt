Three young Oklahoma girls are celebrating two years of being cancer free. They're doing so in the same way that first got them worldwide attention.

We first introduced you to go Riley, Rheann, and Ainsley back in 2014. Their battle with cancer gained international attention after a photo, taken by local photographer Lora Scantling, went viral.

Two years later, the girls reunited to take this new picture. Riley, on the left, continues to get better and now enjoys her days in Pre-K, gymnastics, dance, and T-Ball.

In the middle is Rheann. Rounds of radiation and chemo caused her to permanently lose her hair, but not her spirit. The active 8-year-old enjoys riding her bike and hanging out with friends.

Ainsley, on the right, undergoes testing each month but remains in remission and is enjoying springtime.

The girls' photographer hopes the photos will continue to raise awareness for childhood cancer.
