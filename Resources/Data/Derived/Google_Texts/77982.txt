Saturday, thousands of eager and excited children lined up at the Panama City mall to see Santa.

"You're never too old for Santa, right?" said Erin Wommack, the Marketing Director of the Panama City Mall.

That's right, and hundreds of local residents agree.

"To see Santa. We came here to see Santa," said Lidia Osovchi.

"We could not get the sleigh and the reindeer here in time," said Ron Mosley, the Program Director for Bay Medical Air Heart Program. "So the second choice was a helicopter."

Santa's entrance via the Bay Medical Sacred Heart Chopper was a way for the holiday season to take early flight.

"I feel Santa is a vital vital organ to Christmas." said Wommack. "I feel its a very big deal to have a big grand entrance for Santa, all the kids expect it and they're so excited."

The St. Andrews Ukulele Orchestra provided memorable holiday music.

The events purpose wasn't just promotion, but tradition.

"I would love for them to grow up saying, hey I remember Santa flying in by a helicopter and landing at the Panama City Mall every year and I went to that every year growing up," said Wommack.

Some parents are providing that opportunity for their children.

"It's a tradition in our household," said mom, Sherry Peacock. "We also have an older daughter and we brought her ever since she was little, so it's a tradition to bring him."

Santa eventually made his way into the Panama City Mall where he will meet and greet the naughty and nice children of Bay County until Christmas.

Some wanted their pictures taken, while others had another agenda, to tell Santa what they would like to see under their Christmas tree.

Johnathan Phillips, a child who claims to be on Santa's "Nice List" said, "I want a remote control car, a remote control plane and a remote control truck."
