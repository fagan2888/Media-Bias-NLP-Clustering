A man from Cleveland County was arrested Thursday on complaints of possessing juvenile pornography.

In court documents, a detective with the Norman Police Department said 34-year-old Randall Lee Sherrill had approximately 50 images of child pornography on his cell phone.

The detective said the images showed girls, aging from infancy to about 10 years old, “performing sex acts on adult men and being penetrated vaginally.”

He said there were other images on the cell phone including adult pornography, bestiality, nudity and normal pictures of Sherrill and his ex-girlfriend.

The court document states the investigation began after police received a tip on June 12, 2014 from Sherrill’s girlfriend saying her boyfriend had a warrant for his arrest in Garvin County, and she had witnessed child pornography on his cell phone.

Sherrill was booked into the Cleveland County jail on a $250,000 bond.
