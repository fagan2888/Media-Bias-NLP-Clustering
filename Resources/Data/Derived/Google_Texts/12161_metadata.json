(Paul Vernon/Associated Press)\n\nAt the conclusion of Wednesday* night\u2019s town hall with Donald Trump on MSNBC, the featured guest made pains to assert that he\u2019d been through the wringer with \u201cMorning Joe\u201d duo Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work. I mean, I\u2019m here. I could be someplace else, to be honest with you. Okay, I\u2019m being grilled by the two of you; I could be someplace else.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrilled,\u201d here, means a few signs of skepticism from the hosts plus several reasonably demanding questions. Like: \u201cWill you make upholding the [Supreme Court\u2019s] Heller decision a litmus test in Supreme Court nominees?\u201d Like: \u201cWhat do you replace [Obamacare] with?\u201d The Republican front-runner also faced questioning about his claims about ringing early alarm bells over the Iraq War and about how he\u2019d manage the federal government\u2019s dispute with Apple over accessing the iPhone of a deceased terrorist.\n\nSkepticism, questions, civil debate, issues \u2014 it\u2019s all great. That long-standing road map, however, doesn\u2019t work well with Donald Trump. One reason is because he\u2019s fact-check-allergic, as he showed in the back-and-forth over Iraq, as he managed to repel yet another aggressive attempt to bust him out on his allegedly early Iraq War claims. Scarborough, just like colleague Chuck Todd on Sunday, noted that no one has been able to find evidence of Trump saying that the Iraq War was a bad idea before the March 2003 invasion.\n\nTrump filibustered the matter, saying, in part, \u201cI said the war is a disaster because you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East. I said it long before 2003 but I\u2019m not a politician,\u201d he argued, suggesting that his remarks weren\u2019t carefully recorded for history.\n\nSoon enough, some tough-talking anchor is going to have to corner Trump on this one and refuse to continue on to other topics until Trump names all the people he informed of his early Iraq-invasion opposition.\n\nThe other reason for the journalistic shortfall in the Scarborough-Brzezinski town hall is Trump\u2019s shameful record of racism, bigotry and rampant disrespect. The Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank summarized that record with this paragraph:\n\nSince then, Trump led the \u201cbirther\u201d movement challenging President Obama\u2019s standing as a natural-born American; used various vulgar expressions to refer to women; spoke of Mexico sending rapists and other criminals across the border; called for rounding up and deporting 11 million illegal immigrants; had high-profile spats with prominent Latino journalists and news outlets; mocked Asian accents; let stand a charge made in his presence that Obama is a Muslim and that Muslims are a \u201cproblem\u201d in America; embraced the notion of forcing Muslims to register in a database; falsely claimed thousands of Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks in New Jersey; tweeted bogus statistics asserting that most killings of whites are done by blacks; approved of the roughing up of a black demonstrator at one of his events; and publicly mocked the movements of New York Times (and former Washington Post) journalist Serge Kovaleski, who has a chronic condition limiting mobility.\n\nAny hour-long session with Donald Trump that doesn\u2019t ask him about those obscenities is a puff session. Allowing this fellow to pronounce on entitlement reform, strategies on the Islamic State, campaign tactics, Iraq, Jeb Bush, health-care reform, gun rights, Supreme Court nominations and other such topics without grinding through an extensive accounting of his racism and bigotry is an outrage only sightly less egregious than the candidate\u2019s own.\n\nYes, an audience member did ask Trump a question about civility: \u201cMy question is where do you think the line is between boldness and honesty, and disrespect and rudeness?\u201d Ever the talented debater, Trump deflected the inquiry into some vague talk about how he handles the outbursts of people at his rallies. Scarborough jumped in and wondered if he\u2019d have allies on Capitol Hill \u2014 again, showering legitimacy on the bigot seated in the middle of town hall.\n\n*Correction: This post originally said the town hall was Thursday night.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Having to answer questions about Social Security, Iraq and the economy is a great luxury for this fellow", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Having to answer questions about Social Security, Iraq and the economy is a great luxury for this fellow", "title": "In town hall, MSNBC and \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 hosts let Trump skate on bigotry, racism", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/02/17/in-town-hall-msnbc-and-morning-joe-hosts-let-trump-skate-on-bigotry-racism/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-10-13/AP/APTOPIX_GOP_2016_Trump-018d9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/02/17/in-town-hall-msnbc-and-morning-joe-hosts-let-trump-skate-on-bigotry-racism/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "msbnc, joe scarborough, mika brzezinski, town hall, racism, bigotry", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "msbnc, joe scarborough, mika brzezinski, town hall, racism, bigotry"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio, on Nov. 23.\nAny hour-long session with Donald Trump that doesn\u2019t ask him about those obscenities is a puff session.\nThat long-standing road map, however, doesn\u2019t work well with Donald Trump.\n(Paul Vernon/Associated Press)At the conclusion of Wednesday* night\u2019s town hall with Donald Trump on MSNBC, the featured guest made pains to assert that he\u2019d been through the wringer with \u201cMorning Joe\u201d duo Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.\nThe other reason for the journalistic shortfall in the Scarborough-Brzezinski town hall is Trump\u2019s shameful record of racism, bigotry and rampant disrespect."}
