State Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman has won the Democratic nomination for Congress in central New Jersey’s 12th District.

She defeated three rivals, including two other state legislators.

Watson Coleman is a heavy favorite to win in November over physician Alieta Eck, who was unopposed in Tuesday’s Republican primary.

Either way, the seat is almost certain to be filled by the first woman elected to represent New Jersey in Congress since 2000.

The seat opened up when Democrat Rep. Rush Holt decided he would step down at the end of the year.
