What\u2019s more, executives of CGI Federal personally gave more than twice as much to GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney than to President Obama. The contractor has also feasted on more than $2.4 billion worth of IT work dating back to the early Bush Administration.\n\nSo far, none of that has stopped the Republican National Congressional Committee from suggesting CGI netted hundreds of millions of dollars to create the dysfunctional website because of its ties to the White House\n\nOn Wednesday, the NRCC blasted the Republican National Committee\u2019s email list heralding a petition it had started that would urge Congress to investigate CGI-Obama ties. The email noted the importance of finding out, among other pressing questions, \u201cHow did [CGI] get contracted to do it?\u201d\n\nTwenty-eight hours later, the NRCC had its answer. \u201cNRCC Investigation of HealthCare.gov Finds Insider Deals Worth Over $400 Million,\u201d the next missive declared. The email itself doesn\u2019t reference any evidence of \u201cinsider deals,\u201d but the conservative Daily Caller has been building the case for weeks by noting the company had given donations to Obama and other Democrats and that its executives had visited the White House regularly.\n\nYet FEC records indicate executives for CGI gave $5,550 to GOP Romney and just $2,000 to Obama \u2014 not quite the behavior of a company indebted to the president for its contacting jackpots.\n\nAlso, the company\u2019s PAC, CGI-AMS, gave $48,000 to 28 GOP members of the House including $5,000 to Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), $6,000 to Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), and $2,000 each to Issa, Appropriations Committee Chair Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), now-Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Rep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.). Yoder, Wolf, and Cole also sit on the Appropriations Committee. Issa, Wolf and Cole also received contributions from the PAC during the 2010 cycle.\n\nAttempts to reach Issa, Yoder, and Wolf were unsuccessful Thursday.\n\nThe PAC gave $32,000 to 13 Democratic House members. They also gave $29,500 to Democrats running for Senate and $19,000 to Republican Senate candidates, reflecting a savvy record of giving more to members of the parties in power in each chamber.\n\nThe bipartisan giving makes sense given that CGI\u2019s first federal contract for IT work started in 2001 and, as a multibillion-dollar firm, has many lobbying interests in congress.\n\nIn fact, USASpending.gov, the federal site tracking government contracts, shows CGI has been the contractor of choice for a wide range of computer systems work throughout the Bush Administration, including hundreds of multimillion-dollar contracts for the Departments of Defense, Agriculture and Health and Human Services.\n\nThe contract under which CGI did the Obamacare website work, in fact, began in 2007 as a contract with HHS to handle Medicare and Medicaid IT.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 with all of its tentacles intersecting with those programs, there was almost no way CGI wasn\u2019t going to get to expand the scope of their existing contract, contracting experts say. Federal contracting rules are strict \u2014 so as to avoid political meddling \u2014 and they favor entrenched, large companies with track records. And if the case of CGI\u2019s shoddy work doesn\u2019t appear to represent partisan favoritism, it does appear to underscore broader problems with the system.\n\n\u201cThis was not a patronage deal,\u201d said George Washington Law School professor Joshua I. Schwartz, co-director of the university\u2019s Government Procurement Law Program. \u201cThe one thing members and the president do not seem to have is influence over who gets a particular contract. They just don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nClay Johnson, a former Presidential Innovation Fellow under Obama who has excoriated the White House and HHS for its handling of the site, nonetheless also believes the problem stems from the procurement process and the biases that keep small, nimble tech start-ups from getting this kind of work.\n\n\u201cThe buck definitely has to stop somewhere, but I think it\u2019s the public\u2019s fault for turning a blind eye on this contract situation for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see members of Congress winning elections by campaigning for comprehensive procurement reform.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2683807, "userid": 866193}, "description": "The GOP is arguing that the federal contractor got a sweetheart deal from its ties to the Obama administration, but the company donated...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
