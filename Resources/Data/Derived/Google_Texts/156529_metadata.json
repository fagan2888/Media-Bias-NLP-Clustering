Ever.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest mistakes I ever see: People go out and spend good money on good coffee and then they get it back home and freeze it,\u201d Calloway said. \u201cNever freeze your coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is water in coffee beans and when you put water in the freezer, it crystallizes. So what you\u2019re doing is getting crystallized water in your coffee beans, which is breaking up your beans, allowing the oils to release their gases before they\u2019re even brewed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you get a pound of whole bean and you make sure it\u2019s sealed properly, you can sit it out on the counter for three weeks. It\u2019s good to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother thing is the oils in the bean itself are very absorbent. They\u2019re going to absorb every odor and flavor in your freezer. Whether or not you think it there, it\u2019s there,\u201d Calloway said. \u201cIf you have fish in your freezer or you have meat in your freezer, it\u2019s absorbing all those flavors and odors. So, when you brew it and it tastes a little funky, that\u2019s why.
