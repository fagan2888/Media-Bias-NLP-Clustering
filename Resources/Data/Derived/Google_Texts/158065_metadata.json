Teaming up with Weedmaps (the \u201cYelp of weed dispensaries\u201d), Afroman is back almost 15 years later to put a positive spin on his 2001 hit in support of marijuana legalization. By challenging old pot stereotypes, Afroman, Norml\u2019s new spokesman, hopes to shed light on the importance of the cannabis law reform for people who rely on marijuana for medicinal purposes.\n\n\u201cNORML is thrilled to have brought Weedmaps and Afroman together to create this unique cultural collaboration merging art, entertainment, and activism into a single campaign that highlights many of the positive benefits of cannabis, and raises awareness for the legalization initiatives coming up in the 2014 November elections,\u201d Sabrina Fendrick, NORML\u2019s director of strategic partnerships, said in a statement.\n\nWhile you may remember the narrator in Afroman\u2019s 2001 version of \u201cBecause I Got High\u201d was plagued by memory loss, laziness, and an overall poor quality of life, the narrator in his remix highlights the beneficiary aspect of marijuana, such as glaucoma treatment, cigarette and alcohol cessation, and stress relief. The release of Afroman\u2019s pro-pot remix also coincides with the launch of the #SmokeTheVote campaign, which has brought attention to the upcoming Nov. 4 vote to legalize recreational marijuana in Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia. Florida will also be voting on the legalization of medical marijuana.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "afroman, because, i, got, high, marijuana, legalization", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A remix of Afroman's 2001 hit \"Because I Got Hit\" is circulating the Internet in support of marijuana legalization and Nov. 4's Smoke The Vote.", "title": "Afroman\u2019s \u2018Because I Got High\u2019 Remix Supports Marijuana Legalization [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smoke-vote-afroman-puts-positive-spin-because-i-got-high-support-marijuana-legalization-307255", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/16/afroman.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A remix of Afroman's 2001 hit \"Because I Got Hit\" is circulating the Internet in support of marijuana legalization and Nov. 4's Smoke The Vote.", "title": "Afroman\u2019s \u2018Because I Got High\u2019 Remix Supports Marijuana Legalization [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smoke-vote-afroman-puts-positive-spin-because-i-got-high-support-marijuana-legalization-307255", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/16/afroman.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/16/afroman.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-16T14:12:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-16T14:12:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A remix of Afroman's 2001 hit \"Because I Got Hit\" is circulating the Internet in support of marijuana legalization and Nov. 4's Smoke The Vote."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfce1\"", "article_summary": "Teaming up with Weedmaps (the \u201cYelp of weed dispensaries\u201d), Afroman is back almost 15 years later to put a positive spin on his 2001 hit in support of marijuana legalization.\nBy challenging old pot stereotypes, Afroman, Norml\u2019s new spokesman, hopes to shed light on the importance of the cannabis law reform for people who rely on marijuana for medicinal purposes.\nFlorida will also be voting on the legalization of medical marijuana.\nAfroman\u2019s \u201cBecause I Got High\u201d was regarded as the unofficial anthem for pot lovers, even though the song\u2019s narrator is explaining how smoking marijuana sent his life into a downward spiral.\nThe release of Afroman\u2019s pro-pot remix also coincides with the launch of the #SmokeTheVote campaign, which has brought attention to the upcoming Nov. 4 vote to legalize recreational marijuana in Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia."}
