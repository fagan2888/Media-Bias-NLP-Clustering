× Spence Jackson’s funeral held in Springfield

SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) – Former Missouri auditor’s spokesman Spence Jackson is being remembered at his funeral as a gregarious guy who was passionate about politics.

Jackson’s funeral was held Friday in his hometown of Springfield, two weeks after he fatally shot himself in what police describe as a suicide.

Jackson’s death came a month after his boss, Auditor Tom Schweich, also fatally shot himself.

Their deaths have shaken Missouri politics, particularly the Republican Party.

Jefferson City police say Jackson left a note expressing concern about losing his job, which would have been possible when the governor appoints a new permanent auditor.

At his funeral, Jackson’s friends, family and co-workers recalled his quick wit and dedication to his work.

Among the 150 in attendance was former Gov. Matt Blunt, for whom Jackson once worked.
