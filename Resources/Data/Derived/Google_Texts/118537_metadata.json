You don't want to blow it all in one spot.\n\nIf you weren't happy yesterday, you won't be happy tomorrow. It's money. It's not happiness.\n\nIf you were happy yesterday, you are going to be a lot happier tomorrow. It's money. Life gets easier when you don't have to worry about the bills.\n\nTell all your friends and relatives no. They will ask. Tell them no. If you are close to them, you already know who needs help and what they need. Feel free to help SOME, but talk to your accountant before you do anything and remember this, no one needs $1 million for anything. No one needs $100,000 for anything. Anyone who asks is not your friend.\n\nYou don't become a smart investor when you win the lottery. Don't make investments. You can put it in the bank and live comfortably. Forever. You will sleep a lot better knowing you won't lose money.\n\nHe also shared one last bonus tip with Business Insider: \"Be nice. No one likes a mean billionaire. :)\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.
