Beth Anderson earns extra income renting out her womb to infertile couples who dream of becoming parentsâ€”a mutually beneficial arrangement, as she sees it. "I really, really like being pregnant," she says. "They need help, it's something I want do, and it's a way for me to make a little bit of extra money."

But these types of arrangements are outlawed in many states. In Oklahoma, for example, surrogacy contracts are considered a form of child trafficking. In Michigan, surrogates face five years in jail and up to $50,000 in fines.

Gestational surrogacy contracts are also against the law in New York, but State Senator Brad Hoylman (D-27th Senate Dist.) introduced a bill last year that would change that. And he has first hand experience with the issue. Hoylman and his husband had to go to California to find a surrogate to carry their daughter Silvia, who's now four.

"If the [bill] passes, we'll have surrogates who could actually engage with intended parents and egg donors," says Hoylman.

"We don't want to turn baby making into a commercial industry," says Jennifer Lahl, president of the Center for Bioethics and Culture, who, among other things, worries that surrogacy contracts don't "anticipate every problem" that could arise between a surrogate and a couple.

With the legalization of same-sex marriage and ever-improving reproductive technologies, the movement to legalize commercial surrogacy is likely to grow in coming years.
