After five terms in office, former Sheriff Bill Wittman announced in October 2013 that he would step down for health reasons, making way for a new sheriff in town.\n\nThere is no way one could have missed seeing one of the thousands of campaign signs around the county in support of either Acting Sheriff Mike Boudreaux or former Undersheriff Dave Whaley.\n\nThe race to permanently fill that office has so far been one of the most exciting races in the county \u2014some would say, one of the most contentious.\n\nBut apart from the rancor that emanated from supporters in both camps \u2014 when allegations of an illegal raffle and improper reporting of campaign financials surfaced in Boudreaux\u2018s campaign \u2014 the two candidates have had strong, steady and distinguished careers. Both are serious contenders for the role of sheriff and both have the experience and the training to lead the department.\n\nBoudreaux is a 27-year veteran of the department, working his way through specialty units and eventually to sergeant, lieutenant and captain before being named Undersheriff by the Board of Supervisors when Wittman stepped down to take a medical leave. He earned degrees in criminology and administration of justice. He\u2019s also a graduate of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s West Point Leadership Academy as well as the FBI\u2019s National Academy.\n\nWhaley spent 34 years in the department also working his way up the ranks before achieving the Undersheriff position under Wittman. He helped lead the department through lean years and flush years, getting hand-on training and mentoring from Wittman in the same way that Boudreaux has.\n\nBut what the Tulare County Sheriff\u2019s Department will need most \u2014 what any law-enforcement agency today will need \u2014 going forward is a sheriff with the ability to master changing technology; to develop and then present the increasingly specialized needs of the department to the residents and taxpayers in a way that will garner support.\n\nHe must also be an effective speaker, and must pay close attention to the needs of the agricultural industries who have been hit hard by a growing and sophisticated problem of ag crime.\n\nFor those reasons, we urge you to vote for Mike Boudreaux for Tulare County Sheriff.\n\nMake no mistake \u2014 each candidate clearly has the ability to lead the department and neither has an overwhelming advantage over the other.\n\nBoth, at one time or another in their careers, had the support of their boss, former Sheriff Wittman.\n\nBoudreaux currently has Wittman\u2019s endorsement, but if Wittman had stepped down while Whaley was Undersheriff, we have no doubt Whaley would have likewise earned the endorsement. For Wittman to have thrown his support behind Whaley now would have been an insult to Boudreaux. So Wittman\u2019s endorsement carried relatively little weight.\n\nAnd while a premature departure does give every \u201cacting\u201d candidate an advantage \u2014 some might say an unfair advantage \u2014 Boudreaux does have what it takes to lead the department through the 21st century.\n\nGo to the polls on June 3 and cast your vote in support of Boudreaux.\n\nComing next week\n\nLook for the Times-Delta/Advance-Register editorial board pick for Tulare County District Attorney in the May 30 edition.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/opinion/2014/05/23/vote-mike-boudreaux-sheriff/9484577/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "EDITORIAL", "og": {"site_name": "Visalia Times-Delta and Tulare Advance-Register", "description": "EDITORIAL", "title": "Vote Mike Boudreaux for Sheriff", "url": "http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/opinion/2014/05/23/vote-mike-boudreaux-sheriff/9484577/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/visaliatimesdelta.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "EDITORIAL", "creator": "@vtdnews", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/90bb0221ddc849dd810d4d0850d1798dfe1cad77/c=100-0-244-144&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Visalia/2014/05/23/electionlogo2014.jpg", "title": "Vote Mike Boudreaux for Sheriff", "site": "@vtdnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=870529059", "fb": {"app_id": 148799741837669}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8528\"", "article_summary": "For those reasons, we urge you to vote for Mike Boudreaux for Tulare County Sheriff.\nThere is no way one could have missed seeing one of the thousands of campaign signs around the county in support of either Acting Sheriff Mike Boudreaux or former Undersheriff Dave Whaley.\nComing next weekLook for the Times-Delta/Advance-Register editorial board pick for Tulare County District Attorney in the May 30 edition.\nBoth, at one time or another in their careers, had the support of their boss, former Sheriff Wittman.\nGo to the polls on June 3 and cast your vote in support of Boudreaux."}
