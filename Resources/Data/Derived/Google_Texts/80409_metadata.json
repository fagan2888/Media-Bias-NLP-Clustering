The woman is alleged, during an argument, to have pushed her 33-year-old boyfriend with both her hands and then trying to grab his throat before he pushed her back in order to get away. She told police the incident occurred after she found out that \"he had been keeping secrets from her about another woman.\"\n\nPolice responding to a Wednesday morning report of a possible burglary in progress at a business on the 1000 block of Main Street contacted a 25-year-old Lakewood man on the east sidewalk of the block, near the Boulder County courts building, and took him into custody after a computer check showed he was wanted for failure to appear in court on a Black Hawk theft charge.\n\nPolice were dispatched Wednesday afternoon to the Left Hand Brewery, 1265 Boston Ave., on a report that an intoxicated man was passed out inside, that he'd been asked to leave several times but that he had refused. Police arrested the 54-year man, who turned out to be wanted on a warrant from the Fremont County Sheriff's Office for failing to comply with the terms of a child-abuse charge.\n\nPolice checking the 1900 block of Main Street on a Thursday morning report of a physical disturbance in the area arrested an 18-year-old man they located in an alley. The man and a friend denied being involved in any physical altercation, but police arrested the man when it turned out he was wanted on a warrant for failure to comply with the terms of a sentence on a defective-vehicle offense.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27251652/longmont-police-blotter-secrets-spark-spat", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "by Times-Call staff", "description": "Police arrested a 49-year-old woman on suspicion of domestic violence and harassment by stalking on Wednesday night after being dispatched to a residence on the 1000 block of Gay Street on a report of a domestic disturbance there.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27251652:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-03T10:44:48-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27251652/longmont-police-blotter-secrets-spark-spat", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "Police arrested a 49-year-old woman on suspicion of domestic violence and harassment by stalking on Wednesday night after being dispatched to a residence on the 1000 block of Gay Street on a report of a domestic disturbance there.", "title": "Longmont police blotter: Secrets spark spat"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Police arrested a 49-year-old woman on suspicion of domestic violence and harassment by stalking on Wednesday night after being dispatched to a residence on the 1000 block of Gay Street on a report of a domestic disturbance there.", "title": "Longmont police blotter: Secrets spark spat", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27251652/longmont-police-blotter-secrets-spark-spat", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-03T10:44:48-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Longmont police blotter: Secrets spark spat", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "by Times-Call staff", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2015-01-03T10:46:46-0700", "endDate": "2025-01-03T10:44:48-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-01-03T10:48:26-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde608\"", "article_summary": "She told police the incident occurred after she found out that \"he had been keeping secrets from her about another woman.\"\nPolice checking the 1900 block of Main Street on a Thursday morning report of a physical disturbance in the area arrested an 18-year-old man they located in an alley.\nPolice arrested the 54-year man, who turned out to be wanted on a warrant from the Fremont County Sheriff's Office for failing to comply with the terms of a child-abuse charge.\nPolice arrested a 49-year-old woman on suspicion of domestic violence and harassment by stalking on Wednesday night after being dispatched to a residence on the 1000 block of Gay Street on a report of a domestic disturbance there.\nThe woman is alleged, during an argument, to have pushed her 33-year-old boyfriend with both her hands and then trying to grab his throat before he pushed her back in order to get away."}
