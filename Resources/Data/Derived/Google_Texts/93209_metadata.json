Located at AARPTEK.org, the site can be accessed from a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops or desktops and offers dozens of tutorials on a range of helpful topics, from social media to staying safe online.\n\nAARP TEK (which stands for Technology Education and Knowledge) launched last year offering hands-on workshops in select cities to empower the 50-plus audience to use technology to live their best lives. The TEK Academy is the latest offering as part of this program.\n\n\u201cWith 37 million Americans not online, AARP TEK Academy is for anyone who wants to get the most out of their mobile devices, stay safe online and pursue online adult learning for professional development, healthy living, online money management, entertainment and much more,\u201d said AARP Interim Vice President Anne Jacoby. \u201cWe have had strong success at our face to face TEK workshops in cities across the country as adults share stories of being able to stay in touch with family via social media, use technology to expand their business and learn new skills for job searches. The online AARP TEK Academy is a solution to reach even more Americans and help them to use technology to positively impact their lives and to realize the \u2018real possibilities\u2019 that AARP represents.\u201d\n\nWhile aimed at helping the 50-plus demographic, AARP TEK is for anyone who wants to get the most out of their smartphone, tablet or other technology. With the addition of the online AARP TEK Academy, people can now leverage AARP TEK resources in a variety of ways including: hands-on AARP TEK workshops in many cities, online seminars, and interactive online courses. New features available at AARP TEK Academy include a webinar series on topics such as Facebook security, digital photography and building your personal brand online.\n\nProduced in collaboration with Kaplan, AARP TEK also provides people with access to LearningAdvisor.com, a robust site for adult learning that features a searchable database of more than 30,000 online courses from 20 different providers, providing a range of courses for everyone from the tech savvy to new users.\n\n\u201cTechnology now provides unprecedented access to a new world of learning possibilities,\u201d said Sophie Vlessing, SVP for Strategy and Innovation at Kaplan Higher and Professional Education. \u201cAARP TEK Academy with LearningAdvisor helps bridge the digital divide and makes navigating the journey easier.\u201d\n\nFor more information on AARP TEK and its new AARP TEK Academy, please visit aarptek.org.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
