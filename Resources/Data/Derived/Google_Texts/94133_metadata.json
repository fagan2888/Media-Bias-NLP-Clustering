But first: A major development in the Zika funding fight looms today.\n\nSENATE ON VERGE OF APPROVING ZIKA REQUEST \u2014 The Senate is likely to approve a $1.1 billion Zika funding package today as part of a transportation funding bill. But that's not the whole story.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Where they stand: Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, one of the amendment\u2019s crafters, told PULSE she is \u201chopeful\u201d of passage. Republican Sen. Richard Burr told us that he\u2019s a \u201cyes,\u201d too, and he expects enough Republican support. However, several Republicans told us yesterday evening that they were still reviewing the language and not ready to commit to approval.\n\n\u2014 What else is on tap: The Senate will also vote on an amendment to fully fund the $1.9 billion White House request and not pay for it (which is expected to get Democratic support) and a $1.1 billion package that is funded with ACA cuts, among other pay-fors (which will get GOP support, but Democratic backing is unlikely).\n\nHOUSE TARGETING LOWER LEVEL OF ZIKA FUNDING \u2014 House appropriators on Monday introduced a $622.1 million emergency funding bill responding to the Zika virus outbreak, about a third of what the White House has sought to combat the mosquito-borne virus.\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said the bill \u2014 which draws on $352 million in unspent Ebola funds and another $270 million in HHS's administrative budget, and does not include new money \u2014 will be taken up by his committee this week.\n\nThe White House has failed to justify its budget request, Rogers said\n\n\u2014 Democrats say GOP is playing Zika politics with Clean Water Act. A House GOP bill called the Zika Vector Control Act contains the same language as the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, which creates exemptions to the Clean Water Act's restrictions on pesticide use.\n\nThe legislation, which is on the suspension calendar for Tuesday, \"has nothing to do with Zika and everything to do with Republicans\u2019 relentless special interest attacks on the Clean Water Act,\" said Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. \"It is shameful that House Republicans have decided the Zika crisis is nothing more than an opportunity to eliminate protections for the water our children drink.\"\n\n\u2014 The Mosquito Control Association disagrees with Democrats. In a letter, the not-for-profit group offers its \"enthusiastic support\" for Republicans' measure.\n\n\"This amendment addresses a situation that has placed mosquito control activities under substantial legal jeopardy,\" the association wrote on Monday. \"Mosquito control programs are vulnerable to lawsuits for simple paperwork violations of the Clean Water Act \u2026 where fines may be up to $35,000 per day for activities that do not involve harm to the environment.\"\n\nRead the letter: http://politico.pro/1TFrbZD\n\nTHIS IS TUESDAY PULSE \u2014 Where we're truly wondering if Sen. Marco Rubio is going to do chest or legs at the gym today.

Nearly all House Republicans have signed on to a letter seeking to kill the demonstration to test new ways to pay for physician-administered drugs, and the committee plans to discuss Rep. Larry Bucshon\u2019s bill to end the project.\n\n\u2014 What you'll hear: \u201cMisguided,\u201d \u201cill-conceived,\u201d and \u201charmful,\u201d will be some of the negative refrains from witnesses \u2014 along with the verb \"withdraw.\"\n\nBut the hearing may be more balanced than some might have thought. Two of the five witnesses offered strong support for the Part B demo in prepared testimony, Pro's Sarah Karlin notes.\n\n\u201cMy personal Catch-22 is that while drugs are keeping me alive, I am going through my savings at an alarming rate,\u201d said Heather Block, a stage four cancer patient, in prepared testimony. \u201cIn all the uproar over this proposal, I have yet to hear anyone say that the current system is working.\u201d Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, said the demonstration must move forward if the government wants to achieve its overall goal of transitioning Medicare to a system that reimburses for health care based on value \u2014 a concept supported by many of the Part B demo\u2019s detractors, including physicians and hospitals.\n\n\u2014 Even critics of the demo want changes to drug prices. Michael Schweitz, the national advocacy chair for the coalition of state rheumatology organizations, and an opponent of the proposal, wrote that the increases in drug prices \u201care unsustainable for Medicare and beneficiaries.\u201d But Medicare\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t directly address drug prices, he said.\n\nHearing information and links to all testimony: http://1.usa.gov/27jKPEu\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

Elizabeth Warren and 10 colleagues wrote on Monday night to HHS and CMS leaders. http://politico.pro/1TdAzti\n\nOBAMA: FULL COURT WOULDN'T HAVE PUNTED ON ZUBIK \u2014 The president said on Monday that he suspects the Zubik v. Burwell outcome would have been different had the court had a full bench.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t speculate as to why [the court] punted but my suspicion is that if we had nine Supreme Court justices instead of eight, there might have been a different outcome,\u201d President Barack Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed.\n\nThe court unanimously remanded the case on Monday, telling the lower courts to find a solution that allows religious institutions to object to providing birth control but also keeps intact Obamacare\u2019s coverage protections.\n\nJUST 9.1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS ARE UNINSURED \u2014 That's according to new National Health Interview Survey estimates out today, and it represents the lowest uninsured level on record. The survey, which goes through 2015, shows consistent declines in the uninsured rate beginning in 2013, as Affordable Care Act coverage expansion began to take effect.\n\nSee the data: http://1.usa.gov/1WB6kO3\n\n\u2014 More Americans have private insurance than before the ACA took effect. About 63.2 percent of all Americans were covered through private health insurance in 2015, up from 59.5 percent in 2013 and 60.2 percent in 2010. The explanation: More than 10 million Americans bought private coverage through the ACA exchanges.\n\n\u2014 Poverty is still a differentiator. About one-quarter of adults ages 18-64 who were poor or near-poor were uninsured in 2015, versus just 7.6 percent of all other adults.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Health Care Report \u2014 Reaching the Tipping Point: Health Care Delivery Reform: A conversation about regional variation in health care delivery system reform.

The still-developing plan would be based on Indiana's approach to Medicaid expansion and represent a significant reversal: Gov. Mary Fallin has been a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act. http://yhoo.it/1ZZv0gx\n\nIN CASE YOU REALLY MISSED IT \u2014 Pros got wind of Oklahoma's expansion proposal in early April.

PREPARE TO BE STRESSED OUT \u2014 In the metro D.C. area, 86 percent of network psychiatrists were either not reachable or not able to schedule a new visit, according to the American Psychiatric Association. The organization performed a secret-shopping study by contacting a random sample of 150 psychiatrists listed through the exchange.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is intended to expand access to mental health and substance use disorder care, yet networks are shrinking,\" said APA's leader Saul Levin. He added that psychiatrists are dropping out of the networks available on the ACA exchanges because of \"unreasonable administrative burden\" and low reimbursement rates, while plans continue to narrow their networks and prune the list of available providers.\n\nPROTON THERAPY CENTERS HAVE DOUBLED WORLDWIDE IN PAST FIVE YEARS \u2014 More hospitals are investing in the technology, which had been scrutinized for its high price and questionable cost-effectiveness, as vendors roll out smaller and less expensive centers. http://on.wsj.com/1R5uebI\n\nAN ANTI-AGING DRUG IS FOR THE DOGS \u2014 Researchers are using dogs to test a drug that slows some of the key effects of aging, according to a front-page New York Times story today. http://nyti.ms/1stKgs4\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING, by Rachana Pradhan\n\nThe New York Times' Upshot explores why single-payer in the U.S. would probably still be expensive. http://nyti.ms/1Ox3X6m\n\nVox writes about how the ACA can't compel insurers to offer plans in the exchanges. http://bit.ly/24V2bWe\n\nDarrell West with the Brookings Institution opines how Zika could help Donald Trump if the virus wreaks havoc in the U.S. later on this year.http://brook.gs/1Tdv5hX\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports on new research showing why cancer affects men and women differently. http://on.wsj.com/1rQq2rG\n\nVeterans are waiting even longer to see a doctor despite Congress' response to the VA scandal two years ago, NPR reports. http://n.pr/1WzXv74\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
