These are the most important variables the law uses to determine eligibility for subsidies, and yet the system can't regularly perform an effective validation of any of them. Household income, in particular, is the biggest factor in determining whether someone qualifies for subsidies, and, if so, how much. But Obamacare\u2019s system doesn\u2019t consistently provide an accurate check.\n\nAre there lots of subsidies going out that shouldn\u2019t be? This is, at the very least, a real possibility. The lack of effective verification doesn\u2019t tell us that what percentage are wrongly awarded\u2014just that we can\u2019t be sure what percentage is handed out correctly.\n\nIn addition, the report says that applications with inconsistencies aren\u2019t always resolved properly, and that records related to inconsistent applications aren\u2019t well maintained.\n\nWhy is the system unable to do what it is supposedly designed to do? Basically because it\u2019s just too complicated. Information sent through the exchanges is sent through the Federal Data Services Hub, a kind of air-traffic control system for all the personal data that Obamacare\u2019s federal exchange system handles. The Data Hub then connects to HHS, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the IRS, as well as a number of other agencies.\n\nExcept, well, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. As the Inspector General\u2019s report says, \"The deficiencies related to verifying applicants\u2019 eligibility occurred because, for example, the Federal marketplace\u2019s eligibility and enrollment system was not designed to always validate Social Security numbers through SSA.\"\n\nBasically, the Data Hub is supposed to send personal data out to do digital wind sprints\u2014touching some other agency database, then coming back through the central hub. But sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s too much information trying to connect to too many different systems. It\u2019s a technical problem born out of bureaucratic sprawl, and it's a mess.\n\nThe result is a system that could well be rife with errors, and lends itself to exploitation. Just last month, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), another federal watchdog, released a report showing that Obamacare\u2019s exchange technology had allowed 11 fake accounts made up by undercover GAO investigators to stay in the system, even though the GAO had made the existence of those accounts public a year earlier. Indeed, about half of those fake accounts were actually granted even larger subsidies their second year in the system. The watchdog agency\u2019s blunt conclusion was that \"HealthCare.gov [the federal health exchange site] does not appear to be set up to detect fraud.\"\n\nThis is one of the dangers of a law like Obamacare, which, for political reasons, largely built on top of the already-complicated, already-fractured existing health system. The result is a makeshift, patchwork add-on that in many ways makes the system even more frustratingly complex, and in the process creates more problems\u2014like this.\n\nIt's not just subsidy verification that is turning out to be harder than expected. The law's back-end payment systems, which were supposed to be completed and online in 2013, still aren't fully finished, meaning that insurers are just estimating how much they're owed under the law. Earlier this year, the administration sent out hundreds of thousands of tax forms related to the law with errors on them, and didn't even know why. A similar problem affected more than 100,000 Obamacare enrollees in California. In the state-run exchanges, many crucial functions remain incomplete.\n\nThink of it this way: Before Obamacare, the U.S. health system was like a giant tangled knot. If you\u2019ve ever tried to untangle a big knot, you know that it can take a while, and that the trick is to patiently loosen one bit at a time.\n\nObamacare\u2019s designers, in contrast, saw that they couldn\u2019t undo the knot, so they added more string, and tied it into the knot that was already there. Now it\u2019s an even bigger mess.\n\nThat\u2019s obviously a problem for reformers who want to begin the slow, frustrating process of untangling the knot. Obamacare has made the age-old problems with the U.S. health care system even harder to unravel.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a problem for people trying to make Obamacare work. HHS officials basically agreed with the IG report and said they are taking some steps to address. Yet it\u2019s clearly a harder problem to solve than anyone expected. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this administration never gets it all resolved. Obamacare is likely to continue struggling with the burden of its complexity for as long as it lasts.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Yet another government watchdog says the health law is failing to verify eligibility for subsidies.", "title": "Is Obamacare Too Complex to Work?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/10/is-obamacare-too-complex-to-work", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14392338744811.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yet another government watchdog says the health law is failing to verify eligibility for subsidies.", "title": "Is Obamacare Too Complex to Work?", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14392338744811.jpg", "creator": "@petersuderman", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-08-10T19:31:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Think of it this way: Before Obamacare, the U.S. health system was like a giant tangled knot.\nBut it\u2019s also a problem for people trying to make Obamacare work.\nThe watchdog agency\u2019s blunt conclusion was that \"HealthCare.gov [the federal health exchange site] does not appear to be set up to detect fraud.\"\nThis is one of the dangers of a law like Obamacare, which, for political reasons, largely built on top of the already-complicated, already-fractured existing health system.\nBut Obamacare\u2019s system doesn\u2019t consistently provide an accurate check."}
