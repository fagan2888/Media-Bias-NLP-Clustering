He paused, then acknowledged: \u201cWhen I say this, really smart people like \u2026 Jim Lewis over at CSIS [the Center for Strategic and International Studies] begin to get very forceful in response.\u201d\n\nLewis, who heads CSIS\u2019s Strategic Technologies Program, is a rare cyber expert with a history that bridges the technical, international relations and warfare components of cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cI did the political military stuff for many years, but I still am sort of geeky,\u201d Lewis said, laughing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLewis, who\u2019s been writing computer programs since high school, sat in on White House meetings during the so-called \u201ccrypto wars\u201d of the 1990s, helped the NSA roll out its first major public encryption device, travelled extensively to Asia with the U.S. Foreign Service, learned about the private sector at the Commerce Department and met with Chinese delegations and Defense Department (DOD) officials to talk cyberattack attribution.\n\n\u201cI was a bad federal employee,\u201d Lewis joked. \u201cI was more like a tourist.\u201d\n\nBut as cybersecurity quickly evolves from an IT issue into a geopolitical concern that cuts across almost every agency, Lewis\u2019s tourism has made his a top opinion sought out by administration officials and lawmakers alike.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a topic where there aren\u2019t a lot of people who can make useful suggestions,\u201d Lewis told The Hill in a recent interview in his office overlooking Rhode Island Avenue. \u201cIf you worked on technology, if you worked on security, if you worked on intelligence and you worked on commerce, that gives you sort of a unique blend.\u201d\n\nThe massive cyberattack last November on Sony Pictures \u201cis a good example,\u201d Lewis says.\n\nThe high-profile hit crippled the film studio\u2019s networks, exposed troves of internal data and emails and almost caused the company to cancel a big-budget comedy. It also generated ample armchair cyber analysis.\n\nMany security firms have cast doubt on the government\u2019s narrative that North Korea backed the attack in retaliation for the studio\u2019s comedy, \u201cThe Interview,\u201d about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nLewis has been one of the few to strongly back the government\u2019s explanation. He enjoys adopting a Kermit the Frog voice when imitating the arguments of government doubters.\n\nOne in particular stuck out to him, regarding the language of the code that was used to take down Sony\u2019s network. The FBI cited the Korean-language basis of the code when laying out its case against North Korea. Some doubters pointed out the code had more indications of South Korean language than North Korean language.\n\nOr, as Lewis said in semi-Kermit mode: \u201cWe know it wasn\u2019t North Korea because North Korea and South Korea have different languages.\u201d\n\nDropping back to his normal tone, Lewis replied. \u201cReally dude? There\u2019s only one problem with that. I\u2019ve been to Korea four times and no Korean has ever told me that.\u201d\n\nThe language that has developed regional and cultural differences as a result of the half-century of minimal contact. But, Lewis said, those differences aren\u2019t substantial enough to use as the basis for a counter-argument.\n\n\u201cKnowing what I know, I think it gives me a little bit of an edge in analyzing problems,\u201d Lewis added.\n\nPolicymakers agree. Lewis regularly briefs lawmakers on cyber issues and has advised governments from China to South Korea to Australia on cyber concerns.\n\nIn recent years, the tenor of these meetings has changed drastically. Only two or three years ago, when Lewis briefed U.S. lawmakers, their attitude was: \u201cWhy are you bothering with this stuff?\u201d\n\nNow they have a whole host of questions for him.\n\nHow does the U.S. balance its economic relationship with China while the country bombards America with cyberattacks? How should the U.S. respond when it believes North Korea has destroyed data at a private American company? What are the benefits of sharing cybersecurity information between the public and private sector?\n\n\u201cWhat I mainly talk to them about is, let\u2019s not lose sight of the big things we\u2019re ultimately going to have to do, but what are the things we can do in the interim that might make things better?\u201d Lewis said.\n\nMany believe Congress has the bipartisan support to move a bill this year that would enable increased information sharing between the government and private companies. Proponents of the bill \u2014 namely industry groups and intelligence officials \u2014 argue such an information exchange is necessary to better defend the country\u2019s infrastructure from cyberattacks.\n\nLewis thinks it\u2019s one of the \u201cinterim\u201d measures Congress can take.\n\nAdministration officials also seek Lewis\u2019s advice.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more focused on the immediate results,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have that sense of urgency that doesn\u2019t really exist on the Hill.\u201d\n\nIn May of last year, the administration indicted five members of the Chinese army for hacking the U.S., straining bilateral cyber relations. Following the Sony hit, President Obama decided to impose a round of economic sanctions targeting Pyongyang\u2019s arms dealers. Both moves are helping shape the international norms on cyberattack punishments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong sense when you talk to State [Department] or DHS [Department of Homeland Security] or DOD or the White House that they need to do something now,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe administration is also weighing its stance on modern encryption, roughly two decades after the \u201ccrypto wars\u201d of the 1990s, during which Lewis helped shape the government\u2019s initial thoughts on the technology.\n\n\u201cThere were negotiations underway, which I was involved in back then, on how you make the Internet secure for both users and for law enforcement,\u201d he said. The Clinton administration decided it wanted to have encryption publicly available.\n\n\u201cThey would take the hit on law enforcement and intelligence in order to make people more secure,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nHe recalled a meeting with then-CIA Director John Deutch and FBI officials to discuss the decision.\n\n\u201cSome FBI people said to them, \u2018If we do this it\u2019s going to create major problems,\u2019 \u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd [Deutch] said, \u2018Look that\u2019s my problem don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut the decision was decades too early. The public didn\u2019t care about adopting encryption, and it remained a fringe technology.\n\nThat has caused the same argument to come roaring back after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed a number of secret spying programs that collected mass quantities of Americans\u2019 data. For the first time, desire for encryption has gone mainstream.\n\nProminent companies like Apple and Google have built default encryption into their devices that they claim keeps the government permanently locked out. The FBI has responded in the same fashion, publicly and privately criticizing companies for aiding and protecting criminals.\n\n\u201cAll the complaints you see about the FBI and Apple and Google, that\u2019s a replay of the crypto wars of the \u201990s,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nPro-encryption and civil liberties advocates were unhappy when Obama seemed to partially side with the FBI a few weeks back.\n\nFollowing a meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron, the president endorsed the British leader\u2019s push for \u201cbackdoors,\u201d or intentional weaknesses built into technology that give the government permanent access to communications with a warrant.\n\nLewis believes in strong public encryption. He even thinks the government \u201cshould mandate encryption for some activities,\u201d but acknowledges \u201cit\u2019s tricky because you make people\u2019s data safer but that includes jihadis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you have to think, \u2018Is there a balance, is there another solution?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAll that takes time to cook up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all part of managing a rapidly developing, and often unpredictable, invention \u2014 the Internet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the others would say this, but nobody expected the Internet to take off the way it did,\u201d Lewis acknowledged. \u201cNobody expected the tidal wave.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The head of CSIS\u2019s Strategic Technologies Program is a rare cyber expert.", "description": "The head of CSIS\u2019s Strategic Technologies Program is a rare cyber expert.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The head of CSIS\u2019s Strategic Technologies Program is a rare cyber expert.", "title": "Cybersecurity savant", "url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/230796-cybersecurity-savant", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/lewisjim_012115gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/230796-cybersecurity-savant", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-27T06:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-27T06:00:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/230796-cybersecurity-savant", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The head of CSIS\u2019s Strategic Technologies Program is a rare cyber expert.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cybersecurity savant"}, "dcterms.title": "Cybersecurity savant"}, "article_summary": "Or, as Lewis said in semi-Kermit mode: \u201cWe know it wasn\u2019t North Korea because North Korea and South Korea have different languages.\u201dDropping back to his normal tone, Lewis replied.\nHow should the U.S. respond when it believes North Korea has destroyed data at a private American company?\nHe recalled a meeting with then-CIA Director John Deutch and FBI officials to discuss the decision.\nThe FBI cited the Korean-language basis of the code when laying out its case against North Korea.\nWhat are the benefits of sharing cybersecurity information between the public and private sector?"}
