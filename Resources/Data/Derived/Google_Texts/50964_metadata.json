According to The Daily Beast, Lisa, whose name has been changed for anonymity, was in no shape to regularly attend class, facing constant seizures and disability from many strokes. A doctor in charge of Lisa\u2019s care noted that her battle with brain cancer left her in need of \u201cassistance in dressing, eating, and eliminating urine and feces.\u201d\n\nThe superintendent, principal, and head of special education in her district were all aware of Lisa\u2019s problems, and did not penalize her for it. \u201cFor the past two-and-a-half years of her life, she was in and out of the hospital,\u201d said her mother Martha, whose name had also been changed. \u201cShe went from being this chatterbox to not talking at all.\u201d\n\nLisa had been absent from school since 2012 after having her first stroke. Her prolonged period of truancy compelled her school to drop her from enrollment, prompting her family\u2019s loss in welfare. \u201cI checked my [benefits] card monthly to see how much I would have, and thought, \u2018Why is the amount less?\u2019 Then I got a letter in the mail,\u201d Martha told The Daily Beast.\n\nMartha\u2019s subsequent lack of welfare funding was due to the passing of the Republican-sponsored state bill, \u201cThe Parental Responsibility Act.\u201d The law states that frequent absenteeism on the part of a child under 16 years old means the whole family will lose out on the cash benefits of welfare \u2014 the child alone will lose benefits only after turning 16.\n\n\u201cOur top priority is to keep kids in school, and we want to use whatever tools we can to incentivize children to stay in school,\u201d said the state\u2019s Department of Health Services representative, Bob Wheaton.\n\nSince 2012, the DHS says 350 households have been taken off welfare in an attempt to get their kids to go to school. But is this actually keeping kids at their desks? Wheaton\u2019s response to this question left much to be desired. \u201cThat\u2019s not anything we\u2019re able to track because they\u2019ve stopped receiving public assistance,\u201d he said, adding the department has the \u201cability, in some cases, to manually cross-reference new applicant [data] and current-recipient data.\u201d But Wheaton still concedes that the method has not been wholly effective; one-sixth of families who have been taken off of welfare for truancy have been put back on, while about half who lost welfare did not re-apply.\n\nDespite the lack of concrete evidence that this new policy is working, several representatives who initially supported the bill still believe it is the best, and only, method to keep kids in class. Representative Jim Runestad said in a hearing this year that \u201ctough love\u201d was necessary for truancy, because parents whose children did not attend school \u201cwere on drugs\u201d and their \u201ckids were running free.\u201d\n\nSeveral democrats in Michigan have proposed an amendment to the bill, decrying that restricting welfare is not an incentive for children to go to school, but rather an exacerbation of the problem. \u201cThis is not about helping poor people. This is about kicking people while they\u2019re down,\u201d Senator Coleman Young II told MLive. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s disgusting. It needs to stop.\u201d\n\nMany others are working on coming forward alternatives to improving frequent absenteeism without involving politics. The Daily Beast notes \u201cPathways to Potential,\u201d a Michigan-based program, uses caseworkers in 200 schools across the state to help families find daycare for younger children, so that older children won\u2019t need to stay home and watch them. The program also offers travel vouchers to families in need. And Wheaton says this program has reduced truancy in Michigan by 33 percent.\n\nMartha, whose child could not attend school regardless of outside assistance, had no choice but to take her case to court. In her first hearing, the judge was \u201csympathetic to extenuating circumstances,\u201d but was still bound by the law claiming that Martha was ineligible for benefits. Four weeks later, another judge ruled in favor of Martha\u2019s plight, saying that because she never transferred her daughter to another school, she was owed several months in back-payments for missed welfare. She was ultimately reinstated into the program.\n\nUnfortunately, Lisa did not live to see her mother win the case. She died just before the second ruling. Now, Martha is hoping that her experience will shed some light on the injustices of the current welfare system in Michigan. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be a help department, but I think they actually hurt you more than help you,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her death to be in vain. If her situation can help another family, I really want it to be done. I hate to have anyone go through what I went through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "crime, and, punishment, michigan, mother, taken, welfare, because, her, daughter, brain, cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Michigan mother was taken off welfare after her daughter with severe brain cancer could no longer attend school.", "title": "Mom Punished For 12-Year-Old Daughter's Brain Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/crime-and-punishment-michigan-mother-taken-welfare-because-her-daughter-brain-cancer-344206", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/22/mother-daughter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michigan mother was taken off welfare after her daughter with severe brain cancer could no longer attend school.", "title": "Mom Punished For 12-Year-Old Daughter's Brain Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/crime-and-punishment-michigan-mother-taken-welfare-because-her-daughter-brain-cancer-344206", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/22/mother-daughter.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/22/mother-daughter.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-22T15:11:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-22T15:11:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Michigan mother was taken off welfare after her daughter with severe brain cancer could no longer attend school."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc03f\"", "article_summary": "A Michigan mother and her children have been kicked off of welfare after her 12-year-old daughter, suffering from brain cancer, failed to attend school.\nMartha, whose child could not attend school regardless of outside assistance, had no choice but to take her case to court.\nHer prolonged period of truancy compelled her school to drop her from enrollment, prompting her family\u2019s loss in welfare.\nSince 2012, the DHS says 350 households have been taken off welfare in an attempt to get their kids to go to school.\nNow, Martha is hoping that her experience will shed some light on the injustices of the current welfare system in Michigan."}
