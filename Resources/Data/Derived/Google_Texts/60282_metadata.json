Instead, it\u2019s slamming the drug industry.\n\n\u201cDrugmakers have no straight-face explanation to justify the increasingly astronomical prices they have been charging for their medications,\u201d complains one of numerous public relations communications sent recently by the industry trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\n\nThe group has called drug prices \u201cunsustainable\u201d and accused the industry of \u201cprice gouging.\u201d The focus of the industry\u2019s fury at the moment is Sovaldi, a breakthrough treatment that can cure Hepatitis C, but which costs $84,000. These are the same complaints lodged for years by leftist groups that want price controls on prescription drugs \u2014 complaints that are at odds with the facts.\n\nThe truth is that spending on prescription drugs has been virtually flat for years, climbing just 3.5% between 2009 and 2012 at a time when the nation\u2019s overall health care spending climbed 11.5%.\n\nAmazingly, drug spending accounted for a smaller share of the total health tab in 2012 than it did in 1960, government data show.\n\nEven if some drugs do cost a lot, it doesn\u2019t make sense to look at just one side of the ledger. A cure for Hepatitis C could save billions in health costs elsewhere, to say nothing of the economic gains of having these people as productive citizens.\n\nThat broader perspective on drugs has been echoed in several studies. One of them, published in Health Affairs, found that each dollar spent treating congestive heart failure can save $9 in other health spending.\n\nTo the extent that drug prices are a problem, the cause is largely the massive regulatory hurdles imposed on the industry, not price-gouging schemes. Insurers say they\u2019re raising a fuss in hopes that the drug industry will keep prices in check now, rather than suffer government price controls later. But it\u2019s really just trying to deflect blame for ObamaCare-caused premium spikes.\n\nBy feeding the public\u2019s impression that drug prices are wholly arbitrary, it\u2019s providing fertile ground for those price controls. And not just for drugs. Soon, someone\u2019s going to use the insurance industry\u2019s same arguments to call for price controls on premiums, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anti-Capitalism: You'd think that after ObamaCare's chaotic launch, premium rate shocks, subsidy foul-ups and costly ad hoc changes, the insurance industry", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Anti-Capitalism: You\u2019d think that after ObamaCare\u2019s chaotic launch, premium rate shocks, subsidy foul-ups and costly ad hoc changes, the insurance industry would attack the law.
