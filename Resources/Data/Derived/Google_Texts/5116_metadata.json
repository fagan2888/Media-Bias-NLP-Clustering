Mr. Trump\u2019s impressive victories in Hawaii, Mississippi and Michigan underscored his unmovable support with at least a third of the GOP electorate across the country.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rubio, Now a Zombie Candidate, Under Pressure to Quit\n\nTrump has amassed a considerable delegate lead over Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 himself no favorite of the Party establishment \u2013 and stands ready to leap even further ahead if he can secure the 99 delegates that will go to the winner of Florida\u2019s primary next Tuesday and the 66 that go to the victor in Ohio.\n\nTrump\u2019s inexorable march toward the GOP nomination had some figures like conservative radio host Erick Erickson calling for swift action to consolidate the party against Trump.\n\n\u201cIt is time for the GOP to pick its poison: Trump or Cruz,\u201d he wrote Wednesday morning. Erickson\u2019s choice is, plainly, rejecting Trump. Not only does Cruz stand a better chance of defeating Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, in November. Trump could also have catastrophic effects on down-ballot Republican races.\n\n\u201cSo the GOP must choose. They can reject Trump or they can reject Cruz. They cannot reject both at this point,\u201d he wrote. Then, though, he spun out a deeply unlikely scenario in which Cruz and Rubio unite as a unity ticket, with Cruz as president and Rubio as vice president, and \u201cbarnstorm\u201d Florida together, with Rubio urging his supporters to throw their votes to Cruz.\n\nRelated: Better Business Bureau \u2013 Trump Lied About Our Ratings\n\n\u201cIt is the only way now to stop Trump from getting those 99 delegates and it is the only way now to change the trajectory of the race,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt needs to happen by tomorrow. The next twenty-four hours will be the difference between stopping Trump and being seen as rigging the game against Trump. The former is a clean win no one can dispute. The latter will make wounds fester. Decide today.\u201d\n\nRailing against \u201cthe mother of all capitulations\u201d in the National Review, Jonah Goldberg fretted that long-time conservatives, who have jumped ship to join the Trump movement, are jettisoning their principles as they hit the water. \u201cInstead of converting voters to conservatism, Trump is succeeding at converting conservatives to statism on everything from health care and entitlements to trade.\u201d\n\nOthers are bracing themselves for a figuratively (and perhaps literally) bloody fight at the Republican nominating convention in Cleveland this July.\n\nWriting in Commentary on Tuesday, Noah Rothman bemoaned the thuggishness of the Trump campaign. (After the story was published, Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski reportedly manhandled a female reporter following Trump\u2019s Florida press conference Tuesday evening.) Some conservative commentators have warned that organized resistance to Trump at the nominating convention could lead to violence, but Rothman called on conservatives to resist \u2013 even in the face of a violent backlash.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Numbers Are Falling \u2013 How Far Can They Go?\n\n\u201c[R]esistance will falter if the conservative movement\u2019s most influential leaders become paralyzed with fear over the prospect of political violence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis would be a tragedy of unspeakable proportions. Trumpism cannot be accommodated or incorporated into the GOP. Those Trump supporters who might be moved to violence will not be mollified if only the party took a harder line on free trade or espoused the reformation of the earned income tax credit. A movement that will not tolerate representative proportionality or the horse-trading that occurs at a nominating convention is incompatible with the American system of governance, as we understand it today. One or the other must cease to exist.\u201d\n\nRothman concluded with a (slightly overwrought) call to arms. \u201cSteel yourselves, conservative pundits. Your conviction and your ideals have not yet begun to be tested. There is a political fight coming, and preemptive submission will not yield you better terms.\u201d\n\nIt may not be too late to avoid the need for some sort of Trumperd\u00e4mmerung at the GOP convention, but Erickson is at least correct that time is running desperately short.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Tuesday morning, half a day after billionaire Donald Trump added three more primary state victories to his tally in the Republican presidential race, panic wafted through the rhetoric of the conservative media.", "title": "Panic on the Right as the GOP Careens Toward a Chaotic Convention", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/09/Panic-Right-GOP-Careens-Toward-Chaotic-Convention", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/09/Panic-Right-GOP-Careens-Toward-Chaotic-Convention", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "On Tuesday morning, half a day after billionaire Donald Trump added three more primary state victories to his tally in the Republican presidential race, panic wafted through the rhetoric of the conservative media.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt is time for the GOP to pick its poison: Trump or Cruz,\u201d he wrote Wednesday morning.\nTrump\u2019s inexorable march toward the GOP nomination had some figures like conservative radio host Erick Erickson calling for swift action to consolidate the party against Trump.\nThere is a political fight coming, and preemptive submission will not yield you better terms.\u201dIt may not be too late to avoid the need for some sort of Trumperd\u00e4mmerung at the GOP convention, but Erickson is at least correct that time is running desperately short.\n\u201c[R]esistance will falter if the conservative movement\u2019s most influential leaders become paralyzed with fear over the prospect of political violence,\u201d he wrote.\nThe next twenty-four hours will be the difference between stopping Trump and being seen as rigging the game against Trump."}
