He said they would be deployed in the coming days.\n\nA task group of military advisers to assist Iraqi and other security forces fighting the militants would form part of the deployment but Abbott said he had not yet made the decision to commit troops to combat action.\n\n\"I have to warn the Australian people that should this preparation and deployment extend into combat operations, that this could go on for quite some time,\" he told reporters in the northern city of Darwin.\n\nAbbott said Australia did not intend to operate in Syria.\n\nKerry drums up support\n\nObama announced his plans in a prime time address on Wednesday to build an alliance to root out Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq, plunging the United States into two conflicts in which nearly every country in the Middle East has a stake.\n\nObama: Will conduct a 'systematic campaign' of airstrikes\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is touring the Middle East to try to secure backing for the plan, and on Thursday won the backing for a \"coordinated military campaign\" from 10 Arab countries - Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and six Gulf states including rich rivals Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nHowever, a lack of detail on commitments from NATO allies and Turkey's reluctance to play a frontline role have highlighted the difficulty of building a willing coalition for a complex military campaign.\n\nBritain has said it supports U.S. air strikes and Prime Minister David Cameron has said repeatedly that Britain itself has ruled nothing out except combat troops on the ground.\n\nLike Australia, Britain has delivered humanitarian aid, carried out surveillance, given weapons to Kurds and promised training in Iraq.\n\nFrance has confirmed its commitment to use military force in Iraq, but it was unclear whether France would join strikes in Syria. Germany has said it won't take part in air strikes.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Australia became the first country to detail troop numbers and aircraft for a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq, as Washington drums up support for global action to counter the terrorist threat.", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Australia became the first country to detail troop numbers and aircraft for a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq, as Washington drums up support for global action to counter the terrorist threat.", "title": "Australia answers US call to fight Islamic State", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/14/australia-answers-us-call-to-fight-islamic-state.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/14/101998661-Tony_Abbott_Arlington.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Australia became the first country to detail troop numbers and aircraft for a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq, as Washington drums up support for global action to counter the terrorist threat.", "title": "Australia answers US call to fight Islamic State", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/14/australia-answers-us-call-to-fight-islamic-state.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/14/101998661-Tony_Abbott_Arlington.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Middle East Turmoil, Middle East, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-09-14T04:35:09-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Middle East Turmoil", "modified_time": "2014-09-14T04:55:52-0400", "tag": "Middle East"}, "pageNodeId": 101998662, "news_keywords": "australia middle east conflict"}, "article_summary": "Australia became the first country to detail troop numbers and aircraft for a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq, as Washington drums up support for global action to counter the terrorist threat.\nA number of countries have responded to U.S. President Barack Obama's call to join a coalition against Islamic State, but Australia is the first to publicly provide specific troop numbers and military hardware for the mission.\nRead MoreBritish captiveapparently beheaded by ISISAbbott said along with the troops, Australia would send eight super hornet fighter jets, an early warning and control aircraft and an aerial refuelling aircraft.\nAustralia Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Sunday a 600-strong force comprising some 400 airforce personnel and 200 special forces soldiers would be deployed to a U.S. military base in the United Arab Emirates.\nLike Australia, Britain has delivered humanitarian aid, carried out surveillance, given weapons to Kurds and promised training in Iraq."}
