(AP) \u2014 Fitbit, the maker of a popular line of wearable fitness-tracking devices, said Friday that it does not sell personal data to advertisers, contrary to concerns raised by U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company spelled out its privacy policy on its website after Schumer warned of a potential \u201cprivacy nightmare\u201d relating to concerns that the makers of fitness monitoring devices could sell users\u2019 data to advertisers.\n\nSchumer has called for a federal regulation to require companies like Fitbit to let customers prevent their data from being sold. On Friday he praised the company for \u201crevising\u201d its policy, even though Fitbit CEO and co-founder James Park said there\u2019s been no change in the company\u2019s practices.\n\n\u201cIt has always been our policy not to sell user data,\u201d Park said in a statement. \u201cWe have never sold personal data and we do not share personal data unless a user specifically directs us to do so, or under the limited exceptions described in our privacy policy.\u201d\n\nThose exceptions include credit card processing or when the company is under legal obligation to provide the information.\n\nSchumer said there are no federal laws to prevent other companies from sharing personal information from the devices. He called on other manufacturers of wearable devices to follow Fitbit\u2019s lead.\n\nMany Americans wear fitness bracelets and monitors or use mobile apps to monitor their activity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fitbit, the maker of a popular line of wearable fitness-tracking devices, said Friday that it does not sell personal data to advertisers, contrary to concerns raised by U.S. Sen.
