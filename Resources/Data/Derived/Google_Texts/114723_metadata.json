That prompted the full Sanders rap on the wonders of Denmark, including the Nordic country\u2019s strong safety net and egalitarian ethic.\n\nAs a longtime fan of all things Danish, from their bike lanes to their Viking hats, I\u2019m excited to see this northern nation enter the spotlight here at home. While studying abroad in Denmark as a college student, I compared its universal health care system to our own \u2014 and found Denmark\u2019s far superior.\n\nThis was in 2009, a time when this was anything but an academic exercise.\n\nBack home, Congress and the Obama administration were brushing the so-called \u201cpublic option,\u201d which would have given all Americans a chance to steer clear of private insurers, off the table. Progressives were outraged when they realized that the Affordable Care Act wouldn\u2019t bring on anything remotely like Denmark\u2019s single-payer health care system.\n\nUpon returning to the States, I interned for a year at Sanders\u2019 district office in Vermont. After I graduated, I moved to Washington and worked in his Capitol Hill office for three more.\n\nI got to hear Bernie talk about Denmark a lot. I watched as he fought to bring a Danish- style democratic socialism to bear in Congress \u2014 admittedly a hard sell.\n\nThe Scandinavian nation has long served as a model for Bernie\u2019s political ambitions, and for good reason. Not only are Danes among the happiest people on earth, but the country also consistently ranks near the top of Forbes\u2019 list of the world\u2019s best business environments.\n\nIt earns this distinction despite a progressive tax code in which the highest rate tops 60 percent \u2014 and a robust welfare state that ensures access to child care, health care, parental leave, high quality education, and senior care.\n\nCollege students not only get a tuition-free higher education, they get a stipend to cover their living expenses and books. In contrast, American college students get the privilege of $35,000 in average debt.\n\nIf you were looking for a place where democratic socialism appears to be working, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a better example than Denmark. Compared to our country, Denmark has higher wages, less poverty, less inequality, shorter work hours, lower carbon emissions, longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality rates, less unemployment, less depression, less crime, and less suicide. And the list goes on.\n\nColumnist and Nobel winning economist Paul Krugman summed it up the best: \u201cDanes get a lot of things right,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand in so doing refute just about everything U.S. conservatives say about economics.\u201d\n\nOf course, no country is perfect, and policies that work in one place may not prevail in another. Conservative pundits, along with Hillary Clinton, have harped especially on Denmark\u2019s small and largely homogenous population. It\u2019s intrinsically different from the United States, they say.\n\nBut I think there\u2019s plenty that we can learn from seeing Denmark as a model.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s exciting to see our country\u2019s newfound interest in Denmark. The Boston Globe published competing columns praising and criticizing the country, and The New York Times held the Danish system up to scrutiny in its popular Room For Debate section.\n\nSo far, no one\u2019s saying much about Danish cuisine, but they should. Think ball-shaped pancakes called aebleskiver that could be the next cronut.\n\nWhile I doubt Americans will embrace the Danes\u2019 love for pickled fish, I\u2019m hopeful we might connect the dots between their successful social outcomes and their progressive public policies. Perhaps, as Bernie Sanders has been advocating for decades, we might even decide to put some of those lessons into practice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you were looking for a place where democratic socialism appears to be working, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a better example than Denmark.", "og": {"site_name": "Foreign Policy In Focus", "description": "If you were looking for a place where democratic socialism appears to be working, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a better example than Denmark.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Has America Talking About Denmark.
