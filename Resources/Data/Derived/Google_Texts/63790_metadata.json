Increasingly, nurses work in team-based care, in which accountable care organizations or assisted living facilities aim to improve outcomes for patients and increase the quality of care overall.\n\nCase management jobs and ambulatory care practices are seen as preferable positions over hospital jobs, RN Work Project Co-director Christine Kovner told Forbes.
