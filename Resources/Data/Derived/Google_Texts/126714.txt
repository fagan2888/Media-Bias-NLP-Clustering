Ebola in NYC! Chaos! Doom! Hysteria! Hashtags!

Late Thursday, New York City officials confirmed that a doctor recently returned to the city from treating Ebola patients in West Africa has tested positive for the virus. The internet, a place where serious things are not taken seriously and unserious things are taken very seriously, was a bit confused about how to react. On the one hand, panic! On the other hand, #ironic #detachment!

Into this whirlwind jumped Nick Muzin, Sen. Ted Cruz's deputy chief of staff:

The internet was unsure if this not very funny joke was a joke or not and ran with it as though it were serious because the truth is conservatives do seem to blame quite a lot on Obamacare, but then the tweet was deleted and followed up with:

Earlier tweet was a bad joke, my sarcasm did not translate well online. Deleted. — Nick Muzin (@nickmuzin) October 24, 2014

I would personally like the record to reflect that though I wasn't sure if it was a joke and didn't find it particularly funny, I'd die for Nick Muzin's right to tweet his joke.

Have a great night.
