Some parents will expect you to clean their house in addition to taking care of their kids. If the kids are napping while I'm at a house, I don't feel comfortable just sitting there the whole time, so I offer to help with the baby bottles or do the baby's laundry. But one mom would literally leave me a list. She would ask me to hang-dry her clothes, put a load in the wash, cook full meals, and vacuum the whole house upstairs and downstairs. It got a little uncomfortable for me when she asked me to do that, because I'm here all day to work for her kids, not clean her house.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n2. Don't worry about how your outfit looks. I always wear T-shirts that are comfortable, and I choose not to show cleavage because kids usually tug at your shirt. And it's essential to wear jeans you can easily move around in because you're getting up and down from sitting on the floor playing with the kids. I also opt to not wear makeup to work and to wear my hair in a bun because you deal with getting boogers, drool, and food thrown or spat out on your face. You spend most the time in the house, so in reality, no one sees you but the kids.\n\n3. The more you know, the more you get paid. The pay is pretty much dependent on your education and your experience working with children. I've been doing this for six years, and I've taken enough college courses in early childhood development to qualify for a teacher's assistant permit in California, which certifies me to work in a daycare. I also have a paraeducators license. That certification comes from taking and passing a test for a certain school district, which then allows you to be a teacher's aid in that school district you applied for it in. It's definitely worth it to get these certifications because the applications only require a small fee, and you can take the college credits at a community college. I tell parents I have these skills when I'm applying for nannying positions, so I can charge what would be considered the higher pay scale of $15 to $20 an hour for the San Francisco Bay Area, versus a lower rate of $10 or less an hour. If you're going to be alone caring for a child for 10 hours a day, the parents wants to be confident that their kid isn't going to be sitting around watching TV. Since they're not choosing a daycare, they want to be sure you know how to do educational things, like flash cards, reading, or teaching baby sign language.\n\n4. Being paid under-the-table can have negative consequences. Nannying is pretty much all under-the-table work, so I rarely file any taxes while I'm working this job. I've only paid taxes on the few positions I've had in childcare that have allowed me to. The majority of families that I've worked with have paid me under-the-table because if they claim a certain amount that they pay me, then they'll have to pay taxes on that, and it ends up being a loss for them. The family [I currently work for] and I aren't too worried about getting caught, though, because this is just how it is for nearly everyone in childcare. I've never sat down and thought about [the legality]. But it can be really difficult if I go and try to apply for a credit card, loan, or mortgage because it seems like I haven't been working for a while even though I do make a good income and work a lot of hours. Luckily, I've qualified for store credit cards like Kohl's and worked myself up from there by establishing credit. But larger loans are harder, so I had to get a co-signer for my car.\n\n5. Don't expect to get insurance through work. I don't really go to the doctor ever, because this is not the type of job that comes with insurance benefits. I have to pay for any medical costs out of pocket. Depending on the job my husband has at the time, I can be covered by his health insurance, but it can be a little more expensive so we usually opt out. I haven't looked into the Affordable Care Act. It can be stressful not having a normal job where they take care of you if something goes wrong, but hopefully I'll eventually have a job in childcare that does offer those types of benefits.\n\n6. You will get more emotionally attached to the kids than you think. The hardest part of this job is your last day working for a family that no longer needs you. You have to say good-bye to the kids you might have been with since they were 2 months old. You get to see them grow, you see them eat their first real foods, you see them take their first steps, celebrate their first birthday. Whenever it's my last day with a family, I try not to cry in order to keep it professional. But you just can't help it when you're with these kids every day and then all of a sudden, you're not going to see them anymore.\n\n7. Rude parents will make your job even harder. It's difficult to work in a place where the parents are using bad words in front of the children or are generally impolite. When I'm with the kids, I'm always smiling, I'm teaching them to say please and thank you, and I never use foul language. It can be confusing for the kids to see their parents acting one way when I'm trying to teach their children the opposite.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/30/160x160/square-1437678464-nanny1.jpg", "description": "You'll make a lot more money if you take college classes in education.", "title": "13 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Became a Nanny", "og": {"site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "description": "You'll make a lot more money if you take college classes in education.", "title": "13 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Became a Nanny", "url": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/a43465/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-became-a-nanny/", "image": {"url": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/30/1600x800/landscape-1437678464-nanny1.jpg", "width": 1600, "identifier": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/30/1600x800/landscape-1437678464-nanny1.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "image": {"src": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/30/1437678464-nanny1.jpg"}, "description": "You'll make a lot more money if you take college classes in education.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "13 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Became a Nanny"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-24T10:00:00-04:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "13 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Became a Nanny", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951817550, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteCosmo&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.tags": "Career, nanny,babysitting,career advice", "keywords": "nanny,babysitting,career advice", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "section": "Career", "published_time": "2015-07-24 02:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16 20:11:30"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/30/768x384/landscape-1437678464-nanny1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "When I'm with the kids, I'm always smiling, I'm teaching them to say please and thank you, and I never use foul language.\nThe hardest part of this job is your last day working for a family that no longer needs you.\nNannying is pretty much all under-the-table work, so I rarely file any taxes while I'm working this job.\nI always wear T-shirts that are comfortable, and I choose not to show cleavage because kids usually tug at your shirt.\nBut you just can't help it when you're with these kids every day and then all of a sudden, you're not going to see them anymore."}
