It may seem like a stretch to compare the Republican presidential front-runner to the most evil person of the 20th century, but if you really think about it, it\u2019s not really that far a stretch. Sure, Trump hasn\u2019t really done anything truly evil yet. He hasn\u2019t implemented another Holocaust or plunged us into a world war.\n\nRight now, he\u2019s just a racist, xenophobic loudmouth. But if you were to stop and really look at the methods used by Hitler to gain power and the methods currently being used by Trump, you would see that they\u2019re not all that different. Consider:\n\n\u2022Both men have racism at the core of their ideology: For Hitler, it was the Jews. For Trump, it is Mexicans and Muslims. Hitler blamed the Jews for every ill that plagued Germany following World War I. Similarly, Trump has demonized Mexicans, calling them \u201crapists and murderers.\u201d He has called for a ban on Muslims coming to the U.S. and proposed the creation of a Muslim registry. Hitler required all Jews to wear a Star of David. How is the proposed registry any different?\n\n\u2022Both Hitler and Trump promised to make their countries \u201cgreat again:\u201d Now, it\u2019s true there are some stark differences between post-World War I Germany and modern America. Our economy isn\u2019t in shambles, for one thing, and our currency isn\u2019t worthless, for another. But Hitler played off the anger of his electorate. He took advantage of the feeling among Germans that Germany had become weak and had lost the world\u2019s respect. Trump is doing the same thing. And like Hitler, he has positioned himself as the \u201csavior,\u201d the only person capable of restoring his country to its former glory.\n\n\u2022Both men believe in torture: The entire world knows about the atrocities committed by Hitler and the Nazis. But Trump has also said he supports the use of water boarding and other forms of torture, and has promised to bring them back if elected \u201cbecause it works.\u201d Enough said.\n\n\u2022Hitler couldn\u2019t stand criticism or any opposing voices. Neither can Trump: To deal with this problem, Hitler had Joseph Goebbels and his propaganda ministry, which controlled every bit of information fed to the German people. For his part, Trump has said that if he gets elected, he will seek to rewrite this nation\u2019s libel laws, to make it easier for politicians to sue the media. This goes against decades of Supreme Court precedent, which has sought to protect the media. It also insults both the spirit and intent of the First Amendment, which guarantees a free press. A free and healthy press is essential to a thriving democracy, and there can be only one purpose for Trump\u2019s promise to rewrite libel laws: to intimidate the media and silence opposition. That, more than any other, is the mark of a dictator.\n\n\u2022Hitler had his soldiers swear an oath of loyalty to him. Trump is doing the same thing: Recent video has shown Trump asking his supporters to swear to turn out and vote for him. Granted, it\u2019s not exactly the same thing as having soldiers swear undying loyalty to the point of death, but given everything else we\u2019ve seen from Trump, it\u2019s still a disturbing picture.\n\nDonald Trump is an egomaniacal windbag, a man with no moral center or core beliefs of his own. While it may seem a stretch to compare him to Hitler \u2013 especially before we see what he would do as president \u2013 I believe it would be foolish not to take note of the striking, and very real, similarities between the two men.\n\nOf course, we can continue to ignore what\u2019s right in front of us, but we do so at our own peril.\n\nPeter Watson lives in Shreveport.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/2016/04/08/similarities-donald-trump-hitler-truly-striking/82806958/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Is Donald Trump the modern-day Adolf Hitler?
