Since 2010, two years after the election of the nation\u2019s first black president, at least 16 states have tightened up requirements for voting despite critics\u2019 contention that the new laws are aimed at curbing the African-American vote. Here is your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in less than 180 seconds or your next one is free.\n\nUrban Non-Renewal: The unrest in Baltimore has put the problems of urban America \u2013 blight, unemployment, racial inequality \u2013 on the national political agenda and the platform for the 2016 presidential race. Hillary Clinton has called for a renewed federal investment in cities, but Republicans largely blame the federal government for coddling poor people. No surprise, actually: Dem voters tend to be city-dwellers while GOP voters generally are in suburban and rural areas, giving the party little incentive to talk about the needs of the needy.\n\nFollow the Money, or Lack Thereof: The flip side of that debate, however, was exemplified on CNN Wednesday morning, when host Chris Cuomo challenged Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat whose district includes Baltimore. Cuomo asked Cummings whether Republicans were right: that because Dems have run Charm City for decades and because Maryland\u2019s a blue state, they have to own the Freddie Gray riots. But Cummings rejected the connection, insisting that decades of GOP-led austerity measures at the federal level cut off the spigot for programs that would have helped Gray and other residents rise up out of poverty", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing: Dems Reject Baltimore Blame Game While GOP Sees Black Helicopters Approaching Texas", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Walker maintains while Jeb fades in Iowa, Hillary runs left on immigration and Elizabeth flirts with the Draft Warren movement, sort of.", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing: Dems Reject Baltimore Blame Game While GOP Sees Black Helicopters Approaching Texas", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/05/06/three-minute-briefing-dems-reject-baltimore-blame-game-while-gop-sees-black-helicopters-approaching-texas", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/de/5e/2762f2f24755a0bfd96f775f4687/150506-baltimore-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Walker maintains while Jeb fades in Iowa, Hillary runs left on immigration and Elizabeth flirts with the Draft Warren movement, sort of.", "card": "summary", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing: Dems Reject Baltimore Blame Game While GOP Sees Black Helicopters Approaching Texas"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "May 6, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
