YouTube/ WhatsUpMoms\n\nA few California moms decided to make the best of their pregnancy pains for so many in the form of a rap. The group, \"What\u2019s Up Moms?,\" posted a parody of the song \u201cFancy\u201d by Iggy Azalea, called \u201cI\u2019m So Pregnant.\"\n\nThe featured mom on the video is Meg, who is expecting to give birth next week. In fact, it'll be baby number three. \"Baby don't kick me, I might just go pee-pee. I'm sick of the waiting. I just want some sushi,\" Meg raps.\n\nThe moms had originally started their channel to share their tips and advice for other moms, but as they told the NY Daily News, they\u2019ve now begun making funnier videos. \"We realized moms need a good laugh apparently since people are watching them,\" said Elle Walker, co-founder of the group.\n\nThe team cut it close with filming when Meg was 38 weeks pregnant. \"We had a blast. It was a really great time and hopefully that comes across with the video,\" Walker said. \"Meg was a total trooper. However, we were a little concerned during the middle of the shoot we would lose our star. We told her you can't go into labor during this or we will finish it at the hospital. We can't let our video be half finished.\"\n\nThe girls say they wanted to share the message that being pregnant does have its downfalls, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re stuck in a rut. \u201cYou can be a mom or be pregnant and still have a really good time with your friends,\u201d Walker said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "i'm so pregnant, iggy azalea", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Moms rap about the challenges of being pregnant in this parody on Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy.\"", "title": "This 'I'm So Pregnant' Parody Is Hilarious And Pretty Accurate [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/im-so-pregnant-parody-iggy-azaleas-fancy-hilarious-still-describes-pregnancy-pain-accurately-287614", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/im-so-pregnant-parody_0.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Moms rap about the challenges of being pregnant in this parody on Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy.\"", "title": "This 'I'm So Pregnant' Parody Is Hilarious And Pretty Accurate [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/im-so-pregnant-parody-iggy-azaleas-fancy-hilarious-still-describes-pregnancy-pain-accurately-287614", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/im-so-pregnant-parody_0.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/im-so-pregnant-parody_0.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-10T18:16:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T18:17:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Moms rap about the challenges of being pregnant in this parody on Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy.\""}, "article_summary": "The group, \"What\u2019s Up Moms?,\" posted a parody of the song \u201cFancy\u201d by Iggy Azalea, called \u201cI\u2019m So Pregnant.\"\nMoms rap about the challenges of being pregnant in this hilarious video that gives pretty accurate info, too.\nIt was a really great time and hopefully that comes across with the video,\" Walker said.\n\u201cYou can be a mom or be pregnant and still have a really good time with your friends,\u201d Walker said.\nYouTube/ WhatsUpMomsA few California moms decided to make the best of their pregnancy pains for so many in the form of a rap."}
