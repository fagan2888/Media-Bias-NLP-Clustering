Kansas City's Marcus Peters is the first cornerback in 17 years to win The Associated Press NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award.

Peters, a first-round selection (18th overall) out of Washington, was a key to the Chiefs' 11-game winning streak this season that helped them to the divisional playoff round. He tied Cincinnati's Reggie Nelson for the NFL lead with eight interceptions. Peters returned two for scores, one covering 90 yards. He also had a pick in the postseason.

That performance earned Peters 45 votes from a nationwide panel of 50 sports writers and broadcasters who regularly cover the NFL. Buffalo CB Ronald Darby was next with four votes, and one ballot went to Jets lineman Leonard Williams.

Oakland's Charles Woodson was the previous cornerback to win the award, which was presented Saturday night as part of NFL Honors.
