It worked: pointing toward a neighbor\u2019s house, Briggs explained what happened next.\n\n\u201cAnd he laid that bike over about here and slid all the way to that pickup. He got up, run around that fence right there and I just went after him.\u201d\n\nThe beer-bellied, middle-aged man wasn\u2019t able to give chase for long, however.\n\n\u201cI was running out of steam very quick. I\u2019m not very aerodynamic.\u201d\n\nFortunately, Chickasha police were there waiting for the fleeing motorcycle driver to run right into their arms.\n\nIt turns out the motorcycle driver, identified as Michael Coppedge, was fleeing for the most ridiculous of reasons: he didn\u2019t have his driver\u2019s license or insurance. Briggs didn\u2019t find that a very compelling reason to flee and put innocent lives at risk.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a serious thing right there \u2026 you get a ticket, slap on the hand, pay your fine, and go fix your problem.\u201d\n\nCoppedge was arrested and charged with eluding a police officer, and leaving the scene of an accident involving damage. Both are misdemeanors in Oklahoma, according to Kania Law Firm, and both faces penalties of up to a year in jail and fines of up to $500 for leaving the scene of an accident, and up to $1,000 for eluding.\n\nEver the gentleman, Floyd Briggs told a reporter that he wanted to make sure that his neighbors who witnessed his takedown heard his apology for the language he used during the incident.\n\n\u201cI did use some language that just isn\u2019t how I talk \u2026 Some of the words I used, I was pretty worked up. I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d\n\nNeither the fleeing motorcycle driver nor the concerned citizen who stopped him were injured in the accident.\n\n[Image courtesy of KFOR]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A high-speed game of chicken between a motorcycle driver fleeing police and a concerned citizen in Chickasha, Oklahoma, ended with the concerned citizen in the", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "A high-speed game of chicken between a motorcycle driver fleeing police and a concerned citizen in Chickasha, Oklahoma, ended with the concerned citizen in the", "title": "Chickasha, Oklahoma: Concerned Citizen Stops Fleeing Motorcycle With His Body", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2050296/chickasha-oklahoma-concerned-citizen-stops-fleeing-motorcycle-with-his-body/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chickasha-Motorcycle-Chase.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-28T16:52:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-28T18:26:03+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chickasha-Motorcycle-Chase.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-04-28T16:52:31+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "chickasha,concerned citizen,high speed chase,oklahoma,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chickasha-Motorcycle-Chase.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A high-speed game of chicken between a motorcycle driver fleeing police and a concerned citizen in Chickasha, Oklahoma, ended with the concerned citizen in the"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a4f\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201dNeither the fleeing motorcycle driver nor the concerned citizen who stopped him were injured in the accident.\nA high-speed game of chicken between a motorcycle driver fleeing police and a concerned citizen in Chickasha, Oklahoma, ended with the concerned citizen in the Win column, KFOR (Oklahoma City) is reporting.\nI\u2019m not very aerodynamic.\u201dFortunately, Chickasha police were there waiting for the fleeing motorcycle driver to run right into their arms.\nFloyd Briggs says that he had seen the fleeing motorcycle driver tear through residential streets at speeds up to 60 miles per hour before he decided he\u2019d seen enough.\nIt turns out the motorcycle driver, identified as Michael Coppedge, was fleeing for the most ridiculous of reasons: he didn\u2019t have his driver\u2019s license or insurance."}
