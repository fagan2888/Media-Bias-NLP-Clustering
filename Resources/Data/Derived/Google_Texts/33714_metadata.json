In the last two days, more than 25 people reported receiving a call from someone pretending to be a Madison police officer.\n\nThe fake officer tells the person they have an outstanding warrant, and must pay a fine or an officer will come to take them to jail.\n\nEven more troubling, the call shows up on caller ID as a Madison Police number.\n\n\"We're concerned that we don't want people to be victimized,\" said Officer Howard Payne, spokesman for Madison Police. \"An unsuspecting person may see something on their caller ID and feel like it's legitimate.\"\n\nPayne said officers would never contact anyone over the phone about a warrant.\n\nA number of software programs allow people to dictate what name and number comes up on caller ID. It's fairly common and easy to do, according to tech expert Jones Kennedy, with Madison Geeks.\n\nHe suggests people use apps like Trap Call, which provide you with the actual number calling.\n\n\"They can help you out and actually figure out what these numbers are by contacting the providers,\" he said.\n\nAnyone with information on the police impersonation scam is asked to contact your local law enforcement office. Details such as what the caller sounded like, what they said, how much money they asked for, can all help officers with the investigation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the last two days, more than 25 people reported receiving a call from someone pretending to be a Madison police officer.", "language": "english", "author": "Christy Dimond", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/Madison-Police-warn-of-police-impersonation-scam-265779241.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/560*315/madison+police3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In the last two days, more than 25 people reported receiving a call from someone pretending to be a Madison police officer.", "title": "Madison Police warn of police impersonation scam"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the last two days, more than 25 people reported receiving a call from someone pretending to be a Madison police officer.", "title": "Madison Police warn of police impersonation scam", "url": "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/Madison-Police-warn-of-police-impersonation-scam-265779241.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/560*315/madison+police3.jpg", "creator": "@nbc15_madison", "site": "@nbc15_madison", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Madison Police warn of police impersonation scam", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "nVn1exeOti1r4o5YNXcCBEDU1eFrVztxyWcqAwhz9WA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Madison Police warn of police"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda638\"", "article_summary": "Posted: Thursday, July 3, 2014 -- 9:15 p.m.Madison Police are warning about a phone scam involving their agency.\nEven more troubling, the call shows up on caller ID as a Madison Police number.\nIn the last two days, more than 25 people reported receiving a call from someone pretending to be a Madison police officer.\nAnyone with information on the police impersonation scam is asked to contact your local law enforcement office.\nA number of software programs allow people to dictate what name and number comes up on caller ID."}
