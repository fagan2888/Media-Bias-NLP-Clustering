Sometimes it\u2019s like the New Orleans brass, jazzy side of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll,\u201d a meeting of the musical forms he likens to Phish-meets-Parliament Funkadelic.\n\nHe also lists The Band, John Prine, Michael Jackson and David Bowie among his musical heroes.\n\nThe band\u2019s most recent album, \u201cDance,\u201d serves up reggae- and jazz-influenced cuts such as \u201cGreyhound Station\u201d and the unspellable \u201cLobstamandaughta.\u201d Mr. Timmons and his crew also paid homage to one of their many influences on the album, covering Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cFool in the Rain.\u201d\n\nMr. Timmons met Sol Driven Train saxophonist Russell Clarke in middle school, where they played together in local bands. As the pair began to think they might have a shot at making music full-time, they joined up with bassist Matt Thompson, guitarist Ward Buckheister and keyboard Ross Bogan to form their good-time quintet.\n\nAlthough the members of Sol Driven Train are used to taking the express out onto the road, they still call Charleston home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to that public school music education that encouraged us to play music and follow our dreams,\u201d Mr. Timmons said of their salad days.\n\nHe said it is one of many reasons the band still calls Charleston home.\n\n\u201cWe love the beach, we love downtown, we love pretty girls,\u201d he said of the port town, whose harbor was the site of the opening shots of the Civil War in 1861 when rebel cannons fired upon Fort Sumter and forced its surrender. \u201cWe like the diverse music scene here [and] all sorts of different bands that are constantly collaborating and informing each other about how it\u2019s supposed to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also love the food,\u201d Mr. Clarke said.\n\nMr. Buckheister relates that even as a professional musician, he still gets star-struck. He recalls once \u201cpurposely\u201d tripping and falling into guitar great G.E. Smith, who played with Bob Dylan and Paul Simon and was the bandleader of the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d house ensemble from 1985 to 1995. Mr. Buckheister maintains that his pratfall ruse was done simply \u201cso I could touch him.\u201d\n\nWith their 12 albums and a full tour schedule, the lads have managed a following beyond their hometown. Their current road trip brings them to Gypsy Sally\u2019s in the District on Wednesday, a first time for them at that venue.\n\n\u201cD.C. is an awesome city,\u201d Mr. Timmons said. \u201cI love to eat the food there, the variety of different ethnic cuisines,\u201d he said \u2014 the epicurean curiosity a seeming through-line in the band\u2019s mindset. \u201cI\u2019m also just a sucker for the museums,\u201d Mr. Timmons said.\n\nMr. Timmons promises that the crowd at Gypsy Sally\u2019s will be as thankful for the band\u2019s onstage energy as the band is gracious for the fans who come out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s guaranteed to be a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cWe enjoy what we do, and we try to project that out into the crowd. We\u2019ll be playing music off \u201cDance,\u201d which is designed to encourage people to do just that.\u201d\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHAT:Sol Driven Train with Front Country\n\nWHERE: Gypsy Sally\u2019s, 3401 K St. NW, Washington, D.C., 20007\n\nWHEN: Wednesday, 8:30 p.m.\n\nINFO: Tickets $12 to $15; call 202/333-7700 or visit GypsySallys.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charleston, South Carolina, may be known as the Holy City because of its plethora of antebellum churches, but the members of homegrown rock band Sol Driven Train have made a name for themselves by raising an entirely different kind of beautiful noise than the city's bevy of chancel choirs.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Charleston, South Carolina, may be known as the Holy City because of its plethora of antebellum churches, but the members of homegrown rock band Sol Driven Train have made a name for themselves by raising an entirely different kind of beautiful noise than the city\u2019s bevy of chancel choirs.", "title": "Sol Driven Train rock band takes unique sound blends on tour, calls South Carolina home", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/12/sol-driven-train-rock-band-takes-unique-sound-blen/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/12/sol_driven_train2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/12/sol_driven_train2.jpg", "description": "Charleston, South Carolina, may be known as the Holy City because of its plethora of antebellum churches, but the members of homegrown rock band Sol Driven Train have made a name for themselves by rai", "card": "summary", "title": "Sol Driven Train rock band takes unique sound blends on tour, calls So"}, "Author": "Eric Althoff", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Joel Timmons, Sol Driven Train, Charleston, Ward Buckheister"}, "article_summary": "Although the members of Sol Driven Train are used to taking the express out onto the road, they still call Charleston home.\n\u201cI\u2019m also just a sucker for the museums,\u201d Mr. Timmons said.\nCharleston, South Carolina, may be known as the Holy City because of its plethora of antebellum churches, but the members of homegrown rock band Sol Driven Train have made a name for themselves by raising an entirely different kind of beautiful noise than the city\u2019s bevy of chancel choirs.\nis an awesome city,\u201d Mr. Timmons said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to that public school music education that encouraged us to play music and follow our dreams,\u201d Mr. Timmons said of their salad days."}
