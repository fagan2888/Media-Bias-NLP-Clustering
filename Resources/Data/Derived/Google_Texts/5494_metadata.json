There are 521 gas cylinders ahead of his, and not even the dealer knows when more fuel will arrive, thanks to a two-month-long border blockade that shows no sign of ending.\n\n\u201cI sent my wife and child back to our village home because we don\u2019t have the gas to cook,\u201d said Parwar, whose roadside candy stall is shuttered while he waits. \u201cI have been eating in restaurants with borrowed money but that too has run out. I have no option but to wait in line.\u201d\n\nAn ethnic group\u2019s blockade of a key border point with India is leaving Nepal with only about 15 percent of its normal supply of gasoline, diesel and cooking fuel, and creating shortages of other goods including food and medicine.\n\nThe group\u2019s dispute with the government is part of the political dysfunction that has held back development and even prevented the adoption of a constitution for nearly a decade. Now it is threatening lives as hundreds of thousands of people, many of them displaced by Nepal\u2019s devastating spring earthquakes, face the winter without fuel, secure housing and many essential goods.\n\n\u201cWe are all suffering. Prices of food have gone up and there is shortage of many things here,\u201d Parwar said in Kathmandu, the capital. \u201cIt is the common people who are suffering. The rich and the leaders are getting the fuel and gas and living comfortably.\u201d\n\nA look at Nepal\u2019s crisis through the eyes of those close to the dispute, and others who are struggling with its consequences:\n\n___\n\nTHE MADHESIS\u2019 COMPLAINT\n\nMembers of the Madhesi ethnic group in south and southeast Nepal are blockading the border to protest Nepal\u2019s new constitution, which was adopted in September after years of infighting. The group wants a larger Madhesi province and more seats in Parliament than they have been given.\n\nMadhesi protesters have clashed with police, attacked public vehicles and shut down highways. At least 50 protesters, police and bystanders have died in the violence.\n\nUpendra Yadav, a leading Madhesi protest leader, blames the government for ignoring their demands and using excessive force to crush peaceful demonstrations.\n\n\u201cJust last week the government sent their goons to disrupt our mass gathering, burning down the stage and chasing our supporters,\u201d Yadav said.\n\nThe Madhesis have held talks with government negotiators at least nine times but have not reached any agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are very clear with our demands,\u201d Yadav said, accusing the government of failing to present a clear agenda.\n\n___\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT\u2019S RESPONSE\n\nThe coalition government led by Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli took office after the protests began with promises it would resolve the conflict, but two months later, a solution is nowhere in sight.\n\nThe government has said it\u2019s ready to make changes to the constitution but has said little about protesters\u2019 demands for a bigger province. The Himalayan country has more than 100 ethnic groups, and while the Madhesi are among the largest, making up about a fifth of Nepal\u2019s 30 million people, there are fears that a deal to end the blockade could set off protests elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe fear that giving more land to the Madhesi province and making changes to the state boundaries could trigger new conflicts in the country,\u201d said Pradip Gyawali, secretary of the ruling Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist). Gyawali said any such changes would require detailed research and agreement among the main political parties.\n\n___\n\nA TENT FOR WINTER\n\nSundari Lama was forced to live in a tent this spring after her house was destroyed in the April earthquake that killed nearly 9,000 people. She eventually moved into an apartment, but now she\u2019s back in the tent, this time because of the blockade.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With lives at risk, Nepal struggles to escape dysfunction", "author": "Binaj Gurubacharya", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With lives at risk, Nepal struggles to escape dysfunction", "title": "With lives at risk, Nepal struggles to escape dysfunction", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/05/with_lives_at_risk_nepal_struggles_to_escape_dysfunction/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/nepal-disastrous-dysfunction.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With lives at risk, Nepal struggles to escape dysfunction", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/nepal-disastrous-dysfunction.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "With lives at risk, Nepal struggles to escape dysfunction", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "With lives at risk, Nepal struggles to escape dysfunction", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The group wants a larger Madhesi province and more seats in Parliament than they have been given.\nMadhesi protesters have clashed with police, attacked public vehicles and shut down highways.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsKATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) \u2014 Shiva Parwar has been camping on the pavement for five days, waiting in line for cooking gas.\nShe eventually moved into an apartment, but now she\u2019s back in the tent, this time because of the blockade.\nUpendra Yadav, a leading Madhesi protest leader, blames the government for ignoring their demands and using excessive force to crush peaceful demonstrations."}
