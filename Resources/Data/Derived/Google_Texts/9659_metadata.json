They both died of wounds sustained during the raid.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.\n\nThe 40 commandos from the elite Seal Team 6 were discovered after an al Qaeda guard left the compound to relieve himself, according to ABC News.\n\nEven so, Rep. Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said he agreed with the Obama administration for attempting the rescue effort.\n\n\u201cI do think it was the right decision to actually engage and try to go in for the rescue attempt,\u201d Mr. Rogers said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cNobody can do it better than our special forces community. It doesn\u2019t always go perfectly. That\u2019s always the risk.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe information was obviously good, the intelligence was good. Unfortunately, in something like this, they do try to prevent that, they being the terrorists who are holding these hostages. They\u2019re trying to set up a perimeter to stop it, and unfortunately that\u2019s what they ran into.\u201d\n\nAbout 40 American special operations forces were involved in the rescue attempt, which followed U.S. drone strikes in the area, U.S. officials said.\n\nFollowing a firefight with militants, the rescuers eventually reached the men and found them alive but gravely wounded. They both died shortly after.\n\nOn Thursday, al Qaeda released a video showing Mr. Somers and threatening to kill him in three days if the U.S. did not meet the group\u2019s unspecified demands.\n\nIn South Africa, Mr. Korkie\u2019s body is expected to arrive from Yemen on Monday, according to a government statement issued Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe South African government sends deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Korkie for their loss. Condolences are also conveyed to the family and loved ones of the deceased American hostage,\u201d said the government statement.\n\nMr. Korkie\u2019s widow, Yolande, and their two children have gone to a secluded place to grieve, said family friend Daan Nortier.\n\n\u201cYolande and the children are at a safe place and the family is being helped by counselors,\u201d said Mr. Nortier.\n\nLater in the day in the capital, Sanaa, gunmen at a funeral opened fire on a tribal leader aligned with ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh, killing three of his bodyguards and wounding him, security officials said.\n\nSheikh Sagheer Bin Aziz was involved in fighting against Shiite Houthi rebels in 2010, who have since taken control of Sanaa. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters, said they believe Houthis were behind the attack.\n\nSeparately, gunmen believed to be from al Qaeda fought with government troops in the southern city of Houta, killing one soldier and wounding three as they attempted to take control of government buildings but failed, the officials said.\n\n\u2981 This story is based in part on wire service reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The raid to rescue hostages held by terrorist forces in Yemen failed largely because U.S. commandos lost the element of surprise, an analyst said Sunday.", "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The raid to rescue hostages held by terrorist forces in Yemen failed largely because U.S. commandos lost the element of surprise, an analyst said Sunday.", "title": "U.S. Yemen raid failed due to lack of surprise", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/us-commando-raid-yemen-failed-due-lack-surprise/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/jolly-rogers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/jolly-rogers.jpg", "title": "U.S. Yemen raid failed due to lack of surprise", "description": "The raid to rescue hostages held by terrorist forces in Yemen failed largely because U.S. commandos lost the element of surprise, an analyst said Sunday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, al Qaeda, Yemen, Pierre Korkie"}, "article_summary": "The high-risk, U.S. led raid to rescue hostages held by terrorist forces in Yemen failed largely because U.S. commandos lost the element of surprise, an analyst said Sunday.\nThe 40 commandos from the elite Seal Team 6 were discovered after an al Qaeda guard left the compound to relieve himself, according to ABC News.\nMatthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said the operation was \u201cdangerous and risky,\u201d adding that al Qaeda operatives were on the lookout after an earlier failed rescue attempt.\nIn South Africa, Mr. Korkie\u2019s body is expected to arrive from Yemen on Monday, according to a government statement issued Sunday.\nOn Thursday, al Qaeda released a video showing Mr. Somers and threatening to kill him in three days if the U.S. did not meet the group\u2019s unspecified demands."}
