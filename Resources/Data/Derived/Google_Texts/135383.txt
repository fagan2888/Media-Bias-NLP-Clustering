GOP candidates in the race for the White House are bringing their campaigns to Central Florida. They're speaking at the Sunshine Summit.



The issues include health care, immigration and the military. Seven candidates spoke on Friday, but the focus seemed to be on the top five, including Ted Cruz.



Marco Rubio spoke of having a moral foreign policy, one of trust, and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.

"If we do what needs to be done, that American dream will reach more people than ever before, and the 21st century won't just be as good as the 20th, it will be better," Rubio said.

In front of the crowd of roughly 2,000, Jeb Bush said he's the one to lead America's armies.

"Should I be president, I promise you I won't be a divider in chief. I wont be an agitator in chief. I'll be a commander in chief because that's what we need," Bush said.

Donald Trump talked about building a wall on the United States/Mexican border, and giving jobs to legal citizens.

"We're going to hire Americans first. We're going to take care of Americans. You ever hear of the Dream Act? The Dream Act isn't for our children. The Dream Act is for other children that come into the country. I want the Dream Act to be for our children," Trump said.

Ben Carson said if he wanted to ruin the country, he would run it exactly how it's being run now, and said he can do it better.

"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will tell you that it's because of the rich. It is not because of the rich. It's because of these asinine policies that are not allowing our economy to expand," Carson said.



With day one in the books, day two kicks off at Rosen Shingle Creek on Saturday morning, where another batch of Republican presidential hopefuls will take to the stage, trying to get the vote.
