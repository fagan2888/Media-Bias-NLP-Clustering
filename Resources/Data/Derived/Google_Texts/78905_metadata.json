A male survivor was pulled out conscious from the sixth floor section of the folded 17-story building, according to a notice posted at a rescue information center on site.\n\nRescuers also found signs of life from a 28-year-old woman who is a migrant worker and an 8-year-old girl, both conscious but trapped in the fifth-floor section.\n\nMore than 100 people are believed to be still buried in the collapsed building from a disaster that struck during the most important family holiday in the Chinese calendar \u2014 the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nThe government in Tainan, the worst-hit city, said that more than 170 people had been rescued from the 17-story building, which folded like an accordion after the quake struck.\n\nThe death toll from Saturday's powerful 6.4-magnitude quake in south Taiwan stood at 36. Thirty-four of those were from the building collapse in Tainan city, and two other people died elsewhere in the city.\n\nRescuers said Tsao was found under the body of her husband, who had shielded her from a collapsed beam, Taiwan's government-run Central News Agency reported. Her husband and 2-year-son were found dead, while five members of her family remained unaccounted for, it said.\n\nEarthquakes frequently rattle Taiwan, but most are minor and cause little or no damage, though a magnitude-7.6 quake in central Taiwan in 1999 killed more than 2,300 people.\n\nThe spectacular fall of the high-rise, built in 1989, raised questions about whether its construction had been shoddy. Tainan's government said the building had not been listed as a dangerous structure, and Taiwan's interior minister, Chen Wei-zen, said an investigation would examine whether the developer had cut corners.\n\nThe extended Lunar New Year holiday officially started Monday, but celebrations were subdued and both President Ma Ying-jeou and President-elect Tsai Ing-wen canceled the handing out of envelopes of cash in their hometowns, a holiday tradition for Taiwan's leader.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Louise Watt and news assistant Henry Hou in Beijing, and Christopher Bodeen in Qingdao, China, contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Survivors pulled out from building 2 days after Taiwan quake - AP News: TAINAN, Taiwan (AP) \u2014 Two survivors \u2014 one found shielded .05/27/2016 8:12:35AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "TAINAN, Taiwan (AP) \u2014 Two survivors \u2014 one found shielded under the body of her", "title": "AP News - Survivors pulled out from building 2 days after Taiwan quake", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/02/07/taiwan-rescuers-find-signs-of-life-in-quake-rubble-n2115999", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\37\\a06ee920-4c46-4eee-b67a-04756679e605.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "TAINAN, Taiwan (AP) \u2014 Two survivors \u2014 one found shielded under the body of her", "title": "AP News - Survivors pulled out from building 2 days after Taiwan quake", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/02/07/taiwan-rescuers-find-signs-of-life-in-quake-rubble-n2115999", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/37/a06ee920-4c46-4eee-b67a-04756679e605.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Survivors pulled out from building 2 days after Taiwan quake, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "TAINAN, Taiwan (AP) \u2014 Two survivors \u2014 one found shielded under the body of her husband \u2014 were pulled out alive from a toppled high-rise apartment building on Monday, two days after a powerful quake that killed at least 36.\nEarthquakes frequently rattle Taiwan, but most are minor and cause little or no damage, though a magnitude-7.6 quake in central Taiwan in 1999 killed more than 2,300 people.\nTaiwan's Eastern Broadcasting Corp. reported that Tsao Wei-ling called out \"Here I am\" as rescuers dug through to find her.\nThe death toll from Saturday's powerful 6.4-magnitude quake in south Taiwan stood at 36.\nThirty-four of those were from the building collapse in Tainan city, and two other people died elsewhere in the city."}
