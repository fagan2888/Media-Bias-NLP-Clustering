While coverage is getting cheaper in states like Indiana and Mississippi, in North Carolina, it's becoming much more expensive. Federal data show that North Carolina's average premium increase is among the highest in the country.\n\nSue Martin of Mebane, N.C., couldn't afford treatment for Lyme disease and a thyroid condition without health insurance. She got covered through healthcare.gov, and a federal subsidy cut her premium to $238 a month.\n\nBut the insurance company is cancelling that plan and suggesting a similar one for next year, with a big caveat. Martin says it'll cost her $491 a month.\n\n\u201cTo go up that much on premium, that's prohibitive for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere's no way being a retired single lady, that's, well, double what I was paying before.\u201d\n\nThe company behind that plan, Aetna, declined our interview request. Instead, Aetna provided a statement that says its goal is to use rates that'll cover the cost of doing business.\n\nIn North Carolina and across the country, many insurance companies are still figuring out what that rate is. There's a sweet spot with premiums. Companies want them high enough to cover the cost of people's medical care but low enough to attract customers.\n\nGeorgetown University researcher Sabrina Corlette says when the Obamacare exchanges first opened two years ago, \u201cfor many insurance companies, that was a real guessing game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn't know what kind of policyholder they would attract,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just had no idea what their costs would be.\u201d\n\nCorlette says now that companies have actual data on who signed up and how much care they needed, \u201cthey\u2019re saying, whoa, wait a minute, we didn't price the way we should have to actually reflect our costs, and so we need to adjust.\u201d\n\nIn North Carolina, the adjustments are huge. All three insurers on the exchange are raising average premiums at least 20 percent. The dominant player, BlueCross BlueShield, is raising rates 33 percent.\n\nManaging Actuary Brian Tajlili says BlueCross is a long way from that sweet spot.\n\n\u201cThe assumption was the sick would come in the first year in 2014 but then in 2015, healthier people would enroll,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made that assumption. Many others in the industry did as well.\u201d\n\nPreliminary research is mixed on whether that happened nationally. But Tajlili says it didn't in North Carolina.\n\n\u201cAnother thing that we had assumed is many people would go in, get a lot of services done all at once in the first year - something we sometimes call pent-up demand - and that cost would level out after that,\u201d he says. \u201cThat proved to not be the case either.\u201d\n\nThe bad projections meant premiums weren't even close to covering costs, and BlueCross lost more than $120 million on that part of its business.\n\nTo be sure, it's a small part of the business: less than 10 percent of its customers are on the exchange. The premium increases we're talking about don't affect most people, who have insurance through their jobs.\n\nSo were North Carolina's insurance companies just worse at predicting who'd sign up?\n\n\u201cPremium increases really vary state by state and there hasn't been, at least at this point, a really clear pattern that has emerged,\u201d says Elizabeth Carpenter of Avalere Health. She consults with insurance companies and other clients navigating the exchanges nationwide.\n\nNorth Carolina Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin has his own theory for why premiums are so high in this state.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians would have had lower rate adjustments and more competition and more choices for plans if we had gone a state-based route,\u201d he says.\n\nGoodwin says Republican state lawmakers and the governor made a mistake by choosing the federal exchange (as about three dozen other states did) rather than setting up their own.\n\nThe data is not clear on that. Jon Gabel at the University of Chicago has researched this point.\n\n\u201cLast year the rate of increase in state-based exchanges and the federal exchanges was basically, there was no statistical difference,\u201d he says.\n\nThere's huge variation among each kind of exchange. Government data show that a benchmark plan for Indiana is dropping an average of 13 percent, while the same plan in Oklahoma is rising an average of 36 percent \u2013 and both states use the federal exchange.\n\nGabel says there can be advantages to the state exchanges though.\n\n\u201cYou have much more decision making power, that is for sure,\u201d he says.\n\nIn other words, you're in control of the red tape. Commissioner Goodwin argues that could've allowed North Carolina to attract more insurance companies.\n\n\u201cThat alone would've been a major factor for consumers here if there were more companies available,\u201d Goodwin says.\n\nThe data does back up the idea that more competition equals lower premiums. North Carolina and the other states with the highest increases tend to have the fewest insurance companies.\n\nBack in Mebane, Sue Martin shopped around healthcare.gov and found a new plan she could afford, albeit with skimpier benefits.\n\n\u201cEven if the premiums are a little higher than I like or everything isn't covered or whatever, I still have the option to see my doctor,\u201d she says. \u201cI can still afford my medications. I hate to sound hyperbolic, but it's kind of a matter of life and death.\u201d\n\nAbout half a million North Carolinians are on the Obamacare exchange. They have until January 31 to decide on their next plan.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "On the Obamacare exchanges, there are large disparities in how health insurance premiums are changing next year based on where you live.
