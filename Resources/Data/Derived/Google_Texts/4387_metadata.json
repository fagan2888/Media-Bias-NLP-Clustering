The award is handed to members of Congress with a voting record that supports the national chamber\u2019s position at least 70 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s website.\n\nThe award was presented ahead of Sinema\u2019s second State of the District speech in which she covered topics of note for the district. Tops among the address were issues related to business, as Sinema said the business environment in the state has grown and will continue to do so in the future. A sign she said indicates the improvement is the news of two large-scale companies \u2013 Tesla Motors and Google Fiber \u2013 that have expressed interest in setting up shop in the state.\n\nAlso a focus were businesses much smaller than those two, with Sinema saying bills she supported in Congress could and would have a beneficial effect on local companies. One piece of legislation she cited would support businesses that emphasize alternative energy like Monarch Power, which is based in Scottsdale.\n\nIts companies like those and others rooted in her district, including the East Valley, municipalities that Sinema said have a large effect on employment.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of the new jobs in our community come from small businesses,\u201d she said.\n\nAn issue that\u2019s tied tightly to the business community addressed by Sinema was the Affordable Care Act. That bill could have serious implications for businesses both small and large and for employees, and Sinema said the federal government did an \u201catrocious job\u201d rolling out the new regulations.\n\nWhile she said she supported a one-year delay of the implementation, she said the legislation has enough positive aspects, for example extending the time students can stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plan, that the goal should be to eliminate the \u201creal stinkers\u201d instead of repealing it wholesale.\n\nGiven the split between Democrats and Republicans about the legislation, Sinema said getting politicians to amend it could take a while.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see some real change until the heat goes down on this bill,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema offered up an update on the state of her district and received an award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce during an event hosted by Rio Salado College on March 21.", "og": {"site_name": "East Valley Tribune", "description": "U.S. Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema offered up an update on the state of her district and received an award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce during an event hosted by Rio Salado College on March 21.", "title": "Sinema outlines legislation linked to East Valley", "url": "http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/arizona/politics/article_82184af2-b150-11e3-a183-0019bb2963f4.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eastvalleytribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/37/837f2510-b122-11e3-b9de-0019bb2963f4/532ccbf3aa85c.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C300", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@evtnow", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,100006692256060,1527006887", "app_id": 148566918492476}, "keywords": "kyrsten sinema,state governments of the united states,sinema,u.s. chamber of commerce,east valley,rio salado college,congress,tesla motors,google fiber,tempe chamber of commerce,united states house of representatives,chamber of commerce,tempe, az,politics,arizona,tempe,chandler,mesa,tempe,local,money,spotlight,top_story", "news_keywords": "kyrsten sinema,state governments of the united states,sinema,u.s. chamber of commerce,east valley,rio salado college,congress,tesla motors,google fiber,tempe chamber of commerce,united states house of representatives,chamber of commerce,tempe, az,politics,arizona,tempe,chandler,mesa,tempe,local,money,spotlight,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f47\"", "article_summary": "Given the split between Democrats and Republicans about the legislation, Sinema said getting politicians to amend it could take a while.\nIts companies like those and others rooted in her district, including the East Valley, municipalities that Sinema said have a large effect on employment.\nSinema, whose district encompasses Tempe, Chandler, Mesa and Ahwatukee, was given the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Spirit of Enterprise award during the event organized by the Tempe Chamber of Commerce.\nOne piece of legislation she cited would support businesses that emphasize alternative energy like Monarch Power, which is based in Scottsdale.\nAn issue that\u2019s tied tightly to the business community addressed by Sinema was the Affordable Care Act."}
