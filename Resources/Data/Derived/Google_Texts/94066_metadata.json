One told the man to \u201cget it out of my face.\u201d Another officer told the man to \u201cshut your fucking mouth or you\u2019re going to jail.\u201d The man later said, \u201cI thought I had freedom of speech here,\u201d to which an officer replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t. You just lost it.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video here (warning: some explicit language):\n\nBaltimore County police officials are investigating the incident and told CBS Baltimore that they \u201crecognize and respect the rights of citizens to film officers on duty in a public place, unless the person filming has violated a law or statute,\u201d acknowledging that individuals operating in a public space do have particularly strong First Amendment protection. In several states, police have sought to use wiretapping or eavesdropping laws to protect themselves from audio and video recordings, arguing that the police incidents are instead private. A number of court rulings have rejected this argument, including one in Maryland. In 2012, the Supreme Court declined to hear a case on Illinois\u2019 harsh taping restrictions. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that Illinois could not enforce felony sentencing for unauthorized audio recordings was thus upheld.\n\nIn Maryland, a circuit judge reinforced this view after motorcyclist Anthony Graber was slapped with felonies for violating Maryland\u2019s wiretapping law and \u201cpossession of an intercept device\u201d for filming Maryland State Trooper David Uhler on a helmet-cam. Uhler had pulled Graber over for speeding and reckless driving. Circuit Court Judge Emory A. Plitt, Jr. dismissed the felony charges against Graber, writing that \u201cthose of us who are public officials and are entrusted with the power of the state are ultimately accountable to the public. When we exercise that power in a public forum, we should not expect our activity to be shielded from public scrutiny.\u201d Plitt\u2019s ruling that onlookers can record officers in public sight remains the standard in Maryland.\n\nVideotaping of police has proved an essential tool for monitoring misconduct and abuse, the most famous example being the grainy footage that caught Los Angeles police officers beating Rodney King in 1992. More recently, cell phone video captured the shooting of Oscar Grant at the Fruitvale Station BART stop in the California Bay Area.\n\nIn Maryland, a video recording revealed misconduct after a University of Maryland basketball game in College Park, when officers from the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department approached Jack McKenna and another Maryland student. Radley Balko explains:\n\nAccording to police reports, McKenna confronted the officers, verbally provoked them, assaulted them, and then fought when they tried to detain him. But several students at the scene captured the incident on their cell phone cameras. In those videos, later posted on the Internet, McKenna appears to do nothing to provoke the police. Instead, the riot cops stop McKenna, throw him up against a wall, and begin beating him with their batons.\n\nProsecutors dropped charges against McKenna, while four of the officers drew suspensions.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Baltimore County Police became incensed when a man recorded them on duty, threatening him with arrest.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Baltimore County Police became incensed when a man recorded them on duty, threatening him with arrest.", "title": "Cop To Man Filming Him: You Don\u2019t Have Freedom of Speech", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/02/27/3341751/cop-man-filming-make-arrest-rights/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/PoliceShutterstock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Baltimore County Police became incensed when a man recorded them on duty, threatening him with arrest.", "creator": "@aleichenger@americanprogress.org", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/PoliceShutterstock-321x214.jpg", "title": "Cop To Man Filming Him: You Don\u2019t Have Freedom of Speech", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/PoliceShutterstock.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/PoliceShutterstock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-27T17:30:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0dcd\"", "article_summary": "Justice Cop To Man Filming Him: You Don\u2019t Have Freedom of Speech CREDIT: ShutterstockA dispute between Baltimore County police officers and a man that filmed them arresting two people in Towson, Maryland, is raising questions about civilians\u2019 rights to videotape cops.\nOne told the man to \u201cget it out of my face.\u201d Another officer told the man to \u201cshut your fucking mouth or you\u2019re going to jail.\u201d The man later said, \u201cI thought I had freedom of speech here,\u201d to which an officer replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t.\nInstead, the riot cops stop McKenna, throw him up against a wall, and begin beating him with their batons.\nIn Maryland, a circuit judge reinforced this view after motorcyclist Anthony Graber was slapped with felonies for violating Maryland\u2019s wiretapping law and \u201cpossession of an intercept device\u201d for filming Maryland State Trooper David Uhler on a helmet-cam.\nThe Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that Illinois could not enforce felony sentencing for unauthorized audio recordings was thus upheld."}
