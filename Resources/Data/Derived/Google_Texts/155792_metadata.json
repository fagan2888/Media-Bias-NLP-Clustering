Ted Cruz, conservative businesswoman Carly Fiorina, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal assured local GOP supporters that the Republican Party is going to come out on top, whether it\u2019s the state\u2019s gubernatorial election between Republican Greg Abbott and Democrat Wendy Davis, or the potential control shift of the U.S. Senate on Nov. 4.\n\nThe discussion was a fundraiser for the Republican Party of Texas\u2019 campaign to help Republican candidates secure wins on Nov. 4. The Texas Victory 2014 event was moderated by Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Christi Craddick, who gave the panelists ample time to voice their minds in front of an audience that paid $100 each for the lengthy, 90-plus minute discussion.\n\nCruz literally and figuratively stood out from the other panelists, sitting at the edge of his seat when he spoke, using his charisma and humor to make the audience laugh and capture their attention.\n\nOn the first topic about energy and the oil and gas industry being safe from the \u201cliberal agenda,\u201d Cruz spoke about the \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d that is happening in Texas and the legislation he has worked on to further enable the industry\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cYour question is how do we get any of this done?\u201d Cruz said to Craddick. \u201cIt\u2019s real simple. We vote the Democrats out of power and put people with common sense in.\u201d\n\nFiorina, also charismatic and mindful of the Permian Basin audience, said it should be states that dictate how, when and where resources for this country are developed, which received applause.\n\nAnd Jindal, who kept referring to the American Dream in his answers, said energy can be a big part in restoring the American Dream, the vision that he believed has been destroyed by President Barack Obama\u2019s policies. He said the left has an agenda to manipulate the economy via energy.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, the left, President Obama, wants energy to be scarce and expensive,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nAnd on national security, the three panelists slammed Obama for his foreign policies, as during his presidency, Russia under President Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine, the Islamic State has proliferated, and cases of Ebola continue to appear domestically.\n\nBut on elections, as referenced in the event\u2019s name, the panelists called for the end of the Democrats\u2019 power on Nov. 4.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable now that Democrats realize they\u2019re going to lose in 12 days, and they will lose,\u201d Fiorina said \u201c(U.S. Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid will lose his job.\u201d\n\nFiorina added that in addition to Reid losing power and Abbott winning the race for Texas governor, there is an opportunity to show that conservative principles is what lifts people up.\n\nJindal looked at the discontent people are having with both the Democratic and Republican parties, especially in instances when people are told nothing can get done such as a balanced budget. He called for the Republican Party to not be just \u201canti-Obama\u201d and show consistent governance with conservative principles.\n\nAnd Cruz, confident Republicans will seize the Senate majority from Reid and Democrats on Nov. 4, noted that control of the Senate alone will not get things done. When a Republican-majority Senate rolls into action, Cruz said the Senate will have meaningful oversight \u201cof the abuse of executive power and lawlessness\u201d from the Obama administration. The second big shift Cruz envisions with a Republican-majority Senate will be having bills passed, most of them bi-partisan.\n\nCruz\u2019s vision of GOP control did not end with the Nov. 4 elections. He, and possibly some of the others sitting next to him at the event, were looking years away.\n\n\u201cI am convinced, come January 2017, with a Republican president in the White House, we\u2019re going to sign legislation repealing every single word of \u2018Obamacare,\u2019\u201d Cruz said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "MRT.com", "description": "The Republican Party of Texas brought out big GOP stars Thursday night for a panel discussion that encompassed energy policy, national security issues and victory.", "title": "Speakers assure GOP victories on Nov. 4, beyond", "url": "http://www.mrt.com/statenation/article_dd8272a6-5b36-11e4-8c94-3b9fca0c64fb.html", "image": {"width": 852, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/mrt.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/1c/01c124ff-5d78-58df-a850-30cad721f015/5449b49052f47.image.jpg?resize=852%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "description": "The Republican Party of Texas brought out big GOP stars Thursday night for a panel discussion that encompassed energy policy, national security issues and victory.", "alexaVerifyID": "A6ceEFS0S5jDksnNeroDWYv-Ng8", "msvalidate.01": "413490AB8B4C8646430571E6A42CDACD", "fb": {"admins": 683724462, "page_id": 361381078011, "app_id": 361381078011}, "google-site-verification": "xNnVfsZTVBWcZfJ0g8VA3xLs604yxyfE-XDF2qcsuS8", "keywords": "Midland,news, A6ceEFS0S5jDksnNeroDWYv-Ng8", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheReporterTelegram"}, "y_key": "b7ecaaeb522529c1", "news_keywords": "politics of the united states,politics,carly fiorina,bobby jindal,ted cruz,texas,statenation,top_stories"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7392\"", "article_summary": "The discussion was a fundraiser for the Republican Party of Texas\u2019 campaign to help Republican candidates secure wins on Nov. 4.\nHe called for the Republican Party to not be just \u201canti-Obama\u201d and show consistent governance with conservative principles.\nThe Republican Party of Texas brought out big GOP stars Thursday night for a panel discussion that encompassed energy policy, national security issues, but most prominently, victory for GOP candidates during the Nov. 4 and 2016 elections.\nBut on elections, as referenced in the event\u2019s name, the panelists called for the end of the Democrats\u2019 power on Nov. 4.\nCruz\u2019s vision of GOP control did not end with the Nov. 4 elections."}
