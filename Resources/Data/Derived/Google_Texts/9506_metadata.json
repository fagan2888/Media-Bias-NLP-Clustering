They say I\u2019ve got to do other stuff.\u201d\n\nThat other stuff includes preparing Baylor Scott & White, formed earlier this year by the merger of Dallas-based Baylor Health Care System and Temple-based Scott & White Health, for a future that includes full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which is transforming how care is provided and compensated across the country.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re going through probably the biggest, fastest change I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Allison, 65, said of his organization and the industry.\n\nGoing forward, the scale and pace of change will probably increase, he said, as health care providers bridge the strategy of today to that of tomorrow. He foresees:\n\nA focus on quality as providers become more and more accountable for the care they deliver. In tandem, he sees a focus on wellness, keeping people healthy rather than treating them when they are sick.\n\nTreatment will continue to move to outpatient settings instead of hospital inpatient facilities that involve overnight stays.\n\nA focus on pricing as reimbursements to providers continue to decrease. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the last industries to go through a repricing of our product,\u201d Allison said.\n\nGrowing industry consolidation through mergers and acquisitions of hospital groups and physician groups. Scale is becoming critical to effectiveness and survival.\n\nIn fact, Allison said, the country may be just at the beginning of a period of consolidation.\n\n\u201cIn 10 years, there may be only 150 large, integrated health care delivery systems in the nation able to be accountable for and able to take risk for a significant population of patients,\u201d he said.\n\nIn October, Baylor and Scott & White completed their merger. The new organization, with Allison as CEO, has more than $8 billion in combined assets and about $6 billion in annual revenue. It includes 43 hospitals in North and Central Texas, more than 500 patient care sites, more than 6,000 affiliated physicians and 34,000 employees.\n\nThe merged system has about 4.8 million \u201cpatient encounters\u201d a year, Baylor Scott & White says. One patient can account for more than one encounter.\n\n\u201cWe put the two organizations together because we truly believe that one plus one equals three,\u201d said Allison, who earned about $1.6 million in salary and bonus in 2012. \u201cWe\u2019re building on the legacy while we make the changes necessary.\u201d\n\nThis year, Modern Healthcare magazine ranked Allison No. 19 on its list of the 100 most influential people in the industry, just behind Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, is No. 1, President Barack Obama No. 3.\n\n\u201cJoel, you\u2019re at the peak of your career at a critical moment in health care,\u201d KERA\u2019s Lee Cullum told Allison on her CEO show earlier this fall. Much of the discussion was about Baylor\u2019s merger.\n\nDuring interviews with The Dallas Morning News for this article, Allison was asked if he had plans to retire. No, he answered. He said that decision is in the hands \u201cof the Lord\u201d and Baylor Scott & White\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of folks flunk retirement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think this is the most exciting time in my career. It\u2019s energizing.\u201d\n\nFootball, Marines\n\nAllison\u2019s perspective on health care developed over a career that began in 1973 at Hendrick Medical Center in Abilene, where he worked under Boone Powell Jr., who later ran Baylor Health Care System and eventually hired Allison here.\n\nHis life lessons began earlier. He attended high school in Jefferson City, Mo., where he played football and basketball and threw the shot and discus in track. He earned a football scholarship as a lineman (tackle) to Baylor University, where he majored in journalism and religion. He said he wasn\u2019t a starter in football at Baylor, but he did letter.\n\nOriginally, he wanted to be a minister, he said, but eventually he figured out that he was being called to hospital administration.\n\nWith a low draft lottery number and the likelihood of being drafted, Allison said, he joined the Marine Corps reserves while waiting to enroll in graduate school at Trinity University in San Antonio, where he earned a master\u2019s degree in health administration in 1973. He did six months of active duty in the reserves and 5\u00bd years of reserve obligations.\n\nFootball and the Marines, he said, taught him loyalty, duty, discipline, the importance of teamwork, how to handle defeat and to never be satisfied.\n\nOn his high school football team, he remembered, anyone on the field could challenge for your job at practice on Tuesdays. If you got beat, the starter\u2019s jersey came off.\n\nIn a long 2001 interview conducted by William Clifford Roberts and published in the Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings, Allison said the Marine Corps was one of the best management training experiences he had.\n\n\u201cPart of what I learned was what it is to be the lowest person in the chain of command,\u201d he told Roberts. \u201cI began to appreciate how the lowest person is treated by superiors. I began to appreciate that lack of information breeds fear and rumors.\u201d\n\nAfter Hendrick, where he rose to chief operating officer, Allison held a succession of CEO jobs at Methodist Medical Center in St. Joseph, Mo., Northwest Texas Hospitals/Amarillo Hospital District in Amarillo, and Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital in Corpus Christi before he came to Dallas in 1993 to work under Powell again.\n\nThe Corpus posting was especially appealing because it was near his family\u2019s second home in Port Aransas. \u201cIt\u2019s where I go when I need down time,\u201d Allison said, calling the place his retreat.\n\nAt one time, he owned a 15-foot Dixie Airboat, one of those boats with the big fan at the back for propulsion. Allison used it to take his sons duck hunting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like sitting in a duck blind with the sun coming up and your two boys beside you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Allison replaced Powell as CEO at Baylor, ending five decades of Powell family leadership.\n\n\u201cEverybody recognizes that the whole health care industry is changing, and we have to respond to those changes,\u201d Allison told The News at the time. \u201cWe want to create a model of health care delivery that is hassle-free for the patient and the physician, and that will restore the physician-patient relationship.\u201d\n\nThirteen years later, the industry continues to change, but not the doctor-patient goal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to achieve that,\u201d Allison said when reminded of his words.\n\nGrowing system\n\nAllison credits all those who helped him in the past, including his sixth-grade teacher, his high school football coach, his pastor and, of course, Boone Powell Jr., his friend of 40 years.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do any of this on my own,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview, Powell, now 76, said that from the first he liked Allison\u2019s enthusiasm, commitment and ability to assess, evaluate and make decisions, essential skills for a manager.\n\n\u201cHe was young. I was pretty young,\u201d Powell said of the time he and Allison were at Hendrick. \u201cThe longer I worked with him, the more I liked his potential.\u201d\n\nWhen Powell got to Dallas and Baylor, he never forgot about Allison.\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, I always knew in the back of my mind that if the appropriate time came, I would like to invite him to join me at Baylor,\u201d Powell said.\n\nDuring Powell\u2019s tenure, Baylor grew from one hospital into a system. It initiated partnerships with private ventures, doctors and other hospitals that helped it grow. Allison continued the strategy.\n\nOne of those ventures is in partnership with United Surgical Partners International, a for-profit company. The partnership runs ambulatory surgical centers and some other facilities, including Baylor Frisco Medical Center.\n\nAllison has been on the board of directors of United Surgical Partners since 2002. He doesn\u2019t receive director compensation. Instead, it goes to Baylor. Allison\u2019s son Blake is an executive at United Surgical.\n\nAllison met his wife, Diane, at Baylor University, and they married after their junior year. Their another son, Brent, who is a maritime attorney, and their daughter, Celeste, is a working student living in the Austin area.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, Baylor University appointed the trustees for Baylor University Medical Center and Baylor Health Care System. Since then, those trustees have been independently appointed. The hospital system, however, still licenses the Baylor mark from Baylor University, subject to maintaining certain quality standards.\n\nJust as Allison was mentored, he is now doing the same.\n\nBenjamin Anderson, 34, is CEO of Kearny County Hospital in Lakin, Kan., which has about $22 million in annual revenue. Anderson said he got to know Allison about five years ago when he was poised to take his first CEO job at another small rural Kansas location.\n\n\u201cI was very, very green,\u201d Anderson said. He made an appointment to see Allison to get some advice. Allison complied, and they have stayed in contact ever since.\n\nAnderson\u2019s message for Allison: \u201cFirst, thank you, and I promise I\u2019ll pay this forward,\u201d he said.\n\nAllison is also active in civic organizations. He is a past chairman of the boards of the United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, the Dallas Regional Chamber and the Dallas Citizens Council.\n\n\u2018A good railroad\u2019\n\nSince the merger, Allison has moved his office a few blocks. He used to be located with executives focused on Baylor Health Care\u2019s North Texas operations. But he doesn\u2019t want to suffocate them by being too close and he doesn\u2019t want to show any favoritism over Scott & White.\n\nHis new location is close enough that he can still walk over for hospital rounds. The day a reporter and video crew accompanied him, the stops were picked in advance because of patient privacy rules.\n\nAllison demonstrated an easy rapport with patients, nurses, doctors and other hospital personnel. He gave each patient he visited his business card and told them to contact him if he could do anything for them.\n\n\u201cLeaders need to be visible,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be invisible.\u201d\n\nAmong his four stops was a cancer patient, Kevin Whitecotton, undergoing his final scheduled chemotherapy session for lymphoma. Whitecotton praised the care he received.\n\nAnother stop was heart patient Jerry Davis, who had his aortic valve replaced through a procedure that goes through an artery rather than opening his chest.\n\n\u201cYou run a good railroad, I\u2019ll say that,\u201d Davis told Allison.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got good people running things,\u201d Allison responded. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the people.\u201d\n\nWith Allison heading the overall merged organization, Gary Brock is now running operations at Baylor Health Care System.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a manager, he\u2019s a leader,\u201d Brock said of Allison. \u201cHe relies on his management team to manage. He wants to be kept informed but he doesn\u2019t want to be in the group.\u201d\n\nOne group that Allison does want to be a part of is the growing legion of Baylor football fans. He\u2019s on the school\u2019s board of regents and attends many of the games.\n\nDuring his playing days, he said, he was listed in the program as 6-2, 235 pounds.\n\nToday, he says, he\u2019s about 6-1 and 180.\n\nDid he shrink?\n\n\u201cI think coaches always put a little stretch in their programs,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is no stretch, though, when Allison talks about his work \u2014 his calling, he said \u2014 even if he can\u2019t visit patients all the time.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019re a big business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re really built around serving others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never worked a day in my life, because I love what I do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ten years from now, because of consolidation, there may be only 150 large, integrated health care delivery systems in the nation, the CEO says.", "og": {"description": "Ten years from now, because of consolidation, there may be only 150 large, integrated health care delivery systems in the nation, the CEO says.", "title": "Baylor Scott & White\u2019s Joel Allison: \u2018We\u2019re going through probably the biggest, fastest change I\u2019ve seen\u2019", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20131207-baylor-scott-whites-joel-allison-were-going-through-probably-the-biggest-fastest-change-ive-seen.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131207-joelallison_xxxxbus.ece/BINARY/original/JoelAllison_xxxxbus", "height": 447}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-12-08T01:12:18Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-12-08T00:46:35Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Baylor Scott & White\\u2019s Joel Allison: \\u2018We\\u2019re going through probably the biggest, fastest change I\\u2019ve seen\\u2019\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20131207-baylor-scott-whites-joel-allison-were-going-through-probably-the-biggest-fastest-change-ive-seen.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131207-joelallison_xxxxbus.ece/BINARY/original/JoelAllison_xxxxbus\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1333177\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-08T00:46:35Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"GARY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131207-joelallison_xxxxbus.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/JoelAllison_xxxxbus", "publishtime": "2013-12-08T00:46:35Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf60a\"", "article_summary": "Until the late 1990s, Baylor University appointed the trustees for Baylor University Medical Center and Baylor Health Care System.\nHe said that decision is in the hands \u201cof the Lord\u201d and Baylor Scott & White\u2019s board.\nThe hospital system, however, still licenses the Baylor mark from Baylor University, subject to maintaining certain quality standards.\nGoing forward, the scale and pace of change will probably increase, he said, as health care providers bridge the strategy of today to that of tomorrow.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re going through probably the biggest, fastest change I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Allison, 65, said of his organization and the industry."}
