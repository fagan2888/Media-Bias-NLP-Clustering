This includes a 2.1% increase in the federal per diem base rate, from $713.19 to $728.31.\n\nThe per diem base rate increase \"is comprised of a rehabilitation, psychiatric, and long-term care market basket increase of 2.9%, an ACA-required reduction of 0.3 percentage points, and an ACA-required productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5 percentage point,\" the agency noted.\n\nAs part of the payment rule for psychiatric facilities, CMS also added several new quality measures to the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program. For reporting beginning in 2016, a \"patient experience of care\" measure and a \"use of electronic health record\" measure were added, and for reporting beginning in 2017, two tobacco use measures and two immunization measures -- one for inpatients and one for providers themselves -- were added.\n\nThe final 2015 payment rule for skilled nursing facilities will be published on Aug. 5 in the Federal Register. The inpatient rehabilitation facility and inpatient psychiatric facility final rules will be published on Aug. 6.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joyce  Frieden", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Medicare/47043", "image": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/8/2/47043.jpg", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released 2015 payment schedules for several types of facilities -- and it's mostly good news for providers.", "card": "Summary", "title": "CMS Issues Pay Rules for Psych, Rehab Facilities"}, "dc.date.issued": "2014-08-02 12:30:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "primarycare,psychiatry,publichealthpolicy,generalpsychiatry,generalprimarycare,geriatrics,washington-watch,medicare,practicemanagement,reimbursement,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-02 12:30:00", "sailthru.title": "CMS Issues Pay Rules for Psych, Rehab Facilities", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released 2015 payment schedules for several types of facilities -- and it's mostly good news for providers.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-08-03 12:08:00", "date": "2014-08-02 12:30:00", "sailthru.description": "WASHINGTON -- The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released 2015 payment schedules for several types of facilities -- and it's mostly good news for providers.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Medicare/47043", "image": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/8/2/47043.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released 2015 payment schedules for several types of facilities -- and it's mostly good news for providers.", "title": "CMS Issues Pay Rules for Psych, Rehab Facilities"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2014-08-02 12:30:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "psychiatry,primarycare,Other,geriatrics,pain_management", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/8/2/47043.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda52b\"", "article_summary": "\"The wage index for each provider will consist of a blend of 50% of the FY 2015 wage index using the current OMB delineations and 50% of the FY 2015 wage index using the revised OMB delineations.\"\nFor inpatient psychiatric facilities, CMS will increase total payments by 2.5% compared with 2014, according to a CMS fact sheet.\nAs part of the payment rule for psychiatric facilities, CMS also added several new quality measures to the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program.\nThe inpatient rehabilitation facility and inpatient psychiatric facility final rules will be published on Aug. 6.\nWASHINGTON -- The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released 2015 final payment rules for inpatient rehabilitation, inpatient psychiatric, and skilled nursing facilities -- with mostly good news for providers."}
