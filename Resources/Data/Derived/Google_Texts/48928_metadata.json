All a gang over there [in the States] is going to take you to is death or prison.\u201d\n\nA militiaman wears a protective vest.\n\nDudley Althaus/GlobalPost\n\nFor 11 months, armed civilians calling themselves \u201cautodefensas,\u201d or self-defense militias, have been fighting to thwart the deadly Knights Templar in Michoacan\u2019s Pacific coastal lowlands.\n\nThe militias\u2019 recent successes against the gang has renewed fears of civil war here, spurring President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to dispatch thousands of troops to keep the groups apart.\n\nThe criminal violence that\u2019s claimed some 80,000 lives in Mexico, according to independent analysts, began in these very towns seven years ago. Michoacan plagues the government still \u2014 and it\u2019s quickly become Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s most vexing security headache.\n\nKnown as \u201cTierra Caliente,\u201d or Hot Country, this region has long sold fruits, vegetables, and crystal meth to Mexican and US consumers. Experts say the Templars dominate large parts of the meth trade.\n\nAfter years of kidnappings and endemic extortion by the Templars, \u201cpeople just want to be able to work unmolested,\u201d says Aaron Sanchez, an official in Nueva Italia, a market town that militiamen captured on Sunday following skirmishes with the gang.\n\n\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t been able to deal with the situation so we as a people have had to,\u201d he says.\n\nMilitia leaders say they don\u2019t have a good count of the US-raised youths among their hundreds of gunmen. But Verduzco and others from Southern California say their numbers are considerable.\n\nOne fighter claimed to be a US Army veteran who returned to Mexico specifically to join the militias. There were many like him, he said. But he walked away when pressed for details.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the people. They tell us whatever they need,\u201d Adolfo Silva, 20, raised in Santa Ana, Calif., says of the Templars in English (seen in the video below). \u201cI\u2019m a guerrilla.\u201d\n\nFighting the Templars, Silva says, reminds him of gang turf battles back in California. But in Michoacan, \u201cyou are more into it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cOver there you might go see a movie,\u201d he says of his American life, which he left voluntarily rather than face minor drug charges. \u201cHere you are in the movie.
