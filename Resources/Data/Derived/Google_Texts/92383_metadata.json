Already, both sides have begun public relations campaigns to pin blame on the other.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to get blamed for a shutdown, no matter what happens, by the general public.\u201d Stan Collender\n\nHere are some questions and a few answers about how we got here and what\u2019s at issue:\n\nQ. So why do we have to care about this again?\n\nA. Two separate disputes have become intertwined. The White House says government-wide automatic spending cuts known as sequestration are hurting the economy, and that President Barack Obama will no longer sign bills that continue them. Republicans want government funding cut off for Planned Parenthood, the women\u2019s health provider whose services include abortion.\n\nQ. Sequestration, right. What\u2019s that again?\n\nA. Back in 2011 Congress and Obama agreed to resolve a political crisis over the U.S. debt by creating a special committee of lawmakers to recommend ways to reduce spending. They couldn\u2019t agree. So instead we got caps on domestic and military spending. The Congressional Budget Office says federal spending would increase $979 billion over the next decade if those limits are lifted. Sequestration is the technical term for the process that would be used if spending exceeds the limits.\n\nEven some Republicans, notably the House Appropriations Committee Chairman, Hal Rogers of Kentucky, want to get rid of the caps, especially for the military.\n\nQ. And what\u2019s the deal with Planned Parenthood?\n\nA. This summer, an anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress released hidden-camera videos of Planned Parenthood executives discussing reimbursement for providing tissue from aborted fetuses to researchers. Conservatives were outraged and have demanded that Republicans stop federal funding for the group. Planned Parenthood denies that it sells fetal tissue and it\u2019s forbidden from using federal money to pay for abortions.\n\nQ. Is there a deadline to resolve all of this?\n\nA. Yes. The current federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Without new appropriations, federal agencies won\u2019t have authority to spend money starting the next day, with some exceptions for services that are considered essential such as the military, law enforcement and air traffic control.\n\nQ. I hear Ted Cruz is involved. Didn\u2019t he have something to do with the last shutdown?\n\nA. That\u2019s right. In September 2013, Republicans led by the Texas senator -- who is now running for president -- insisted on shutting off spending for the Affordable Care Act. (You may recall him reading Dr. Seuss\u2019s \"Green Eggs and Ham\" from the Senate floor.) Obama refused, and the government closed down for the first 16 days of October. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors were furloughed and federal services including national parks were closed. Republicans relented after public opinion turned against them.\n\nQ. Republicans lost in the last shutdown. Who will get the blame this time?\n\nA. Republicans, probably. Right now, about 41 percent of Americans say they\u2019d blame congressional Republicans for a shutdown, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Aug. 31. Thirty-three percent say they\u2019d blame Obama or congressional Democrats. The rest don\u2019t know or would blame both sides.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to get blamed for a shutdown, no matter what happens, by the general public,\u201d said Stan Collender, a budget analyst and executive vice president at Qorvis MSLGroup in Washington. \u201cThey have too much baggage, too much history and it only seems to happen on their watch. But I don\u2019t think they care.\u201d\n\nQ. So do they care?\n\nA. Their leaders do. House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has told members of his party that he doesn\u2019t want another shutdown, Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a relatively moderate member of the party, said on Wednesday. Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has vowed there won\u2019t be a shutdown.\n\nQ. Then why would there be a shutdown?\n\nA. Because Republican leaders can\u2019t always control their rank-and-file members. Remember Cruz? He\u2019s leading the effort to deny money to Planned Parenthood this year.\n\nQ. Is there a way out of this?\n\nA. Maybe. Republican and Democratic leaders are discussing a stopgap measure called a \"continuing resolution\" that would keep the government running after Sept. 30 and give them more time to work out a deal on a full-year plan. But some Republicans say they won\u2019t even support a short-term bill unless it cuts off money for Planned Parenthood.\n\nQ. I\u2019m a Republican. Can I blame Obama and the Democrats for this?\n\nA. Sure. Obama\u2019s threatened to veto every fiscal 2016 spending bill that House and Senate Republicans have produced so far, generally because he wants to spend more money. And House Democrats say they\u2019ll help pass a short-term bill -- if it doesn\u2019t eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood and if they\u2019re part of negotiations on a full-year plan that raises spending for domestic programs such as health care, welfare and education.\n\n\u201cCongress can pass a budget that does away with this so-called sequester that just lops things off whether it\u2019s good or not for the economy, harms our military, hurts working people,\u201d Obama said Monday in a speech to union workers in Boston. \u201cWe could instead invest in working families, invest in our military readiness, invest in our schools, rebuild our roads, rebuild our ports, rebuild our airports, put people back to work right now. I\u2019ll sign that budget. I\u2019m ready to work with them.\u201d\n\nQ. I\u2019m an investor. Should I panic?\n\nA. Nope. \u201cThree weeks is an eternity by Wall Street standards,\u201d Collender said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Angela Greiling Keane,Billy House", "description": "It may seem like only yesterday that the U.S. government shut down, followed by promises from Republicans and Democrats alike: Never again.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "It may seem like only yesterday that the U.S. government shut down, followed by promises from Republicans and Democrats alike: Never again.", "title": "The U.S. Government May Shut Down (Again).
