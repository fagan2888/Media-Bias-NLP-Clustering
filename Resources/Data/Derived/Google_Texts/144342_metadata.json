That\u2019s big for them. We hit on that as a logo the other day, and we talked about the importance of being in history books as the best team in history, along with the 1997 team.\u201d\n\nMountain West winner Boise State, ranked 20th, received a CFP access bowl bid as the highest-rated champion of a non-power conference and will meet Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nThat allowed CSU (10-2) to move up to the league\u2019s top-slotted bowl.\n\n\u201cThe last few days have been hectic, and it\u2019s good to find out that we\u2019re playing Utah and that we get to prepare and focus on that instead of the other things,\u201d senior linebacker Aaron Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a special season this year, and with these two guys, we\u2019ve been here for a while. We\u2019ve been here at the down times, and this is definitely a high point of our careers. It\u2019ll be good to get out there and show another Pac-12 team how good the Colorado State Rams are.\u201d\n\nThe Rams have won their last three games against teams from power conferences \u2014 against Washington State in the New Mexico Bowl last season, then Colorado and Boston College this season.\n\n\u201cWe know how good this team is, but a lot of people base it off those types of wins,\u201d senior middle linebacker Max Morgan said. \u201cSo we\u2019re happy to have another opportunity at it. \u2026 We have lots of motivation to win this game. We have seniors going up, we have guys coming up like Trent and we want to build the brand of Colorado State University and we\u2019re going to have a national stage to do it.\u201d\n\nThe Rams will depart for Las Vegas on Tuesday, Dec. 16.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nA look at the Utes\n\n\u2022 Went 5-4 in the Pac-12 and finished with a 38-34 win over Colorado in Boulder.\n\n\u2022 Three of their four losses were to teams ranked in the final CFP top 25\u2014 Arizona State (15), Oregon (2) and Arizona (10). The other loss was to Washington State (28-27) on Sept. 27.\n\n\u2022 Defeated No. 14 UCLA and No. 24 Southern California.\n\n\u2022 Junior QB Travis Wilson threw for 2,012 yards and 17 touchdowns.\n\n\u2022 Junior RB Devontae Booker ran for 1,350 yards and nine touchdowns.\n\n\u2022 In their most recent meeting with CSU, the Utes prevailed 59-6 in 2010, the Utes\u2019 final season in the Mountain West.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State to face Utah in Las Vegas Bowl on Dec. 20", "title": "Colorado State to face Utah in Las Vegas Bowl on Dec. 20", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/07/colorado-state-to-face-utah-in-las-vegas-bowl-on-dec-20/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141124__SP23FBCCSU_AC25363xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141124__SP23FBCCSU_AC25363xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-07T13:42:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:17:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s been only one other team in the history of Colorado State football that went 11-2, won 11 games,\u201d Baldwin said.\nAnd if they do that in the Las Vegas Bowl against former Mountain West rival Utah at Sam Boyd Stadium at 1:30 p.m. on Dec. 20, the accomplishment won\u2019t remain in Vegas.\n\u2022 In their most recent meeting with CSU, the Utes prevailed 59-6 in 2010, the Utes\u2019 final season in the Mountain West.\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 The carrot for Colorado State: Try to match the 11-2 record of the Rams\u2019 1997 Western Athletic Conference champions, a Sonny Lubick-coached team that finished with a flourish, beating Missouri in the Holiday Bowl.\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFreiA look at the Utes\u2022 Went 5-4 in the Pac-12 and finished with a 38-34 win over Colorado in Boulder."}
