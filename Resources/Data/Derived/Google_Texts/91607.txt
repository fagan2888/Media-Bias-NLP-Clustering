Papa John's Set To Dump Peyton Manning?







Louisville (eTrueSports) - A source close to bargain pizza purveyor Papa John says the company will dump Peyton Manning as a company spokesman. "Any way you slice it, he's a loser," the source told eTrueSports.



"Sounds like Johnny snapped again," another observer said about Papa John's mercurial tycoon owner John Schnatter. "But firing Peyton is risky."



Schnatter, with a net worth of $600 million, was one of the first moguls who after the Affordable Health Care Act became law reduced his fulltime workers to thirty hours a week, so that he didnâ€™t have to pay for their insurance.



Manning owns 21 Papa John's franchises.



"If Peyton calls Bob Woodward, the world might be saved from a lot of crappy pizza," the source added.
