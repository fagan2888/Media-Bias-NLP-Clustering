Do you need to sign up?\n\nJanice \u2013 Pa.: I am on only a couple of prescription medications with no significant medical issues. One of my drugs costs me only $37 out-of-pocket for a 90-day supply. However, my insurance company is charged more than $500 for this generic drug, and all of this cost is applied to my donut-hole coverage. Over the course of the year, this single drug will eat up nearly my entire insurance limit. In Canada, my annual cost for this same drug would be only about $800 a year \u2014 without insurance! Why is our government allowing this price gouging, which we as citizens ultimately pay for? Not to mention, it\u2019s compromising our health by not being able to afford medication that clearly has been exorbitantly overpriced.\n\nPhil Moeller: Your government is allowing this, because the pharmaceutical industry convinced enough legislators in 2003 to forbid Medicare from negotiating drug prices when Congress enacted the law creating Part D drug plans. It was a bad move then, and it is costing us even more now. As new generations of effective but very expensive drugs hit the market, Medicare has little choice but to pay up. A Congress that truly represented the American public would have addressed this problem. Our Congress has not. And while high drug prices will be an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, it\u2019s tough to see Congress dealing with it before the election.\n\nMORE FROM MAKING SEN$E\n\nAlso, calls for drug price cuts make for good news headlines. But the key here is to rein in U.S. drug prices while not destroying the financial incentives that I believe are appropriate to encourage companies to pursue the very costly research and development costs of new drugs. The Maven may (once again) be a lonely voice here, but the U.S. can\u2019t do this by itself. We need to involve other nations and develop a global cost-sharing system where all countries pay some of the freight for pharmaceutical research and development. Today, U.S. consumers (and taxpayers) are shouldering nearly all of this burden. Compared with global accords on limiting greenhouse gas emissions, a trade pact on drug prices should be a snap.\n\nChris \u2013 Texas: I turn 65 this December. My wife is five years younger than me. Our goal is to both stay with my company\u2019s health savings account (HSA). Unfortunately, pre-tax contributions will no longer be possible, because the United Healthcare HSA prescription drug plan is not \u201ccreditable\u201d \u2014 essentially because the HSA is high deductible. I\u2019ve advised my employer to no longer make contributions to my HSA. I do not plan on taking Social Security until I turn 70. Should I select a \u201ccreditable\u201d private prescription drug plan or a Medicare Part D \u201ccreditable\u201d prescription drug plan? It\u2019s my understanding that the later forces me into Part A. I assume I would then notify Medicare that I\u2019m continuing to work and now have a \u201ccreditable\u201d drug plan. Will I incur any penalties now or in the future for following this road map?\n\nPhil Moeller: What a ball of hot and gooey wax! First off, just because you have a high-deductible health plan doesn\u2019t mean your drug coverage is not creditable. So ask your employer to certify whether that\u2019s the case. If, as you say, it\u2019s not the case, I\u2019d explore leaving your HSA plan during your company\u2019s open enrollment period and choosing a plan for 2016 that has creditable drug coverage. This will permit you to continue getting drug coverage from your employer plan and of course, other health coverage for you and your wife. This is likely to be a better deal than you signing up for Medicare and your wife getting coverage on the Texas state insurance exchange.\n\nTo answer your drug coverage question, you cannot pick a Part D plan without first having Parts A or B of Medicare (and you\u2019d need both A and B if you want a Medicare Advantage plan that includes drug coverage). If it turns out that you do need to sign up for a Part D plan, I doubt your employer would continue to cover the rest of your health insurance needs. That\u2019s a separate conversation you would need to have. But if you needed to rely on Medicare for all your health insurance, you\u2019d have a seven-month window to sign up in order to avoid late-enrollment penalties \u2014 three months before turning 65, the month of your 65th birthday and the following three months. Lastly, even if you no longer can contribute to an HSA, you can keep any balances in the plan and use them the future. So long as they\u2019re spent on qualifying medical expenses you will pay no taxes on these funds.\n\nSteven \u2013 Okla.: I just turned 64. My wife will be 63 in January. I plan to work until 67, and she will likely do so until she turns 67 or later. We plan to retire abroad in France where health care costs are generally lower. I know that Medicare will not pay for any procedures performed outside the U.S., but can we suspend coverage when we leave the country? It seems pointless to pay a premium for Part B when we have no hope of receiving a benefit. And if we don\u2019t pay, will we be subject to the 10 percent annual penalty if we then return to the U.S. in the future and wish to resume Medicare coverage?\n\nPhil Moeller: Once your employer group health insurance ends, Medicare generally does not permit time outs, do overs or other suspensions. Sadly, you would thus be on the hook for Part B and Part D penalties if your Medicare lapses and you resume it later on. But then, Paris is so beautiful!\n\nTucker \u2013 Wash.: Why does Medicare only consider reimbursement for a wheelchair used in the home? Do they want us to be shut-ins?\n\nMORE FROM MAKING SEN$E How do I know if my doctor accepts Medicare?\n\nPhil Moeller: You\u2019re correct that Medicare\u2019s standard for wheelchair use is your doctor\u2019s assessment that you have a medical need for a wheelchair inside your home. But you are then free to use it wherever you wish. I don\u2019t see this as meaning that Medicare wants you to be a shut-in. However, if you can putter around your home without needing a chair, but you can\u2019t walk very far outside the home, I can see where you\u2019d feel this standard is unfair. In practice, basing Medicare coverage on your mobility outside the home would create a very slippery slope. How far would you need to walk unaided before you didn\u2019t need a wheelchair? A mile? Less? More? How would this distance be tested? The medical need requirement is consistent with other Medicare coverage determinations. And the in-home standard, while certainly murky in some circumstances, is easier to consistently interpret.\n\nBruce \u2013 N.Y.: I have family medical coverage through my job. When I retire at age 65, will Medicare cover my spouse?\n\nPhil Moeller: Medicare doesn\u2019t do family plans. It covers only individuals. If your spouse is 65 or older, she will have to get her own Medicare coverage. If she is younger and no longer covered by your employer health plan, she will have to get coverage on the New York state insurance exchange as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLinda \u2013 Wash.: I was 65 last November and have Medicare Part A in place. My private employer insurance ended October 1, and I signed up for Medicare Part B and a Medigap policy to start then. The only drug I take is a relatively inexpensive low-dose generic. Do I need Medicare Part D now?\n\nPhil Moeller: Part D is voluntary, so you don\u2019t have to get it. However, if you later need a Part D plan, large annual penalties will be applied to your Part D premiums. Actually, they\u2019re applied to an average of Part D premiums, so even if you have a zero premium plan, you\u2019d get socked with a penalty. The penalty is 1 percent a month, and it will be imposed so long as you have a Part D plan. My advice is to buy one of the many no-premium Part D plans that are available. If your drug use continues to be modest, you will wind up paying little for the policy, but doing so will allow you to avoid Part D\u2019s late enrollment penalties.\n\nAnn \u2013 Ore.: If my doctor does not accept Medicare, can I pay him out-of-pocket without involving Medicare? If he prescribes medications, can I use a Part D plan to pay for them?\n\nPhil Moeller: You can certainly pay your doctor without filing a Medicare claim. If he prescribes medication, however, a new Medicare rule taking effect next year will prohibit your Part D plan\u2019s pharmacy network from filling a prescription unless the prescribing physician participates in Medicare.\n\nMalcolm \u2013 Cal.: I\u2019m 79 and have Medicare Parts A and B and a Medicare supplement policy. I\u2019ve never had a Part D drug plan. Is there a way to get Plan D without the huge penalty?\n\nPhil Moeller: If you have a very low income, you might be able to qualify for Medicare\u2019s Extra Help program to assist you with your drug expenses. In some cases, this assistance includes waiving Part D penalties. Otherwise, it will be difficult to avoid a big late-enrollment penalty, which could add 12 percent a year to your premium for each year you failed to enroll. I suggest you speak to a SHIP counselor at 1-800-434-0222 and see if there are any options for California residents that might help you out.\n\nGeorge \u2013 N.Y.: I just received my Aetna PPO (preferred provider organization) MA (Medicare Advantage) booklet for 2016. It indicates there will be a $75 monthly charge for out of network gym memberships. There is no mention of in-network coverage for such memberships. Does this mean they will stop honoring Silver & Fit current locations for members?\n\nPhil Moeller: No. An Aetna representative says your membership will still be covered without a co-pay. The new charge applies only to non-network gyms. This should be reflected in a chart in your booklet. If you\u2019re still unclear, please get in touch with Aetna.\n\nBarbara \u2013 Fla.: I did not sign up for Medicare prior to turning 65, because I have a full-time job with medical benefits from a large employer. I have since been told that since I did not sign up for Medicare three months before I turned 65, I would be paying penalty fees when I do. I just turned 66 and will be retiring next August a month before my 67th birthday. I am so confused and frustrated.\n\nPhil Moeller: It sounds to me like you got bad advice. Large employer plans (meaning plans involving 20 or more employees) cannot force you to take Medicare when you turn 65 (the employer size jumps to 100 for disabled persons). When your employer coverage ends, you will have a special enrollment period of eight months within which you can sign up for Medicare without facing any late-enrollment penalties. If you need \u201cfirepower\u201d to stand up to whomever said you would face penalties, call the Medicare Rights Center\u2019s helpline at 800-333-4114.\n\nBarbara \u2013 Mass.: I am paying higher Medicare premiums based on my high income in 2014. My income will drop enough in 2015 so that I should now be paying the standard $104.90. Will this automatically take place or do I have to contact Social Security or Medicare to discuss it?\n\nPhil Moeller: This is a Social Security matter, as it oversees the Medicare program that deals with income-based Part B and Part D surcharges. This program is called IRMAA, which stands for income-related monthly adjustment amount. There is a two-year lag between when your income changes and when this change is reflected in your Medicare premiums. For example, this year\u2019s premiums will be based on the income reported on your 2013 tax returns, and next year\u2019s will be based on 2014 tax returns. The adjustment should be automatic. But there has been a big projected boost in Part B premiums next year for people paying IRMAA surcharges. So a clarifying call to Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 might make sense to make sure you don\u2019t get hammered unfairly in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pharmaceutical industry convinced enough legislators in 2003 to forbid Medicare from negotiating drug prices when Congress enacted the law creating Part D drug plans.", "pubdate": 20151007, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The pharmaceutical industry convinced enough legislators in 2003 to forbid Medicare from negotiating drug prices when Congress enacted the law creating Part D drug plans.", "title": "Column: Why does Medicare allow for the price gouging of prescription drugs?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medicare-and-uncle-sam.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/medicare-allow-price-gouging-prescription-drugs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The pharmaceutical industry convinced enough legislators in 2003 to forbid Medicare from negotiating drug prices when Congress enacted the law creating Part D drug plans.", "title": "Column: Why does Medicare allow for the price gouging of prescription drugs?", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Medicare-and-uncle-sam.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "medicare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Making Sen$e, Making Sen$e Columnist, medicare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb112\"", "article_summary": "Should I select a \u201ccreditable\u201d private prescription drug plan or a Medicare Part D \u201ccreditable\u201d prescription drug plan?\nIn practice, basing Medicare coverage on your mobility outside the home would create a very slippery slope.\nIf your spouse is 65 or older, she will have to get her own Medicare coverage.\nFirst off, just because you have a high-deductible health plan doesn\u2019t mean your drug coverage is not creditable.\nUnfortunately, pre-tax contributions will no longer be possible, because the United Healthcare HSA prescription drug plan is not \u201ccreditable\u201d \u2014 essentially because the HSA is high deductible."}
