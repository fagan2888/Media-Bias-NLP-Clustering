Shults handled that her usual way: She ignored it. Her failures to appear in court resulted in an arrest warrant and finally an arrest. She spent two weeks in the county jail, awaiting trial or a plea deal, at a cost of $135 a day and with a probable benefit of about zero, for both Shults and taxpayers.\n\nShe was facing 20 to 60 days in jail before her case was diverted to the new Spokane Community Court, an experimental approach for chronic nonviolent offenders. If she sticks to her agreement for six months \u2013 committing no new crimes, connecting with the services she needs, showing up regularly for progress checks, and performing community service \u2013 her case will be dismissed.\n\nLike other problem-solving courts, the community court turns the traditional model of criminal justice on its head by offering as much help as punishment. Instead of emphasizing an endless cycle of short-term jail sentences, it promotes community service and intense supervision. It requires defendants to get help with their problem, whether it\u2019s homelessness, addiction treatment, health care \u2013 or a sandwich. Instead of issuing stacks of failure-to-appear warrants, it tries to build relationships and requirements that bring offenders back to court regularly and begin to forge community connections.\n\n\u201cPeople coming into Municipal Court \u2013 they are not just visitors to the city of Spokane who come in off I-90, commit a crime and leave,\u201d said Judge Mary Logan, who presides over the court. \u201cThey live here.\u201d\n\nIf all we do is repeatedly put them in jail and release them, \u201cWhat do you suppose happens when they walk out that door?\u201d she asks.\n\nWhat happens is what\u2019s already happened. Jail costs escalate. The system \u2013 from police to prosecutors to defense attorneys to probation officials \u2013 falls further and further behind a parade of low-level offenders who are, in effect, trapped in a feedback loop of escalating punishments that compound but never end. The Community Court, based on successful programs in other cities, is an attempt to break that loop. The first cases were heard in December, and the court\u2019s effectiveness will be closely measured by a team from Washington State University. City public defenders, prosecutors, police, probation and library officials are involved, along with representatives of a wide range of social services and programs. The population it aims to help \u2013 the homeless, chronic trespassers and vandals, addicts and the mentally ill \u2013 is one that is notoriously difficult to help, and some of the participants, doubtlessly, will not succeed.\n\nBut the early signs are promising. Certain stubborn reoffenders are taking their first steps toward changing their lives. They are performing community service around the downtown area, part of the overall strategy of starting to build connection and community.\n\nIt\u2019s very different from the traditional ideas of crime and punishment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for some people to swallow,\u201d said Jacqueline van Wormer, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Washington State University who is tracking the court\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nShe said community courts in other cities have shown promise in reducing jail costs and cutting the frequency of repeat offenses. And, however well Spokane\u2019s court works, it\u2019s clear that repeatedly arresting and jailing and releasing people like Shults has not worked.\n\n\u201cJail does not change behavior,\u201d van Wormer said. On the other hand, \u201cProblem-solving courts can be very effective in reducing recidivism if they follow the (right) model.\u201d\n\n\u2018Good job! All right!\u2019\n\nIt is a Monday in March, and Community Court is in session. You might not recognize it as court, though. It convenes at the downtown Spokane library, in the first-floor conference rooms. In one room, social service providers help people apply for housing assistance, sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, seek treatment for drug or alcohol addiction, and connect to other services. A local church provides lunch.\n\nIn a neighboring room, Logan hears cases, sitting at a table between two flags so new the creases haven\u2019t shaken out. The general pattern is services in the morning and court in the afternoon, but things run informally. When the bailiff calls \u201cAll rise,\u201d all do not necessarily rise. Sometimes, it\u2019s because they\u2019re sleeping.\n\nFrancis Adewale is the primary defense attorney assigned to the court. A native of Nigeria, he is also a pastor, author, frequent speaker, advocate for refugees and others \u2013 and a kind of charismatic whirlwind, blending an insistent positivity with frankness.\n\n\u201cDid you do some community service for me?\u201d he asks one client he spots in the hallway.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the man answers.\n\n\u201cGood job! All right!\u201d Adewale hugs him, patting him on the back. \u201cI love it! Are you going to AA?\u201d\n\nThe man, Masecio Spice, 43, was facing a charge of trespassing, and not his first. He described his offense this way: \u201cIt was 3 in the morning. Raining out. A little dry spot, and here come the police.\u201d\n\nSpice said he appreciated the chance to try community court.\n\n\u201cThis is different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. It\u2019s in a library. You get handshakes.\u201d\n\nAlmost all the cases in Community Court involve trespassing, malicious mischief and other nonviolent \u201cquality of life\u201d crimes. In exchange for an eventual dismissal, defendants agree to several conditions: performing community service, connecting with the services they need, regular check-ins at court on Mondays.\n\nCommunity service is a key part of the mix; Logan said offenders have several options for helping out downtown, and officials are devising others. They\u2019re working to develop ways to connect offenders and victims \u2013 to have a graffiti tagger clean up the property he tagged, for example.\n\nIn one recent case, the court brought in a barber to meet the young man who had been charged with theft for skipping out on a haircut. The man, Brandon Pier, has been a persistent panhandler, scrounger and small-time con man around Spokane; so far through Community Court he has apologized to the barber face to face, shown up for his hearings, and been admitted into treatment for his drug addiction.\n\nHe\u2019s not out of the woods, of course. He must stick with the program for at least six months. City Prosecutor Adam Papini told Logan, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be too forgiving yet, Judge.\u201d\n\nStill, Logan was excited.\n\n\u201cThat is hopeful, hopeful news,\u201d she said.\n\nIn jeopardy\n\nTo sit through a session of Community Court is to gain an appreciation of how incredibly complicated the problems of deep poverty can be.\n\nOne man argued truculently with probation officials, was scolded for doing so, decided he would take his chances in traditional court, left \u2013 and then returned to say he\u2019d changed his mind. Another showed up in soaking wet shoes, having walked across town in the snow simply to report that he had met his community service obligations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really commendable,\u201d Logan told him. \u201cIt really says a lot that you came back.\u201d\n\nA single mother told the judge she was struggling to balance several crises at once \u2013 a custody case over her children, the need to work and a lack of transportation that was compounded by the fact that she was banned from the STA Plaza over her trespassing there. How, she asked, was she supposed to start working when she couldn\u2019t catch a bus? Papini asked her to write a letter of apology to STA and bring it the following week; if she did that, he told her, perhaps he could help her resolve the problem at the Plaza. Another woman needed help balancing the scheduling of community service with her inpatient drug and alcohol treatment.\n\nOne formerly homeless man who is known as a \u201cfrequent flier\u201d in local emergency rooms had reached a thorny place in his efforts to reform, battling with those trying to help him. At one point during the hearing, Adewale turned to the man and pleaded, \u201cI\u2019m begging you. \u2026 You are off the streets. You are in housing now. You can\u2019t lose that.\u201d\n\nA young man who police say is one of a handful of \u201ctaggers\u201d responsible for the majority of downtown graffiti pleaded guilty to two charges of malicious mischief, and four others were set aside for now. He would be required to perform community service and get treatment for his meth addiction. Though the court has a problem-solving, helping approach, the threat of possible punishment is a part of the mix, too.\n\nPapini said, \u201cI want this young man to feel in jeopardy \u2013 in jeopardy of more charges and jail time.\u201d\n\nAdewale and Logan both talked about their hopes that the young man might turn his artistic talents in a different direction.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come a long way, but there are still a lot of challenges ahead for him,\u201d Adewale said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to need very heavy hand-holding. This is not going to be easy. The next six months is probably going to be the hardest of his life.\u201d\n\nKeeping track\n\nThe approach will certainly not work for everyone. But whether it works overall \u2013 helps break the cycle of repeat offenders, helps lower costs and improve lives \u2013 will not always be an open question.\n\nVan Wormer, the criminology professor at WSU, will be measuring the court\u2019s effectiveness, and she will present a report after the court\u2019s first six months, and then regularly in later installments. She plans to compare the outcomes of defendants in Community Court who have long records in the traditional court system. But Spokane is not inventing this wheel \u2013 community courts are showing some success in other communities.\n\nShe said certain components are vital: deep collaboration among the different parties, plenty of community service and interaction on the part of offenders, and a strong judge who balances toughness and compassion.\n\nKathy Knox, the head of the city\u2019s public defender\u2019s office, was a major proponent of starting a community court here. She and the attorneys in her office see the ineffectiveness of the revolving jail door firsthand. They also see the deep, intractable problems of many chronic low-level offenders that the traditional justice system does not touch \u2013 problems that can make it impossible, or at least very difficult, for them to even begin to turn their lives around.\n\nOne positive early sign is the number of people who are coming to the library on Mondays who aren\u2019t charged with any crime. More than 125 people have come in simply for \u201cservices\u201d \u2013 for the one-stop shopping of ways they might get help. And the word is spreading.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got street cred,\u201d Knox said with a smile.\n\nAdewale said he has long wanted to see an approach like this one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been crying out for a program like this for years,\u201d he said. \u201cI just love doing this.\u201d\n\nThat comes through. At the start of a recent court session, Adewale addressed the defendants and explained the court to them \u2013 what it would do for them and what they would have to do in return.\n\n\u201cYou have to be willing to accept the offer,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou have a choice not to be part of the Community Court. But if I were you, I would not do that. You will be taken back into the court system on the other side of the river.\u201d\n\nAdewale also emphasized that the defendants are members of the community. He urged them to accept the responsibility that goes with that.\n\n\u201cIt is not only people who are well-to-do who know how to take care of the community,\u201d he said.\n\nShults seems to have taken that message to heart.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all part of the community,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou and me are no different.\u201d\n\nShe is at the front end of a hard journey. A heroin addict, she is awaiting word on whether she can get into housing as a first step toward recovery. Through Community Court, she has taken steps to reapply for Social Security benefits, sign up for health insurance, have her missing teeth replaced, establish mental health treatment, and get on a treatment program to help her kick heroin. She\u2019s had her setbacks, and she\u2019s one of the people the court will try to \u201cwrap around\u201d with services from every direction \u2013 including volunteers who will take extra steps to ensure she gets to all her appointments.\n\nStill, Shults says that for the first time, she\u2019s showing up for court and telling the truth about her problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing for me. \u2026 Being honest with these guys is the biggest part of me changing.\u201d\n\nShe has another powerful incentive to show up on Mondays. Her 21-year-old son is in Community Court, too. Shults gave birth to him when she was 17, living on the streets and in shelters, and lost touch with him for years.\n\n\u201cNow I see him every Monday,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see how we\u2019re both progressing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Aubrey Shults landed in jail in January, it was the end of a long, sad slide.
