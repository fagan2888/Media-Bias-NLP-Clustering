Nathan Deal\u2019s office confirmed the move. In a statement, the governor said: \u201cLanier Tech has outgrown its current property, and this money is for a new campus and for the planning needed to bring this vision to reality. Lanier Tech is providing a high-quality education and giving students the job skills needed in today\u2019s workforce.\u201d\n\nPerren said he can speculate what the new campus will include, but he cannot say for sure.\n\n\u201cMy assumption is what we have here, we will move and have somewhere else,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Oakwood campus opened in January 1967, and many of the facilities and buildings are dated or too small for the growing student needs.\n\nIn 2014, 3,277 students enrolled and attended classes on the Oakwood campus\u2019 43 acres behind the University of North Georgia\u2019s Gainesville campus near Mundy Mill Road and Thurmon Tanner Parkway near Interstate 985.\n\nPerren said relocating to a new campus would help the college attract students and would give it a better sense of identity.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the older campuses in the system,\u201d Perren said. \u201cGainesville-Hall County is one of the premiere centers for manufacturing and health care in northeast Georgia. Our mission is, of course, workforce development. Our mission is to be sure that manufacturing, health care and whoever has the workforce they need to grow.\u201d\n\nPerren said the allied health facility on the Oakwood campus has reached its capacity. It was built in 1975, and health care technology and needs have changed dramatically in the last 40 years.\n\nLanier Tech was also named Georgia\u2019s Technical College of the Year in 2014 by the state board of the Technical College System of Georgia. Perren said the college will need to expand in Hall County in order to continue its level of excellence.\n\n\u201cThe need is definitely there for us to either get new buildings or relocate,\u201d Perren said. \u201cWe definitely need more facilities to do the job we\u2019ve been charged with doing as far as workforce development.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/108853/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Lanier Technical College will relocate its current Oakwood campus to another location in Hall County, school and state officials announced Thursday.", "title": "State money will go toward land for new Lanier Tech campus"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "State money will go toward land for new Lanier Tech campus"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce412\"", "article_summary": "Lanier Technical College will relocate its current Oakwood campus to another location in Hall County, school and state officials announced Thursday.\nLanier Tech was also named Georgia\u2019s Technical College of the Year in 2014 by the state board of the Technical College System of Georgia.\nThe Oakwood campus opened in January 1967, and many of the facilities and buildings are dated or too small for the growing student needs.\nThe money for the land purchase was included in the budget approved this week by the state legislature.\nIn 2014, 3,277 students enrolled and attended classes on the Oakwood campus\u2019 43 acres behind the University of North Georgia\u2019s Gainesville campus near Mundy Mill Road and Thurmon Tanner Parkway near Interstate 985."}
