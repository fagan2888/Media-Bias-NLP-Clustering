Bush political advisor Karl Rove and former GOP lobbyist and now Virginia Senate candidate Ed Gillespie, spent the money October 21 on TV ads, media production and ad placements, Political Moneyline reported.

Patriot Majority doesn't disclose its donors, while the Senate Majority and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee disclose contributors.\n\nThe Senate Majority PAC is led by two former aides to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Republicans say that Reid has blocked votes to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline and other bills to create more oil and gas jobs.\n\nA total of $418,170, all from the Senate Conservatives Fund, was spent to promote the candidacy of Tea Party Republican Rob Maness.
