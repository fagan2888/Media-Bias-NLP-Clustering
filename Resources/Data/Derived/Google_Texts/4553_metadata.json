(AP) \u2014 The roar of mammoth Air Force bombers and tanker planes has long been silenced at the Grand Forks Air Force Base, but backers of the nation\u2019s first unmanned aircraft business park say the drones are creating a buzz.\n\nConstruction on the Grand Sky grounds won\u2019t likely begin until May, but national and international companies are jockeying for position in the 1.2 million-square-foot park that sits near the former alert pad where bombers and tankers were poised for takeoff on a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nNorth Dakota is one six sites around the country testing unmanned aircraft, for which some Americans have lingering concerns about privacy and safety. The new park\u2019s tenants are likely to be researching and developing drones for a host of applications \u2014 farming, law enforcement, energy, infrastructure management, public safety, coastal security, military training, search and rescue and disaster response.\n\nDefense technology giant Northrop Grumman, based in Falls Church, Virginia, has already signed a letter of intent to anchor the park and more big names are likely to follow suit, Grand Sky Development President Tom Swoyer said. He added he met with representatives from two prospective companies last week, including a \u201chousehold name in the unmanned system industry\u201d that he would not identify.\n\n\u201cCompanies in the industry are starting to take notice,\u201d Swoyer said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of input.\u201d\n\nOne company looking to get into the ground floor of Grand Sky is Smart C2, a fledgling software business that picked North Dakota for its home base because of the state\u2019s commitment to unmanned aircraft. Stuart Rudolph, company president and CEO, said the park will have all the key players in one space.\n\n\u201cGrand Sky is going to be the melting pot,\u201d Rudolph said. He noted other favorable factors, such as access to talent at the base, University of North Dakota aerospace school and a nearby technical school; government support; private equity financing and lots of airspace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roar of bombers replaced by drone buzz in North Dakota", "author": "Dave Kolpack", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Roar of bombers replaced by drone buzz in North Dakota", "title": "Roar of bombers replaced by drone buzz in North Dakota", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/roar_of_bombers_replaced_by_drone_buzz_in_north_dakota/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/drone-development-north-dakota.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Roar of bombers replaced by drone buzz in North Dakota", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/drone-development-north-dakota.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Roar of bombers replaced by drone buzz in North Dakota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Roar of bombers replaced by drone buzz in North Dakota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "North Dakota is one six sites around the country testing unmanned aircraft, for which some Americans have lingering concerns about privacy and safety.\n\u201cGrand Sky is going to be the melting pot,\u201d Rudolph said.\nHe noted other favorable factors, such as access to talent at the base, University of North Dakota aerospace school and a nearby technical school; government support; private equity financing and lots of airspace.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of input.\u201dOne company looking to get into the ground floor of Grand Sky is Smart C2, a fledgling software business that picked North Dakota for its home base because of the state\u2019s commitment to unmanned aircraft.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsFARGO, N.D.
