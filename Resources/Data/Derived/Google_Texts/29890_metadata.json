Tapper is, after all, one of the more interesting, sharp and watchable people on television. He could actually inject some much-needed life into the eternally dismal Sunday current affairs landscape.\n\nIf his ascension to the Sunday throne isn\u2019t a cause for outrage, though, it still provides a depressing look at the cringeworthy lack of diversity in much of our elite media. Taken together with the recent promotion of John Dickerson to replace Bob Schieffer at \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d the Tapper news means that all five major Sunday shows will now be hosted by white men.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n\u201cMeet the Press\u201d (NBC) \u2014 Chuck Todd\n\n\u201cFace the Nation\u201d (CBS) \u2014 John Dickerson\n\n\u201cThis Week\u201d (ABC) \u2014 George Stephanopoulos\n\n\u201cState of the Union\u201d (CNN) \u2014 Jake Tapper\n\n\u201cFox News Sunday\u201d \u2014 Chris Wallace\n\nIf you throw in the big three newscasts on CBS, NBC and ABC, that\u2019s seven out of eight highly prestigious jobs in TV news currently being occupied by white guys. The lone exception to the rule is Lester Holt, currently serving as the interim anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d meaning if the network brings Brian Williams back from his time in purgatory (however unlikely that eventuality might now be), white newsmen could make it a clean sweep.\n\nBy my rough calculation, the five big Sunday shows have been on the air a combined 187 years. In that time, women have hosted or co-hosted for 26 of those years. \u201cMeet the Press\u201d hasn\u2019t had a female host since 1953. Racial diversity? Forget about it. They\u2019ve also all been straight (unless there\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about). And\u2014well, you get the picture.\n\nYou could ask if this matters so much these days, when the fracturing of the media landscape has left both the nightly and the Sunday news shows with nothing like their past influence, and when the true network money centers \u2014 morning shows like \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and the \u201cToday\u201d show\u2013 are light-years ahead in terms of both racial and gender diversity. The biggest star in morning TV, Robin Roberts, is an African-American lesbian, about as potent a symbol of media progress as you\u2019re likely to get.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If it's Sunday, it's lots of white dudes (and not much else)", "title": "TV\u2019s white-guy industrial complex: Sunday morning\u2019s shocking lack of diversity has gotten even worse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If it's Sunday, it's lots of white dudes (and not much else)", "title": "TV\u2019s white-guy industrial complex: Sunday morning\u2019s shocking lack of diversity has gotten even worse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/tvs_white_guy_industrial_complex_sunday_mornings_shocking_lack_of_diversity_has_gotten_even_worse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/chuck_todd2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If it's Sunday, it's lots of white dudes (and not much else)", "title": "TV\u2019s white-guy industrial complex: Sunday morning\u2019s shocking lack of diversity has gotten even worse", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/chuck_todd2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jack Mirkinson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, chuck todd, face the nation, Jake Tapper, John Dickerson, meet the press, State of the Union, The Sunday Shows", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7b6\"", "article_summary": "Tapper is, after all, one of the more interesting, sharp and watchable people on television.\nBy my rough calculation, the five big Sunday shows have been on the air a combined 187 years.\nThe biggest star in morning TV, Robin Roberts, is an African-American lesbian, about as potent a symbol of media progress as you\u2019re likely to get.\nHe could actually inject some much-needed life into the eternally dismal Sunday current affairs landscape.\nIf his ascension to the Sunday throne isn\u2019t a cause for outrage, though, it still provides a depressing look at the cringeworthy lack of diversity in much of our elite media."}
