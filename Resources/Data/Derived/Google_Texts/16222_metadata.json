The small Iowa town in which the story unfolds gives the book its title and is where the protagonist, Rev. John Ames, composes his letter to his young son.\n\nIn a review in the Nation of Robinson\u2019s 2014 novel, \u2018Lila,\u2019 which forms a trilogy with \u2018Gilead\u2019 and \u2018Home,\u2019 writer Roxana Robinson described the town as \u201ca safe, domesticated place where people work in their gardens and hang out their wash. Children swing in the backyard and swim in the river\u2026. There is no sense of physical danger here; the most powerful conflicts are intellectual, emotional and moral.\u201d\n\nGilead, where children are safe playing on their own and Ames himself wanders outdoors when he can\u2019t sleep, is where the minister has spent almost all but two of his seventy-six years. Ames writes: \u201cIt was on the nights I didn\u2019t sleep at all and I didn\u2019t feel like reading that I\u2019d walk through town at one or two o\u2019clock. In the old days I could walk down every single street, past every house, in about an hour. I\u2019d try to remember the people who lived in each one, and whatever I knew about them, which was often quite a lot\u2026And I\u2019d pray for them.\u201d\n\nAs Rev. Ames\u2019s health fails, his daily circuit becomes even more circumscribed, limited largely to the home he shares with his young wife and son and the church where he has preached for decades.\n\nGilead in the mid-1950s seems a reassuring, remote place of solid Midwestern values. Ames himself refers to it affectionately as \u201ca shabby little town\u201d and his attachment to it\u2014and, perhaps, a sense that Gilead\u2019s distinctive qualities may not outlast him for long\u2014flows like an undercurrent through the book.\n\nSpeaking of his church, Ames writes, \u201cThe light in the room was beautiful this morning, as it often is. It\u2019s a plain old church and it could use a coat of paint. But in the dark times I used to walk over before sunrise just to sit there and watch the light come into that room. I don\u2019t know how beautiful it might seem to anyone else.\u201d\n\nAlthough Robinson doesn\u2019t have Ames dwell on descriptions of the town\u2019s layout\u2014such as stores, a post office and the like, she establishes a very assured portrait of the place.
