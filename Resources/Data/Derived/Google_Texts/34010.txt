Sioux Falls, SD

The fifth annual Paint the Plows event takes place Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Empire Mall.

27 plows will be on display in the JCPenney north parking lot of the Empire Mall.

Everyone is welcome to attend and vote for their favorite. The plows are set up to viewed by car or foot. Those who participated can pick up their certificates during this time as well.

The plows are primed by the Street Division and the schools and organizations supply the paint. The plows are delivered at the end of August to the participating schools or organizations and are completed by the first week of October.

The top three favorites will be featured in the Parade of Light in downtown Sioux Falls.
