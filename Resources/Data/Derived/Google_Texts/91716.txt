Krugman: Rubio is not the GOP's only 'broken record' Paul Krugman says the senator's repetitious performance at the debate epitomizes the entire party's reliance on spin and adherence to dogma.

By now everyone who follows politics knows about Marco Rubio's software-glitch performance in Saturday's Republican debate. (I'd say broken-record performance, but that would be showing my age.) Not only did he respond to a challenge from Chris Christie about his lack of achievements by repeating, verbatim, the same line from his stump speech he had used a moment earlier; when Christie mocked his canned delivery, he repeated the same line yet again.
