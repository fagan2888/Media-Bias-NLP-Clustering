The Alliance for Justice gushed that Liu \u201chas spent his career advocating for the right of equal justice for all, not a select, privileged few.\u201d Here, liberals thought, was a true believer who might be able to move from the farm team of the appeals court to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he might be the first Asian American justice.\n\nUnfortunately, the liberals\u2019 dream was a nightmare for Senate Republicans. In a time-dishonored tradition, they blocked Liu\u2019s confirmation, and he withdrew his name from consideration. But then, in 2011, Gov. Jerry Brown nominated Liu for a seat on the California Supreme Court. State supreme courts also have proved to be on-deck spots for future U.S. Supreme Court justices, including the liberal lion Justice William Brennan, who had served on the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n\nBut Liu, who faces a retention vote in the November election, may have blotted his copybook in the eyes of some liberals this week. Liu joined his colleagues in ordering the removal from the November ballot of a question asking voters if Congress should propose, and the California Legislature ratify, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution overturning the Citizens United ruling.\n\nThat\u2019s the 2010 decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that corporations have a 1st Amendment right to spend unlimited money on independent political expenditures. As I have noted before, Citizens United is for some progressives what Obamacare is for some conservatives \u2014 an obsession that sometimes leads to derangement.\n\nLiu didn\u2019t just join his colleagues in shelving the anti-Citizens-United Proposition 49 until the court could hear arguments on a challenge to its legality. He filed a concurring opinion that, without committing himself to a final conclusion, suggested strongly that the Legislature exceeded its power in voting to put Proposition 49, a purely advisory measure, on the ballot.\n\nCitizens United is for some progressives what Obamacare is for some conservatives -- an obsession that sometimes leads to derangement. \u2014 &nbp;\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating (and I think persuasive) opinion that examines the proposition in the light of the California Constitution\u2019s apportioning of power between the Legislature and the people, both of whom can make binding law. Liu wrote that both parties in the case conceded that \u201cProposition 49 is not an initiative or a referendum because it does not propose to enact any law.\u201d\n\nLiu explained that a measure asking voters to advise legislators on how to vote blurs the line between the roles of the Legislature and the people. \u201cThe California Constitution draws a clear line between lawmaking by the Legislature and lawmaking by the citizenry through the ballot,\" he wrote. \u201cIt does not contemplate a mix-and-match approach.\u201d\n\nWill Liu\u2019s opinion cost him retention votes in November or chill liberal ardor for him as a potential U.S. Supreme Court justice? I hope not, but emotions run high on anything connected to Citizens United.\n\nAfter the state Supreme Court\u2019s order, I got an email from a group called \u201cYes On 49/Money Out Voters In.\u201d It said in part: \u201cThe California Supreme Court is trying to ensure that we will not be able to speak. Instead, we are determined to be even louder. Now is your chance to make your voice heard... We\u2019ve started a petition to the court letting them know that California voters want a chance to speak out on this issue. Please sign it today. This is not over. We the People will not be silenced!\u201d\n\nEven by liberal judges.\n\nFollow Michael McGough on Twitter @MichaelMcGough3", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Et tu, Liu?
