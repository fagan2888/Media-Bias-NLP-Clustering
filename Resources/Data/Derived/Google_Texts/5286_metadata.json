As the United States seems to be progressing with regard to gay rights, transgendered people are still facing the brunt of discrimination in the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) community. According to a new report, these societal pressures have led 41 percent of the transgender community to attempt suicide.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS), looking for \u201clinks between minority stressors and suicidal behavior among transgender and gender non-conforming individuals,\u201d said Jody L. Herman, of the University of California, Los Angeles Law School Williams Institute, in a statement. \u201cThis is a critical first step in efforts to address the negative mental health impacts of anti-transgender discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe survey asked more than 6,400 transgender people about any experiences with discrimination and abuse while at work, school, home, or in public \u2014 it also looked at the effects these acts had on the person. Astoundingly, 78 percent of respondents who said that they experienced sexual or physical violence at school also said that they\u2019d tried to commit suicide. When it came to those who experienced the same discrimination at work, 65 percent said they had tried to kill themselves.\n\nBut physical and sexual abuse is only part of the problem. Transgender people face various problems, all of which contribute to a harder life to live. Their gender-change can cause confusion and disapproval in family, friends, and those around them, causing added stress. The simplest tasks, like going to the restroom, become difficult \u2014 should they go in the men\u2019s or women\u2019s? \u2014 as they risk discrimination from anyone inside.\n\nFinding a job is also difficult because of a risk of bias on the interviewer\u2019s side, and once they have that job, the risk of losing it because of discrimination is generally high too, at 47 percent. At that, transitioning from one gender to another while already having a job puts it at risk. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a clause like an anti-discrimination rule, people can be let go if they transition,\u201d clinical psychologist Gail Knudson, medical director of the Transgender Health Program at Vancouver Coastal Health, told LiveScience.\n\nStill, many transgender people must go through with their transition in order to be happy, Knudson told LiveScience. Once they\u2019ve dealt with medical expenses \u2014 insurance rarely pays for it \u2014 and gone through guidelines known as Standards of Care, which first require them to live and present themselves as their preferred gender for many months, they can get the surgery. Even with all the trouble, they become happier and substance abuse lessens. \u201cFor their lives to go forward they need to transition,\u201d Knudson told LiveScience. \u201cA lot of the health care providers that work in the field see transitioning as a medical necessity \u2014 not as something people chose to do, but as something they need to do to lead productive lives.\u201d\n\nSource: Haas A, Rodgers P, Herman J.
