I attended the meeting, but was forced to leave when Harbaugh arrived. Insisting the meeting was \u201cprivate,\u201d administrators then barred entry to the press and anyone else not on a preapproved list.\n\nDid Harbaugh apologize to the students? I don\u2019t know. After 1 hour and 30 minutes, the room opened and everyone left. I asked nearly every person to comment, but all of them\u2014including Harbaugh himself\u2014refused.\n\nThe event was initially advertised as one in which Harbaugh would \u201cbe issuing a private apology to Middle Eastern, North African, Muslim, and South Asian students,\u201d according to an email sent by student activist Lamees Mekkaoui, who spearheaded efforts to get the American Sniper screening cancelled last month. Harbaugh had tweeted in support of screening the movie:\n\n\u201cMichigan Football will watch \"American Sniper\"! Proud of Chris Kyle & Proud to be an American & if that offends anybody then so be it!\n\nAdministrators eventually decided to screen American Sniper, but also showed the comparatively tame Paddington as an alternative for offended students.\n\nAfter informing her fellow activists that Harbaugh would be apologizing, Mekkaoui sent a follow-up email clarifying that she had been mistaken:\n\nI would like to make a correction in my email. I made the mistake of assuming that an apology would be issued. However, Coach Jim Harbaugh was simply invited to a private meeting with us in order to talk about the screening of American Sniper and get a dialogue going about how a university leader's social media can impact campus climate.\n\nThe meeting was held in a classroom-sized room in the student union. I arrived early, but waited outside the door until Harbaugh appeared with a university photographer and another administrator. I then followed them inside and took a seat. A student organizer asked me to identify myself, and instructed me to leave after I revealed that I was a journalist. I asked to be allowed to just listen-in on the conversation, but Harbaugh\u2019s people insisted that the event was private and closed to the press. I appealed to Harbaugh himself, but he wouldn\u2019t meet my gaze. Once it was clear there was nothing I could do to remain in the room, I left.\n\nAfter that, the entrance was barred to anyone not a preapproved list\u2014including student reporters with The Michigan Daily, who turned up a bit later.\n\nI was then approached by a middle-aged-woman who had access to the meeting. She asked me if I needed her help, so I repeated my request to sit in. She explained that that was never going to happen and asked me whether I had taken any pictures. Indeed, I had\u2014though only of Harbaugh, before he entered the room. The woman asked me not to take any more pictures and asserted that I was making the students \u201cunsafe.\u201d\n\nAfter it was over, I followed Harbaugh down the hallway: He repeated several times that the meeting \u201cwent great,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t say anything else. Event organizers also declined comment. University Public Relations Director Rick Fitzgerald told me that the meeting was always intended to be private. A Michigan Daily reporter asked him whether there were any ulterior reasons for the incredible secrecy; Fitzgerald reiterated his stance.\n\nThe students were clearly coached not to speak to the press; none would answer any questions about what had transpired. The Michigan Daily reporters appeared to have no more luck than I.\n\nI don\u2019t dispute that the students have every right to conduct a private meeting, though I can\u2019t help but wonder what purpose such militant secrecy serves. Did the perpetually offended campus left just deal Harbaugh his first defeat as Wolverines head coach\u2014months before the season even begun? Or did he defend himself? We may never know.\n\nFor more on the American Sniper controversy at UM, read my exclusive report on an act of vandalism perpetrated by a liberal Muslim student leader.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Discussion between Harbaugh and students conducted behind locked doors.", "title": "What Did U-M Coach Jim Harbaugh Say to Offended Students?
