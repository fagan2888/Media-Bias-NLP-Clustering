CLEVELAND, Ohio -- In an effort to raise awareness about the care that it provides to people with health insurance, the Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland will hold its first Community Outreach Health Fair from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, July 26.

The Free Clinic is located at 12201 Euclid Ave., Cleveland.

With an expanded Medicaid program and the Affordable Care Act making it possible for more people to get health insurance, the Free Clinic is on a new mission: convincing people who aren't insured to change that.

"We are trying to help people get enrolled in plans if they haven't done so already," said Free Clinic spokeswoman Donna Korn. Even though the majority of patients who seek medical care at the Free Clinic qualify for Medicaid, "Only about 20 percent of patients are enrolled," she said.

"There is a lot of suspicion from people who applied [for Medicaid] in the past and didn't get it," Korn said. "A lot of people also don't understand the Affordable Care Act."

The Free Clinic is typically open every other Saturday as a walk-in clinic. The July 26 event is for everyone â€“ including teens and people who have Medicare coverage.

In addition to Medicaid enrollment, people can get testing for STIs and dental education. The event also will feature food, fresh produce, and door prizes.

For information, call (216) 707-3438.
