It's not practical to write down every possible disease in the universe that could possibly respond to the treatment, he said, even in the future.\n\n\"To put this all in a list in the constitution is not a good policy decision,\" Mills said.\n\n\"If I suffered from chronic back pain, is that a condition or a disease?\" asked Justice Barbara Pariente. \"I thought this could only be prescribed for horrible conditions.\"\n\nOn the back-pain question, it would be up to the individual physician, based on the language in both the summary and proposed amendment. Winsor maintained that certain phrasing in the amendment would give physicians immunity from state disciplinary action or civil suits if their pot-prescribing results in harm.\n\nBut Mills said nothing in the amendment takes away the statutory authority of the Department of Health to discipline physicians whose prescribing falls outside the \"standard of care.\"\n\nAs Justice R. Fred Lewis reminded the packed courtroom, the court must decide only whether the ballot language is misleading -- not whether prescribing medical marijuana is a good idea.\n\nThe court usually delays a decision for months, but this one is expected to come sooner, since proponents are gathering signatures for the ballot. They have to gather nearly 700,000 and have them validated.\n\nThe summary says: \u201cAllows the medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating diseases as determined by a licensed Florida physician. Allows caregivers to assist patients\u2019 medical use of marijuana. The Department of Health shall register and regulate centers that produce and distribute marijuana for medical purposes and shall issue identification cards to patients and caregivers. Applies only to Florida law. Does not authorize violations of federal law or any non-medical use, possession or production of marijuana.\u201d\n\nIn order to go into effect, voters would have to pass it by 60 percent.\n\nThe South Florida Sun-Sentinel answers basic questions about the issue.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida Supreme Court justices who will decide whether medical marijuana will come up for a vote next November kept asking the same question over and over", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/disease-vs-condition-courts-debate", "type": "article", "description": "Florida Supreme Court justices who will decide whether medical marijuana will come up for a vote next November kept asking the same question over and over", "title": "Disease vs. Condition:  Court's Debate"}, "story_id": 248998068, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Carol Gentry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Disease vs. Condition:  Court&#039;s Debate"}, "nid": 4819, "datePublished": "2013-12-05", "keywords": "medical marijuana, Florida Supreme Court, marijuana, Pam Bondi, John Morgan, disease, medical condition", "wordCount": 640, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd33\"", "article_summary": "\"We all know there is a wide variety of opinions in the medical community about marijuana,\" Winsor said.\nAs Justice R.
