MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — It looks like Elvis Presley’s airplanes are staying at Graceland after all.

Graceland released a statement Sunday saying the Lisa Marie and the Hound Dog II, two custom-designed airplanes once owned by Presley, will remain permanently at the Memphis tourist attraction centered on the life and career of the late singer.

The announcement ends confusion about the future of the planes, once used by the King for travel to performances after he bought them in the 1970s.

The larger plane, a Convair 880 named after Presley’s daughter Lisa Marie, is like a customized flying limousine, complete with a large bed, a stereo system, conference room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. It was renovated after Presley bought it from Delta Air Lines. Presley took his first flight on it in November 1975.

When Presley died on Aug. 16, 1977, Presley’s pilot flew the Lisa Marie to California to pick up Presley’s ex-wife, Priscilla Presley, to bring her back to Memphis.

The smaller jet, a JetStar named the Hound Dog II, was also used by Presley.

The planes were sold after Presley’s death, and they were eventually purchased by a company called OKC Partnership.

OKC Partnership and Graceland agreed to park the planes at Graceland in the mid-1980s, and tours of their opulent interiors became popular with visitors. Their agreement called for OKC Partnership to receive a cut of ticket sales in return for keeping the planes at Graceland.

But the fate of the planes became cloudy last year.
