Gary Herbert's private-sector alternative called Healthy Utah.\n\nBut House Speaker Greg Hughes and Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan are allergic to anything that helps the working class or implies that President Obama might have had a good idea. So, with Healthy Utah dead in its tracks, the mayors and the governor took what they could get.\n\nThat plan, focused on the chronically homeless, the mentally ill and those in the criminal justice system, is different enough from the ACA vision that it requires a waiver from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThat is the trigger for a series of public hearings and an opportunity for people to make their views known online. (Details at health.utah.gov/MedicaidExpansion/ )\n\nIt wouldn't help much to oppose the plan now, as the only realistic alternative, were the feds not to approve it, would be for nothing at all to happen.\n\nReal improvement will take a revolt at the polls and a Utah Legislature that's as intelligent and decent as the people of the state.
