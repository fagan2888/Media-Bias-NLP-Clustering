Baltimore paid at least $8 million for the technology.\n\nThe city has since purchased a new integrated tax billing system made by another company. Officials are in the process of moving from the more than 30-year-old legacy billing system to the new one. The city began using the new system to process personal property tax bills a year ago.\n\nA Unisys spokesman said the company stands by its work.\n\nywenger@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/yvonnewenger", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "City wins $5M in settlement over development of faulty property tax software", "date": "2015-04-15", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "Baltimore officials accepted a $5 million settlement Wednesday from the designer of a property tax billing system the city maintained was riddled with problems.", "title": "City wins $5M in settlement over development of faulty property tax software", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-unisys-settlement-20150415-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-552eecd0/turbine/bs-md-ci-unisys-settlement-20150415", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/83308053", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Baltimore property tax software errors", "news_keywords": "Baltimore property tax software errors", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Baltimore officials accepted a $5 million settlement Wednesday from the designer of a property tax billing system the city maintained was riddled with problems."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea97\"", "article_summary": "Baltimore officials accepted a $5 million settlement Wednesday from the designer of a property tax billing system the city maintained was riddled with problems.\nThe city began using the new system to process personal property tax bills a year ago.\nThe city has since purchased a new integrated tax billing system made by another company.\nCity officials said the system never went online.\nOfficials are in the process of moving from the more than 30-year-old legacy billing system to the new one."}
