Marco Rubio (R-FL), with just one day before the New Hampshire Republican Primary.\n\nIn explaining his appeal to voters in a Monday town hall, Kasich told a Democratic primary voter:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe gotta get hope back in the country again. Hillary is too brittle, and Bernie is way out here on the extreme. I\u2019m the right porridge. One of them is too hot, the other is too cold, but I got the right temperature.\u201d\n\nThe Gravis Marketing poll seems to indicate that a large swath of voters agree Gov. Kasich has the \u201cright porridge.\u201d He is now in second place in the poll, trailing frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s 28 percent with 17 percent support among likely voters. He is followed by Rubio with 15 percent, Jeb Bush with 14 percent, and Ted Cruz, who grabbed 11 percent from the likely voters surveyed.\n\nThough Gov. Chris Christie was commended for his strong performance in the ABC News Republican debate on Saturday night, the polling does not indicate that the citizens of New Hampshire have gotten behind the New Jersey Governor. He retains only 6 percent support among likely voters, with Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson trailing, accumulating 5 and 3 percent respectively.\n\nOther polls continue to indicate that the race for second in New Hampshire remains wide open, with Rubio, Cruz, Kasich, and Bush consistently polling in the double-digits in The Granite State.\n\nGov. Kasich has indicated that he would go \u201chome to Ohio\u201d if he finished poorly in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cIf I get smoked here I\u2019m going home to Ohio\u2026but I really want to go on, and it\u2019s going to depend on this state how I do,\u201d he told supporters in New Hampshire last week. \u201cOur campaign will take a look at how we do on the 10th of February and then we\u2019ll make a decision. We expect to finish high. I\u2019ve said all along, if we get smoked up there, you know, I\u2019m going back to Ohio. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Kasich\u2019s Got the \u2018Right Porridge,\u2019 Surges over Rubio in New Hampshire Post-Debate Poll", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "John Kasich\u2019s Got the \u2018Right Porridge,\u2019 Surges over Rubio in New Hampshire Post-Debate Poll", "title": "John Kasich\u2019s Got the \u2018Right Porridge,\u2019 Surges over Rubio in New Hampshire Post-Debate Poll - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3672, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/ap_john-kasich_ap-photo.jpg", "height": 2220}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/08/john-kasichs-got-the-right-porridge-surges-over-rubio-in-new-hampshire-post-debate-poll/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Kasich\u2019s Got the \u2018Right Porridge,\u2019 Surges over Rubio in New Hampshire Post-Debate Poll", "title": "John Kasich\u2019s Got the \u2018Right Porridge,\u2019 Surges over Rubio in New Hampshire Post-Debate Poll - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/ap_john-kasich_ap-photo.jpg", "creator": "@JordanSchachtel", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016, 2016 GOP Primary, John Kasich, Kasich Surges, New Hampshire, New Hampshire Republican primary, poll, Right Porridge,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,John Kasich", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Right Porridge", "published_time": "2016-02-08T14:00:22-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "He retains only 6 percent support among likely voters, with Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson trailing, accumulating 5 and 3 percent respectively.\nKasich has the \u201cright porridge.\u201d He is now in second place in the poll, trailing frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s 28 percent with 17 percent support among likely voters.\nHe is followed by Rubio with 15 percent, Jeb Bush with 14 percent, and Ted Cruz, who grabbed 11 percent from the likely voters surveyed.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA post-debate poll published Monday afternoon reveals that Ohio Governor John Kasich has jumped over establishment rival Sen.
