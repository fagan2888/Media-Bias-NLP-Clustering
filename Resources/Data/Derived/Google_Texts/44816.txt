As international ceremonies commemorated Holocaust Remembrance Day this week, a new report revealed the sobering reality that, with little safety nets available, a significant number of an estimated 189,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel struggle to find enough money to heat their homes or eat regularly.

According to a new report published by the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust Victims in Israel, the average age of a Holocaust survivor is 83, two-thirds are women, and nearly a quarter live below the poverty line with an income less than $870 a month.

The report also found that 27 percent of survivors, who don’t have pensions or rely on government aid, can’t afford to heat their homes during the winter. Many need help with groceries and regular medical care. The report says that with each day that passes, 40 survivors die.

According to the report, nearly half — 46 percent — of survivors said the Holocaust will be forgotten once they’re gone. More so, 36 percent live alone, while 45 percent of survivors report feeling lonely.

The Israeli general public tends to agree that Holocaust survivors have a difficult time getting by. The study found that three-quarters of Israelis think the nation does not do a good job of taking care of survivors.
