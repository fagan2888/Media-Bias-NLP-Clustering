Obama bowed to political pressure from his fellow Democrats on Thursday and announced a plan to let insurers renew for one year the health plans for Americans whose policies would be otherwise canceled due to Obamacare. REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) - RTX15DNW\n\n3972427\n\nA downbeat President Barack Obama repeatedly asked his worried supporters Monday night to help resurrect his spirits, following weeks of political disasters and personal humiliations caused by the cascading collapse of Obamacare. The distracted president railed against opponents and at one point appeared to forget the number of people in the Obamacare system during the rambling quarter-hour address.\n\n\u201cMy main message is I\u2019m going to need your help, your energy, your faith, your ability to reach out to neighbors, kids and friends [and] co-workers,\u201d he told listeners to the Internet broadcast arranged by his grassroots group, Organizing for Action.\n\nBut his worried followers would also benefit from proselytizing for Obama and Obamacare, Obama suggested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never lost faith in our ability to get this done\u2026 you guys have lifted me up, and lifted each other up at every step of the way, and I know you\u2019re going to just keep on doing that,\u201d he said during his 14-minute sermon.\n\n\u2018We have experienced discouragement and setbacks and naysayers every step of the way, but you know when you\u2019re on the right side of something, then it gives you energy, it gives you motivation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll the people out there who need help, everybody out there who is working hard but just finding that the system kinda feels rigged against him\u2026 that\u2019s got to motivate us,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his monologue, he made a mistake that illustrates the strain he\u2019s facing while trying to save his Obamacare network.\n\n\u201cIn the first month alone, we\u2019ve seen more than 100 million Americans already successfully enroll in the new insurance plans,\u201d he said, inaccurately referring to the 106,000 Americans who managed to pick a health-benefit plan via the cripple website.\n\nThe broadcast was audio-only, and conducted after the evening news. That media strategy will likely minimize TV coverage of his speech and despondent mood, while still allowing him to reach his political base.\n\nAfter past political defeats, including the 2011 budget negotiations, Obama showed reduced energy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "'I\u2019m going to need your help, your energy, your faith, your ability'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A downbeat President Barack Obama repeatedly asked his worried supporters Monday night to help resurrect his spirits, following weeks of political disasters and personal humiliations caused by the cas", "title": "Morose Obama asks his base for psychological intervention", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/19/morose-obama-asks-his-base-for-psychological-intervention/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sad-obama.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'I\u2019m going to need your help, your energy, your faith, your ability'", "title": "Morose Obama asks his base for psychological intervention Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/19/morose-obama-asks-his-base-for-psychological-intervention/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sad-obama.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-19 03:11:23", "sailthru.title": "Morose Obama asks his base for psychological intervention", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,obamacare,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "barack obama,obamacare,organizing for action,organizing for america", "sailthru.description": "A downbeat President Barack Obama repeatedly asked his worried supporters Monday night to help resurrect his spirits, following weeks of political disasters and personal humiliations caused by the cas", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sad-obama.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7d9\"", "article_summary": "But his worried followers would also benefit from proselytizing for Obama and Obamacare, Obama suggested.\nU.S. President Barack Obama pauses while talking about the Affordable Care Act in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, November 14, 2013.\nAfter past political defeats, including the 2011 budget negotiations, Obama showed reduced energy.\nThat media strategy will likely minimize TV coverage of his speech and despondent mood, while still allowing him to reach his political base.\nDuring his monologue, he made a mistake that illustrates the strain he\u2019s facing while trying to save his Obamacare network."}
