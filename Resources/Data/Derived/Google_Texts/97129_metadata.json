At the Arg, the presidential palace in Kabul, Ashraf Ghani was sworn in as president, while the outgoing Hamid Karzai watched calmly from a front-row seat. Washington, congratulating itself on this \u201cpeaceful transition,\u201d quickly collected the new president\u2019s autograph on a bilateral security agreement that assures the presence of American forces in Afghanistan for at least another decade. The big news of the day: the U.S. got what it wanted. (Precisely why Americans should rejoice that our soldiers will stay in Afghanistan for another 10 years is never explained.)\n\nThe big news of the day for Afghans was quite different \u2014 not the long expected continuation of the American occupation but what the new president had to say in his inaugural speech about his wife, Rula Ghani. Gazing at her as she sat in the audience, he called her by name, praised her work with refugees, and announced that she would continue that work during his presidency.\n\nThose brief comments sent progressive Afghan women over the moon. They had waited 13 years to hear such words \u2014 words that might have changed the course of the American occupation and the future of Afghanistan had they been spoken in 2001 by Hamid Karzai.\n\nNo, they\u2019re not magic. They simply reflect the values of a substantial minority of Afghans and probably the majority of Afghans in exile in the West. They also reflect an idea the U.S. regularly praises itself for holding, but generally acts against \u2014 the very one George W. Bush cited as part of his justification for invading Afghanistan in 2001.\n\nThe popular sell for that invasion, you will recall, was an idea for which American men had never before exhibited much enthusiasm: women\u2019s liberation. For years, human rights organizations the world over had called attention to the plight of Afghan women, confined to their homes by the Taliban government, deprived of education and medical care, whipped in the streets by self-appointed committees for \u201cthe Promotion of Public Virtue and the Prevention of Vice,\u201d and on occasion executed in Kabul\u2019s Ghazi stadium. Horrific as that was, few could have imagined an American president, a Republican at that, waving a feminist flag to cover the invasion of a country guilty mainly of hosting a scheming guest.\n\nWhile George W. Bush bragged about liberating Afghan women, his administration followed quite a different playbook on the ground. In December 2001, at the Bonn Conference called to establish an interim Afghan governing body, his team saw to it that the country\u2019s new leader would be the apparently malleable Hamid Karzai, a conservative Pashtun who, like any Talib, kept his wife, Dr. Zinat Karzai, confined at home. Before they married in 1999, she had been a practicing gynecologist with skills desperately needed to improve the country\u2019s abysmal maternal mortality rate, but she instead became the most prominent Afghan woman the Bush liberation failed to reach.\n\nThis disconnect between Washington\u2019s much-advertised support for women\u2019s rights and its actual disdain for women was not lost upon canny Afghans. From early on, they recognized that the Americans were hypocrites at heart.\n\nWashington revealed itself in other ways as well. Afghan warlords had ravaged the country during the civil war of the early 1990s that preceded the Taliban takeover, committing mass atrocities best defined as crimes against humanity. In 2002, the year after the American invasion and overthrow of the Taliban, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission established under the auspices of the U.N. surveyed citizens nationwide and found that 76% of them wanted those warlords tried as war criminals, while 90% wanted them barred from public office. As it happened, some of those men had been among Washington\u2019s favorite, highly paid Islamist jihadis during its proxy war against the Soviet Union of the 1980s. As a result, the Bush administration looked the other way when Karzai welcomed those \u201cexperienced\u201d men into his cabinet, the parliament, and the \u201cnew\u201d judiciary. Impunity was the operative word. The message couldn\u2019t have been clearer: with the right connections, a man could get away with anything \u2014 from industrial-scale atrocities to the routine subjugation of women.\n\nThere is little in the twisted nature of American-Afghan relations in the past 13 years that can\u2019t be traced to these revelations that the United States does not practice what it preaches, that equality and justice were little more than slogans \u2014 and so, it turned out, was democracy.\n\nTaking Sides\n\nThe American habit of thinking only in the short term has also shaped long-term results in Afghanistan. Military and political leaders in Washington have had a way of focusing only on the most immediate events, the ones that invariably raised fears and seemed to demand (or provided an excuse for) instantaneous action. The long, winding, shadowy paths of history and culture remained unexplored. So it was that the Bush administration targeted the Taliban as the enemy, drove them from power, installed \u201cdemocracy\u201d by fiat, and incidentally told women to take off their burqas. Mission accomplished!\n\nUnlike the Americans and their coalition partners, however, the Taliban were not foreign interlopers but Afghans. Nor were they an isolated group, but the far right wing of Afghan Islamist conservatism. As such, they simply represented then, and continue to represent in extreme form today, the traditional conservative ranks of significant parts of the population who have resisted change and modernization for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nYet theirs is not the only Afghan tradition. Progressive rulers and educated urban citizens have long sought to usher the country into the modern world. Nearly a century ago, King Amanullah founded the first high school for girls and the first family court to adjudicate women\u2019s complaints about their husbands; he proclaimed the equality of men and women, and banned polygamy; he cast away the burqa, and banished ultra-conservative Islamist mullahs as \u201cbad and evil persons\u201d who spread propaganda foreign to the moderate Sufi ideals of the country. Since then, other rulers, both kings and commissars, have championed education, women\u2019s emancipation, religious tolerance, and conceptions of human rights usually associated with the West. Whatever its limitations in the Afghan context, such progressive thinking is also \u201ctraditional.\u201d\n\nThe historic contest between the two traditions came to a head in the 1980s during the Soviet occupation of the country. Then it was the Russians who supported women\u2019s human rights and girls\u2019 education, while Washington funded a set of particularly extreme Islamist groups in exile in Pakistan. Only a few years earlier, in the mid-1970s, Afghan president Mohammad Daud Khan, backed by Afghan communists, had driven radical Islamist leaders out of the country, much as King Amanullah had done before. It was the CIA, in league with the intelligence services of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, that armed them and brought them back as President Ronald Reagan\u2019s celebrated \u201cfreedom fighters,\u201d the mujahidin.\n\nTwenty years later, it would be the Americans, spearheaded again by the CIA, who returned to drive them out once more. History can be a snarl, especially when a major power can\u2019t think ahead.\n\nWhether by ignorance or intention, in 2001-2002, its moment of triumph in Afghanistan, the U.S. tried to have it both ways. With one hand it waved the progressive banner of women\u2019s rights, while with the other it crafted a highly centralized and powerful presidential government, which it promptly handed over to a conservative man, who scarcely gave a thought to women. Given sole power for 13 years to appoint government ministers, provincial governors, municipal mayors, and almost every other public official countrywide, President Karzai maintained a remarkably consistent, almost perfect record of choosing only men.\n\nOnce it was clear that he cared nothing for the human rights of women, the death threats against those who took Washington\u2019s \u201cliberation\u201d language seriously began in earnest. Women working in local and international NGOs, government agencies, and schools soon found posted on the gates of their compounds anonymous messages \u2014 so called \u201cnight letters\u201d \u2014 describing in gruesome detail how they would be killed. By way of Facebook or mobile phone they received videos of men raping young girls. Then the assassinations began. Policewomen, provincial officials, humanitarian workers, teachers, schoolgirls, TV and radio presenters, actresses, singers \u2014 the list seemed never to end. Some were, you might say, overkilled: raped, beaten, strangled, cut, shot, and then hung from a tree \u2014 just to make a point. Even when groups of men claimed credit for such murders, no one was detained or prosecuted.\n\nStill the Bush administration boasted of ever more girls enrolled in school and advances in health care that reduced rates of maternal and infant death. Progress was slow, shaky, and always greatly exaggerated, but real. On Barack Obama\u2019s watch, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton renewed American promises to Afghan women. She swore repeatedly never to abandon them, though somehow she rarely remembered to invite any of them to international conferences where men discussed the future of their country.\n\nIn the meantime, Karzai continued to approve legislation that tightened restrictions on the rights of women, while failing to restrict violence against them.\n\nOnly in 2009, under relentless pressure from Afghan women\u2019s organizations and many of the countries providing financial aid, did Karzai enact by decree a law for \u201cThe Elimination of Violence Against Women\u201d (EVAW). It banned 22 practices harmful to women and girls, including rape, physical violence, child marriage, and forced marriage. Women are now reporting rising levels of violence, but few have found any redress under the law. Like the constitutional proviso that men and women are equal, the potentially powerful protections of EVAW exist mainly on paper.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Afghan women have been shut down, shut out and silenced by the very men the U.S. has asked them to vote for", "author": "Ann Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Afghan women have been shut down, shut out and silenced by the very men the U.S. has asked them to vote for", "title": "Democracy\u2019s ugly misogyny: The dark reality of \u201cfree\u201d elections in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/democracys_ugly_misogyny_the_sexism_of_free_elections_in_afghanistan_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/cheney_bush_rove.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Afghan women have been shut down, shut out and silenced by the very men the U.S. has asked them to vote for", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/cheney_bush_rove.jpg", "title": "Democracy\u2019s ugly misogyny: The dark reality of \u201cfree\u201d elections in Afghanistan", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Democracy\u2019s ugly misogyny: The dark reality of \u201cfree\u201d elections in Afghanistan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Afghanistan, Democracy, elections, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1267\"", "article_summary": "While George W.
