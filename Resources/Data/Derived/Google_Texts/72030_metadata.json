It\u2019s an upscale consignment store offering designer dresses at discounted prices.\n\nThe shop, which opened in February, offers hundreds of gowns at lower-than-retail prices. Many still have price tags on them.\n\nThe bridal boutique boasts a collection of dresses designed by the likes of Maggie Sottero, Alfred Angelo, Justin Alexander, James Clifford, La Sposa and Anjolique. Prices for these finds range from $200 to $2,800, Christman said.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to provide upscale formal wear at affordable prices, providing a means for past brides to receive a return on their investment and paying it forward for future brides to love that once-worn treasure on her special day,\u201d she said.\n\nBrides who bring in their once-worn dress must get it dry-cleaned first, and it\u2019s only added to the store\u2019s collection if it\u2019s in \u201cperfect condition,\u201d Christman said.\n\n\u201cThen, she gets 50 percent of the sale and we receive 50 percent.\u201d\n\nThe store also accepts and resells other wedding-themed items, including flower girl dresses, shoes, gloves, jewelry, veils, purses and mother-of-the-bride gowns. It\u2019s also a destination for the prom \u2014 those dresses run from $90 to $280.\n\nLike some of the wedding dresses, several of the prom dresses have never been worn. In fact, some come from collections at area formal-wear shops.\n\nGina Jones of Bensalem was trying on a dress that still had the retail shop tags on it. Once $1,285, the dress was selling for $600 at Angelina\u2019s.\n\nWith a wide grin, Jones spun around in the beaded gown, saying, \u201cI love the simple but elegant nature of the dress.\u201d\n\nJones said she is a strong believer in reusing and re-purposing everything.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d she said, \u201cis a great alternative, especially in today\u2019s economy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Intelligencer", "description": "Cindy Christman, the owner of Infinitely Yours Flowers in Bensalem, knows that every young girl dreams about the dress she\u2019s going to wear on her wedding day.", "title": "$aving Bucks finds discount option for wedding, prom dresses", "url": "http://www.theintell.com/life-style/aving-bucks-finds-discount-option-for-wedding-prom-dresses/article_3cc97d93-af90-55a6-8b70-bad191cf1783.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theintell.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/03/9032c597-b5ab-5563-a1f3-18ddceeeed6c/5515bbed18f27.image.jpg?resize=524%2C760", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheIntellNews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "angelina's bridal boutique,bridal consignment,deals,wedding gowns,designer gowns,bensalem,alfred angelo,formal wear,formalwear,cindy christman,wedding dress,bride,gina jones,designer,maggie sottero,justin alexander,james clifford", "fb": {"app_id": 579115282248617}, "msvalidate.01": "D8575C90B3B4CCE6B6A7C9F0086B7312", "google-site-verification": "8nckBxTQwgRuj2o3n2pyWZlSYU8Q818IpV17p1FQOGI", "news_keywords": "angelina's bridal boutique,bridal consignment,deals,wedding gowns,designer gowns,bensalem,alfred angelo,formal wear,formalwear,cindy christman,wedding dress,bride,gina jones,designer,maggie sottero,justin alexander,james clifford", "description": "Cindy Christman, the owner of Infinitely Yours Flowers in Bensalem, knows that every young girl dreams about the dress she\u2019s going to wear on her wedding day."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddba9\"", "article_summary": "Like some of the wedding dresses, several of the prom dresses have never been worn.\nGina Jones of Bensalem was trying on a dress that still had the retail shop tags on it.\nBut through her work with brides at the flower shop, she learned many women couldn\u2019t afford that special dress.\nIt\u2019s an upscale consignment store offering designer dresses at discounted prices.\nCindy Christman, the owner of Infinitely Yours Flowers in Bensalem, knows that every young girl dreams about the dress she\u2019s going to wear on her wedding day."}
