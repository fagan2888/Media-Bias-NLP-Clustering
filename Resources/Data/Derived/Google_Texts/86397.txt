A spectator at the Colorado Renaissance Festival who fancied himself a knight by crashing a jousting performance and absconding with a sword was quickly brought to justice the old-fashioned way.

A woman, dressed as a medieval wench, chased the man down, tackled him to the ground and held him there until officers with the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office could arrive.

“I thought they were playing until she took him down in a headlock,” said Steve Chapman, a freelance photographer from Golden who was at the mid-afternoon show in Larkspur and witnessed the altercation.

Deborah Sherman, a spokeswoman for the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, said 22-year-old Connor Ward was arrested on suspicion of theft and attempted assault on a police officer, after he allegedly resisted while being handcuffed.

Sherman said it appears that Ward was drunk. She said a police report noted that Ward’s friend stopped him from running away, but Chapman said he saw the woman dressed in period costume bring him down.
