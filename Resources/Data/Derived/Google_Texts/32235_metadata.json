Or rather, they cite Smith\u2019s little known work The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which many of them argue should be considered at least as important as his opus The Wealth of Nations.\n\nConsider Matt Lewis at the Daily Caller, who informs us that:\n\nThose who want to portray conservatives as ravenous fail to appreciate the yin and the yang that goes back to the beginning of fiscal conservatism. As I\u2019ve noted before: \u2018Most educated Americans know Adam Smith wrote Wealth of Nations, expounding on the virtues of self-interest in free markets. But how many Americans know Smith\u2019s first (and only other) book was called The Theory of Moral Sentiments \u2014 and that it was about the virtues of personal benevolence? Indeed, Smith developed a theory of an \u2018impartial spectator\u2018 (a sort of conscience) as a standard for moral judgment.\u2019\n\nOr Andrew Sullivan at The Dish:\n\nLimbaugh has obviously never read the Gospels. He has never read the parables. His ideology is so extreme it even trashes, because it does not begin to understand, the core principles of capitalism, as laid out by Adam Smith. Market capitalism is and always has been a regulated construction of government, not some kind of state of nature without it. Indeed without proper regulation to maintain a proper and fair and transparent market, it is doomed to terrible corruption, inefficiency, injustice, and abuse.\n\nBut there is a reason Ayn Rand is considered a gateway drug to the right and Smith isn\u2019t\u2014the \u201cgreed is good\u201d ethos, whatever else may be wrong with it, is much sexier, more rebellious, and thus more appealing than staid bourgeois morality. But more to the point, it\u2019s interesting that both Lewis and Sullivan consider Smith the fons et origo of fiscal conservatism, as defined by support for capitalism. I find it interesting because it\u2019s mistaken, albeit a mistaken belief that is held almost universally.\n\nSmith\u2019s Wealth of Nations and Theory of Moral Sentiments were not the first popular defense of capitalism, nor was he even the first to explicitly develop the law of supply and demand. In some ways Smith\u2019s oeuvre is a response to an earlier work, and I believe conservatives today have far more to learn from that first defense of capitalism, and its forgotten author, than they do from Smith.\n\nSo who is this forgotten political economist? The little-known Bernard Mandeville, who was most active in the early 18th century. Or rather, an author who is little known now. In his time, he influenced not only Smith (who mentions him by name in Wealth of Nations), but also Jean Jacques Rousseau and David Hume, among others.\n\nWhy have so few heard of him? Because his contemporaries actively suppressed his work, so pervasively did it scandalize the intelligentsia of the time. Protestant theologian John Wesley wrote of Mandeville, \u201ctill now I imagined there had never been in the world such a book as the works of Machiavel. But de Mandeville goes far beyond it.\u201d In fact, Mandeville\u2019s book was even presented as a public nuisance by the Grand Jury of Middlesex.\n\nThat book, The Fable of the Bees, has since been revived by libertarian outlets and put back on the market. Reading it now, one immediately sees why the world was not ready for it back in 1714. It was so radically ahead of its time that it reads like it was written by a time traveler who had visited modern Las Vegas. Its central thesis would probably raise hackles on both sides of the aisle today. Mandeville summed it up this way: \u201cprivate vice makes public benefit.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mandeville, one couldn\u2019t separate any benefit of capitalism, even private charity, from the supposed sins of pride and greed. Greed\u2019s role is self-explanatory, but Mandeville arguably considered pride more important, because he believed it was what motivated acts of putative altruism. \u201cPride and vanity have built more hospitals than all the virtues together,\u201d Mandeville writes in The Fable.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mandeville argued, consumerism and capitalism were completely synonymous and, in fact, it was the desire to consume more and better goods that prompted people to advance themselves in a capitalist society, not the desire for virtue. Thus, people who argued for a society where vice ceased to exist (many of whom, Mandeville often argued, represented the most hypocritically prideful of the lot), were actually arguing for an end to everything that made modern life possible and tolerable.\n\nNeedless to say, Mandeville\u2019s work earned widespread condemnation at the time. Adam Smith spends some time trying to refute it in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Yet what most of Mandeville\u2019s detractors missed (and, indeed, what distinguishes him from garden variety \u201cgreed is good\u201d theorists like Ayn Rand) was that his background as a doctor of the nerves and stomach had given him an uncanny insight into the workings of peoples\u2019 minds. Despite The Fable\u2018s chilly reception, Mandeville did attract at least one high-profile admirer\u2014David Hume, arguably the greatest psychological political theorist of all time, according to political psychologist Jonathan Haidt.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ludwig von Mises praised Mandeville for \u201cpoint[ing] out that self-interest and the desire for material well-being, commonly stigmatized as vices, are in fact the incentives whose operation make for welfare, prosperity and civilization.\u201d Mises\u2019s fellow Austrian Friedrich Hayek hailed Mandeville as the first man to come up with the idea of spontaneous order and described him as \u201ca really great psychologist, if this is not too weak a term for a great student of human nature.\u201d\n\nAnd Mandeville certainly was a great student of human nature. If you read \u201cThe Grumbling Hive\u201d today, it\u2019s hard to believe that the author didn\u2019t live in the age of Facebook and Miley Cyrus. While the notion that the desire to consume propels people toward economic ambition and upward mobility was controversial at the time, in a world that knows of the existence of Las Vegas and Macau, it\u2019s almost trivial in its obviousness. The idea that vice can propel the economy, in a country where Miley Cyrus\u2019s performance at the MTV Video Music Awards probably generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue for sites that linked to it (and more for Cyrus herself), is wholly unsurprising. Indeed, the idea that pride is a tool for moral enforcement is proven by every celebrity who\u2019s had to apologize for an ill-considered tweet, by the neurotic culture of self-censorship on Facebook, and by the continued demands for video games with moral choice systems that reward players for making the right ones.\n\nSo why does the GOP have so much to learn from Mandeville? Because it is precisely the demographics steeped in these elements of our new, increasingly Mandevillean world that the GOP seems most incapable of reaching. Meanwhile, the Obama administration has long since mastered the art of catering to the pride of various groups. The GOP seems stuck scolding an increasingly large proportion of the population for differences of moral emphasis, much like Mandeville\u2019s benighted antagonists.\n\nMoreover, Mandeville\u2019s psychological lessons on the importance of pride are expounded by some of the most popular conservatives around the globe, as in the case of London mayor Boris Johnson invoking the spirit of Margaret Thatcher to warn about constrained economic mobility. Mandeville\u2019s warnings that morally zealous people could imperil modern society now sound too prescient, both at home and abroad.\n\nUnlike Smith, Mandeville\u2019s moral vision needs no updating, but instead treats every element of the modern world as an accomplishment to be celebrated, rather than a collection of vices to be ignored or overcome. His work carries a timeless key to the human psyche.\n\nAdam Smith ties are a nice fashion accessory, but if conservatives want to speak to the modern world, they\u2019d better start humming the same tune as Mandeville\u2019s busy little bees.\n\nMytheos Holt is an associate policy analyst at the R Street Institute, and communications strategist at Mair Strategies.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "Before Ayn Rand or Adam Smith, there was the author of \"The Fable of the Bees.\"", "title": "Bernard Mandeville and Consumerism\u2019s Buzz", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/bernard-mandevilles-bees-consumerisms-buzz/", "image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_111783938.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When addressing the right's awkwardness surrounding issues of extreme economic inequality, it's lately become almost\u00a0de rigeur\u00a0among conservative reformers to cite Adam Smith as a polestar that cons", "title": "Bernard Mandeville and Consumerism\u2019s Buzz", "image": {"src": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_111783938.jpg"}, "creator": "@amconmag", "site": "@amconmag", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "maisie.allison"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ffc\"", "article_summary": "Needless to say, Mandeville\u2019s work earned widespread condemnation at the time.\nThe little-known Bernard Mandeville, who was most active in the early 18th century.\nGreed\u2019s role is self-explanatory, but Mandeville arguably considered pride more important, because he believed it was what motivated acts of putative altruism.\nMandeville summed it up this way: \u201cprivate vice makes public benefit.\u201dAccording to Mandeville, one couldn\u2019t separate any benefit of capitalism, even private charity, from the supposed sins of pride and greed.\n\u201cPride and vanity have built more hospitals than all the virtues together,\u201d Mandeville writes in The Fable."}
