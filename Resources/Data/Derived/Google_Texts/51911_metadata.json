In the discussion of its extent, its westward movement, etc., it can not therefore any longer have a place in the census reports.\n\nTurner recognized that contained within this small passage of officialese was a momentous turning point in American history. The official announcement of the end of the existence of the American frontier marked \u201cthe closing of a great historic moment.\u201d In Turner\u2019s view, the existence of the frontier, and all that it entailed, constituted the deepest source of the American character\u2014more than any other explanation, including even the Constitution.\n\nTurner was a fervent Progressive during the years when Progressivism was gaining steam\u2014indeed, he receives top billing in Richard Hofstadter\u2019s study The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington. In Turner\u2019s view, the role played by the frontier\u2014and the type of values and attributes it fostered in Americans\u2014was the root of the progressive thrust in American history, including, importantly in his view, the rise of the sense of American nationalism.\n\nThe wilderness has been interpenetrated by lines of civilization growing ever more numerous. It is like the steady growth of a complex nervous system for the originally simple, inert continent. If one would understand why we are to-day one nation, rather than a collection of isolated states, he must study this economic and social consolidation of the country.\n\nWhat is striking in these and similar passages is how closely Turner\u2019s analysis echoes the hopes and intentions of the Founders of whom the Progressives were often fervent critics. He particularly echoes the Hamiltonians who envisioned a \u201cnational system\u201d that would draw the allegiances of people away from local and parochial identities through the soft but persistent pressure of a nationalizing economic and political order. Turner recognized that this thrust toward an increasing national identity would be achieved through the encouragement of the individualistic spirit of the American frontiersman. The John Wayne, Daniel Boone spirit of the self-standing, self-made, independent, free individual would, ironically, forge the conditions for a national identity and usher in the possibility and even necessity of the Progressive stage.\n\nOne sees these arguments presented most succinctly by Turner in his follow-up essay \u201cLater Developments and Explanations,\u201d published in 1920, which appeared in his book The Frontier in American History. Turner speaks of the frontier in Baconian terms, celebrating (as would Dewey) the frontiersman\u2019s conquest of nature and the savages, the subduing of each for \u201cthe purposes of civilization, and the task of advancing his economic and social status in the new democracy which he was helping to create.\u201d He recognizes the ideal of \u201cthe self-made man\u201d that arose especially from the experience of settling the West, and the frontier\u2019s role in cultivating the central American qualities of \u201cindividualism, economic equality, freedom to rise, democracy,\u201d and \u201cfree opportunities.\u201d Turner concludes, \u201cAmerican democracy is fundamentally the outcome of the experiences of the American people in dealing with the West.\u201d\n\nYet it was from these very sources\u2014individualism, restlessness, ambition, opportunity, and conquest\u2014that Turner also believed arose the conditions that made the rise of nationalist Progressivism unavoidable. The deep-seated American impulse of mobility was the first and most secure source of the rise of nationalism, the identification of the population no longer with particular places and histories, but with the \u201cidea\u201d of the nation as the locus of opportunity, ambition, wealth, and independence. Turner saw in the \u201cnationalizing tendency of the West\u201d the transformation of the \u201cdemocracy of Jefferson\u201d to \u201cnational republicanism.\u201d As hoped for by both Founders like Hamilton and Progressives like Croly, mobility hollowed out identification with localities. \u201cNothing works for nationalism like intercourse within the nation. Mobility of population is death to localism, and the western frontier worked irresistibly in unsettling population.\u201d\n\nBecause of the formative role played by the frontier in the formation of the American character and psyche, Turner therefore found the declaration of the \u201cend\u201d of the frontier in 1890 to mark the most important development in American history. What would now be the sources of American character, its characteristic independence, liberty, ambition, mobility? Turner believed that it would fall increasingly to the national government to preserve \u201cthe spirit\u201d of democracy once fostered by the presence of the frontier.\n\nOne new role for government\u2014here, characteristically Progressive\u2014would be the tempering of the very individualism that had been fostered by the frontier. Now, with the frontier\u2019s \u201cclosure,\u201d individualism was an impulse that posed a threat in an age of encroaching and growing population, with all its attendant problems and challenges. Thus, for instance, we see the concern expressed in Turner about the need for conscious efforts at \u201cconservation\u201d and stewardship of resources that can no longer be assumed to be limitless. Further, without the \u201coutlet,\u201d or \u201csafety-valve\u201d of the frontier, the option of simply \u201clighting out\u201d to seek economic opportunity was no longer readily available, meaning that, increasingly, it would have to be the role of the government to \u201cfill in\u201d for the role that had once been provided by the frontier. Where once one could seek opportunity and economic equality by \u201clighting out for the territory,\u201d one would instead have to look East\u2014toward Washington.\n\nBut, perhaps more striking and ironically still, the experience of independence and individualism would also have to be increasingly afforded, even created, by the government. This would be provided through government support for, and even subsidy of, the creation of opportunity\u2014particularly through transportation and increasing the \u201cintercourse\u201d throughout the nation. Though Turner would not live to see it, the eventual massive government support for the automobile\u2014through the highways, particularly, but even indirect and (as we have seen in recent years) the direct support of automobile manufacturers would be a way that the government could support and foster the sense of \u201cindependence.\u201d\n\nOne can turn to other historians for further exploration of the \u201cfrontier\u201d thesis in the automobile era and for further discussion of this paradoxical and parasitic relationship between individualism and Statism. One good source is Frederick Lewis Allen, who devotes a chapter to \u201cThe Automobile Revolution\u201d in his book The Big Change: America Transforms Itself 1900-1950. Suddenly, with the automobile, the frontier seemed again to open, so soon after it had been declared closed. In tones reminiscent of Turner, Allen wrote that \u201cthe automobile weakened the roots that held a family to one spot. Always a mobile people in comparison with the peoples of Europe, now Americans followed the economic tides more readily than ever before\u2026\u201d However, as James Flink notes in his book The Automobile Age, this experience of liberty now rested on massive government support\u2014just as Turner suggested would need to happen. In particular, this massive outlay of support for the automobile culture came at the exclusion of public support for mass transportation, based on the American desire to experience independence and individual mobility\u2014even if massively subsidized by the government that they otherwise so often deplored for undermining their independence.\n\nWe see the strange irony of American politics in these studies. According to Turner, it was characteristic American individualism that gave rise to nationalism and eventually the growing need and demands for national solutions to most political and economic issues. In turn, it was from national sources that would issue growing support for our demands for independence and the experience of individualism. First, individualism would foster nationalism; then, nationalism would subsidize individualism. So they are found together, purported enemies but so often dancing cheek-to-cheek.\n\nFollow @PatrickDeneen\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "How the frontier and the automobile hollowed out attachment to place.", "title": "Mobility and the Rise of Progressive Nationalism", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/2013/11/07/mobility-and-the-rise-of-progressive-nationalism/", "image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/yellowstone-early-automobiles.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the landmark studies of America, published 120 years ago, is Fredrick Jackson Turner's essay \"The Significance of the Frontier in American History.\" Turner's essay was inspired by a line that a", "title": "Mobility and the Rise of Progressive Nationalism", "image": {"src": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/yellowstone-early-automobiles.jpg"}, "creator": "@amconmag", "site": "@amconmag", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "maisie.allison"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd851\"", "article_summary": "According to Turner, it was characteristic American individualism that gave rise to nationalism and eventually the growing need and demands for national solutions to most political and economic issues.\nTurner was a fervent Progressive during the years when Progressivism was gaining steam\u2014indeed, he receives top billing in Richard Hofstadter\u2019s study The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington.\nFirst, individualism would foster nationalism; then, nationalism would subsidize individualism.\nIn Turner\u2019s view, the role played by the frontier\u2014and the type of values and attributes it fostered in Americans\u2014was the root of the progressive thrust in American history, including, importantly in his view, the rise of the sense of American nationalism.\nSuddenly, with the automobile, the frontier seemed again to open, so soon after it had been declared closed."}
