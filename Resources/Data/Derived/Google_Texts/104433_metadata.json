Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nMemo to Hillary Clinton: Sen. Bernie Sanders is running for president. This is the best thing to happen to you since Chelsea had her baby. Sanders will remind voters what they love about the Democrats (the idealism and concern for the little guy) and also what scares the heck out of them (unions, big government and backward policy ideas).\n\nYour job is to co-opt the former and distance yourself from the latter. If you play this gift right, Sanders will make it much harder for the Republicans to paint you as a raging liberal in the general election, as you will have spent the whole primary fending off the Democratic leftists.\n\nRemember Bill Clinton\u2019s Sister Souljah moment? (It feels weird to call him \u201cBill Clinton\u201d in this memo, but \u201cyour husband\u201d feels even weirder.) Anyway, back to Sister Souljah. In the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton criticized extreme remarks hip hop artist Sister Souljah had made about black-on-white violence during the Los Angeles riots, thereby distancing himself from the left wing of the party.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Hillary Clinton]\n\nThis moment was so important that \u201cSister Souljah moment\u201d has its own Wikipedia page. It is defined as \u201ca key moment when the candidate takes what at least appears to be a bold stand against certain extremes in their party.\u201d And then this: \"Such an act of repudiation is designed to signal to centrist voters that the politician is not beholden to traditional, and sometimes unpopular, interest groups associated with the party.\u201d\n\nHeck, Hillary, I am squirming with excitement as I sit here in this nondescript airport terminal. You have the opportunity to make the whole primary your Sister Souljah moment.\n\nWhile we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s fold Sen. Elizabeth Warren into this process. She\u2019s not running, but she\u2019s going to be sniping from the left for the whole primary process. The folks over in polling are telling me that when you mention Bernie Sanders, you need to mention Elizabeth Warren, too.\n\n\n\n[READ: For Hillary and Bill, What's Past Is Prologue ]\n\nSome commentators have predicted that Sanders and Warren are going to force you to tack left during the primaries. (See how I mentioned them together there?) That would be exactly the wrong thing to do. Stand your ground and let them win 15 or 20 percent of the vote. Maybe even a state or two. Because it\u2019s all about the general election. This is chess. Sometimes you have to sacrifice a piece or two to win the game.\n\nFending off Sanders and Warren will make you less scary for swing voters come November 2016. And let\u2019s be real: 1) You are going to win the primary; and 2) people who voted for Sanders and Warren are going to turn out for you in the general election regardless of what happens between now and then. Are they going to sit out the election that could put the first woman in the White House? No chance.\n\nThis is a gift. You can emerge from the Democratic primary as a pragmatic problem-solving moderate, distancing yourself from both the starry-eyed populists in your own party and the out-of-touch Republicans on the right. Just get the messaging right.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the 2016 Presidential Elections]\n\nFirst, embrace the idealism. Sanders and Warren are right about a lot of things. Inequality will eat away at the fabric of our society. Climate change is a serious threat. College is obscenely expensive. Middle-class wages have to be sufficient to raise a family. And so on.\n\nThese are crucial issues that unsettle a wide swath of American voters. The Republicans are leaving the door open because their response to many of them, for reasons I do not fully understand, is denial.\n\nBut then trash Sanders' and Warren's policy solutions. (This is a confidential memo, right?) This is where the left wing of your party just falls apart. We can\u2019t create more wealth by voting against trade agreements. We can\u2019t help poor and minority children by pandering to the teachers unions. We can\u2019t raise families out of poverty with a $15 minimum wage if workers are not skilled enough to justify that kind of money. You know all this stuff. Capture the heart of the left wing of the party while demonstrating that you\u2019ve got a brain, too. (Seriously, you\u2019re not going to leak this, are you?)\n\n\n\n[READ: Bernie Sanders Is No Barack Obama]\n\nSignal a willingness to reign in entitlements. Don\u2019t get specific about it. Just point out the obvious: These programs are unsustainable. The best way to protect the social welfare programs that Americans care about is to fix them. While Sanders and Warren are promising to expand Social Security, you are going to come across as the responsible Democrat in the room by talking about the fiscal reality.\n\nSupport the Affordable Care Act and then talk about reining in health care costs. There are few people in America who know more about health care than you do.\n\nAmericans don\u2019t trust the Republicans to protect these programs, and they don\u2019t trust the Democrats to keep control of spending. You are going to steer a course right in between, all thanks to Sanders and Warren.\n\nBest of all, none of this will compromise your ability to govern. If anything, it signals a willingness to compromise with Republicans: on trade, on entitlement reform, on school reform, on fixing Obamacare.\n\nOne last thing: Please tell me that you and the Friends of Bill are not secretly funding Sanders' campaign. Because otherwise, this is too good to be true.
