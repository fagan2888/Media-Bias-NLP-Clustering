And many people in the real estate business do that, you use alias. And you have to, frankly, otherwise they find out it's you and they charge you more money \u2014 and nobody wants to pay more money.\" He'd often use an alias \"when I was out in Brooklyn with my father and I'd want to buy something. And honestly nobody knew who Trump was at that time, nobody knew me, so it wasn't so much so important. But I would never want to use my name because you had to pay money for the land.\"\n\nTrump has shied away from reports that he used to pose as his own spokesman, going by such creative monikers as \"John Miller\" and \"John Barron.\" His youngest son's name is Barron, and he said he did use that name once and made \"a very good deal.\" He also revealed that he'd be delighted to have a one-on-one debate with Bernie Sanders, promising the duo \"would have such high ratings.\" Catherine Garcia", "article_metadata": {"description": "Official site of The Week Magazine, offering commentary and analysis of the day's breaking news and current events as well as arts, entertainment, people and gossip, and political cartoons.", "og": {"url": "http://theweek.com/speedreads/544492/obamacare-drove-35-percent-drop-americas-uninsured-rate", "image": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_6_4/public/462802362_0.jpg?itok=INYXmK4N", "type": "article", "description": "Approximately 16.4 million people have gained health insurance since ObamaCare went into effect, according to a report\u00a0released Monday by the Department of Health and Human Services.
