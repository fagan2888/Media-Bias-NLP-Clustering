Instead, they will have to play him a $1.5 million buyout fee.\n\nAnderson broke the news before the Rockies officially did, tweeting: \u201cWho has 2 thumbs and is a free agent\u2026this guy.\u201d\n\nAnderson, acquired in a trade last year with Oakland for lefty Drew Pomeranz, never really got a chance to prove himself in a Rockies uniform.\n\nHe went 1-3 with a 2.91 ERA in just eight starts, his season ruined by a broken index finger suffered during an early-season at-bat and by a ruptured disc in his lower back late in the summer.\n\nWith his playing time limited because of various injuries, Anderson has made just 19 starts in the past three seasons.\n\nStill, Anderson entered the offseason wanting to return to the Rockies, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of out of my control, but aside from the season I\u2019ve had, and all of the losses, I like everything about being here,\u201d Anderson said in September. \u201cI like the city, I like the team, I like the guys. Hopefully I\u2019m back here next year and I can show what I can do beyond just a handful of starts.\u201d\n\nAnderson is not the only pitcher the Rockies need to replace. Tyler Chatwood will miss most, if not all, of the 2015 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery in July.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brett Anderson\u2019s 2015 option declined by Rockies, making him a free agent", "title": "Brett Anderson\u2019s 2015 option declined by Rockies, making him a free agent", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/01/brett-andersons-2015-option-declined-by-rockies-making-him-a-free-agent/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141101_022550_brett-anderson-1.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141101_022550_brett-anderson-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-01T14:24:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:28:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Tyler Chatwood will miss most, if not all, of the 2015 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery in July.\nThe Rockies, on Saturday, declined to pick up his $12 million option for the 2015 season.\nBrett Anderson, the left-hander starting pitcher the Rockies had such high hopes for, is a free agent.\nWith his playing time limited because of various injuries, Anderson has made just 19 starts in the past three seasons.\nStill, Anderson entered the offseason wanting to return to the Rockies, he said."}
