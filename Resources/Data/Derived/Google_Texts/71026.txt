Coalition jets led by the U.S. military launched more than a dozen attacks on Islamic State stronghold areas in northeastern Syria overnight in what’s being billed as response raids to the terror group’s capture of a Jordanian pilot last month.

The group “Raqqa is Silently Being Slaughtered” reported that the coalition kicked off at least 13 strikes, The Washington Post reported.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights as well as the Local Coordination Committees collective confirmed the raids took place, but none of the groups gave casualty counts.

On Dec. 24, a Jordan pilot was captured by the Islamic State after his F-16 jet was downed near Raqqa.
