The number of investments in HR software companies has been increasing since the 2009 recession, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, with 45 investments worth $230.3 million occurring in 2013.\n\nMr. Conrad discovered the frustration and difficulty of HR\u2013administering payroll and benefits for employees while at the same time complying with increasingly burdensome government regulations\u2013at his last startup, the investment management company SigFig Wealth Management LLC.\n\nAfter his experience at SigFig, he told VentureWire in January, the Obama administration\u2019s 800-page Affordable Care Act, which employers will have to comply with by next year, looked like \u201ca whirlwind coming down the pike.\u201d\n\nHe designed Zenefits to comply with that act. When an employee is hired or leaves, the software enables the employer to check a few boxes, letting the software do the work of connecting to back-end payroll, insurance and other systems, gather information and file whatever\u2019s needed.\n\nThe company is on track to grow revenue this year by 1,300%\u2013revenue in April exceeded forecasts by five times\u2013and it claims more than 2,000 customers serving more than 50,000 employees. In the last three months, more than half of new customers have come from outside California and outside the tech industry\u2013new customers include a steel mill and a church, which implies a large market for the software.\n\nZenefits is headquartered in San Francisco and must comply with regulations state by state.\n\n\u201cThe unique and defining thing about Zenefits is that we\u2019re an integrated, all-in-one approach to this stuff,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. \u201cI believe some of these compliance complexities will drive the entire market toward that. You can\u2019t really roll your own stuff any more.\u201d\n\nOn the cloud computing front, Zenefits is one of several young companies that\u2019s growing much faster than the earlier generation of cloud companies, Mr. Dalgaard said, including Salesforce.com and SuccessFactors Inc., which Mr. Dalgaard himself founded in 2001 and later sold to SAP AG for $3.4 billion.\n\nZenefits\u2019 software is free to users\u2013the company makes money on commissions and referral fees from insurance companies and other services\u2013and it\u2019s also attractive, easy to use, cheap to make and obviously useful, which makes sales easier, he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever we\u2019re seeing now [in the downturn of public tech stocks] is a blip in the valuation of cloud apps companies,\u201d Mr. Dalgaard said. \u201cThey will be an extremely valuable category over the next decade or two.\u201d\n\nOther investors participating in this round\u2013which takes Zenefits\u2019 total funding to $84 million\u2013include Institutional Venture Partners, SV Angel, Hydrazine Capital (a firm co-founded by entrepreneur Sam Altman, who\u2019s also the president of Y Combinator), former Twitter and Google executive Elad Gil, and actor/musician Jared Leto.\n\nMr. Leto was introduced to Zenefits by Box Inc. Chief Executive Aaron Levie and is expected to help with connections to the media and entertainment industries, Mr. Conrad said. There are no board seats with this round.\n\nWrite to Deborah Gage at deborah.gage@wsj.com.
