But this report by Eric Owens of the Daily Caller leaves me stunned:\n\nThe latest version of a top-selling study guide for the Advanced Placement European History exam explains the French Revolution with a chart which identifies Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as a fascist and pairs him with the Ku Klux Klan. \u201cBarron\u2019s AP European History\u201d (7th edition) makes the claim, intended for consumption by American high school students, on page 168. The chart attempts to compare modern American political affiliations with the various factions involved in the French Revolution. The chart moves politically from left to right. The far right of the chart is labeled \u201cfascist.\u201d The authors demonstrate modern-day \u201cfascists\u201d by pairing \u201cClarence Thomas and the KKK\u201d in the same box. Barron\u2019s typifies the far right during the French Revolution with \u201cwealthy people who fled France.\u201d The far left of the same chart is labeled \u201cCommunist.\u201d For the French Revolution, \u201cpoor city dwellers\u201d represent the far left. For today\u2019s politics, the authors choose \u201canarchists.\u201d\n\nFor Barron\u2019s, then, the polar extremes in modern politics are Communists and anarchists on the one hand and Clarence Thomas on the other. And Barron\u2019s perpetuates the myth that Communism and Fascism (National Socialism) are polar opposites, rather than first cousins.\n\nOrdinary conservatives fare better than Justice Thomas, but not as well as liberals. Conservatives are depicted as \u201cthose against change/most Republicans.\u201d \u201cLiberals\u201d are \u201cthose in favor or gradual change\u2026most Democrats.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know any conservative who, at this juncture, is \u201cagainst change.\u201d Nor would I describe the changes favored by today\u2019s liberals \u2014 a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants, Obamacare, regionalism, legalized marijuana, etc. \u2014 as gradual.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s just me. But Adams shows that Barron\u2019s definitions are at odds with those found in Merriam-Webster\u2019s best-selling dictionary. Barron\u2019s is also at odds with President Obama who has described his goal as \u201ctransformation,\u201d not gradual change.\n\nIs Barron\u2019s to blame for its scandalously left-wing characterization of the modern political scene? It\u2019s in the business of preparing students to take exams. If the contents of its prep material help students do well on the AP U.S. History test \u2014 for example, if its rendition of the modern American political scene provides an understanding that is likely to boost test scores \u2014 then Barron\u2019s is simply doing its job. In that case, the fault lies with the College Board, not with Barron\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the authors of this particular Barron\u2019s guide, Seth A. Roberts and James M. Eder, went rogue for the purpose of providing their own indoctrination of AP U.S. History students. But given the hard-left orientation of the course\u2019s published framework, and its left-wing roots, I find it far more likely that Barron\u2019 is teaching to the test.\n\nIn other words, Barron\u2019s has simply been enlisted, along with America\u2019s AP U.S. History teachers, in the College Board\u2019s radically leftist indoctrination project, a project that is linked with the Common Core and which can be expected to infect it sooner rather than later.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "I\u2019ve been warning for some time about the College Board\u2019s effective mandate that AP U.S. History be taught from a hard-left perspective.
