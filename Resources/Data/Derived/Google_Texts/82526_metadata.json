In 2007, Dr. Scheiner \u2014 also a single payer advocate \u2014 was invited \u2014 then un-invited to a White House roundtable on health policy issues.\n\nIn Young\u2019s autobiography \u2014 Everybody In, Nobody Out: Memoirs of a Rebel Without a Pause \u2014 published last year, Young writes that \u201chad I been in Congress, I would have unequivocally voted against Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad bill. Whether it\u2019s worse than what we have now could be argued. We rather think because of its ability to enshrine and solidify the corporate domination of the health system, it\u2019s worse than what we have now. But whether it is somewhat better or a lot worse is immaterial. The health system isn\u2019t working in this country \u2014 fiscally, medically, socially, morally.\u201d\n\nYoung rejected the idea that President Obama should have compromised on single payer in the face of industry opposition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any sympathy for the idea that the president had to compromise because his opposition was strong,\u201d Young writes. \u201cWinning is not always winning the election. Winning is making a huge fight and then taking the fight to the people \u2014 re-electing people who are supporting your program and defeating those who aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYoung first met the young Barack Obama in the mid-1990s at social gatherings.\n\nAt the time, Obama was lecturing at the University of Chicago Law School and practicing law.\n\n\u201cWe did not become bosom buddies after a few of these social gatherings \u2014 I just viewed him as a nice, bright guy living in the neighborhood,\u201d Young says.\n\nWhen Obama ran for the Illinois Senate, Young supported him.\n\n\u201cI was happy with his views on health care,\u201d Young writes. \u201cHe recognized that major reform was necessary and indicated support for a single-payer approach. No blushing friend, I took every opportunity to solidify his position. While not an official adviser, I tried to influence him as much as I could. My colleagues and I sent him notes touting the advantages of single-payer and the form it might take and talked with him and his staff about it whenever I had the chance.\u201d\n\nConsumer advocate Ralph Nader said that \u201cDr. Young was a physician for all seasons \u2014 for his patients, for public health facilities, for workplace safety and for full Medicare for all people with free choice of doctors and hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was Barack Obama\u2019s physician friend and mentor about single payer health insurance,\u201d Nader said. \u201cYet years later, President Obama excluded him from the roundtable discussions at the White House which he had with representatives of the insurance, drug and hospital companies. Dr. Young\u2019s compassion and wisdom will be sorely missed.\u201d\n\nDr. Young was an inspiration to single payer advocates around the country.\n\n\u201cQuentin was my mentor,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Flowers, currently a single payer candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maryland. \u201cI admire his commitment to social justice. He set the example of what doctors should be doing \u2014 getting out into the streets to support struggles for social justice and using our influence to fight for equal rights, including equal access to high quality health care. He started his career out as a public health officer in West Virginia.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me, he was a superstar. It meant so much to me that he spoke with me the night before our Baucus 8 (the eight single payer activists who were arrested in 2008 before the first Obamacare hearing before a committee chaired by then Senator Max Baucus) actions and agreed that it was time for such an action. His support gave me the courage to carry through with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had the honor of spending time with Quentin in DC, Chicago and Berkeley where he wintered with his daughter. I will always remember how he encouraged me and others to focus on \u2018the elegant simplicity of single payer.\u2019 I think it was Quentin who coined the phrase \u2014 \u2018everybody in, nobody out.\u2019\n\n\u201cQuentin was witty and brilliant and loving. He was energetic and fearless. I am privileged to have crossed paths with him. He touched so many throughout his life. He will be missed.\u201d\n\nDr. Young graduated from Northwestern Medical School and did his residency at Cook County Hospital in Chicago.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, he served as chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine at Cook County, where he established the Department of Occupational Medicine.\n\nIn 1983, Chicago Mayor Harold Washington appointed him president of the Chicago Board of Health, where he served with distinction. From 1952 to 2008, he was an internal medicine doctor in private practice in Chicago\u2019s Hyde Park community, where he lived most of his life.\n\nFor many years Dr. Young hosted a popular program on WBEZ, Chicago\u2019s public radio station, where he discussed health and social issues and took calls from listeners.\n\nIn 1998, he had the distinction of serving as president of the American Public Health Association and in 1997 was inducted as a Master of the American College of Physicians.\n\nIn 2009 he was appointed Health Advocate for the state of Illinois by Gov. Patrick Quinn.\n\nIn addition to his distinguished career as a physician, Dr. Young was a leader in public health policy and medical and social justice issues.\n\nHe was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s personal physician during the latter\u2019s stays in Chicago, and during the civil rights era he served as national chairman of the Medical Committee for Human Rights.\n\n\u201cFrom my adolescent years to the present, I\u2019ve never wavered in my belief in humanity\u2019s ability \u2013 and our collective responsibility \u2013 to bring about a more just and equitable social order. I\u2019ve always believed in humanity\u2019s potential to create a more caring society,\u201d Dr. Young wrote in his autobiography.\n\n\u201cThat viewpoint has infused my relations with family, friends, patients and medical colleagues. It\u2019s been a lifelong, driving force to promote equality and the common good, and I believe it has served me well.\n\n\u201cI suppose being a physician has made it easier for me to work toward this goal. Easier, that is, than if I had chosen a different occupation. I\u2019ve spent a lifetime trying to help others \u2013 in my daily rounds, in my clinic, as a hospital administrator, at demonstrations, in my work with health advocacy groups \u2013 and it all adds up to deeply rewarding career. Few people have such good fortune.\n\n\u201cBut as you\u2019ve no doubt noticed in the preceding pages, my views and actions have also propelled me into sharp conflict with institutions and person who would perpetuate injustice. That was true yesterday \u2014 it remains true today.
