(Scroll down to access report)\n\nCongress is expected to address the reauthorization of the NFIP before its expiration on Sept. 30, 2017.\n\n\u201cFlood disasters represent the number one natural catastrophe in the US, and the NFIP plays a critical role in helping Americans recover from these events,\u201d said Zaffino. \u201cThe report presents suggestions on how policymakers may capitalize on this opportunity to enact meaningful reforms and greatly improve this important program.\u201d\n\nMarsh is a a global provider in insurance broking and risk management.
