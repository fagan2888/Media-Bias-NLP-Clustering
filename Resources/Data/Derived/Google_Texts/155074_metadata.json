He\u2019s expected to enter the plea June 30 and receive a $5,000 fine and 500 hours of community service.\n\n\u201cWe thank the (Manhattan) district attorney for focusing on the facts, and only the facts,\u201d Felton\u2019s lawyer, Jim Walden, said in a statement.\n\nFelton was arrested in February, turning himself in shortly after a Dallas Mavericks-Knicks game at Madison Square Garden. Authorities said his estranged wife\u2019s lawyer had brought a loaded semi-automatic handgun to a police precinct, saying it was Felton\u2019s and she wanted it out of their house. His wife, law student Ariane Raymondo-Felton, had filed for divorce the week before.\n\nFelton was charged with offenses including a weapon-possession offense that carries the potential for up to seven years in prison; it outlaws large-capacity ammunition magazines, under some circumstances. The gun in Felton\u2019s case had a magazine that could hold about 20 rounds, prosecutors said.\n\nThe NBA has said it\u2019s monitoring the case. The league usually waits until criminal cases against players are resolved before deciding whether to impose any fine or suspension.\n\nThe former University of North Carolina star, who turns 30 on Thursday, was the fifth pick of the 2005 NBA draft. After five seasons with the Charlotte Bobcats, he had stints with the Knicks, Denver Nuggets and Portland Trail Blazers before returning to the Knicks for the 2012-13 season.\n\nFelton averaged a career-low 9.7 points last season as the Knicks went 37-45 and missed the playoffs. The point guard missed 17 games while battling injuries, and team president Phil Jackson recently denied a report that he had told Felton he planned to try to trade him this summer. Felton is set to earn $3.8 million next season and has a player option that would pay him $4 million in 2015-16.\n\nFelton is among a few pro athletes who have gotten into trouble with New York\u2019s strict gun laws. Then-New York Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress was arrested in 2008 after accidentally shooting himself in a Manhattan nightclub. He pleaded guilty to an attempted weapon-possession charge and served about two years in prison.\n\nFighter Robert Guerrero was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport last year after he presented a locked gun box containing an unloaded handgun during check-in. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was ordered to pay a $250 fine and complete 50 hours of community service.\n\nFelton played with the Denver Nuggets in 2011.\n\nReach Jennifer Peltz on Twitter @ jennpeltz.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Knicks\u2019 Raymond Felton expected to plead guity in NY gun case", "title": "Knicks\u2019 Raymond Felton expected to plead guity in NY gun case", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/23/knicks-raymond-felton-expected-to-plead-guity-in-ny-gun-case/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140623_082347_raymond-felton.jpg", "height": 535}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140623_082347_raymond-felton.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-23T08:18:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:09:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton is expected to plead guilty in a felony gun possession case in exchange for a no-jail sentence, prosecutors said Monday.\nThe gun in Felton\u2019s case had a magazine that could hold about 20 rounds, prosecutors said.\nFelton was in a Manhattan court as prosecutors outlined the agreement, which would resolve a gun case that arose amid the breakup of his marriage.\nHe\u2019s expected to enter the plea June 30 and receive a $5,000 fine and 500 hours of community service.\nFelton is among a few pro athletes who have gotten into trouble with New York\u2019s strict gun laws."}
