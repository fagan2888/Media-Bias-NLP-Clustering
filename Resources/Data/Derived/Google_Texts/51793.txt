H.S. Boys' Basketball: Titles and more at stake for the holidays



In a time of year defined by traditions, the New Hampshire boys’ hoop ranks will follow one of its own with annual holiday tournaments on tap for the days between Christmas and the start of the New Year.

..

The majority of teams from each of the NHIAA’s four divisions will participate in a tournament with different goals in mind.



For Merrimack, which is off to a strong regular-season start at 2-0, the game plan for tournament play has several layers.

..

“Kids only have so many opportunities to win so many championships,” Tomahawks coach Tim Goodridge said. “If you have an opportunity to win a tournament, then we are going to try and win it. If we don’t, then you want to get kids playing time and look at different things for what comes next.”

..

It will be a season of change for Merrimack’s holiday slate, as Goodridge opted to move to the Chick-Fil-A Holiday Basketball Tournament, which runs Dec. 28-30 at Nashua South, after a long, successful run at the Queen City Basketball Invitational in Manchester.

..

“We participated in the Manchester tourney for about 19 or 20 years and it was a great tournament,” Goodridge said. “The only thing was we always found ourselves playing the same teams. We would’ve played Bedford (which Merrimack played Tuesday) again the day after Christmas and then get Dover or Exeter regardless if we win or lose.”

..

Merrimack will jump into a tournament pool in Nashua that features Nashua South, Nashua North, Alvirne, Milford, Souhegan, Goffstown and Thornton Academy of Maine.



Goodridge said the potential of playing some top Division II teams, including the Grizzlies and new head coach Mike Gasper, Goodridge’s former assistant, might serve the Tomahawks well in the future, with Merrimack’s dwindling enrollment putting it on the cusp of dropping to D-II.

..

Several tournaments bunch up local teams, regardless of their division, to not only keep teams from traveling long distances, but to create further incentive beyond getting extra game repetitions.



The Lakes Region Holiday Tournament at Gilford could be one of those battles for supremacy. The tournament, which runs Dec. 28-30, features host Gilford, Laconia, Winnisquam of Tilton, Newfound of Bristol, Kingswood of Wolfeboro, Belmont, Moultonborough and Prospect Mountain of Alton.

..

Gilford coach Chip Veazey said there are no fierce rivalries present among the lakes schools at this time, but Laconia coach Steve McDonough believes there is still incentive to be on top.



“It’s one of the things you use to get the kids up to play over the vacation,” said McDonough of playing regional schools. “Kids might want to be in bed or playing Xbox during those first-round games at 11 a.m., so it helps make the energy great and makes me love this time of year.”

..

Another regional battle will go down in Concord, where the NHTI Capitol Area Holiday Tournament will bring together some of the area’s best Dec. 26-28. Concord and Pembroke are the only Division I teams in the eight-team field, but the talent is still there with reigning Division II champion Bishop Brady of Concord, undefeated Hopkinton, Kearsarge, Bow, John Stark of Weare and Merrimack Valley of Penacook all in the mix.

..

One of the more intriguing fields will take place at the Keene State College Boys’ High School Basketball Tournament Dec. 26-28. The tournament has two brackets, one featuring respective Division III and Division IV powers Conant of Jaffrey and Epping, and the other with Division IV defending state champion Wilton-Lyndeborough.

..

The Blue Devils and Orioles have a chance to meet in the finals of the “A” bracket, but will need to navigate through the likes of Keene, Coe-Brown Northwood Academy, Smithfield, R.I., and Mamaroneck of Long Island, N.Y. Epping, which lost to champion Smithfield in the opening round of last year’s tournament, committed to returning to the tournament this year before leaving last year’s tournament, understanding the competition and atmosphere will help build the team up for a similar look come tournament time in March.

..

“This is exactly where we wanted to be,” Epping coach Sean Young said. “We’re just stoked to play these types of teams. It’s a tremendous opportunity for a small school like us to even be a part of something like this.”

..

The tournament slate also includes the Oyster River Holiday Tournament at Oyster River High in Durham and the Mike Lee Holiday Bash at Farmington High. Both tournaments run Dec. 26-28 and feature diverse and competitive fields. There will be just six teams at Oyster River, but the Bobcats, Spaulding of Rochester, Winnacunnet of Hampton, Timberlane of Plaistow, Somersworth and Raymond will create some interesting inter-league matchups.

..

The Mike Lee Holiday Bash has variety with at least one team each from Division II, III and IV. The favorites include unbeaten Portsmouth Christian of Dover and Newmarket from D-IV, Sanborn from D-III, and Kennett from D-II.
