NH hospital lays off 6, cuts positions: 4 things to know

Monadnock Community Hospital in Peterborough, N.H., has laid off six workers and cut positions, a hospital spokeswoman said, according to a report from The Keene Sentinel.

Here are four things to know about the layoffs and cuts.

1. The hospital implemented the layoffs and cuts to address a $3 million budget shortfall. "This is largely as a result of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, which really got into full swing in 2014," Laura Gingras, vice president of philanthropy and community relations for MCH, told The Keene Sentinel. "So, we saw a similar gap last year, and even one the year before too."

2. While six people were laid off, some vacant positions also will not be filled and some employees' hours have been cut, Ms. Gingras said, according to the report. She told the publication the number of work hours cut represent the equivalent of 15 full-time jobs.

3. Information on what jobs were eliminated or which employees saw their hours decrease was not provided by MCH, according to the report. However, the hospital did say cuts and layoffs were occurring throughout a number of MCH departments.

4. While the hospital has eliminated jobs, it was also added them. Ms. Gingras told The Keene Sentinel the hospital has brought on two more primary care physicians, a nurse practitioner and a physician assistant, and is hiring a care coordinator.
