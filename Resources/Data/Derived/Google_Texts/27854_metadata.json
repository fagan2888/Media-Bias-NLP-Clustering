About a dozen sit in a circle in armchairs, or shoulder to shoulder on the sofa, a thick book of plays in their laps.\n\n\u201cOne, two, cha cha cha!\u201d one woman reads, \u201cVery good, cha cha cha!\u201d\n\nThe group gathers once a month, rotating among each other\u2019s houses, to read plays together. Today, it\u2019s Neil Simon\u2019s \u201cCome Blow Your Horn,\u201d a comedy about a young man, bored living with his parents, who moves in with his older brother to find excitement.\n\n\u201cAnswer phone, cha cha cha,\u201d the actor reads. \u201cHello? Snow? Don\u2019t you know you could get arrested for having such a sexy voice?\u201d\n\nEveryone here is a member of the San Francisco Village \u2014 a grass-roots group of local seniors from across the city, who banded together to support each other so they could stay home as they age.\n\nMembers help each other with things like grocery shopping, changing lightbulbs, giving rides to doctors\u2019 appointments. A corps of volunteers is on hand to help with gardening, computer support and other chores. And a roster of local vendors offers a range of discounted services, like plumbing. But at the heart of the movement are the social activities.\n\n\u201cYou know what I hear they played at 3 in the morning?\u201d another actor reads from the script. \u201cStrip Scrabble.\u201d\n\nThroughout the year, there are holiday dinners, museum outings, yoga classes, hiking groups. Sarah Goldman started this play-reading group five years ago. For her, joining the village was really about meeting new people after she left her job.\n\n\u201cSo the village came along at a time when I was looking to expand a friendship circle,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s more than that, of course. Goldman is 87. The stairs in her apartment building seem to be getting steeper every year. She knows she can\u2019t stay forever.\n\n\u201cI do not want to move to a continuing care community,\u201d she says. \u201cNor would I have the funds to do so if I did.\u201d\n\nLike many elderly people, Goldman isn\u2019t interested in living with her kids.\n\n\u201cMy family is estranged from me, my biological family,\u201d she says. \u201cI have difficult relationships. They\u2019re across the country.\u201d\n\nGoldman had hoped people in the village could help her identify somewhere else to live on her own. But in mid-September, she moved into a retirement community in San Francisco, one that can provide assisted living if she ever needs it. She says she\u2019s still part of the village and plans to continue with the play-reading group and other activities.\n\n\u201cI appreciate being able to have people that I can talk to,\u201d she says.\n\n100 Villages and Growing\n\nThere are now more than 100 senior villages across the country, and another hundred in the works. But as the movement grows, it is starting to confront some growing pains, particularly around financial sustainability and diversity.\n\nNinety percent of village members are white and middle class. These demographics date back to the founders of the village movement: They didn\u2019t have the money to pay for full-time care to stay at home, but they had too much money to qualify for many government services. Most in-home programs are strictly for low-income folks.\n\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t really services for seniors who are near poor, or who are middle income,\u201d says Carrie Graham, a medical sociologist at UC Berkeley who studies villages. \u201cAnd a lot of services that are available to middle-income seniors are unaffordable.\u201d\n\nJoining a village costs about $50 a month. Those membership fees fund the staff that administers the services and organizes volunteers who give rides and help with chores. But those fees may not be enough anymore. As members grow older, Graham says, village finances are getting strained.\n\n\u201cWe hear villages saying older members might use more services, they might need more volunteers,\u201d she says.\n\nNew Funds Come with Strings Attached\n\nSo they\u2019re looking for more money. In San Francisco, the village started hunting for grants from the city and foundations. But this money comes with strings attached. Funders want the white, middle-class movement to expand to more low-income and minority elders. This might be harder than it sounds.\n\nAt a recent happy hour for members of the Ashby Village in Berkeley, everyone was white. Executive Director Andy Gaines says the Berkeley group was started by former professors from the university. Diversifying beyond that circle has been really difficult.\n\nNews about Ashby Village \u201cis very much passing word of mouth,\u201d Gaines says. \u201cSo it\u2019s people who know people, and so the tendency is for it to stay within a smaller community.\u201d\n\nAshby Village tried to recruit more African-Americans from local churches. But they weren\u2019t interested. Some organizers have observed that communities of color have a stronger emphasis on families caring for elders.\n\n\u201cThere tends to be a stereotype of ethnic groups or immigrant groups being much more accepting of relying on their children. And in fact, expect to rely on their children in old age,\u201d says Graham. \u201cIt would make sense that they may not find a model of independent aging as attractive.\u201d\n\nIn general, Graham and Gaines have noticed a tendency toward racial and religious isolation in aging services.\n\n\u201cEspecially as people are growing older, there is more kind of desire to stay like with like,\u201d Gaines says. \u201cAnd less active movement towards reaching out to meet other populations.\u201d\n\nBack at San Francisco Village, member Janey Norman thinks the focus on race is misplaced. She\u2019s African-American. She says, for her, joining the village was never about meeting other people of color.\n\n\u201cBelonging to a village, it\u2019s about human beings and sharing interests, and caring for each other and being there for each other,\u201d she says.\n\nNorman is all for subsidizing membership fees so that low-income people can join the village. But the idea of funders pushing the movement to diversify racially offends her.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a money thing. \u2018If we get more black people in here, if we get more Asians, we can get more money here,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cWhat is all of this? Why? Why?\u201d\n\nWhat Norman wants is friends to share a bottle of Louis Martini cabernet with. People to talk to about art and music. Folks who will look out for her if there\u2019s an earthquake.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond color, OK,\u201d she says. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not about color. It\u2019s about connection with human beings.\u201d\n\nNew America Media and the Gerontological Society of America provided support for this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Groups of seniors create these associations to share both errands and social activities, so they can continue living at home.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"'Senior Villages' Struggle with Call to Diversify\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/10\\/02\\/senior-villages-movement-confronts-growing-pains\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-02 09:15:13\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-02 17:05:58\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":81630,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Aging\",\"News\",\"Senior Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/09\\/AshbyVillage-e1443032242322.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Groups of seniors create these associations to share both errands and social activities, so they can continue living at home.", "title": "\u2018Senior Villages\u2019 Struggle with Call to Diversify", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/10/02/senior-villages-movement-confronts-growing-pains/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/09/SFV_Member_JaneyN-400x267.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "aging,news,senior health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9da9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnswer phone, cha cha cha,\u201d the actor reads.\n\u201cOne, two, cha cha cha!\u201d one woman reads, \u201cVery good, cha cha cha!\u201dThe group gathers once a month, rotating among each other\u2019s houses, to read plays together.\n100 Villages and GrowingThere are now more than 100 senior villages across the country, and another hundred in the works.\n\u201cWe hear villages saying older members might use more services, they might need more volunteers,\u201d she says.\nYou couldn\u2019t pay any of the 80-year-olds in this Pacific Heights living room to go to a senior center."}
