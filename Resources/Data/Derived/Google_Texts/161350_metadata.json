I just like the feel of him being with our group. I think the guys, they like the feel of him out there. They were razzing him, giving him a hard time. I think that\u2019s good for the camaraderie for our entire group.\u201d\n\nNurkic, who has missed six games with the sprain, is walking much better lately. There remains no timetable for his return.\n\nMeanwhile, forward Darrell Arthur was a limited participant in shootaround due to a strained right calf. He\u2019ll see how it feels pre-game before a final determination about his availability is made.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets\u2019 Jusuf Nurkic remains out, making progress from sprained ankle", "title": "Nuggets\u2019 Jusuf Nurkic remains out, making progress from sprained ankle", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/09/nuggets-jusuf-nurkic-remains-out-making-progress-from-sprained-ankle/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150209__nuggets-Nurkicp1.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150209__nuggets-Nurkicp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-09T12:48:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T22:21:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was really cool to see Juka,\u201d Nuggets interim head coach Melvin Hunt said.\nHe\u2019s still a ways away from playing but Nuggets rookie center Jusuf Nurkic was back out at shootaround on Monday morning, mostly a spectator as he continues to recover from a sprained right ankle.\nMeanwhile, forward Darrell Arthur was a limited participant in shootaround due to a strained right calf.\nI think that\u2019s good for the camaraderie for our entire group.\u201dNurkic, who has missed six games with the sprain, is walking much better lately.\nHe\u2019ll see how it feels pre-game before a final determination about his availability is made."}
