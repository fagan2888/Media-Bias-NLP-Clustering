(WHNT) - The CEO of Decatur Morgan Hospital says the U.S. appears headed toward a single payer health care system, or Medicare for all. Nat Richardson made the remarks during a Morgan County Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting Thursday. He says health care providers need to sit down and prepare.\n\n\"The government will pay us one payment and or commercial insurance payers will pay us one payment. The hospitals would then be responsible for making sure all of the providers thats attached with that episode of care are paid,\" Richardson told WHNT News 19.\n\nThere is a big difference in a so-called single payer system and the Affordable Care Act. Richardson says in the next decade millions of Americans will remain uninsured under the Affordable Care Act, and millions more will be under-insured. That means the delivery of health care services would still conditioned by a patient's ability to pay. However, under a single payer system, everyone's covered.
