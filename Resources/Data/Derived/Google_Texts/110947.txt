A 19-year-old Broken Arrow man was arrested in an elementary school parking lot when police were shown his Facebook message asking to meet a teenage boy for sex.

Police said Brandon Tyler Victory, 19, exchanged messages with the boy and scheduled the meeting at the school, and the boys' family filed a complaint with police.

Police said they read the messages, then went to the parking lot about 8:50 p.m. on Friday to see if Victory showed. A white Ford Explorer pulled into the lot and killed the lights, according to an arrest report. When the driver didn't exit the car, officers went to the vehicle and identified themselves as police.

When they asked Victory why he was there, he said he was on his way home and stopped to call a friend, according to the report. Victory eventually told police he was supposed to meet someone, the report says.

Investigators asked him if he was there to meet the alleged victim, and he said he was, the report says.

Victory reportedly told police the two met through an Internet site and they were together on Monday and Wednesday at someone else's residence and “we talked for a little bit and then [we] laid down.” He reportedly said they performed sexual acts on one another.

Police said they interviewed the person who lived in the home where the alleged encounters took place and he told them Victory and the boy were at his home on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night and the two were in the bedroom about an hour together.

According to the report, Victory claimed the boy's Facebook profile said he was 18 years old, but when they met the first time, he questioned his age and the boy confessed he was only 14. He said he later heard the boy say he was going to be 14 years old in November.
