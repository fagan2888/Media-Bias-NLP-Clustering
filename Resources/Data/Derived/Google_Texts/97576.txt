It's not clear whether the Sean Hannity family's decision to put their Lloyd Harbor, New York mansion on the market is related to his decision to move out of New York State eventually but it certainly has fueled speculation.

Although some reports have suggested that the house on the market is Hannity's home, he actually lives elsewhere. Newsday reports:

The native Long Islander used to live in the four-bedroom, 5-1/2-bath house on the Long Island Sound; today, he lives in Centre Island. He recently said that he plans to move out of New York State in coming years (he blamed high taxes but also has recently spoken out against Gov. Andrew Cuomo's comment that â€œextreme conservatives . . . have no place in the state of New York"). He could not be reached for comment about whether selling the house now has to do with those plans to leave the state, but Elena D'Agostino of Signature Premier Properties speculated, "That might be the reason."

In case you want to do your part to perhaps hasten Hannity's move out of the Empire State, the asking price is $3.6 million. You can take a virtual tour of the house here.

You may recall that on January 21, Hannity said he was too important had too many people counting on him to leave New York right away but that he thought he'd go after his son graduated high school (in about two years).

Stay tuned!
