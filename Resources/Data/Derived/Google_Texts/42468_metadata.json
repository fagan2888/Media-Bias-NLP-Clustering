Now he\u2019s chiming in on what\u2019s proper and what isn\u2019t in Mexican food. Maybe this is what the fourth quarter of Hopenchange looks like, with no topic too small for the full YOPO treatment from O. Frankly, I think it suits him. He got elected as a cultural phenomenon, not because of any knack for governance. Starting social-media fires over whether, say, Pizza Hut\u2019s hot-dog pizza abortion is better than Little Caesar\u2019s bacon-wrapped grease nightmare is exactly what he should be doing with his time.\n\nIt all started so simply.\n\nAdd green peas to your guacamole. Trust us. http://t.co/7imMY9c2ph pic.twitter.com/oeOMt2qgmh \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) July 1, 2015\n\nTwitter went wild over that because everyone\u2019s bored and looking forward to the holiday this weekend, and because few things lend themselves to the sort of vacuously stubborn insistence on the correctness of one\u2019s subjective opinion that Twitter\u2019s known for as an argument over food. O, meanwhile, was holding a Q&A on ObamaCare when someone slipped the \u201cpeas in guac\u201d question in. And because he\u2019s O, and nothing much really matters anymore anyway now that we\u2019re prepared to let Shiite fanatics get a nuclear bomb, he responded:\n\nrespect the nyt, but not buying peas in guac. onions, garlic, hot peppers. classic. https://t.co/MEEI8QHH1V \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) July 1, 2015\n\nAs Sean Hackbarth said, if Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion stands for anything, it stands for the idea that the essence of liberty is the ability to choose what sort of weird food combinations to eat. I thought leftism and libertarianism were all about social experimentation and not accepting staid essentialist definitions of what something \u201cmust be.\u201d Marriage can include gays. Women can include Bruce Jenner. Blackness can include \u2014 well, no, actually, it can\u2019t include Rachel Dolezal, but that\u2019s a special case. Two out of three ain\u2019t bad. Why can\u2019t guac include peas?\n\nIn case you doubt that O\u2019s opinion is now liberal orthodoxy, take it from another liberal who agrees with him:\n\nYou don't put peas in guacamole https://t.co/kG3ewrVv6f \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) July 1, 2015\n\nThis is mere snobbery, and snobbery in service to populism is the worst kind of snobbery. If the Times had proposed adding, say, chocolate to Beef Wellington, no one would care. But guacamole is cheap eats, a staple of food that\u2019s inexpensive, widely available, and usually eaten with one\u2019s hands. It\u2019s blue-collar food. Everyone\u2019s had it, everyone has an unbending opinion on who makes it the best, and no one\u2019s sacrificing an inch on \u201cauthenticity\u201d by letting a vegetable like peas, that\u2019s usually served as a side dish to a more frou-frou entree like steak, join the party. That also explains why there was so much grumbling about the hot-dog pizza lately. It\u2019s tacky to have a strong opinion about which three-Michelin-star restaurant town is best, but it\u2019s OK to be fanatical about what does and doesn\u2019t qualify as appetizing in a food as democratic as pizza. In fact, I think part of the reason the peas-in-guac thing broke big today is because it was the Times that was pushing it. Leave it to an egghead Manhattanite writing for the ruling class\u2019s favorite paper to mess with a simple pleasure like guacamole to make it more \u201cartisanal\u201d or whatever.\n\nBottom line: Eat the hot-dog pizza and put peas in your guac. It could work. And even if it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll at least have the satisfaction of not being that guy with his nose up, sniffing, \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d never allow such a thing in my $1.99 taco garnish.\u201d\n\nExit quotation from Piers Morgan, who proves once again that there\u2019s no situation so bad that he can\u2019t make it worse.\n\nApparently guacamole is a more pressing health care concern for the President than guns. OK then. Night, @POTUS. \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) July 1, 2015\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Questions.", "title": "Obama finally weighs in: Should guacamole contain peas?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/01/obama-finally-weighs-in-should-guacamole-contain-peas/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-01T23:21:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-01T22:00:19+00:00"}, "keywords": "guacamole, New York Times, nyt, Obama, peas,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca34\"", "article_summary": "Why can\u2019t guac include peas?\nBut guacamole is cheap eats, a staple of food that\u2019s inexpensive, widely available, and usually eaten with one\u2019s hands.\nObama finally weighs in: Should guacamole contain peas?\nO, meanwhile, was holding a Q&A on ObamaCare when someone slipped the \u201cpeas in guac\u201d question in.\nAdd green peas to your guacamole."}
