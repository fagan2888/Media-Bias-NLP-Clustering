An awareness workshop took place at a local church Saturday afternoon in Meridian.

Wesley Chapel hosted the event highlighting that January 11th is human trafficking awareness day. Organizer Mary Ann Shook says she started a brand new organization called Sadieâ€™s Haven. The group's focus is to help make the public aware that human trafficking exists in our own backyard.

"It's our job, as members of the community, to educate our community and to protect our young people," Shook says.

Shook says she has spoken to many people about being aware of human trafficking.
