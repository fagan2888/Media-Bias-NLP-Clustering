Team Hillary is reacting predictably to news reports about the forthcoming book, "Clinton Cash," which purports to connect the dots on the Clintons' unethical, multimillion-dollar favor bank -- which was awash in unvetted foreign cash. Her Majesty's protectors are doing their thing, savaging the messenger as a right-wing hatchet man, and risibly shrugging off the yet-unveiled revelations as "old news," "conspiracies" and "distractions." I discussed these developments on today's edition of Outnumbered:





The book, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, asserts that foreign entities who made payments to the Clinton Foundation and to Mr. Clinton through high speaking fees received favors from Mrs. Clinton’s State Department in return. “We will see a pattern of financial transactions involving the Clintons that occurred contemporaneous with favorable U.S. policy decisions benefiting those providing the funds,” Mr. Schweizer writes...“Clinton Cash” is potentially more unsettling, both because of its focused reporting and because major news organizations including The Times, The Washington Post and Fox News have exclusive agreements with the author to pursue the story lines found in the book...He writes mainly in the voice of a neutral journalist and meticulously documents his sources, including tax records and government documents, while leaving little doubt about his view of the Clintons.
