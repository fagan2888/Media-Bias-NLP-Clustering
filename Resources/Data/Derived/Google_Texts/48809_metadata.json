Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, says he\u2019s simply following the law in likely getting health insurance through an Obamacare exchange, accusing the media of playing \u201cgotcha games\u201d with the development.\n\n\u201cYou know, the mainstream media loves to play gotcha games,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in an interview with CBN News\u2019 David Brody.\n\nHe said his wife, Heidi, decided to take an unpaid leave of absence from her job when he announced his presidential campaign. Since she\u2019s losing her benefits in the process, he said, they are going to take health insurance from their employer, \u201cso in all likelihood, we\u2019ll go on the exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so suddenly, all the media says, \u2018Ahahaha, gotcha, because Cruz is now signing up for Obamacare,\u2019 \u201d he said in the interview, which was posted on The Daily Signal\u2019s website. \u201cListen, I have zero intention of taking any government subsidy or Obama subsidy. Rather, what I\u2019m going to do is pay in the marketplace for health insurance for my family just like millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz went on to say that just because he wants to abolish the IRS, for example, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to stop paying taxes.\n\n\u201cSome of these media outlets think that following the law is somehow less than principled,\u201d he said. \u201cI strongly support a flat tax, abolishing the IRS. It doesn\u2019t mean I refuse to pay my taxes today, because the current law isn\u2019t a flat tax. It is my intention to continue to lead the fight to repeal every word of Obamacare so that none of us are burdened by this law. But in the meantime, I and everybody else are bound by the laws that are passed in this country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
