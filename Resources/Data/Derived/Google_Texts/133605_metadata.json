Will college affordability be a key issue in the presidential election? What are the candidates\u2019 positions on Middle East policy?\n\nMichigan State University experts can discuss these topics and many others in the months leading up to the Nov. 8, 2016 election.\n\nIn addition to Barack Obama\u2019s term-limited presidential seat, all 435 positions in the U.S. House of Representatives are up for grabs, as well as 34 of the 100 U.S. Senate seats.\n\nBelow is a selection of MSU experts on a variety of issues. For more experts, contact Andy Henion, MSU media communications manager, at (517) 355-3295, cell (517) 281-6949 or henion@msu.edu.\n\nPOLITICS, ADVERTISING, DEBATES\n\nMatt Grossmann, associate professor of political science, can discuss the candidates, political parties (especially Democratic/Republican differences and the role of ideology and interest groups in each party), television advertising and candidate messages, campaign consultants and strategy, and negativity.\n\n\u201cWith two contested presidential primaries and a closely divided national electorate, I expect an exciting 2016 campaign season. Though insurgent candidates are gaining attention now, history suggests that the party establishment favorites usually prevail. But Democratic and Republican races are fought on dissimilar ground, with Democratic candidates assembling social group coalitions and Republicans fighting for the mantle of conservatism.\u201d\n\nGrossmann can be reached at (517) 355-7655 or matt@mattg.org.\n\nWill Repko, MSU's head debate coach, can discuss presidential and vice presidential debates, including the candidates' performances, debating styles and the significance of the debates on the election. Repko can be reached at (517) 202-0178 or repkowil@msu.edu.\n\nCamilia Suleiman, a linguist and the academic director of MSU\u2019s Arabic Flagship Program, can discuss politicians\u2019 use of language about race and gender throughout their campaigns.

Kolt can be reached at (517) 355-2314 or kolt@msu.edu.\n\nECONOMICS/BUSINESS/TRADE POLICY\n\nTomas Hult, Byington Endowed Chair and director of MSU\u2019s International Business Center, can discuss how the U.S. election could affect the global economy. Specifically, he can offer expertise on international policy, trade agreement, global leadership, international trade, U.S. international competitiveness and general international business issues.

More than a year before the general election, candidates in both parties have already begun to release proposals for controlling the growth in tuition prices and lower the burden of student loan debt. While American presidential campaigns are famous for bold and innovative pronouncements, many a grand idea from the campaign is lost between the election and the stroll down Pennsylvania Avenue following the inauguration. The reality of having to govern, often in conjunction with at least one if not both houses of Congress under the control of the opposing party, often forces more pragmatic and measured solutions than the far-reaching proposals introduced during campaigns.\u201d\n\nHeller can be reached at: (517) 355-1734 or dheller@msu.edu.\n\nSarah Reckhow, assistant professor of political science, can discuss education policy and the candidates\u2019 positions on education.\n\n\u201cCommon Core may be of particular interest in the Republican primary, especially Jeb Bush\u2019s position and role in promoting the standards. Public support for Common Core has fallen, with the lowest support among Republicans. So this could be a big issue for all of the candidates, but especially for Bush.\u201d\n\nReckhow can be reached at (517) 432-0028 or reckhow@msu.edu.\n\n\n\nFOREIGN POLICY, INTERNATIONAL ISSUES\n\nRussell Lucas, director of MSU\u2019s Global Studies in the Arts and Humanities and associate professor of Arab studies, is an expert on U.S.-Middle East relations and Arabic culture.

Zierler can be reached at (517) 432-8300 or zierler@msu.edu.\n\nMichael Colaresi, professor of political science, can speak to issues of secrecy and intelligence in democracies, domestic support for and opposition to international cooperation and conflict, and the role of militias and paramilitary forces in civil conflicts.

The loss of a child from these preventable illnesses is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nConner-Warren can be reached at (517) 355-4719 or rhonda.conner-warren@hc.msu.edu.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nDavid Thronson, professor in the College of Law\u2019s Immigration Law Clinic, can discuss candidates\u2019 proposed immigration policies, as well as immigration reform efforts.
