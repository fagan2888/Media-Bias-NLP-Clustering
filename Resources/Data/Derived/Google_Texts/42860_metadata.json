In November and January, more than 87,000 cubic yards of spent material was scooped up. The tally doesn\u2019t include at least 150 huge tree stumps, Marshall said.\n\nThe work extends through the foothills of three counties hit hard by the flood \u2014 Boulder, Jefferson and Larimer. Funding for the pickups comes from the $450 million of federal flood relief allocated to Colorado, Mohr said.\n\nCrews have picked up branches, plants, trees and grass that came loose during the flood. Also on the pickup list is wood framing from houses, furniture, carpet, clothes and concrete.\n\nRegular household garbage and hard-to-recycle items, like televisions, also have been added to the pickup piles, but crews sift through and reject those, Mohr said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some people try to slip their garbage through, but this is strictly for flood items,\u201d she said.\n\nMost furniture and other construction material is taken to a local landfill. The rest, especially vegetation, is stored by CDOT and recycled for construction or slope stabilization.\n\nUnder the program, residents push, pull or drag flood-damaged items to a specific drop-off spot at least a day or two before the scheduled pickup.\n\nThe pickups are weather-dependent, but crews have been able to get to the piles on most days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had several days when crews were hit with snow and ice, but they\u2019ve worked through it,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nMonte Whaley: 720-929-0907, mwhaley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/montewhaley\n\nSchedule for flood-zone debris pickup\n\n\u2022 Colorado 72: Final pass in Coal Creek Canyon will be Monday.
