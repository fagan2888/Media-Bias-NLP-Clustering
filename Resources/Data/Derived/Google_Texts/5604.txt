Police arrested a man and a woman in connection to the armed robbery of an Oklahoma City 7-Eleven store.

According to police, at about 10 a.m. on Tuesday, July 1, officers responded to the report of an armed robbery at 7-Eleven, located at 2400 N. MacArthur.

The store supervisor told police that he was taking deposits from the register to the back room to count the money. He said he had the daily deposits in a bag in his hands when a man came up to him and said “Give me the bag,” and tried to grab the bag.

The supervisor said during a struggle with the suspect, he hit the suspect one time in his side. That’s when the suspect backed off and pulled out a gun. The supervisor said at that time, he dropped the bag on the ground, and the suspect said “look everybody, free money.”

The suspect reportedly then grabbed the money and ran out of the store.

Two others employees at the scene witnessed the incident and spoke with police. Officers were able to obtain a surveillance video from a nearby business. Police learned that after the suspect left the store, he ran towards the 5800 block of N.W. 24th Street. Shortly after, a white Chevy Impala could be seen driving eastbound on N.W. 24th Street.

On Monday, July 28, police arrested two suspects in connection to the crime. Twenty-one-year-old Tessa Johnson and 21-year-old Denzel Ford were both arrested and booked into the Oklahoma County jail on charges of robbery with a firearm.
