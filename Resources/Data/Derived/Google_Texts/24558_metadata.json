She joined the nearly 1,000 people who came from around the nation, including the youth competing in fifteen national contests. The conference, now in its 94th year, is held annually in early January, coincides with the National Western Stock Show. Sears received the trip to Western National Roundup after she placed first at the Colorado State Fair 4-H Demonstration Contest in August. Sears competed in the Family and Consumer Science Presentation Event placing third.\n\nWestern National Roundup provides a place for youth to compete nationally while encouraging teamwork and self-confidence, and while focusing on the 4-H Mission Mandates: Science, Engineering, Technology, Mathematics, Healthy Living and Citizenship.\n\nEach participating youth and adult participates in one or more contests and/or workshops. While each attendee receives a souvenir commemorating their time at Western National Roundup, individual and team excellence is rewarded at an award brunch and ceremony, building personal pride and reinforcing the benefits of setting goals. Leadership is developed at these events by encouraging decision-making and teamwork skills, critical thinking, and independence. Healthy Living is demonstrated at the workshops, the dances, the educational tours, and through the lifestyle that is shown through each contest.\n\nEducational tours and entertainment provide service learning and community-based learning opportunities, focusing on the importance of each youth's citizenship within his or her team, community, and nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4-H and FFA members between the ages of 14 and 19 qualify for the conference either by winning their home state's contest or being chosen as a state delegate. The competitions held at Western National Roundup include horse and livestock judging, hippology, horse demonstrations and public speaking, parliamentary procedure, family consumer sciences presentations and bowl, consumer decision making, fashion review, public speaking prepared and impromptu, and meats judging. Workshops offered throughout the week provide a learning experience for the youth.\n\nYouth participants develop a mastery of their respective subject matters, but more importantly, gain life-long skills. Such skills as public speaking, professionalism, and good sportsmanship along with the memories and new friendships will outlast the trophies and ribbons won this coming week.\n\nSears is an eight year 4-H member of the Travelers 4-H Club. She has taken projects in breeding and market beef, market swine, market goat, clothing, and veterinary science. In addition to competing at the Colorado State Fair in the demonstration contest, she has exhibited livestock at both, National Western Stock Show and the Colorado State Fair. Sears has been a club officer, a record book winner and a pacesetter. Her parents are Tom and Christine Sears of Wiggins.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/fort-morgan-local-news/ci_25087474/amanda-sears-attends-western-national-roundup", "modificationDate": "2014-02-08T11:58:02-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2014/0207/20140207__08ftroundup~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2024-02-07T15:23:08-0700", "description": "Amanda Sears, of Wiggins, attended Western National Roundup, in January at the Renaissance Denver Hotel.", "ag": {"canon": "FortMorganTimes:article:25087474:view"}, "startDate": "2014-02-08T11:57:41-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/fort-morgan-local-news/ci_25087474/amanda-sears-attends-western-national-roundup", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2014/0207/20140207__08ftroundup~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Amanda Sears, of Wiggins, attended Western National Roundup, in January at the Renaissance Denver Hotel.", "title": "Amanda Sears attends Western National Roundup"}, "twitter": {"domain": "fortmorgantimes.com", "description": "Amanda Sears, of Wiggins, attended Western National Roundup, in January at the Renaissance Denver Hotel.", "title": "Amanda Sears attends Western National Roundup", "url": "http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/fort-morgan-local-news/ci_25087474/amanda-sears-attends-western-national-roundup", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2014/0207/20140207__08ftroundup~1.jpg", "site": "@fortmorgantimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-08T11:57:41-0700", "sailthru.site": "fortmorgantimes.com", "sailthru.title": "Amanda Sears attends Western National Roundup", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "eft02te25vH0XbQ44RHik-QVdSWBMa6FaMX67tqgeec", "verify-v1": "LR4Od6pVdw+l77OvOjnTMA990zoSdsdx5+1eNeWXVCw=", "y_key": "87220ae8e8f6d27d", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2014/0207/20140207__08ftroundup~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-02-08T11:58:17-0700", "news_keywords": "Local News, Local News news, Fort Morgan Colorado Local News news, Fort Morgan Colorado news, Local News Fort Morgan news, Local News Colorado news, US Local News news, world Local News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafc3\"", "article_summary": "Amanda SearsAmanda Sears, of Wiggins, attended Western National Roundup, in January at the Renaissance Denver Hotel.\nSears received the trip to Western National Roundup after she placed first at the Colorado State Fair 4-H Demonstration Contest in August.\nThe conference, now in its 94th year, is held annually in early January, coincides with the National Western Stock Show.\nWhile each attendee receives a souvenir commemorating their time at Western National Roundup, individual and team excellence is rewarded at an award brunch and ceremony, building personal pride and reinforcing the benefits of setting goals.\nWestern National Roundup provides a place for youth to compete nationally while encouraging teamwork and self-confidence, and while focusing on the 4-H Mission Mandates: Science, Engineering, Technology, Mathematics, Healthy Living and Citizenship."}
