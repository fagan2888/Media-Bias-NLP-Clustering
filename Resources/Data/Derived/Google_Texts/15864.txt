Grant School District 110 in Fairview Heights and Harmony-Emge District 175 in Belleville are limiting the number of school days a month to 19 to comply with the Affordable Care Act mandate. That means September is one of the months in which students have extra days off â€” including a four-day Labor Day holiday.
