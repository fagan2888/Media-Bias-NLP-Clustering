(\u201cThey\u2019re Liars, and That\u2019s Just the Least of Their Problems\u201d ran the headline of the New York Times review.)\n\nShe\u2019s written about her early years, her drinking, a divorce, and her recovery and Catholicism in two other memoirs, \u201cCherry\u201d and \u201cLit.\u201d A professor at Syracuse University\u2019s prestigious writing program, Karr has just released \u201cThe Art of Memoir,\u201d which is somewhere between a writing instruction book and a defense of the popular but sometimes controversial genre. Cheryl Strayed, whom Karr knew during the \u201cWild\u201d author\u2019s time at Syracuse, calls the book \u201castonishingly perceptive, wildly entertaining, and profoundly honest.\u201d (Karr did teach Koren Zailckas, author of \u201cSmashed: Story of Drunken Girlhood.\u201d) At the very least, Karr has managed to make a tome about a prose form as ornery as her books about sex, drink and sorrow.\n\nWe spoke with Karr in San Francisco, where she was touring behind the book. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nDo you think there\u2019s still a bias against the memoir, for being not as serious or substantial as the novel?\n\nI do! Absolutely! When I was in grad school, I think I mentioned Geoffrey Wolff described it as like engraving the Lord\u2019s Prayer on a grain of rice: It\u2019s just a province of loser, outsider weirdos. As though novels aren\u2019t.\n\nBut yeah\u2026 There\u2019s no danger of the American Academy calling me up to induct me. I\u2019m seen as this low, trashy kind of creature, which is probably not that far from wrong. But certainly the readership for it has ratcheted up, which is a great thing.\n\nWhy do you think it\u2019s considered a less serious form?\n\nI don\u2019t think there are any more bad memoirs than there are bad novels: Most novels are bad and most memoirs are bad and most poems are bad and most movies are bad\u2026\n\nI just think genres rise and fall: When the novel began, [authors] were seen as morally reprehensible because it was made up. And [because they didn\u2019t have] any interest in truth. Obviously you can tell great truths in a novel or you can lie in a novel. It\u2019s like photography, which was seen as not an art until the latter half of the last century. That began to change.\n\nBut [memoir] is filling a need of dealing with the real. As novels have gotten less real, our readership has grown.\n\nThese days, we associate the memoir with pain or trauma or difficult childhood \u2014\n\nIsn\u2019t that what all art is about? Isn\u2019t all art about drama? I think there\u2019s something about it being personal\u2026 A novel is seen as grander\u2026 Or that you could write a novel and your character and your values would not be on display, as they are in a memoir. Or that reality doesn\u2019t inform a novel. As I\u2019ve said, the best parts of David Foster Wallace\u2019s fiction are nonfiction.\n\nIs a memoir a substitute for therapy? Does writing one help or help with the wound that sometime motivates it?\n\nI had a therapist ask me last night\u2026 I think therapy should be a requisite for everybody anyway. I had such a difficult childhood, I don\u2019t know what a normal person, occupying a normal body, would feel like. For me, I had to be in therapy for 15 years before I could even start trying to write the story. In therapy, you pay them; in a memoir, hopefully, they pay you.\n\nI think it is true that writing a memoir is cathartic. But unless it\u2019s cathartic for the reader, don\u2019t publish it\u2026 It\u2019s a bomb that doesn\u2019t go off until the reader starts reading it.\n\nThe other debate around the memoir is the role of reality and truth \u2013 how far is too far for embellishing details. How do you come down on this? You and other writers have been criticized for how you call it.\n\nI actually haven\u2019t been criticized \u2014\n\nI\u2019m talking about the Janet Maslin review.\n\nShe made a mistake. I wrote her an email and said, You misread this.\n\nThere\u2019s a big difference between accidentally misremembering a small detail, and making up an event that didn\u2019t happen. And if you\u2019re doing something to trick or deceive people, you know when you\u2019re doing that: It isn\u2019t hard to figure out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mary Karr talks to Salon about David Foster Wallace's \"Eddie Haskell\" side and her new book \"The Art of Memoir\"", "title": "Mary Karr on the \u201closer, outsider weirdos\u201d of memoir and skipping the David Foster Wallace movie: \u201cThe whole St. David thing \u2026 it\u2019s a little hard to take\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mary Karr talks to Salon about David Foster Wallace's \"Eddie Haskell\" side and her new book \"The Art of Memoir\"", "title": "Mary Karr on the \u201closer, outsider weirdos\u201d of memoir and skipping the David Foster Wallace movie: \u201cThe whole St. David thing \u2026 it\u2019s a little hard to take\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/27/mary_karr_on_the_loser_outsider_weirdos_of_memoir_and_skipping_the_david_foster_wallace_movie_the_whole_st_david_thing_its_a_little_hard_to_take/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/mary_karr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mary Karr talks to Salon about David Foster Wallace's \"Eddie Haskell\" side and her new book \"The Art of Memoir\"", "title": "Mary Karr on the \u201closer, outsider weirdos\u201d of memoir and skipping the David Foster Wallace movie: \u201cThe whole St. David thing \u2026 it\u2019s a little hard to take\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/mary_karr.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Timberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, David Foster Wallace, Editor's Picks, Mary Karr, Memoir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I had a therapist ask me last night\u2026 I think therapy should be a requisite for everybody anyway.\nDo you think there\u2019s still a bias against the memoir, for being not as serious or substantial as the novel?\nTopics: Books, David Foster Wallace, Editor's Picks, Mary Karr, Memoir, Entertainment NewsTwenty years ago, Mary Karr helped kick off the memoir boom with her book \u201cThe Liar\u2019s Club,\u201d which described growing up in a small East Texas town with a charming, mendacious father and deeply pious, hard-drinking family.\nThese days, we associate the memoir with pain or trauma or difficult childhood \u2014Isn\u2019t that what all art is about?\nWe spoke with Karr in San Francisco, where she was touring behind the book."}
