Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly has been under fire following a series of revelations that seem to show he lied about numerous major reporting milestones in his career, from witnessing the murder of nuns in El Salvador to being witness to combat in the Falklands War to personally seeing the suicide of a figure involved in the JFK assassination investigation.

O’Reilly and his bosses at Fox have tried to explain away these apparent lies as simply matters of semantics, for example, claiming that he simply meant he viewed photographs of the assassinated nuns.

But a pair of new investigations provides the most damning evidence yet that O’Reilly outright lied about several events in his career, severely undermining whatever credibility he has left.

Video Of O'Reilly Reporting From Falklands' “War zone”

Mother Jones' David Corn and Daniel Schulman unearthed the original 1982 CBS News video featuring Bill O'Reilly reporting from Argentina. Recall that O'Reilly claimed to see soldiers “gunning down” Argentine civilians with “real bullets.”

Here's the actual video report he filed:

Although O'Reilly has admitted he was never actually in the Falkland Islands where the military conflict occurred, he claimed that the “combat situation” he was in involved at least violent protests in Argentina where killings occurred. The video clip above makes no mention of lethal violence in protests or a massacre that O'Reilly later claimed happened. He does mention that “some journalists behind the line were hurt” and the footage includes images of tear gas being used, but what is shown is similar to protests in the United States. In other words, there may have been heavy-handed use of police force, but there were no massacres, and it certainly wasn't the military combat zone O'Reilly later claimed it was.
