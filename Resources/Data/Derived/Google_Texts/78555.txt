This year the healthcare sees double the people under 35 sign up

Michael Chadwick is all for Obamacare insuranceâ€”up to a point.



The 32-year old Manhattan realtor was uninsured in his late twenties, and he was optimistic when he initially signed up for coverage three years ago. Then, his income changed.



"I couldn't keep up with the payments, so I had no health insurance for the remainder of 2014," Chadwick explained to CNBC. He had a better year in 2015, and he's hopeful he'll be able to maintain his health coverage again this year. Still, he expressed frustration with the law's mechanics.



"The Affordable Healthcare Act (ACA) doesn't take into account that small business owners may not have consistent income," he said.

Recently, the Obama administration said 11.3 million Americans had signed up for 2016 health exchange plans by late December. That's better than administrations cautious estimate that enrollment would top out at 10 million this year, and open enrollment does not end until January 31st.



Health care observers, however, see the milestone differently.



"That's still significantly lower than what experts had initially expected at this point in time in exchange implementation," said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president with health care consulting firm Avalere. "We had anticipated, based on the Congressional Budget Office estimates, that perhaps 21 million people might be enrolled in 2016."
