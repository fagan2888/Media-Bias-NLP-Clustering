The move could cost Assurant up to $250 million, Modern Healthcare reports.\n\nThe fact that no company stepped up to acquire Assurant Health indicates many health insurers believed it was not worth the risk, said Stuart Gunn, a healthcare managing director at investment bank Houlihan Lokey. Consumers with exchange plans have the option of going with a new insurer every year during open enrollment. Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and other large commercial carriers with sizable exchange presences might have figured, \u201cWe can just pick up most of those members on our own,\u201d Gunn said.\n\nMilwaukee-based Assurant, which was new to the Illinois health insurance exchange this year, dubbed Get Covered Illinois, was one of eight companies offering more than 400 plans.\n\nRelated: Assurant Health may exit Illinois Obamacare exchange\n\nAssurant Health will sell its self-funded small-group business and supplemental health plans to National General Holdings Corp., a publicly traded insurance company based in New York City, for an undisclosed sum. However, the individual market represented a vast majority of the insurer's revenue.\n\nThe decision to shutter operations means Assurant Health will not sell plans during the Affordable Care Act's next open-enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31, 2016. Federal law requires health insurers to give at least 180 days notice if they want to stop selling individual plans. Assurant Health's 1 million policyholders will be notified of the situation by letter next week.\n\nMARKETPLACE HOPES\n\nAssurant Health offered health plans on 16 exchanges this year, the first and only ACA enrollment for the insurer. Similar to other insurers, Assurant Health looked to capitalize on the new, evolving individual marketplaces in which consumers are encouraged to shop for health plans as they would for other commodities.\n\nBut in the past 15 months, Assurant Health lost $148 million on the individual policies, which executives said was \u201csignificantly worse than we anticipated.\u201d Underpriced premiums and higher-than-expected medical claims from its sick membership drove the losses and forced Assurant\u2014better known for its home and life policies\u2014to consider selling the health insurance operations in April.\n\nAssurant Health's reputation going into the exchanges also needed a heavy lift. Several state insurance departments, including Connecticut and Missouri, fined the company millions of dollars during the past several years. Regulators routinely found that Assurant Health failed to pay or unreasonably denied medical claims.\n\nTo counter the large deficit, Assurant Health pitched lofty premium rate hikes to the federal government for 2016 plans, some higher than 70%. That may prompt members to jump to other plans in the fall.\n\nThe demise of Assurant Health signals hurdles for new entrants in the individual market, particularly when an insurer doesn't have the same size or provider negotiation leverage as a larger carrier. \u201cThis is becoming more and more of a scale game,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cIf you're an undersized player like an Assurant, it's going to be very difficult to make the math work.\u201d\n\nExiting the market will cost Assurant anywhere from $175 million to $250 million, the company said. Up to $110 million of that total comes from the expectation that premiums will not cover future medical claims and other expenses. That estimated reserve loss already includes the hundreds of millions of dollars Assurant Health expects to receive from the ACA's risk-mitigation programs, known as the 3 Rs. The ACA created the risk programs to offset large losses and prevent adverse risk selection as insurers took on a sicker and more costly patient base.\n\nSeverance-related costs will total up to $95 million, Assurant predicted. About 1,700 Assurant Health jobs will be cut, and a first phase will come this summer with 300 job reductions. Assurant said employees will have a chance to apply for other open positions within the company.\n\nThis story originally appeared on the website of Crain's sister publication Modern Healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "byline": "Bob Herman", "timeCrawled": "20160526_00:06:37", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "title": "Assurant Health closing individual insurance business", "taxo_Industries": "Health Insurance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Assurant Health closing individual insurance business"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "summary": "The Milwaukee firm, new to the Illinois health insurance exchange this year, failed to find a buyer.
