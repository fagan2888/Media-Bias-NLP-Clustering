On the Democratic side, front runner Hillary Rodham Clinton will report having raised $45 million.\n\nCruz was the first major Republican to wade into the GOP primary, which will soon have 16 formally declared candidates. After his March 23 announcement at Liberty University in Virginia, his campaign raised just over $4 million in the final week of that month. Since then, he\u2019s collected another $10 million, his campaign said. Cruz also transferred $250,000 from his Senate campaign to his presidential campaign, according to documents filed with the FEC.\n\n\u201cThe grassroots energy and support we are seeing is overwhelming,\u201d Cruz said in a statement.\n\nCruz also will benefit from several super PACs that are supporting him and can raise money without contribution limits. Those groups have previously said they have raised $37 million.\n\nPresidential campaigns must report their fundraising details to federal regulators by July 15. Outside groups such as super PACs have a later deadline.\n\nThis report was written by Julie Bykowicz of the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz's presidential campaign has raised more than $14 million since the Texas senator launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination just over three months ago, his campaign said Sunday.", "pubdate": 20150705, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Ted Cruz's presidential campaign has raised more than $14 million since the Texas senator launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination just over three months ago, his campaign said Sunday.", "title": "Ted Cruz's presidential campaign reports $14 million in fundraising", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cruz-RTX1F6SG.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/ted-cruzs-presidential-campaign-reports-14-million-fundraising/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Ted Cruz's presidential campaign has raised more than $14 million since the Texas senator launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination just over three months ago, his campaign said Sunday.", "title": "Ted Cruz's presidential campaign reports $14 million in fundraising", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cruz-RTX1F6SG.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Vote 2016"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "GOP, PBS NewsHour Weekend, politics, presidential candidate, Ted Cruz, Vote 2016"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign has raised more than $14 million since the Texas senator launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination just over three months ago, his campaign said Sunday.\nCruz also transferred $250,000 from his Senate campaign to his presidential campaign, according to documents filed with the FEC.\nAfter his March 23 announcement at Liberty University in Virginia, his campaign raised just over $4 million in the final week of that month.\nRepublican Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and political novice, will report having raised $8.3 million for his presidential candidacy, his campaign said on Wednesday.\nOutside groups such as super PACs have a later deadline."}
