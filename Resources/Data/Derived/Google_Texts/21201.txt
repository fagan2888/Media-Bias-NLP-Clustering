The man accused of opening fire during a fight in Glenwood turned himself into authorities Saturday and is now out of jail on bail.

Police said 42-year-old Hurl Beechum faces several charges, but posted $10,000 bond shortly after turning himself in Saturday night.

According to investigators, Beechum shot Colton McDaniel, 21, in the leg Sunday during a fight outside Beechum’s stepfather’s home.

Beechum’s stepfather, Richard Hutchinson, is the principal of Glenwood High School. Hutchinson corrected a group when he allegedly overheard someone using a racial slur.

The incident lead to a fight involving nine people, police say.

Denver Cook, 18, is charged for allegedly knocking the principal unconscious.

McDaniel is also charged with assault.

Beechum, Hutchinson and McDaniel were taken to a hospital after the incident.

A fourth man, 20-year-old Liam Whitehouse, faces weapons charges after authorities say he made a suspicious Facebook post after the shooting. They say a sword and gun were found in his vehicle.

Court records do not list attorneys for the men.
