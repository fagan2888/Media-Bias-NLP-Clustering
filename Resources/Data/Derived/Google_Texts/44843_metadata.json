Now, Sunboy will headline the Larimer Lounge on May 17 after playing opening spots on a few notable bills in the subsequent months. With a knack for hazy melodies and an affinity for tie-dye projectors, Sunboy joins the new age of psych music that has been made popular by Tame Impala and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Wild High, Thanks for Everything and Male Blonding open the show. ($10, larimerlounge.com)\n\nLeave it to Lana Del Rey to make her Colorado debut in the most Lana Del Rey way possible. The singer has always had panache in her short, bright career \u2014 especially when it comes to dominating headlines and conversation. And so it should only make sense that she\u2019ll play her first Colorado show by headlining the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre on May 19. Del Rey\u2019s 2012 album \u201cBorn to Die\u201d dominated sales, becoming the fifth-best-selling album that year thanks to her somber, delightfully creepy persona. This year, she\u2019s prepping the release of her new album, \u201cUltraviolence.\u201d (Sold out)\n\nMatt Miller: mrmiller@denverpost.com, @Official_MattM\n\nGlobal Dub Festival.
