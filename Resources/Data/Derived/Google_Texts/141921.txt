Worrying about President Obama's lame duck status following major Democratic Party losses in the midterm election, on Sunday's NBC Nightly News, White House correspondent Kristen Welker proclaimed: "...Republicans prepare to take over both houses of Congress, vowing to undo Mr. Obama's most treasured accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act."

Welker made the declaration during a report on President Obama beginning his trip to Asia, something Welker framed as a chance for him to escape his political woes:

President Obama left the White House overnight, heading to China, nearly 7,000 miles from Washington and last week's election day drubbing. On the agenda here, the economy, trade, and his place in history....As much as he might want this trip to be the foundation for a lasting legacy, the political trouble will still be there when he returns to Washington.

On Monday's Today, Welker described Obama "trying to rehabilitate his diminished status on the world stage after last week's election day defeat by Republicans."

Like Welker, on Friday's Nightly News, anchor Brian Williams lamented uncertainty for ObamaCare:

And right about the time the President was breaking bread he got a piece of bad news. The Supreme Court will take up another challenge to his signature ObamaCare law. At stake, health insurance coverage for 5.5 million low-income Americans who bought through federal exchanges and now stand to lose the subsidies that made coverage affordable for them.
