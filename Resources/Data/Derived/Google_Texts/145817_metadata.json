I\u2019ve seen it in soccer, cycling, swimming, basketball and baseball,\u201d Priest said.\n\n\"Go to an emergency room any given weekend and see how many people are in there from alcohol abuse and fighting, then show me the beds where people are in there for steroid overdose or steroid use.\"Lee Priest\n\n\u201cIn 60 per cent of gyms I walk into there are young kids on steroids,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any roid rage from them. I see a few idiots, but I see idiots whether they take steroids or drink alcohol.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an idiot you\u2019re an idiot, no matter what you\u2019re taking.\u201d\n\nPriest, who won the Mr Universe title last year, slammed suggestions from Premier Barry O\u2019Farrell that steroid use had contributed to violence in Kings Cross.\n\n\u201cBarry O\u2019Farrell needs to talk to people in the know like myself, who\u2019ve been using them for years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMr Universe is on another planet. I make no apologies for getting tough on illegal supply and possession of steroids as part of our crackdown on drug and alcohol-fuelled violence.\u201dBarry O' Farrell\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a fight since high school, never had a speeding ticket. Roid rage is a myth. I see more idiots doing shit drunk than on steroids.\n\n\u201cIf steroids make you crazy and fight, then why aren\u2019t gyms and all other pro sporting places full of fights 24/7?\u201d\n\nWhen the state government announced its response to ongoing problems in Kings Cross, the harshest penalties were dealt out to steroid users.\n\nJail terms for steroid possession or supply were increased from two years to 25 years. This was despite the Government\u2019s focus on alcohol related violence\n\n\u201cI find it strange that if I\u2019m a professional athlete, an adult using a steroid for my given sport and had two bottles in the house for an injection once a week, I could get 25 years for doing that. I\u2019m not hurting anyone,\u201d Priest said.\n\n\"In 60 per cent of gyms I walk into there are young kids on steroids. I don\u2019t see any roid rage from them. I see a few idiots, but I see idiots whether they take steroids or drink alcohol.\"Lee Priest\n\nHe believes the tougher penalties for steroid use don\u2019t address the underlying issue.\n\n\u201cGo to an emergency room any given weekend and see how many people are in there from alcohol abuse and fighting, then show me the beds where people are in there for steroid overdose or steroid use,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mr O\u2019Farrell refused to backdown on his hardline approach.\n\n\u201cMr Universe is on another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cI make no apologies for getting tough on illegal supply and possession of steroids as part of our crackdown on drug and alcohol-fuelled violence.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s top criminologist Dr Don Weatherburn, who insists links between anabolic steroids and violence, and alcohol and violence are well established.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re full of steroids and aggro and drunk, you lose your self control \u2014 it\u2019s a toxic brew,\u201d Dr Weatherburn said.\n\nPriest claims there is no official link between steroids and violence, but admits obsessive behaviour could be a cause for meltdowns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve witnessed guys on strict diets get mad when they can\u2019t eat food, but this whole roid rage thing is a myth,\u201d he said.\n\nDayne Hudson, a natural bodybuilder and creator of fitnflexed.com, said there\u2019s no doubt steroid use is on the rise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never used steroids in my life, but I\u2019ve been around gyms for long enough to know that what was once the domain of a few professional athletes is now becoming less taboo in the general public,\u201d he said.\n\nPriest, who grew up in Newcastle and started competing in bodybuilding at 13, believes the biggest cause of today\u2019s violence is a lack of discipline in schools and at home.\n\n\u201cI think it comes down to how kids are raised these days,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBack when I was growing up, I used to get the cane. These days teachers can\u2019t do that, and parents can\u2019t really control their kids, or the kids will tell them where to go.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when I moved back from America and saw kids fighting with police who are trying to do a great job. If that happened in America they\u2019d be shot straight away.\u201d\n\nBen Fordham will interview Lee Priest on Monday at 4pm on 2GB.\n\nSTEROIDS DIRECTLY LINKED TO VIOLENCE - JANE HANSEN\n\nTHE link between anabolic steroid use and aggression was made two decades ago when several defendants in murder trails used the \u201cdumbbell \u00addefence\u201d claiming diminished responsibility due to roid rage.\n\nThe last comprehensive study in Australia into the link was conducted by The Bureau of Crime Statistics and \u00adResearch in 1997.\n\nAfter reviewing available evidence researchers found \u201cthat chronic high doses of anabolic steroids are more likely to increase the risk of aggressive and/or violent behaviour than to leave it unaffected.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the American Journal of Public Health published a study that looked at 20,000 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and anabolic-androgenic steroid use and involvement in violent acts.\n\nLead researcher Dr Kevin Beaver concluded that \u201cresults suggest that the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids is \u00adrelated to heightened levels of violent behaviours\u201d.\n\n\"Chronic high doses of anabolic steroids are more likely to increase the risk of aggressive and/or violent behaviour than to leave it unaffected.\u201d\n\nAnabolic steroids are artificially manufactured forms of testosterone given at up to 100 times the natural levels.\n\nAnd while the dramatic physical changes are well documented, the behavioural and emotional effects of steroid use are under-researched.\n\nIn 2007, a Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine review posed the question if steroid users were psychologically dysfunctional to begin with.\n\nOther researchers found weightlifters and body builders who used steroids showed higher scores for pathological narcissism and lower scores for empathy. Dr Mathew Dunn from the Public Health Department of Deakin University is conducting interviews with steroid users to ascertain the link, if any.\n\n\u201cWhen we interview people who use steroids, some say they are more aggressive and violent with a lower trigger point they are more testy, but that is not everyone,\u201d Dr Dunn said.\n\nCo-researcher Professor Peter Miller said users were often stronger and therefore could do more damage.\n\n\u201cEven if someone on steroids isn\u2019t raging, when they punch someone they do so much more damage,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "THE country&#8217;s leading bodybuilder has admitted to 20 years of steroid abuse, saying &#8220;roid rage&#8221; is a myth and the real problem is alcohol.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "THE country&#8217;s leading bodybuilder has admitted to 20 years of steroid abuse, saying &#8220;roid rage&#8221; is a myth and the real problem is alcohol.", "title": "Australia\u2019s leading body builder says \u201croid rage\u201d is a myth and the real problem is alcohol", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/australias-leading-body-builder-says-roid-rage-is-a-myth-and-the-real-problem-is-alcohol/story-fni0cx12-1226828027848", "image": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/02/15/1226828/027765-0e7b57dc-94fa-11e3-8d43-e004d36a6c9a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/02/15/1226828/027765-0e7b57dc-94fa-11e3-8d43-e004d36a6c9a.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226828027848, "keywords": "roid rage, steroid overdose, getting tough, emergency room, young kids, alcohol-fuelled violence, illegal supply, real problem, leading bodybuilder, steroid abuse, builder Lee, steroid users, steroid possession, anabolic steroids, roid rage thing, ongoing problems, professional athletes, body builder, sending users, idiots doing shit, natural bodybuilder, rugby league players, ing ridiculous, ,Newcastle,New South Wales,Australia, ,,,Australia, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dayne Hudson", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Feb 15 23:19:37 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Feb 15 23:19:37 EST 2014", "author": "BEN FORDHAM"}}, "article_summary": "Australia\u2019s leading body builder says \u201croid rage\u201d is a myth and the real problem is alcoholTHE country\u2019s leading bodybuilder has admitted to 20 years of steroid abuse, saying \u201croid rage\u201d is a myth and the real problem is alcohol.\n\u201cI\u2019ve witnessed guys on strict diets get mad when they can\u2019t eat food, but this whole roid rage thing is a myth,\u201d he said.\nRoid rage is a myth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any roid rage from them.\nI don\u2019t see any roid rage from them."}
