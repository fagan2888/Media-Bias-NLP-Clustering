After a convoluted discussion of future costs and speculation about whether Congress might reverse course years from now, the editorial saved for its last paragraph, perhaps as an afterthought, this grudging admission about the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d the editorial read, \u201cpeople who lacked insurance now have coverage, enabling them to get the care they need. That\u2019s an important social good, and should not be discounted.\u201d\n\nTalk about an understatement.\n\nThe core tenet of health care reform is helping families and saving lives. Not vague political theory, but helping people. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Kentucky. It\u2019s a Christian thing.\n\nKentuckians\u2019 collective health has long been among the worst in the nation, ranking at the bottom in almost every health category. That\u2019s had a negative impact on our quality of life, workforce, economy and state government finances.\n\nPoor access to care is partly to blame. Back in 2013, we had about 640,000 people without health insurance.\n\nBut health care reform has given us a transformative opportunity to attack this weakness. Ever since Kentucky put politics aside and both expanded Medicaid and created our private insurance exchange \u2014 called \u201ckynect\u201d \u2014 we have reduced our uninsured rate by almost 56 percent, from 20.4 percent to 9 percent, according to a Gallup Poll.\n\nStates that took both those steps on average reduced their uninsured by 44 percent. In states that resisted reform, the reduction was only 28 percent. And then there\u2019s Virginia, whose uninsured rate fell just 6 percent, from 13.3 percent to 12.5 percent.\n\nThe long-term impact for Kentucky will be a healthier and more financially secure population.\n\nNew data show that Kentuckians on Medicaid are far more likely to get cancer screenings, physicals and dental checkups. Since expansion, breast cancer screenings are up 111 percent, cervical cancer screenings are up 88 percent and colorectal screenings are up 108 percent. Likewise, preventive dental services were up 116 percent, physical exams up 187 percent and more recipients got cholesterol screenings, flu shots and diabetes screenings.\n\nKentucky residents no longer have to choose between medicine and food, skip checkups or ignore troubling signs, such as a lump or pain, praying that those don\u2019t develop into a chronic disease or fatal illness.\n\nAs far as expansion being the \u201csmart\u201d thing to do, an independent analysis of Kentucky\u2019s first year under Medicaid expansion shows clearly what a good deal this is financially, both now and for our economy, long term.\n\nThe analysis \u2014 by Deloitte Consulting and the University of Louisville Urban Studies Institute \u2014 studied actual performance data. It backed up a similar study I commissioned in 2013 before I made the decision to expand Medicaid \u2014 and, if anything, it demonstrated that our 2013 projections weren\u2019t rosy enough. In short:\n\nMore than 12,000 health care-related jobs were created in the first year alone. Not coincidentally, Kentucky\u2019s overall unemployment rate has fallen 37 percent since January 2013. In the same time period, Virginia\u2019s rate declined only 16 percent.\n\nThe updated study predicted a $30 billion positive impact on Kentucky\u2019s economy over eight years because of that expansion.\n\nSpeaking directly to \u201caffordability,\u201d the report predicted a positive net impact of $819.6 million over eight years on state and local governments \u2014 even after the state match for Medicaid costs is phased in. Yes, the \u201cmonstrous hole\u201d mentioned in the editorial has already been taken into account.\n\nAnd finally, health care providers in Kentucky received at least $1.16 billion in new Medicaid revenues in 2014.\n\nAnd those numbers don\u2019t even address the societal impact of improved health on quality of life or economic capacity, or tangible things, such as worker productivity, school attendance and public image.\n\nSo, to those who claim states can\u2019t afford expanded Medicaid, I say this: You\u2019re entitled to your own opinion, but you\u2019re not entitled to your own facts. The facts in Kentucky demonstrate that not only can states afford to expand Medicaid, but they also really can\u2019t afford not to do it.\n\nEspecially if they care about their people.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Richmond Times-Dispatch", "description": "Critics of Medicaid expansion in Virginia who reference Kentucky\u2019s experience with federal health care reform should beware: Our success undercuts your whole opposition.", "title": "Medicaid Expansion: Kentucky governor explains his state's success", "url": "http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/article_23612d66-b0f8-5956-92fe-7b895c630e58.html", "image": {"width": 544, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/74/0748a06b-4190-5730-820e-d2f418cd9421/55d24e5ff0b20.image.jpg?resize=544%2C760", "height": 760}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@richmonddotcom", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Critics of Medicaid expansion in Virginia who reference Kentucky\u2019s experience with federal health care reform should beware: Our success undercuts your whole opposition.", "msvalidate.01": "669B03D2B6841AE0EB5AEA39929FB0A8", "p": {"domain_verify": "76099571785251a341c8e146d86d708e"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004381960031, "app_id": 359392482564}, "keywords": "#printsection_td_a09,guest-columnists,view-oped-sig", "google-site-verification": "wXaa1PI0ELEf5pOWVfpls8JG_g2yaFH-vaqES-qmfuk", "news_keywords": "#printsection_td_a09,guest-columnists,view-oped-sig"}, "article_summary": "Critics of Medicaid expansion in Virginia who reference Kentucky\u2019s experience with federal health care reform should beware: Our success undercuts your whole opposition.\nThe core tenet of health care reform is helping families and saving lives.\nBut health care reform has given us a transformative opportunity to attack this weakness.\nAnd finally, health care providers in Kentucky received at least $1.16 billion in new Medicaid revenues in 2014.\nHaving proved from the beginning that health care reform is both the right thing and the smart thing do, Kentucky has become the poster child for why states should expand Medicaid."}
