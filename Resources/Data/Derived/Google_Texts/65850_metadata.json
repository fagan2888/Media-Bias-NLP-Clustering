And [I] thought today, I don\u2019t to see signs in my country that say No Jews, No Dogs, No Gays \u2014 whatever. And you\u2019d have the right to have a sign if your religion taught you that. And there are religions that would say No Jews, No Dogs and No Gays. So I don\u2019t like that. But I thought, you know what? We\u2019re not the same America that we were in the 1950s. We won\u2019t frequent those places. And so there\u2019s half of it. The other half is, I don\u2019t want to be forced to do something that goes against my religion. So why is this law so wrong, so hateful?\n\nLater on, speaking about a hypothetical business owner who decides they won\u2019t let LGBT people shop in their store, Beck said, \u201cIs it their right to do that? Yeah! Fine.\u201d\n\nBeck next compared anti-gay discrimination (or really any form of discrimination) to a nightclub bouncer or owner deciding who will be admitted and who won\u2019t. \u201cWhat are they doing? They\u2019re discriminating against people like me \u2014 old, dumpy people.\u201d\n\nBeck wasn\u2019t done there, though. He went on to argue that dermatologists should be allowed to refuse to examine people based on their sexuality, religion, ethnicity or race \u2014 but that emergency room doctors should not be granted the same privilege. \u201cEmergency, life-saving care? No, you\u2019ve got to take the person and stop the bleeding.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right-wing media mogul says freedom can require letting some people oppress others VIDEO", "title": "Glenn Beck supports anti-gay Arizona law because \u201cfreedom is ugly\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The right-wing media mogul says freedom can require letting some people oppress others VIDEO", "title": "Glenn Beck supports anti-gay Arizona law because \u201cfreedom is ugly\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/26/glenn_beck_supports_anti_gay_arizona_law_because_freedom_is_ugly/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/glenn_beck2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The right-wing media mogul says freedom can require letting some people oppress others VIDEO", "title": "Glenn Beck supports anti-gay Arizona law because \u201cfreedom is ugly\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/glenn_beck2.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barry Goldwater, civil rights act, Glenn Beck, Right Wing Watch, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebd7\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Barry Goldwater, civil rights act, Glenn Beck, Right Wing Watch, Video, Media News, News, Politics NewsWhen it comes to figuring out how he feels about Arizona\u2019s anti-gay Jim Crow bill, Glenn Beck is really struggling.\nAnd [I] thought today, I don\u2019t to see signs in my country that say No Jews, No Dogs, No Gays \u2014 whatever.\nFine.\u201dBeck next compared anti-gay discrimination (or really any form of discrimination) to a nightclub bouncer or owner deciding who will be admitted and who won\u2019t.\nThe other half is, I don\u2019t want to be forced to do something that goes against my religion.\nAnd you\u2019d have the right to have a sign if your religion taught you that."}
