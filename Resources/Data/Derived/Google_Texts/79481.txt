What to look for on Smart Talk Monday, November 30, 2015:

Under the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, employers with 50 or more full-time employees are required to submit healthcare reporting in January, 2016. Despite the fast approaching deadline, many local employers still have little idea about what they need to turn in to the IRS and how to collect this information.

Many employers who have put off the reporting until now will likely struggle to fill it out correctly. If they report incorrect information, they could end up impacting an employee's eligibility for a subsidy.

We'll learn more about the requirement and what must employers do on Monday's Smart Talk. Our guest is Rob Glus, a consulting actuary and chair of Conrad Siegel Actuaries health and welfare committee.

Also, mention malaria in America, and many people think back to U.S. soldiers in Vietnam or in the South Pacific during World War II. Malaria was eradicated in this country in the 1950s, but in Sub-Sahara Africa, 594 thousand people die from malaria every year. A group of local clergy and churches have joined in a campaign called Imagine No Malaria.

We'll discuss their efforts on Monday's Smart Talk
