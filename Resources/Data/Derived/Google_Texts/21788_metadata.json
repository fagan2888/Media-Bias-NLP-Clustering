Herbert noted that a significant part of the state\u2019s exemplary unemployment rate comes from international trade with the European Union, noting that 87% of foreign direct-investment in the state comes from the EU.\n\nPart of the trade mission was to place Utah on the radar of \u201csite planners\u201d who might consider a US location for international operations. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown our efforts at international business better than any state in America,\u201d Herbert said. \u201c[Utah\u2019s economic success] is mutually beneficial to those countries that we visited\u2026 95 percent of the customers for our businesses here in Utah lie outside the borders of America. International business pays great dividends to the state.\u201d\n\nHerbert was also asked about his thoughts on the controversial prison relocation that has been the work of a re-location task force over the past year.\n\nDeferring to the task force that has convened for the purpose of fact-finding, public comment, and site investigation, the Governor stated that the primary reason for moving the prison should not be driven by the economic benefit of the development of the site. The Governor considers the economic development potential of the relocation as \u201cgravy\u201d on top of the basic reason for moving the prison.\n\nHas the task force looked at the potential of developing the existing site thoroughly enough? \u201cIf they haven\u2019t, they should,\u201d Herbert said, while acknowledging the logistical challenges for doing so at its existing location in Draper.\n\nOn the topic of using $100,000 of state mineral lease revenues to pay for the defense and appeal of San Juan County Commissioner Phil Lyman\u2019s conviction of misdemeanor trespass in Recapture Canyon, Herbert stated that he understood the frustrations surrounding the RS2477 roads closure decisions covering eight years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long time,\u201d Herbert told reporters. \u201cI think that there needs to be a \u2018state connection\u2019 and a \u2018state purpose,\u2019 if we\u2019re using state monies,\u201d and implied that these factors already existed. He felt that the commission should simply base their decision(s) on the law. When reminded that Lyman\u2019s situation has already been through the judicial process, the governor said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a state purpose then the state has a right to weigh-in on it.\u201d\n\nThe link to the entire press conference can be found here.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9470\"", "article_summary": "Has the task force looked at the potential of developing the existing site thoroughly enough?\n\u201c[Utah\u2019s economic success] is mutually beneficial to those countries that we visited\u2026 95 percent of the customers for our businesses here in Utah lie outside the borders of America.\nThe Governor considers the economic development potential of the relocation as \u201cgravy\u201d on top of the basic reason for moving the prison.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown our efforts at international business better than any state in America,\u201d Herbert said.\n\u201cIf they haven\u2019t, they should,\u201d Herbert said, while acknowledging the logistical challenges for doing so at its existing location in Draper."}
