It originated during the colonial era, when the British served the chilled beverage with a blend of spirits, water, and fermented sap from the toddy palm plant. When it made its way across the ocean to America, plantation owners in the South thought to heat it up and stir in their own rum, spices, and local sugar cane.\n\nFor decades, the drink was used as a natural remedy for cold-like aches and pains; it helped sneezers and coughers struggling to fall sleep. It seems counterintuitive, but the bourbon or whiskey used to make a traditional hot toddy dilates the blood vessels and makes it easier for mucus membranes to fight infection \u2014 basically, it's a decongestant. Squeeze in some honey, lemon, and a steeping bag of herbal tea, and the drink is fully equipped to soothe a cold.\n\nIf you\u2019re suffering from a stubborn sore throat, cold, or cough, and your medicine cabinet has failed you thus far, it might be worth it to head to your liquor cabinet instead.
