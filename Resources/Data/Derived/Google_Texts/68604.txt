The Jersey City public schools district is celebrating its arts programs by displaying some of its Permanent Student Art Collection at City Hall for the month of March.

The exhibit is part of the district’s celebration of Youth Art Month, which also includes exhibits at individual schools.

“YAM is a wonderful opportunity to showcase the excellent visual arts education being provided throughout the city and share with our communities the artistic talents of our students,” Jersey City schools spokeswoman Maryann Dickar said.

Every year, outstanding student work is inducted into the permanent art collection and is maintained and displayed throughout the district.

The Jersey City Public Schools offers art education in all schools. Artistically talented art classes are offered in all primary, middle and elementary schools. At the high school level, general art courses available are sculpture, painting, ceramics, printmaking, art history, and drawing. Jersey City students have won national awards and scholarships for their art work over the years and many of these works are included in the permanent collection.
