European Pressphoto Agency\n\nBose is suing Beats Electronics, the headphone and speaker maker that Apple agreed to acquire for $3 billion earlier this year, for infringing on patents related to its noise-cancelling technology.\n\nBose filed the lawsuit on Friday in U.S. District Court in Delaware, saying that Beats \u2013 known for its colorful and flashy headphones \u2013 had infringed on five of its patents pertaining to its noise-cancelling headphones. Bose also filed a complaint to the U.S. International Trade Commission, seeking to halt the sale and import of certain Beats products.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bose asks for damages and an injunction against Beats.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to protecting our investment, protecting our customers, and defending the patents we own,\u201d a Bose spokeswoman said in a statement. Spokespeople for Beats and Apple declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe complaint doesn\u2019t affect the closing of the Apple deal scheduled for September, according to one person familiar with the matter.\n\nApple agreed to acquire Beats \u2013 the biggest deal in the company\u2019s history \u2013 with an eye toward adding Beats Music, a subscription-based, streaming music service, to its audio offerings. Apple has made no secret that it is mainly interested in the streaming music service, and not the headphone and music accessory business.\n\nHowever, the headphone business accounted for all of Beats\u2019 $1.3 billion in revenue in 2013, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBose said it has been working on noise-cancelling technology since 1978 and started selling noise-cancelling headsets to consumers in 2000.\n\nBose said Beats has infringed on its patents in its \u201cStudio\u201d and \u201cStudio Wireless\u201d line-up of headphones. Those headphones, which sell for $299 and $379, respectively, offer \u201cAdaptive Noise Cancellation,\u201d that Beats says helps consumers \u201cput the world on mute.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Bose is suing Beats Electronics, the headphone and speaker maker that Apple agreed to acquire for $3 billion earlier this year, for infringing on patents related to its noise-cancelling technology.", "title": "Sound Off: Bose Sues Beats Over Noise-Cancelling Patents", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/25/sound-off-bose-sues-beats-over-noise-cancelling-patents/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CS680_beats0_G_20140509132603.jpg"}, "site": "WSJD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Tech", "article.headline": "Sound Off: Bose Sues Beats Over Noise-Cancelling Patents", "description": "Bose is suing Beats Electronics, the headphone and speaker maker that Apple agreed to acquire for $3 billion earlier this year, for infringing on patents related to its noise-cancelling technology.", "article_section": "Tech", "author": "Daisuke Wakabayashi", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Digits Blog", "page.subsection": "Digits", "article.summary": "Bose is suing Beats Electronics, the headphone and speaker maker that Apple agreed to acquire for $3 billion earlier this year, for infringing on patents related to its noise-cancelling technology.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-25T19:31:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/25/sound-off-bose-sues-beats-over-noise-cancelling-patents/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DGB-36721", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Tech", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Bose is suing Beats Electronics, the headphone and speaker maker that Apple agreed to acquire for $3 billion earlier this year, for infringing on patents related to its noise-cancelling technology.", "title": "Sound Off: Bose Sues Beats Over Noise-Cancelling Patents", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/25/sound-off-bose-sues-beats-over-noise-cancelling-patents/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CS680_beats0_G_20140509132603.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Digits", "article.id": "BL-DGB-36721", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-26T06:45:34-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a2e\"", "article_summary": "Bose said Beats has infringed on its patents in its \u201cStudio\u201d and \u201cStudio Wireless\u201d line-up of headphones.\nApple agreed to acquire Beats \u2013 the biggest deal in the company\u2019s history \u2013 with an eye toward adding Beats Music, a subscription-based, streaming music service, to its audio offerings.\nBose said it has been working on noise-cancelling technology since 1978 and started selling noise-cancelling headsets to consumers in 2000.\nBose filed the lawsuit on Friday in U.S. District Court in Delaware, saying that Beats \u2013 known for its colorful and flashy headphones \u2013 had infringed on five of its patents pertaining to its noise-cancelling headphones.\nBose also filed a complaint to the U.S. International Trade Commission, seeking to halt the sale and import of certain Beats products."}
