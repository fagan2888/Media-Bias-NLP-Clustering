CDOT started safety metering on eastbound I-70 before the Eisenhower Tunnel at about 4:30 p.m. but it ended about 90 minutes later.\n\nMorning mountain travelers were met with a sea of brake lights along with their scenic views.\n\nWhile traffic eased as the day went on, officials estimated earlier in the day that total travel time from Denver and C-470 to Eisenhower Tunnel would be just shy of two hours.\n\nEastbound I-70 at Vail Pass shut down for a while at mile marker 184 around 11:30 a.m. due to a safety closure but opened about an hour later. The closure caused heavy delays and nearly two-mile long backups.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or @ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Blowing snow, heavy mountain traffic delay drivers on Saturday", "title": "Blowing snow, heavy mountain traffic delay drivers on Saturday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/blowing-snow-heavy-mountain-traffic-delay-drivers-on-saturday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116_121410_plows-on-i70.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116_121410_plows-on-i70.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T08:26:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:26:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Traffic"}, "article_summary": "A busy day for mountain traffic continued into the evening as blowing snow and adverse weather conditions closed a stretch of U.S. 285 on Saturday afternoon.\nAfter a long morning drive to the mountains along Interstate 70, there were delays for those heading back Saturday evening.\nEastbound I-70 at Vail Pass shut down for a while at mile marker 184 around 11:30 a.m. due to a safety closure but opened about an hour later.\nCDOT started safety metering on eastbound I-70 before the Eisenhower Tunnel at about 4:30 p.m. but it ended about 90 minutes later.\nMorning mountain travelers were met with a sea of brake lights along with their scenic views."}
