He suffered a traumatic brain injury that nearly killed him.\n\nHis survival was so improbable, the Vail native and his family regard it as miraculous. He would leave the sport for six years, believing his Olympic dream to be gone. Now he\u2019s competing again in hopes of making the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, and if he gets there, he wants to share his \u201cmiracle\u201d with the world.\n\nMacCutcheon was 17 years old the day of the accident \u2014 April 6, 2005.\n\n\u201cI remember falling, and it was a pretty amazing experience,\u201d MacCutcheon said. \u201cI\u2019m a strong Christian, and I felt like it was God\u2019s hand pulling me slowly down. It wasn\u2019t scary, it wasn\u2019t a fearful experience, I felt like I was held in somebody\u2019s hand, being brought down.\u201d\n\nThe peace he felt before being knocked unconscious was followed by urgent efforts to save his life. His mother, Pam, was having lunch in the base area when she got the news that something terrible happened to her son.\n\n\u201cA friend of his came running in and said, \u2018We need you out here,\u2019 \u201d Pam said. \u201cI heard some girl say, \u2018I don\u2019t think he made it.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, Lord, help me.\u2019 I\u2019m just crying out to the Lord, like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to give me strength.\u2019 \u201c\n\nSteven had to be resuscitated at the site of the crash and was placed in a medically induced coma in the clinic at Copper. He was resuscitated two more times on the Flight for Life trip to the old St. Anthony\u2019s Hospital in Lakewood. When they cut off his race suit, they found the American flag Steven always carried when he raced to honor his grandfather, an Iwo Jima survivor.\n\n\u201cThe Flight for Life guy folded the flag in the trauma room, gave it to me and said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 \u201d Pam said.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder he thought Steven wasn\u2019t going to make it. MacCutcheon had suffered two brain hemorrhages, which seemed certain to cause swelling of his brain. Doctors were prepared to drill holes into his skull to relieve pressure when Steven suddenly sat up. Later, as he slept while family members surrounded him in prayer, another amazing thing happened.\n\n\u201cWe were saying, \u2018Steven, we have so many years ahead of us,\u2019 \u201d Pam recalled. \u201cA little tear came down (from) his eye. Then he opened his eyes. They asked him if he knew his phone number, his name \u2014 he knew everything.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the brain hemorrhages, Steven had suffered a \u201cshear\u201d injury. One hemisphere of his brain moved more than the other, disturbing connections between the two.\n\n\u201cEven though I was sitting up, talking, apparently it was very limited and it wasn\u2019t like I was making any sense,\u201d said Steven, 28. \u201cThere was still a fear of what the future would hold, but it was definitely God\u2019s intervention to save me.\u201d\n\nHe never had any swelling of the brain but faced a long, hard recovery. He required home care with a speech therapist. It was hard for him to speak, to come up with the right words even though he knew what he wanted to say.\n\n\u201cThe highlight reel was definitely in the hospital, waking up, but then everything kind of hit true rock bottom in my life,\u201d Steven said.\n\nHe had shattered his right shoulder and torn the rotator cuff. That had to be surgically repaired, so he couldn\u2019t snowboard the following winter.\n\n\u201cI was really depressed,\u201d Steven said. \u201cIt was April when the accident happened. I made it through the summer, but as winter was approaching, I was very, very upset because I was not preparing for snowboarding. I was on a lot of medications, too. They were afraid of seizures and a lot of things that happen after a traumatic brain injury. I was pretty medicated. That was challenging in itself, because it led me into a dark road.\u201d\n\nHe moved with his family to South Carolina, where his grandparents lived, thinking it would be better to be far from snow, but that made things worse.\n\n\u201cI was away from snow, which was good, but I didn\u2019t have any passions to fulfill these Olympic-sized dreams I had,\u201d he said. \u201cI was known in the Vail Valley as an aspiring Olympian. Next thing I know, I\u2019m sitting in a chair playing video games, thinking about the old days when I could do that.\u201d\n\nHe found an outlet in music, discovering a talent for keyboards he never knew he had. Soon he was playing with the worship band at a church in Myrtle Beach.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018OK, this is what I\u2019m doing. God has replaced my ambition for snowboarding, he\u2019s put this ambition of music in my heart now, so I\u2019m going down this road.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHe moved back to Vail. When Christian musician John David Webster came to town for a concert, Steven got to play for him. Webster was impressed, offering to record Steven and his brother at his home studio in Indiana. Soon Steven was living in Indiana, playing with Webster\u2019s band.\n\nThen Webster took a job as the music leader at Calvary Chapel in Edwards and Steven moved back to Vail for the second time. Steven still thought he was through as a competitive snowboarder, but that changed one day when he and Webster went snowboarding for fun. Webster was blown away by the way Steven ripped that mountain.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018You\u2019re a good keyboard player, but snowboarding is your gift. Nobody else can snowboard like you,\u2019 \u201d Steven said.\n\nThat was 2011, six years after the accident. Steven got a brain scan, which showed his brain was completely normal, so he got the go-ahead to compete again.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s not true confirmation of the miracle and the direction of the story for (God\u2019s) glory, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d Steven said. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy who fell on his head.\u201d\n\nHe had to work his way up, but in 2013 he earned his first-ever World Cup start, fulfilling a childhood dream. He didn\u2019t qualify for the 2014 Sochi Olympics, but last season he had four podium finishes in NorAm Cup races. He got married in August, and in December he claimed his first NorAm victory in a race at Buck Hill, Minn.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning it\u2019s not about making it somewhere, it\u2019s about the story I can communicate to others to bring hope and joy into their lives,\u201d Steven said. \u201cTo see people who are down and realize, \u2018I was there once, too,\u2019 I can relate , I can communicate in a much grander way.\u201d\n\nHe would love to make the Olympics to represent his country and \u201cfight for a medal\u201d to honor his grandfather\u2019s service. But there\u2019s more.\n\n\u201cI have these dreams of being there, having my family there, having the people who were there the day of my accident, watching the impossible become possible, the thing that could never happen happen. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going for, to become that inspiration. Whatever comes in life, with the power of prayer, the power of God \u2014 I give him all the glory because he\u2019s the one that can empower these steps to finish the journey set out for you.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Snowboarder Steven MacCutcheon\u2019s recovery putting him on track as Olympic hopeful", "title": "Snowboarder Steven MacCutcheon\u2019s recovery putting him on track as Olympic hopeful", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/snowboarder-steven-maccutcheons-recovery-putting-him-on-track-as-olympic-hopeful/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__spxxMACCUTCHEON_HR_2522p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__spxxMACCUTCHEON_HR_2522p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T13:04:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:24:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe highlight reel was definitely in the hospital, waking up, but then everything kind of hit true rock bottom in my life,\u201d Steven said.\nIt\u2019s no wonder he thought Steven wasn\u2019t going to make it.\nSteven got a brain scan, which showed his brain was completely normal, so he got the go-ahead to compete again.\nSteven still thought he was through as a competitive snowboarder, but that changed one day when he and Webster went snowboarding for fun.\nThey asked him if he knew his phone number, his name \u2014 he knew everything.\u201dIn addition to the brain hemorrhages, Steven had suffered a \u201cshear\u201d injury."}
