In addition, there have been emerging job opportunities where young professions can find jobs in small private finance firms, non-profits and have the ability to work remotely with today\u2019s global technology.\n\n\u201cEven though September showed an increase in number of sales over September of the previous year, the price per square foot declined,\u201d said Dan L. Fitchett, Jr., managing broker, LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, Vail Valley. \u201cThis is attributed to more sales out of the resort\u2019s core area, where the over-a-million dollar homes were larger in square foot size. We expect this trend to change with more purchases closer to the ski areas where the prices per square foot are much higher as we get closer to the ski season.\u201d\n\nIn Eagle County, 44 homes with a price tag of more than $1 million sold in September, 2015, up 29 percent over 34 homes in September, 2014, according to LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s year over year comparison, based on information from Vail Board of Realtors/MLS. Average price per square foot decreased slightly, 26 percent from $823 in September 2014 to $610 in September 2015.\n\nIn Summit County, 25 homes with a price tag of more than $1 million sold in September 2015, compared to18 in September 2014, a 39 percent increase, according to Summit County\u2019s SAR MLS. Average price per square foot in Summit County rose 28 percent from $400 in September 2014, to $510 in September 2015.\n\n\u201cWith four world class ski resorts, hiking, biking and close proximity to Denver, lifestyle continues to be the driving factor for our Luxury Buyers in Summit County,\u201d said LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty managing broker, Melanie Frank, Breckenridge. \u201cThey aspire to enjoy the mountain beauty and to create a family destination that can be enjoyed by all generations.\u201d\n\nThe proximity to the famous Colorado Rocky Mountains that living in Eagle and Summit County affords, continues to position Colorado as one of the leading resort community destinations worldwide. With the increasing desire for lifestyle-inspired home purchases, the resort market will continue to rise.\n\nLIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty compiles a quarterly luxury market report to help consumers make better real estate decisions, whether purchasing or selling a home.\n\nTo access current market reports, visit ColoradoMarketReports.com.
