They wore the bright purple attire, emblazoned with Rice\u2019s name and the number 27, despite the fact \u2014 or, perhaps, because of the fact \u2014 that the player was released from his contract with the team and suspended indefinitely from the NFL earlier in the week, after footage of him knocking his partner unconscious in an elevator was released by TMZ.\n\nEach fan had their reasons for wearing the jersey. Fox Sports 1\u2019s Mike Garofolo set out to determine some. Here are a few selected responses:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making a statement. I don\u2019t believe in domestic violence. But I will say: Any woman who can hit a man, a man shouldn\u2019t have to sit there and take the abuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not supporting what he did. There\u2019s players who did worse than he did, and they\u2019re still playing. I feel like what he got kicked out for wasn\u2019t right.\u201d \u201cThe reality is: He made a mistake. He admitted it. He owned up to it \u2014 both him and his wife \u2014 and they were punished for it. He\u2019s done everything they\u2019ve asked him to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I don't believe in domestic violence,\" one fan explained to Fox Sports 1's Mike Garofolo", "title": "Why Ray Rice fans wore their jerseys to the Ravens game, according to Ray Rice fans", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"I don't believe in domestic violence,\" one fan explained to Fox Sports 1's Mike Garofolo", "title": "Why Ray Rice fans wore their jerseys to the Ravens game, according to Ray Rice fans", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/12/why_ray_rice_fans_wore_his_jersey_to_the_ravens_game_according_to_ray_rice_fans/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/ravens-rice-video-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I don't believe in domestic violence,\" one fan explained to Fox Sports 1's Mike Garofolo", "title": "Why Ray Rice fans wore their jerseys to the Ravens game, according to Ray Rice fans", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/ravens-rice-video-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Baltimore Ravens, Domestic abuse, domestic violence, Football, fox sports 1, janay rice, NFL, ray rice", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Baltimore Ravens, Domestic abuse, domestic violence, Football, fox sports 1, janay rice, NFL, ray rice, Media News, Life News, NewsA number of Baltimore Ravens fans appeared at Thursday night\u2019s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers wearing Ray Rice jerseys.\nI don\u2019t believe in domestic violence.\nBut I will say: Any woman who can hit a man, a man shouldn\u2019t have to sit there and take the abuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not supporting what he did.\nHe owned up to it \u2014 both him and his wife \u2014 and they were punished for it.\nI feel like what he got kicked out for wasn\u2019t right.\u201d \u201cThe reality is: He made a mistake."}
