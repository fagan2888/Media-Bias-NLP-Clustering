He may not have President Barack Obama’s endorsement, but Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-NY) does have a brand new biographical campaign rap song.

The track below popped up on Rangel’s official YouTube channel this weekend, complete with informational lines like “He was born in Harlem, got a Purple Heart and Bronze Star” and “at 16 he worked a lot of low paying jobs.”

One listen and you likely won’t be able to get the chorus (“Charlie Charlie Charlie Rangel”) out of your head. But since the Rangel campaign declined to credit the artists in their YouTube, we cannot tell you who exactly is responsible for this instant classic.

In a recent NY1/Siena College poll the 84-year-old Rangel, who is running for a 23rd term, leads Democratic challenger State Senator Adriano Espaillat by 13 points, 47-34%. While Espaillat, who would be the first Dominican-American elected to Congress, has a 24-point lead among Latinos, Rangel has a much stronger 70-point lead with African-Americans.
