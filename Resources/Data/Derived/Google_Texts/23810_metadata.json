Saxby Chambliss\u2019 Senate seat in Georgia. Nunn is one of five women that Democrats are pinning their hopes on to win the South\u2014not exactly a Democratic stronghold since the Civil Rights era. She has name recognition\u2014her father Sam Nunn is a much beloved former Senator\u2014and bipartisan bonafides thanks to her work as CEO of the Point of Light Foundation, a charity near and dear to another political patriarch, George H. W. Bush.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I spent a day following Nunn across Georgia. At an Austin\u2019s Steakhouse in Valdosta, Ga., Nunn sat down with me to talk moderation in a time of hyper-partisanship, the challenges of running as a mother of young children and whether she\u2019d rather have Barack or Michelle Obama stump for her.\n\n\n\nHere are excerpts from the interview:\n\nQ. What do you make of the debt ceiling shenanigans of the past two years?\n\nWe cannot fool around with defaulting. It\u2019s part of what\u2019s created the uncertainty that we know, at least economically, the threats of shutting down, the threats of default. Business needs certainty in order to invest and it\u2019s important that our leaders act responsibly around this issue.\n\nQ. What did you make of the House Republican\u2019s last attempt to tie debt ceiling to restoring the sequester cuts to veteran pensions?\n\nWhat I would say is we need to, as much possible, ask our leaders to act without brinksmanship or gamesmanship around these issues. Everybody knows that we can\u2019t afford to default and we should focus on that issue. We also should restore the pensions. But I think that we need more maturity in our leadership and more focus on the national interests versus the political interests.\n\nQ. So you\u2019re against the sequester?\n\nAs people have said repeatedly, sequestration is the absolute wrong way of making the cuts. Nobody in business would cut across the board, they would cut strategically. And we are going to have to make difficult cuts but we are not going to do it effectively when we do it through sequestration which everybody adopted only because it was such a preposterous thing that they would never allow it to happen.\n\nQ. But you do talk about the problems of long-term debt, that is one of your central campaign themes. How would you go about cutting debt? Do you support Simpson Bowles? Is there a plan out there that you see that you like?\n\nI think Simpson Bowles was a good step in the right direction. None of this can be done unilaterally. It has to be done in concert. It has to be done in a bipartisan way. It has to be done with trusting leaders who are also willing to speak with courage and conviction about the necessity of making hard choices and of living within the constraints of our resources and done in a holistic way because it\u2019s going to take a holistic approach.\n\nQ. But debt is not that much of an issue any more in Washington, maybe it still is on the campaign trail. But Democrats are actually talking about more stimulus spending, infrastructure investments, because the economy can\u2019t afford more austerity at this point.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about short-term deficit reduction, I\u2019m talking about long-term debt. And I think those are distinguishable things. And so when we\u2019re talking about pro-growth policies in order to invest to ensure that our economy is growing that\u2019s a part of the equation in dealing with long-term debt. So I think that we often in the political discourse conflate those things in a way that lead us to make short-sighted decisions like sequestration.\n\nQ. Where do you stand on the Keystone pipeline?\n\nI have studied it and I do believe it\u2019s something we should move forward with based upon the practical economic imperatives, energy independence and also that many of the environmental concerns have been addressed.\n\nQ. Who would you rather have stump for you, Barack or Michelle Obama?\n\nI would say that I am focused not so much on getting others to stump for me as I am on getting Georgians to stump for me right now, and talking to the voters of Georgia myself directly. And then getting people that are from Georgia demonstrate their willingness to come out. I\u2019ve worked with President Obama, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with President Bush and Barbara Bush, and it would be a hard choice to say which of the Presidents and First Ladies that I have worked with that I would have most like stump for me.\n\nQ. So it\u2019s more Bush v. Obama?\n\nWell, I\u2019ve just had the privilege of working with Presidents across the aisle. That have embraced service and volunteerism and found common ground. It\u2019s something that I believe that our presidents have done on certain issues, especially around volunteer service that is admirable and that we need more of.\n\nQ. Some of your fellow southern candidates have run away from Obama. They didn\u2019t want to be seen with him. Do you have a fear of being seen with unpopular President?\n\nI ultimately think that people make choices based on individual candidates. As I said I\u2019ve had the real privilege and opportunity to work in different ways with the Presidents over the last several decades and I have an enormous amount of respect for all of our Presidents for the public service that they do and the leadership that they provide our country.\n\nQ. How do you balance appealing to younger progressive voters and older more conservative voters? Because those are two very different constituencies that you\u2019re going for?\n\nYou know I think that\u2019s true but at the same time, there\u2019s a lot of common ground. Like, when I go around the table whether it\u2019s young people or older people they still say jobs is their number one priority. They still believe that education, no matter what generation they\u2019re from, is key to our future. There is a lot that binds generations cross Georgia and share a commitment to our future. I certainly think that we are going to be trying to appeal and engage folks through out the state and across the generations including really mobilizing and tapping into idealism and inspiration of young people and the experience and wisdom of seniors.\n\nQ. Georgia\u2019s demographics are clearly changing but are they going to be enough for your candidacy?\n\nGeorgia\u2019s demographics are changing and we have to both mobilize the base and attract some independent and Republican voters. And I think we can do both and I\u2019m having a good indication already that we can and will attract folks on both sides of the aisle for my candidacy.\n\nQ. How helpful has your dad\u2019s name recognition been to this race and could you have run without it?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to separate who I am from my parents in the same time that it is for all of us. I\u2019m very grateful for his support. It\u2019s an enormous lift to have his advice. He\u2019s been great councilor for all of my life, certainly my professional life as well as my growing up. I\u2019ll continue to look to his guidance and can\u2019t think of a better person to give counsel based on the enormous respect that he has from so many across the state. It is absolutely a wonderful thing to have his partnership and to have him as my father.\n\nQ. Do you ever get sexist question or feel any sexism as a female candidate?\n\nYou know, I have not really. I believe that actually a lot of people are excited about having a woman candidate. I talk to a lot of women and men who look to the Senate and see for instance that it was the women that helped resolve the federal shut down that they believe that it\u2019s a good thing to have a diverse set of leaders in our congressional body.\n\nQ. They say women are often more difficult to convince to run. Was it difficult to convince you to run?\n\nYou know, I\u2019m not sure that I could discriminate based on gender. But will say that I spent a good bit of time thinking about it. It\u2019s a very big decision for someone with a 9 and an 11 year old and a career that I loved. I definitely wanted to make sure that I believed that I could make a difference, that I could make a contribution, that we could win in Georgia and that it was the right time for me personally.\n\nQ. Did you speak to other women politicians in Washington like Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who have young children?\n\nI did, yeah.\n\nQ. And what was their advice?\n\nThe main thing that they convinced me of was that it\u2019s possible to be both a great mom and also a great public servant. And they sort of gave me all sorts of tips on how to do that, which we all have to fund our own path but they convinced me that there was a way of doing it and I think they reinforced what I believed, which is that it\u2019s really helpful to have mothers who are keenly aware of a certain set of issues that are shared by mothers across the United States and that having their representation, having their voices, is an important part of our leadership.\n\nQ. You are one of five Democratic women running in the South. This seems to be almost a strategy. Do you think that Democratic women have a better shot in the South than male Democrats?\n\nThere\u2019s a great opportunity for women in the south and that\u2019s part of the equation. But I certainly think that people vote on who they think the best candidate will be to representing their state, their interests. And I hope that\u2019ll be me.\n\nQ. How much do you benefit from a chaotic GOP field?\n\nI do believe that as I look to the Republican primary it does seem to be a race to the extremes and to embracing the political dysfunction in Washington. I certainly think that the contrast is clear and that continue to be evident and potentially even to grow and the differentiation around the ideas that are there. Ultimately, I believe that Georgians are looking for more pragmatism, more collaboration, more problem solving and less extremism.\n\nQ. One point one of your \u201c5 Ways to Fix Washington\u201d bars members from becoming lobbyists. You realize, that most former members who lobby aren\u2019t technically lobbyist, right?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that I don\u2019t want people in Congress to not continue to influence things for the public good. I think what I\u2019m pointing out is that we should not have congressmen and women use the privilege and platform of the relationships and the understanding that they have through their service and apply it parochial or special interests.\n\nQ. Another point of your \u201c5 Ways to Fix Washington\u201d is if Congress doesn\u2019t pass a budget they don\u2019t get paid, you realize Dems didn\u2019t pass a budget for four of the last five years in order to protect Obamacare, right?\n\nThere\u2019s blame on both asides of the equation for the failure of getting things done in Washington.\n\nQ. So are you equally happy to run against Democratic dysfunction as you are Republican dysfunction?\n\nI\u2019m running against dysfunction in Washington and I\u2019m running against the polarization and I\u2019m running for a spirit of focus on common ground and problem solving, which I think would be helped by sending more people to Washington with those commitments also with a lens that\u2019s outside of Washington and brings a new perspective.\n\nQ. How hard is it to run on Obamacare?\n\nI am running as someone who ran an organization and understands the responsibilities and the difficulties of providing health care for employees. I also believe that we need to fix what\u2019s broken and there are clearly some things that have no worked well in the Affordable Care Act rollout and I think there\u2019s a variety of things that we could and should do differently. I\u2019ve been talking about some ideas that include adding a tier of coverage for more affordability for families, ensuring that we extend the tax credit for small businesses. One of the things that\u2019s happened here in Georgia\u2014because we did not accept Medicaid expansion\u2014that nobody anticipated would be part of the equation is that a number of our rural hospitals are now having cuts that are really problematic. So I am running as someone who wants to fix the things that are broken in the health care system and build upon the things that are good, including ensuring that people who have preexisting conditions have access to health care, that kids up to age 26 have the opportunity to be covered by their parents. So as I\u2019m talking to people about it, I\u2019m talking about let\u2019s take it out of the political lens and let\u2019s just focus on what we would do together to fix health care and make it better and more available, more effective and more cost efficient.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "One of the women Democrats are hoping will lift them to victory in the South talks about whether she'd rather Bush or Obama stump for her, the Keystone XL Pipeline, and how she plans on being the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Georgia in 14 years", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "One of the women Democrats are hoping will lift them to victory in the South talks about whether she'd rather Bush or Obama stump for her, the Keystone XL Pipeline, and how she plans on being the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Georgia in 14 years", "title": "TIME Interview: Georgia Senate Candidate Michelle Nunn", "url": "http://time.com/14141/michelle-nun-georgia-senate-race-interview/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ap509726897868.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ap509726897868.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "TIME Interview: Georgia Senate Candidate Michelle Nunn", "description": "One of the women Democrats are hoping will lift them to victory in the South talks about whether she'd rather Bush or Obama stump for her, the Keystone XL Pipeline, and how she plans on being the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Georgia in 14 years", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2014 election, congress, michelle nunn, midterm elections", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "2014 election, congress, michelle nunn, midterm elections"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb7f\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m not talking about short-term deficit reduction, I\u2019m talking about long-term debt.\nIn this week\u2019s print edition of TIME, I have a story about Michelle Nunn, who is running to take retiring Sen.
