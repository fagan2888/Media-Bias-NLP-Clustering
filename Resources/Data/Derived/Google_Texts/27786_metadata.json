Kirsten Gillibrand has made a name for herself as a champion of measures to address sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. She is an outspoken advocate of ending harassment, and yet \u2014 who is surprised by this? \u2014 has faced plenty of harassment herself. From her male colleagues. In the Senate. Where elected officials are supposed to do things like legislate (maybe even legislate to end rape) instead of demeaning their colleagues with sexist comments.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Gillibrand recently sat down with People to discuss her new memoir, \u201cOff The Sidelines,\u201d and recalled more than one instance of being objectified by her male colleagues:\n\nGillibrand recounts one incident when she was once working out in the House gym during renovations of the women\u2019s facility. \u201cGood thing you\u2019re working out, because you wouldn\u2019t want to get porky!\u201d one of her older male colleagues said. Her response: \u201cThanks, a\u2014hole,\u201d she said in an excerpt from her book. An unidentified southern congressman once held the former upstate House member\u2019s arm while walking her down the chamber\u2019s center aisle. \u201cYou know, Kirsten, you\u2019re even pretty when you\u2019re fat,\u201d he told her. \u201cI believed his intentions were sweet, even if he was being an idiot,\u201d Gillibrand recounted. \u2026 She recalled a labor leader once told her: \u201cWhen I first met you in 2006 you were beautiful, a breath of fresh air. To win [the special], you need to be beautiful again.\u201d \u201cI knew I was too heavy for my own health,\u201d Gillibrand recalled. After she dropped 50 pounds and got elected to the Senate, one of her favorite older senators walked up behind her, squeezed her waist, and intoned: \u201cDon\u2019t lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Democrat describes being sexually harassed while trying to do things like stop sexual harassment", "author": "Jenny Kutner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The New York Democrat describes being sexually harassed while trying to do things like stop sexual harassment", "title": "Sen.
