But according to the FDA, those gels contained high enough amounts of two pneumonia-causing bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca) that they were putting patients at risk of infection. In April 2012, patients at a Michigan hospital became infected from the gel during surgery. The FDA said the company failed to solve the problem, despite repeated warnings.\n\nOn Thursday, the agency sought an injunction in New Jersey's U.S. District Court to prevent the company \"and its principal officer, Gilbert Buchalter, from manufacturing, marketing, selling, and distributing medical products until they come into compliance with all applicable FDA requirements.\" On Saturday morning, the company's website was still actively marketing its products.\n\nIn 2012, U.S. Marshals entered Pharmaceutical Innovations' facilities and seized some of its ultrasound gels after FDA tests discovered the presence of the bacteria. The company released a statement at the time, from Buchalter, decrying the seizure but not denying that there had been a problem. It said that as soon as it learned about the contamination, \"all distributors were advised to suspend distribution and return affected lots to the Company.\" Buchalter said the steps it had taken were \"sufficient,\" adding that this was the first sterility issue since Pharmaceutical Innovations was founded in 1961.\n\nStill, the FDA says the company has been selling products without prior regulatory approval. \u201cDespite multiple warnings by the FDA over the past three years, and promises to correct the numerous ongoing violations, the defendants continued to violate the law,\u201d said Melinda K. Plaisier, the FDA\u2019s associate commissioner for regulatory affairs, in the news release. \u201cThis presents serious health risks to patients who used and continue to use the company\u2019s products. By taking this action, the FDA is demonstrating its commitment to protecting the public from the dangers of adulterated and misbranded medical products.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda, looks, shut, down, pharmaceutical, innovations, inc, after, unheeded, warnings, about", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A New Jersey ultrasound gel manufacturer has been selling contaminated products that have led to infections in Michigan, according to the FDA.
