New York Times\u2019 columnist Paul Krugman called the Veterans Affairs Department\u2019s \u201csuccess story one of the best-kept secrets in the American policy debate.\u201d Krugman wrote in 2006, \u201cThe secret of its success is the fact that it's a universal, integrated system.\u201d\n\nRelated: Vets Blow the Whistle on Negligent VA Management\n\nNow, issues of severe mismanagement have emerged with reports alleging that fudged numbers and long wait times have resulted in the deaths of at least 40 vets who did not receive timely treatment in one Phoenix VA hospital. Reports of suicides possibly linked to neglect and similarly long wait times and management issues are cropping up at other VA facilities across the country. Conservatives and opponents of government-managed care are blaming the large agency.\n\nLarry Kudlow of the Kudlow Report was quick to pounce on the VA scandal as testament to what goes wrong when you adopt socialized medicine. \u201cThis VA scandal is a reminder that government-run single-payer health care does not work.\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cThe long waits for treatment, with excessive delays resulting in as many as 40 deaths, are a tragically predictable outcome. This is the result of bureaucratic rationing, price controls, inefficiencies and the inevitable cover-ups.\u201d\n\nHowever, single payer advocates say what\u2019s happening at the VA isn\u2019t relevant to single payer at all, since the VA is completely government-run and in a single- payer system, the delivery of care would remain largely in the private sector\u2019s hands.\n\nIn a single payer system\u2014known as Medicare for all\u2014the government would pay doctors and hospital bills. It would be funded through taxes.\n\nRelated: Obama Sticks to Playbook in VA Mess\n\nAdvocates have long said adopting a single payer system is the best solution to curb the country\u2019s swelling health care spending. The Affordable Care Act was intended to address that, but they say it doesn\u2019t go far enough. They point to Canada and Taiwan that have controlled health care spending inflation. One study published in the journal Health Affairs shows that American doctors spend nearly four times as much money interacting with healthcare payers than doctors in Canada.\n\nLast year, Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid said in an interview with PBS that Obamacare is a \u201cstep in the right direction, but we\u2019re far from having something that\u2019s going to work forever.\u201d When asked by a panelist whether he meant that ultimately meant the country would adopt a single-payer system, Reid said, \u201cYes, yes. Absolutely yes,\u201d according to the Las Vegas Sun.\n\nOf course, a single payer system is highly unlikely to be embraced by a Congress that is still fighting over the ACA. House Republicans have voted at least 50 times to dismantle the law and they\u2019ve made attacking the law one of their primary campaign strategies going into the 2014 midterm elections. Instead, advocates say single-payer is more likely to start at the state level.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, the independent Senator from Vermont and potential 2016 presidential contender, has been a leading advocate of a single-payer health care system for years. Last week, Sanders led a panel discussion on Capitol Hill over the future of single payer, since his home state of Vermont is expected to serve as a single payer guinea pig for other states. In 2011, Vermont passed legislation that would make it the first state to create its own single payer system called Green Mountain Care. It's set to launch in 2017.\n\nThe most important thing is to show people that change is possible,\u201d Gerald Friedman, an economics professor from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said at the panel discussion. \u201cThat\u2019s the role that Vermont has had \u2013 showing that it\u2019s possible to get something done.\u201d\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The", "title": "VA Scandal Gives Single-Payer Opponents Ammunition", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/27/VA-Scandal-Gives-Single-Payer-Opponents-Ammunition", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05232014_Shinseki.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/27/VA-Scandal-Gives-Single-Payer-Opponents-Ammunition", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05232014_Shinseki.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2538\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis VA scandal is a reminder that government-run single-payer health care does not work.\u201d Kudlow said.\nOf course, a single payer system is highly unlikely to be embraced by a Congress that is still fighting over the ACA.\nSen.
