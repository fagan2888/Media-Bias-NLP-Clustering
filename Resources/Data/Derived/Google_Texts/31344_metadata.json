Newly elected President Ted Cruz (R) insists he has won a mandate to repeal Obamacare. The Senate, narrowly back in Democratic hands, disagrees. Mr. Cruz instructs the Internal Revenue Service not to collect a fine from anyone who opts out of the individual mandate to buy health insurance, thereby neutering a key element of the program. It is a matter of prosecutorial discretion, Mr. Cruz explains; tax cheats are defrauding the government of billions, and he wants the IRS to concentrate on them. Of course, he is willing to modify his order as soon as Congress agrees to fix what he considers a \u201cbroken\u201d health system.\n\nThat is not a perfect analogy to Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed action on immigration. But it captures the unilateral spirit that Mr. Obama seems to have embraced since Republicans swept to victory in the midterm elections. He is vowing to go it alone on immigration. On Iran, he is reportedly designing an agreement that he need not bring to Congress. He already has gone that route on climate change with China.\n\nThe legal or constitutional case for each is different, but the rationales overlap: Congress is broken, so Mr. Obama must act. Two-thirds of Americans did not vote in the midterms, and the president must represent them, too. He has tried compromise, and the Republicans spurned him.\n\nWe will not relitigate that last contention except to note that behind the legislative disappointments of the past six years lies fault on both sides. The bigger point is this: In an era of fierce partisanship and close division, there will always be a temptation to postpone legislating until after the next election and to spend the intervening two years jockeying for political advantage. But a knockout blow will remain out of reach for both sides, and the price of postponement will be national decline. Many areas need federal attention and hold a possibility of bipartisan accord: building the nation\u2019s infrastructure, protecting its cybernetworks and reforming its tax code, to name just three. It would not be rational for Republicans to spurn compromise in these areas just because Mr. Obama acts unilaterally in others; but it is entirely foreseeable.\n\nWe favor immigration reform, including a path to legal status for the 11 million foreigners in the country without valid papers. Congress should have acted on this long ago. We also understand that the president has broad authority in this area, which he exercised in 2012 to pardon young people who had been brought here as children.\n\nNow, however, he is contemplating executive action not really aimed at one group or another but intended \u201cto make the system work better,\u201d as he said in his post-election news conference. He acknowledges that Congress should and could do this job, but he is tired of waiting.\n\nThree years ago, when advocacy groups pressed him to take such a step, Mr. Obama demurred. \u201cBelieve me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just on immigration reform. But that\u2019s not how \u2014 that\u2019s not how our system works. That\u2019s not how our democracy functions. That\u2019s not how our Constitution is written.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama may find a constitutional way to rewrite the nation\u2019s immigration laws. But in his frustration with democracy, he is likely to prove his point: Unilateralism will not make the system work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mr. Obama should heed his past advice on immigration: Unilateralism is \u201cnot how our system works.\u201d", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Mr. Obama should heed his past advice on immigration: Unilateralism is \u201cnot how our system works.\u201d", "title": "In Mr. Obama\u2019s own words, acting alone is \u2018not how our democracy functions\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/as-mr-obama-agrees-acting-alone-is-not-how-our-democracy-functions/2014/11/17/205916d0-6e82-11e4-ad12-3734c461eab6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/11/17/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Immigration_Get_Legal-0d452.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/as-mr-obama-agrees-acting-alone-is-not-how-our-democracy-functions/2014/11/17/205916d0-6e82-11e4-ad12-3734c461eab6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "unilateralism, obama executive action, obama immigration, congress immigration, ted cruz, obama executive overreach", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "eomportal-uuid": "205916d0-6e82-11e4-ad12-3734c461eab6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "unilateralism, obama executive action, obama immigration, congress immigration, ted cruz, obama executive overreach"}, "article_summary": "But in his frustration with democracy, he is likely to prove his point: Unilateralism will not make the system work.\nThree years ago, when advocacy groups pressed him to take such a step, Mr. Obama demurred.\nIt is a matter of prosecutorial discretion, Mr. Cruz explains; tax cheats are defrauding the government of billions, and he wants the IRS to concentrate on them.\nThe legal or constitutional case for each is different, but the rationales overlap: Congress is broken, so Mr. Obama must act.\nBut it captures the unilateral spirit that Mr. Obama seems to have embraced since Republicans swept to victory in the midterm elections."}
