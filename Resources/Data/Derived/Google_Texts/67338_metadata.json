So adept was he at his craft, he even swindled Al Capone out of several thousand dollars during the Roaring 20s and lived to tell about it.\n\nLustig was born in Czechoslovakia in 1890 when it was part of Austria-Hungary. Throughout his lifetime he had more than 45 aliases, and he spoke five languages fluently.\n\nEarly in Lustig\u2019s career he made his money by scamming wealthy tourists during Trans-Atlantic sailings between Europe and the United States.\n\nTraveling with another con man named \u201cDapper Dan\u201d Collins, the two master thieves made their way to in Paris in May of 1925.\n\nOne day while sitting at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 reading the French newspaper \u201cLe Monde,\u201d Lustig came across a small article that reported the Eiffel Tower was in dire need of repair.\n\nWhat is now a national icon had been built for the Paris Exposition in 1889 and was never intended as a permanent fixture in the city\u2019s skyline. In fact, the Eiffel Tower was originally scheduled to be taken down in 1909 and moved to another location. According to the story in the paper, the costs for repair to the tower would be prohibitive.\n\nThat\u2019s when a light bulb came on in Lustig\u2019s fertile brain.\n\nAfter Lustig had a forger print some fake government stationery, he gave himself the title of Deputy Director-General of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs and arranged a highly confidential meeting with six scrap metal dealers at the exclusive Hotel de Crillon.\n\nThe meeting was \u201cby invitation only\u201d with the businessmen being told that they had been exclusively selected because of their high standards of quality in the scrap metal industry.\n\nEach company was to asked submit a bid for project to tear down the Eiffel Tower, but Lustig\u2019s primary goal in setting up the scam was to select the best \u201cmark\u201d for his con.\n\nDuring his presentation, Lustig emphasized the need for secrecy due to the controversy that would be aroused from the public at the thought of tearing down their beloved landmark.\n\nWithin four days, Lustig had chosen his victim, a man named Andre Poisson. Though Poisson\u2019s wife became suspicious that such an important decision would be surrounded by so much secrecy, Lustig managed to charm his way through the negotiations with yet another bit of skullduggery.\n\nLustig confided in Poisson that though he was a \u201chigh ranking\u201d government official, his salary was not as prestigious as his position appeared to warrant.\n\nThe scrap metal dealer quickly realized he was being awarded the project as a bribe, and paid Lustig handsomely to secure the deal.\n\nOnce lucratively rewarded, Lustig and his pal Collins immediately fled to Austria where they lived a lavish lifestyle at Poisson\u2019s expense.\n\nJust to be certain there was no danger of being caught for their scheme, the rip-off artists checked Paris newspapers on a daily basis to stay informed about their escapade.\n\nAfter approximately six weeks with no news of any scandal, Lustig concluded that Poisson had been too embarrassed at falling for the con and never reported it to the authorities.\n\nEmboldened by the results, Lustig and his accomplice returned to Paris and attempted the same plot with five different scrap iron dealers.\n\nAmazingly, Lustig sold the Eiffel Tower for a second using the identical techniques as before. This time however, he was not so fortunate. Lustig\u2019s mark contacted the police after being fleeced of $100,000 and the Count abruptly fled to the United States to avoid capture.\n\nEventually Lustig was caught and sentenced to do time in Alcatraz. While serving his sentence, he contacted pneumonia and died in prison at the age of 57.\n\nInterestingly enough, Lustig\u2019s death certificate listed his occupation as a \u201csalesman.\u201d\n\nSo as officials of the Louvre and the French government mull the idea of selling another national landmark, the Mona Lisa, in order to pay some of its bills, just remember that one man already sold the Eiffel Tower twice.\n\nAnd now you know the real reason behind that bewitching smile on the face Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nBob Taylor has been traveling the world for more than 30 years as a writer and award winning television producer focusing on international events, people and cultures around the globe.\n\nTaylor is founder of The Magellan Travel Club (www.MagellanTravelClub.com)\n\nRead more of What in the World and Bob Taylor at Communities Digital News\n\nFollow Bob on Twitter @MrPeabod", "article_metadata": {"description": "Posing as a scrap metal dealer, Victor Lustig,a master con artist from Czechoslovakia actually sold the Eiffel Tower on two occasions.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Bob Taylor", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Posing as a scrap metal dealer, Victor Lustig,a master con artist from Czechoslovakia actually sold the Eiffel Tower on two occasions.", "title": "France selling the Mona Lisa?
