Shelter, the housing charity, is calling for a ban on “revenge evictions”, which it says are being carried out by bad landlords on tenants who dare to complain about inadequate conditions or ask for repairs to be made.

A survey by YouGov of more than 4,500 private tenants, commissioned by Shelter and British Gas, has revealed that poor conditions are the norm for many renting families. Almost half said they had lived in the past year in a property affected by damp (44%) or mould (48%) – both of which can cause conditions such as asthma and eczema.

Nearly a fifth had been in a property with electrical hazards (19%), and one in six families (18%) reported living with vermin infestations, including mice, ants and cockroaches, which also put their health at risk.

More than 120,000 renting families – the equivalent to one in 10 of Britain’s renters – have suffered health problems in the last year because rogue landlords failed to deal with the poor environment conditions in their properties, according to the research, while more than 60,000 families were threatened with eviction by their landlords after complaining about the state of their homes.

Shelter said it was releasing the figures as part of its campaign to change the law to protect renters from being thrown out of their homes by a small but dangerous minority of rogue landlords who don’t want to repair dangerous or inadequate properties.

On 28 November, politicians will have the chance to vote for the tenancies (reform) bill, to protect renters from unfair evictions. It is a simple clarification to the existing legislation which would ensure that people who report poor conditions to their landlord and are subsequently served a Section 21 eviction notice should have the right to appeal.
