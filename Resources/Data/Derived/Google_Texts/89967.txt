PELAHIIVKA, Ukraine (AP) — Workers have recovered all of the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, more than four months after the passenger jet was shot down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine.

Under the supervision of Dutch investigators and European security officials, the recovered fragments were loaded onto a train in the village of Pelahiivka and shipped to the Ukrainian government-held city of Kharkiv on Sunday.

The investigation into what happened to MH17 is being conducted there and in the Netherlands.

Ukraine and Western governments accuse Russia-backed separatist fighters of firing rockets that felled the plane, killing all 298 people aboard, while Russian state-run TV has blamed Ukraine’s air force.

The recovery operation, which took a week, had been delayed because of continued fighting between government troops and separatist fighters.
