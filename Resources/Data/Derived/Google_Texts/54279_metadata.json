Mitt was actually right when he talked about Russia, and he was actually right when he talked about how hard it was going to be to implement Obamacare, and he was actually right when he talked about the economy. I think there are a lot of everyday Americans who are now feeling the effects of what [Romney] said was going to happen, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nOf course, there is a long tradition in American politics of dwelling on counterfactuals and re-litigating past campaigns after your candidate loses. Democrats have argued through the years that America would have avoided two costly Middle East wars, solved climate change, and steered clear of the housing crisis if only the Supreme Court hadn\u2019t robbed Al Gore of his rightful victory in 2000. But a series of White House controversies and international crises this year \u2014 including a Syrian civil war that is threatening to pull the American military into the mix \u2014 has caused Romney\u2019s fans to erupt into a chorus of told-you-so\u2019s at record pace.\n\nIn the most actively cited example of the Republican nominee\u2019s foresight, Romneyites point to the candidate\u2019s hardline rhetoric last year against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his administration. During the campaign, Romney frequently criticized Obama for foolishly attempting to make common cause with the Kremlin, and repeatedly referred to Russia as \u201cour number one geopolitical foe.\u201d\n\nMany observers found this fixation strange, and Democrats tried to turn it into a punchline. A New York Times editorial in March of last year said Romney\u2019s assertions regarding Russia represented either \u201ca shocking lack of knowledge about international affairs or just craven politics.\u201d And in an October debate, Obama sarcastically mocked his opponent\u2019s Russia rhetoric. \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years,\u201d the president quipped at the time.\n\nThat line still chafes Robert O\u2019Brien, a Los Angeles lawyer and friend of Romney\u2019s who served as a foreign policy adviser.\n\n\u201cEveryone thought, Oh my goodness that is so clever and Mitt\u2019s caught in the Cold War and doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWell guess what. With all of these foreign policy initiatives \u2014 Syria, Iran, [Edward] Snowden \u2014 who\u2019s out there causing problems for America? It\u2019s Putin and the Russians.\u201d\n\nIndeed, earlier this summer, Moscow defiantly refused to extradite National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden to the United States, prompting Obama to cancel a meeting he had scheduled with Putin during the Group of 20 summit. Russia has blocked United Nations action against Syria. And on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told lawmakers that Russia was one of the countries supplying Syria with chemical weapons.\n\nTo Romney\u2019s fans, these episodes illustrate just how unfairly their candidate was punished during the election for speaking truths the rest of the country would eventually come around to.\n\n\u201cThe governor tried to enunciate how to deal with these very hard, tough issues, and we were met with slogans,\u201d O\u2019Brian lamented. \u201cAnd now the real world is exposing the slogans as being totally trite.\u201d\n\nAdmirers point to other examples of Romney\u2019s unrewarded wisdom, as well.\n\nDuring a foreign policy debate in October, the candidate briefly expressed concern over Islamic extremists taking control of northern Mali \u2014 an obscure reference that was mocked on Twitter at the time, including by liberal comedian Bill Maher. Three months later, France sent troops into the country at the behest of the Malian president, bringing the conflict to front pages around the world.\n\nOn the domestic front, Obamacare \u2014 which Romney spent more time railing against on the stump than perhaps any other progressive policy \u2014 is less popular than ever, while the federal government struggles to get the massive, complicated law implemented. (One poll in July found for the first time that a plurality of Americans now support the law\u2019s repeal.)\n\nAnd while the unemployment rate has, in the first year of Obama\u2019s second term, gradually fallen to post-crisis lows, the still-ailing U.S. economy, which served as the centerpiece for Romney\u2019s unsuccessful case against Obama\u2019s reelection, was given a potent symbol earlier this summer when Detroit became the largest American city ever to declare bankruptcy.\n\nThe Motor City became a symbolic battleground during the election, with Romney proudly touting his father\u2019s ties to the auto industry, and the Obama campaign relentlessly attacking the Republican for a Times op-ed he had written years earlier headlined \u201cLet Detroit Go Bankrupt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president took the title of that op-ed, which of course was written by editors of the New York Times, and used it to say Gov. Romney was being insensitive about his own home city,\u201d complained former campaign spokesman Ryan Williams. Romney\u2019s article argued that beleaguered automakers should consider going through a managed bankruptcy instead of taking a bailout but, Williams said, \u201cthe president\u2019s campaign intentionally tried to blur the lines. It worked. And several months later, the city is going bankrupt because of liberal democratic officeholders.\u201d\n\nReferring to the bankruptcy, Putin\u2019s posturing, and the Mali conflict, Williams added, \u201cObviously, it would have been nice if any of these incidents would have occurred during the campaign to vindicate Romney. You would never want to see the bankruptcy of a major U.S. city, or the president embarrass himself on the world stage like he has, but Gov. Romney did discuss these potential outcomes.\u201d\n\nRomneyites are processing these feelings of vindication in different ways. The campaign\u2019s chief strategist, Stuart Stevens, said he has been disappointed to see their central message \u2014 that Obama would be unable to restore America\u2019s strength \u2014 turned out to be so accurate: \u201cIf there is a part of the world in which America is stronger, it\u2019s hard to find. What\u2019s the president doing? Attacking a talk radio host. He has criticized Rush Limbaugh with more conviction than the leaders of Iran\u2026 We can only hope it improves. \u201d\n\nAnd Jennifer Rubin, the conservative Washington Post blogger who became Romney\u2019s most outspoken advocate in the press, accused members of the news media of failing to take the Republican\u2019s arguments seriously, while allowing the incumbent skate through the race untouched.\n\n\u201cAs for the media, they are the least self-reflective people I know,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cThe left-leaning media has carried the president\u2019s water faithfully, eschewing the least bit of critical analysis. Now they don\u2019t like the result?\u201d\n\nFor Zwick, perhaps the closest thing to a true Romney loyalist on the campaign last year, the belief that his candidate turned out to be right offers little comfort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because there\u2019s no way to correct it,\u201d Zwick said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do what they do in the U.K. and lead the opposition party when you lose. When you lose there is no way to sort of be vindicated. There\u2019s no way to say, \u2018OK, well, I didn\u2019t win the presidency but I\u2019m going to continue to fight.\u2019 There\u2019s no fighting. There\u2019s no platform to do that. Fifty million Americans voted for the guy and yet it\u2019s all for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish he\u2019d run again,\u201d Zwick added. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to. But if he did, I\u2019d be right there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2563178, "userid": 233242}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "From Russia to Mali to Detroit, Romney's biggest fans say they've been vindicated. \"Obviously, it would have been nice if any of...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
