Those who ponder the inevitable probably already know that heart disease is the most common causes of death in most states, and cancer in a few northern climes. After that, it’s either stroke, respiratory diseases or accidents.

But what are the maladies least expected yet have a disproportionately high chance of striking in your state?

Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Slate Magazine has compiled a number of maps, including the one we’re reproduced above. That map shows which ailments among the top 10 overall causes of death that are unusually high in certain states.

So if you’re from Missouri, the most likely way you’ll die is either through heart disease or stroke, but watch out for kidney ailments. The same is true in North Carolina. In Montana, the main causes of death are cancer and respiratory diseases, but Big Sky Country also has an disproportionately high number of accidental fatalities. For some reason, Utah and Ohio have an extraordinarily high number of deaths from diabetes.

And heart disease, stroke or respiratory diseases are the most common path to the hereafter in several Southern states and the Eastern seaboard, but beware of something called Septicemia just in case.

What is Septicemia? We had to look it up ourselves in the National Library of Medicine, and it wasn’t fun. It’s a bacteria that forms in the blood that can occur with such infections as meningitis or osteomyelitis, and can be fatal in a hurry.
