Why do you need Obamacare? In case you break your arm at a wild #YOLO party

Why do young people need to enroll in Obamacare? Because they might break an arm at a wild #YOLO party.

In case you missed the memo, the White House hosted a youth summit on Wednesday to discuss the Affordable Care Act and answer questions from young Americans. One questioner asked about the best way to convince young people they need to purchase health insurance, instead of just going uninsured and paying the fine.

Panelist Anton Gunn, the 2008 political director for President Barack Obama’s primary campaign in South Carolina, gave a classic answer: you can’t afford a hospital visit if you break your arm at a #YOLO party.

“One broken arm or broken leg, playing basketball, mountain biking, hiking — or maybe you just had the YOLO party of your life and you stood up on the table that night and the table collapsed beneath you and you fell down and you broke your arm,” Gunn said. “Well, a broken limb can cost you $7,500 if you don’t have health insurance.”

“That’s why health insurance is important,” he closed. “Because it protects you from major out-of-pocket costs if something goes wrong, if you get sick or maybe if you party a little bit too hard.”
