Some GOP candidates have suggested the U.S. economy should be growing at a 4% clip, but most forecasts suggest GDP for 2015 of between 2% and 3%.\n\n\u201cWe have to create better paying jobs,\u201d added former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. Reviving the manufacturing sector would provide middle-class Americans with millions of jobs lost in recent years to cheaper markets overseas, Santorum said.\n\nFormer New York Governor George Pataki said dependency on government entitlements \u2013 namely unemployment benefits \u2013 needs to be replaced with opportunity.\n\nJim Gilmore, the former governor of Virginia, said his administration will grow the economy \u201cso people don\u2019t have to rely on handouts.\u201d Gilmore said he will propose across the board tax cuts for all Americans, a move that will create jobs and grow the economy. He also said taxes and regulations have become too burdensome under more than six years of a Democratic administration.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMuch of the debate focused on issues related to national security.\n\nCarly Fiorina, former CEO of tech giant Hewlett-Packard, said she supports more collaboration between tech companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) and the government in an effort to fight homegrown terrorism.\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal was critical of Obamacare and said Americans can get better and cheaper healthcare if they are provided better jobs.\n\nFormer Texas Governor Rick Perry, who targeted immigration primarily, said he would focus on changing the corporate tax rate and lowering it.\n\nThese seven candidates were relegated to an earlier debate because polls show they aren\u2019t among the top 10 candidates if the election were held today. The top 10 polling candidates will debate later Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-06 04:40:34 EST",
