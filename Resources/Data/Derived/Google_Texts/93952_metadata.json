Bett and I had other intentions \u2014 we were going to the big party at the Railyard. But that was still hours away, so we headed into town in search of mischief.\n\nMore from Narratively: \u201cWhat I Learned Exposing Myself on LiveJournal\u201d\n\nWe stopped briefly at a restaurant where Bett\u2019s girlfriend was having dinner with some of her friends. As we talked with them I ordered an appetizer, even though I had just eaten dinner.\n\nAs we left the restaurant, Bett mentioned that many of the town\u2019s art galleries were open, and were serving free drinks. We agreed that alcoholic freeloading would be a fine way to pass the time before the party, and off we went.\n\nMore from Narratively: \u201cThe Al Gore of Polynesia\u201d\n\nIt turned out that some of the galleries offered free food as well as booze. I partook mightily of both, even though I\u2019d just eaten dinner followed by an appetizer.\n\nAs I chomped on some buffalo wings, I saw Bett looking at me.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t turn down food, even when you\u2019re not hungry, can you?\u201d she asked.\n\nMore from Narratively: \u201cThe Many Masturbating Motorists of My Life\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said. Without my explaining why, she knew and understood.\n\nThere were many times when the only way I could eat was to steal food. I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1966, in the Maryhill district, which was a Third World hidden within the first. For most of my childhood, hot water on tap was a fantasy, having a toilet in your home was a luxury, and food of any quality was seldom available. One of the most painful moments of my life, a moment of pure grief, pure loss, was caused not by the death of a person but by being deprived of a meal.\n\nI was in my early teens, and I had just been handed a plate of chicken. This was a rarity. My diet was almost exclusively one of fried processed meat \u2014 usually cheap sausages \u2014 potatoes, eggs and white bread.\n\nBefore I could eat any of it, a woman whose role was nominally that of parent came into the room. She was drunk at noon, and she didn\u2019t like me. She said something unpleasant to me, I responded in kind, and she knocked the plate of food out of my hands. As she stomped the chicken into the dirty carpet, the hopelessness I felt was so huge that there was room inside me for nothing else.\n\nThat woman is dead now, but, more than thirty years later, I can still see the look of dumb malice on her drunken face. In the years to come, I was to mourn the loss of that meal more times than I could keep count of.\n\nThere were other times, times of inadequate food or no food at all. And, when these times were over, I still lived in fear of their return. I could never bring myself to pass up a chance to eat. I still felt that I had to take it whenever and wherever I could get it, because if I ever had to go hungry again I didn\u2019t want to have to remember the times when I could have eaten but chose not to.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Growing up poor, I often ate what I could steal.
