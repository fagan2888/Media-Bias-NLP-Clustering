However, President Obama is certain to veto any bill containing such provisions, and since a 2/3 majority is needed to override a veto, the president's veto would very likely be upheld.\n\n\"Reconciliation is really a political exercise on the part of Congressional leaders, but it will suck up a fair amount of time and oxygen this fall,\" Park added.\n\nEven legislation that most members of Congress appear to agree on, such as the 21st Century Cures bill, will likely take a back seat to the larger budgetary issues, according to Park. In the case of 21st Century Cures, which passed the House on July 10th, \"the Senate is developing its own bill, but from all of the reports I've heard, the Senate won't work on its own version until next year,\" he said.\n\nThere are a few healthcare issues, however, that may bubble up to the surface. \"There are signs that certain 'tweaks' to the ACA, including repeal of the so-called Cadillac Tax [on expensive health insurance plans], could gain a certain amount of momentum, though wholesale repeal drives will also likely continue,\" Daniel Ehlke, PhD, assistant professor of health policy and management at the State University of New York-Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, said in an email to MedPage Today. \"Though there is scant possibility of any serious gun control legislation, recent events have led some to suggest that support for reform of various mental health provisions could gather steam.\"\n\nAlthough not much healthcare legislation is expected from Congress in the coming weeks and months, \"the passage of the 'Doc Fix' -fix earlier this year, however, shows that the legislature can occasionally surprise in this regard,\" he added.\n\nKip Piper, a healthcare consultant here, suggested one other possibility. \"Congress will face a new problem when [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] announces the Medicare Part B premiums for 2016,\" he wrote in an email. \"Because of the intricacies of the statutory formula and the fact that about 70% of beneficiaries are protected to some degree from big increases in premiums, about 30% of beneficiaries are ultimately responsible for 100% of the annual increases. This means many seniors will likely face a Part B premium increase of 40% or more.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joyce  Frieden", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Washington-Watch/53426", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/53xxx/53426.jpg", "description": "Budget issues will predominate on the healthcare front, experts predict", "card": "Summary", "title": "Next Session of Congress: It's All About the Money"}, "dc.date.issued": "2015-09-04 15:30:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "arrhythmias,hivaids,cardiology,dermatology,endocrinology,gastroenterology,hematologyoncology,infectiousdisease,allergyimmunology,neurology,obgyn,pediatrics,primarycare,psychiatry,publichealthpolicy,ophthalmology,allergy,generaldermatology,othercancers,generalneurology,generalpediatrics,healthpolicy,generalendocrinology,generalgastroenterology,generalobgyn,generalprimarycare,generalophthalmology,emergencymedicine,painmanagement,geriatrics,washington-watch,generalgeriatrics,genetics,generalgenetics,hospitalbasedmedicine,criticalcare,generalcriticalcare,pathology,generalpathology,oncology,anesthesiology,nursing,nursing,generalhospitalpractice", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-04 15:30:00", "sailthru.title": "Next Session of Congress: It's All About the Money", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "Budget issues will predominate on the healthcare front, experts predict", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-09-05 15:09:00", "date": "2015-09-04 15:30:00", "sailthru.description": "Budget issues will predominate on the healthcare front, experts predict", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Washington-Watch/53426", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/53xxx/53426.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Budget issues will predominate on the healthcare front, experts predict", "title": "Next Session of Congress: It's All About the Money"}, "sailthru.featured": 1, "dc.date": "2015-09-04 15:30:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "cardiology,Other,infectiousdiseases,allergyandimmunology,otolaryngology,dermatology,hematologyoncology,hematology_oncology,neurology,pediatrics,endocrinology,gastroenterology,obstetricsandgynecology,primarycare,ophthalmology,emergencymedicine,painmanagement,psychiatry,geriatrics,genetics,criticalcare,pathology,anesthesiology,hospitalmedicine", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/53xxx/53426.jpg"}, "article_summary": "\"When Congress enacts a budget plan ... it includes budget reconciliation instructions,\" Park explained in a phone interview.\nHowever, \"the congressional Republican leadership seems uncertain about what would go in the reconciliation bill healthcare-wise, and the timing,\" said Park.\nAnother possible healthcare-related agenda item for Congress is budget reconciliation, noted Edwin Park, JD, vice-president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank here.\nThose results will affect healthcare funding, including funding for the National Institutes of Health, she said in a phone interview.\n\"Congress will face a new problem when [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] announces the Medicare Part B premiums for 2016,\" he wrote in an email."}
