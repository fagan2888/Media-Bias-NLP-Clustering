The New York Times profiled my change of heart saying that to my former friends I\u2019m considered a \u201ctraitorous prince\u201d since my religious-right family was once thought of as \u201cevangelical royalty.\u201d\n\nYou see, only in the Mafia, the British Royal family and big time American religion is a nepotistic rise to power seen as normal. And I was good at it. And I hated it while hypocritically profiting from it \u2014 until, that is, in the mid-1980s, I quit. These days I describe myself as an atheist who believes in God.\n\nIronically I helped my father become famous in the religion sector. In the 1970s I directed and produced two film series featuring Dad with book companions that became evangelical bestsellers: \u201cHow Should We Then Live?\u201d and \u201cWhatever Happened to the Human Race?\u201d By the time Dad and I completed two nationwide seminar tours launching those projects, I was being invited to speak at the biggest religious gatherings, including the Southern Baptist Convention and the annual meeting of the National Religious Broadcasters.\n\nThe leaders of the new religious right were gleefully betting on American failure. If secular, democratic, diverse and pluralistic America survived, then wouldn\u2019t that prove that we were wrong about God only wanting to bless \u201cChristian America?\u201d If, for instance, crime went down dramatically in New York City, for any other reason than a reformation and revival, wouldn\u2019t that make the prophets of doom look silly? And if the economy was booming without anyone repenting, what did that mean?\n\nWhat began to bother me was that so many of our new \u201cfriends\u201d on the religious right seemed to be rooting for one form of apocalypse or another. In the crudest form this was part of the evangelical fascination with the so-called end times. The worse things got, the sooner Jesus would come back. But there was another component. The worse everything got, the more it proved that America needed saving, by us! Plus, it was good for fundraising.\n\nSome 30 years later, what we helped start \u2014 I am sorry! \u2014 continues. With the Republicans in control of the House and Senate the question arises \u2014 again \u2014 Where does the American far right find the energy to oppose everything and everyone again and again?\n\nThe short answer is that the American right is not about politics as most people understand it but about religious absolutes. As the New York Times noted on the single-minded desire to subvert President Obama\u2019s overhaul of the broken immigration system, \u201cAnd in their most audacious plans, Tea Party groups are preparing to recruit challengers to run against high-profile Republicans they accuse of betraying them \u2014 as they did when they toppled Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader.\u201d\n\nThis zealous negativity has a long history. I was part of it as the nepotistic sidekick to my religious-right evangelist father. The 1970s Evangelical anti-abortion movement that Dad (Evangelical leader Francis Schaeffer), C. Everett Koop (who would be Ronald Reagan\u2019s surgeon general) and I helped create seduced the Republican Party. We turned it into an extremist far-right party that is fundamentally anti-American. There would have been no Tea Party without the foundation we built.\n\nThe difference between now and then is that back then we were religious fanatics knocking on the doors of normal political leaders. Today the fanatics are the political leaders.\n\nYou can\u2019t understand why the GOP was so successful in winning back both houses of congress in 2014, and wrecking most of what Obama has tried to do, unless you understand what we did back then.\n\nYou see, in the late 1960s Dad published the first of many best-selling evangelical books. When Dad toured evangelical colleges and churches all over North America, I often accompanied him while Mom and Dad \u2014 unbeknownst to them at the time \u2014 were gradually being elevated to Evangelical Protestant sainthood. This meant that a few years later when Dad took a \u201cstand\u201d on the issue of abortion, a powerful movement formed almost instantly, inspired by his leadership, and the evangelical-led \u201cpro-life\u201d movement (and the religious right) was born.\n\nMy father is still a hero to many religious right leaders, such as Dave Andrusko (editor of the National Right to Life News). In his review of two books on the history of the anti-abortion movement, Andrusko notes that the anti-abortion movement \u201cattracted people by building on the foundation established by theologian Francis Schaeffer. It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of [Schaeffer\u2019s] book \u201cWhatever Happened to the Human Race?\u201d and [the 1970s] twenty-city film and lecture tour [undertaken] to awaken the evangelical community.\u201d\n\nBy the early 1980s the Republicans were laboring under the weight of a single-issue religious test for heresy: abortion. As I describe in my new book \u201cWhy I am an Atheist Who Believes in God: How to give love, create beauty and find peace\u201d (and I hope offer an alternative to the harm we did), I was there \u2014 and/or Dad was.\n\nWe were leaders participating in various meetings with Congressman Jack Kemp, Presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush, Sr., when the unholy marriage between the Republican Party and the Evangelical Reconstructionist-infected \u201cpro-life\u201d community was gradually consummated. Dad and I \u2014 as did many other evangelical leaders like Jerry Falwell \u2014 met one on one or in groups with key members of the Republican leadership quite regularly to develop a \u201cpro-life strategy\u201d for rolling back Roe v. Wade. (Senator Jesse Helms named Dad as his favorite author when asked by the American Spectator magazine to name his favorite books.)\n\nAnd that strategy was simple: Republican leaders would affirm their anti-abortion commitment to evangelicals, and in turn we\u2019d vote for them \u2014 by the tens of millions. Once Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency, \u201cwe\u201d would reverse Roe, through a constitutional amendment and/or through the appointment of anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court or, if need be, through civil disobedience and even violence, though this was only hinted at at first. In 2016, the dream we had will become a reality unless America wakes up. The Republicans are poised to destroy women\u2019s rights. They have a majority on the Court to back them up.\n\nWhen evangelical and Republican leaders sat together, we discussed \u201cthe issue,\u201d but we would soon move on to the practical particulars, such as \u201cWill blue-collar Catholic voters join us now?\u201d (They did.) Soon evangelical leaders were helping political leaders to send their message to the \u201cpro-life community\u201d that they \u2014 the Republican leaders \u2014 were on board.\n\nFor instance, I organized the 1984 publication of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s anti-abortion book with Evangelical Bible publisher Thomas Nelson. Reagan\u2019s book had first appeared as an essay in the Human Life Review (Spring 1983). I was friends with the Human Life Review founder and editor: brilliant Roman Catholic anti-abortion crusader Jim McFadden. He and I cooked up the presidential project over the phone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was a religious fanatic appealing to political leaders.
