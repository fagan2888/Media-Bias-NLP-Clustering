The force has around 28,000 members spread across 150 districts in the country.\n\nSopko\u2019s team found a force plagued with problems, many caused by the remote setting of its work.\n\nRelated: Battle over Kunduz highlights risk to huge U.S. Afghan investments\n\nFor instance, when it comes to reporting attendance, member can check in using radios and cellphones or deliver reports by hand. Once submitted, the reports go through a byzantine certification process in which the provincial chief of police is in charge of certifying time sheet and controlling salary payments, each of which can be altered at any time. The arrangement \u201ccreates an opportunity for fraud and corruption,\u201d according to the audit.\n\nMeanwhile, DOD itself hasn\u2019t conducted any audits of the salary disbursements to make sure the numbers add up, it notes.\n\nThe rural focus of the ALP also hampers its supply chain\n\nRelated: The U.S. War on Drugs in Afghanistan Is an $8 Billion Failure\n\n\u201cThe ALP is the first line of defense for many villages across Afghanistan, but supplies ordered for the ALP are often diverted, delayed, of inferior quality, or heavily pilfered,\u201d the report states. \u201cFurthermore, coalition and ALP personnel SIGAR interviewed stated that unreliable logistics and lack of supplies also increase the likelihood of attrition.\u201d\n\nPersonnel are also \u201cinappropriately\u201d used as bodyguards for Afghan government officials, no doubt due to the unstable security situation in the country that recently led President Obama to revise his plans for a drawdown in U.S. troops.\n\nThe ALP is supposed to be incorporated into other Afghan security forces eventually, but SIGAR found no concrete plans for doing so any time soon.\n\nSopko makes a number of recommendations to fix the ALP program, including the creation of an electronic payment system; setting up protocols so members get the supplies they need and aren\u2019t used as bodyguards; and conducting financial audits of the entire ALP system.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Defense Department has spent more than $470 million to maintain the Afghan Local P", "title": "Corruption and Fraud Inside Afghanistan\u2019s $600 Million Police Force", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/26/Corruption-and-Fraud-Inside-Afghanistan-s-600-Million-Police-Force", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Afghan_Police_Training_POTD.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/26/Corruption-and-Fraud-Inside-Afghanistan-s-600-Million-Police-Force", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Afghan_Police_Training_POTD.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Defense Department has spent more than $470 million to maintain the Afghan Local P", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd067a\"", "article_summary": "The ALP is supposed to be incorporated into other Afghan security forces eventually, but SIGAR found no concrete plans for doing so any time soon.\nSopko\u2019s team found a force plagued with problems, many caused by the remote setting of its work.\nThe arrangement \u201ccreates an opportunity for fraud and corruption,\u201d according to the audit.\nMeanwhile, DOD itself hasn\u2019t conducted any audits of the salary disbursements to make sure the numbers add up, it notes.\nThe force has around 28,000 members spread across 150 districts in the country."}
