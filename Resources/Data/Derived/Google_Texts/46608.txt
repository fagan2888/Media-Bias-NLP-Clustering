How much higher can they go? Although the online retailer's shares skyrocketed 118 percent to $676 this year, analysts said they still have room to run.

Helping to drive Amazon's performance is the continued growth of its subscription Prime service, which enrolled more than 3 million members worldwide during the third week of December alone. These consumers not only shop with Amazon more frequently, but they also spend more on the site.

"We continue to believe the North America segment maintains a sizable, commanding and expanding lead in the retail space, and for it to increasingly dominate the growing retail e-commerce space," Nomura told investors.

The firm predicts Amazon's North America sales will reach $100 billion by 2017, and account for nearly one-fourth of all U.S. online sales, excluding automobiles and gas. That would compare to 19 percent share in 2014.
