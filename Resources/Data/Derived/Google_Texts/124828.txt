BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (AP) - New Western Kentucky coach Jeff Brohm has announced the hiring of former Cincinnati assistant Tyson Helton as the Hilltoppers offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.

Helton coached special teams and tight ends last season with the Bearcats, who went 9-4 and reached the Belk Bowl. He takes over an offense that posted a school-record 5,502 yards and returns quarterback Brandon Doughty, who set WKU’s single-season passing yardage record with 2,857.

A quarterback at Houston from 1996-99, Helton spent six seasons at UAB as quarterbacks and running backs coach. Brohm was also on the Blazers’ staff in 2012.

Helton also coached special teams and tight ends from 2004-06 at Memphis and served as a graduate assistant and special teams coach at Hawaii.
