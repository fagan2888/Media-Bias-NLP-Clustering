After all was said and done, the President stood before the crowd and will and confident \u201cObama Out\u201d, dropped the mic harder that Run DMC ever could. Well, that\u2019s not true, but at least it was better than Kobe.\n\nTITS AND ASS NO LONGER CRASS\n\nUsually, if the President mentions your name or company, a response might be in line.
