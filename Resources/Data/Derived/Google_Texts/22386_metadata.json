From there, the group cut a wide swath, at times touching 17th Street, California Street, the 16th Street Mall, Stout Street then the Colorado Convention Center before eventually reaching the Denver Detention Center. All along the walk, Denver police tried their best to hold back traffic from the marchers.\n\nAlthough there were no obvious signs of discord, things did get a bit tense when three armed sheriff\u2019s deputies, perhaps disquieted by the size of the gathering, stood on alert just inside the front doors of the jail.\n\nOrganizers had planned for the march to conclude at the jail, but a large group continued the protest, moving moved west on West Colfax Avenue and blocking the viaduct over Interstate 25.\n\nPolice formed a line to prevent protesters from moving onto the interstate about 8:10 p.m.\n\nMost of the crowd then dispersed peacefully. But, police said, four people who refused to leave and grabbed at officers were arrested as police used handheld pepper-spray dispensers.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Police ID 4 arrested during downtown Ferguson protests", "title": "Denver Police ID 4 arrested during downtown Ferguson protests", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/26/denver-police-id-4-arrested-during-downtown-ferguson-protests/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141126__brendon-thompsonp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141126__brendon-thompsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-26T12:44:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:45:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb020\"", "article_summary": "Police in Denver on Wednesday released the names and mugshots of four men arrested on Tuesday night during downtown protests surrounding the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.\nBut, police said, four people who refused to leave and grabbed at officers were arrested as police used handheld pepper-spray dispensers.\nBrendon Thompson, 26, John Thompson, 19, Sergio Juarez, 33, and Kaelon Champion, 20, were all arrested on suspicion of obstruction of a roadway and interference, police said.\nPolice formed a line to prevent protesters from moving onto the interstate about 8:10 p.m.\nAfter brief speeches near the Capitol, the protesters, some of whom carried lit candles, walked into the middle of Broadway."}
