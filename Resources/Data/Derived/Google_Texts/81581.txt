The College of Muscogee Nation in Okmulgee, Oklahoma is eligible for operation funding from the Bureau of Indian Education. The college has been trying to get this funding since April of last year. The funding will begin in July 2014.

“I congratulate the College of the Muscogee Nation for achieving this important milestone in its development and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation leaders for realizing their vision of bringing higher education opportunities to their people,” Assistant Secretary – Indian Affairs Kevin K. Washburn said in a statement. “I’m pleased that we are able to support the college in its quest to become an independent institution of higher learning, and a full member of the family of tribal colleges and universities.”

According to that statement, with this funding, the total number of BIE-funded tribal colleges and universities is now 27.
