As reported by the National Sleep Foundation, caffeine persists for several hours once it\u2019s in the body, and it can take about six hours for only a half of it to be eliminated. Enter Deland Jessop.\n\nIn 2013, Time reported that Jessop founded Counting Sheep Coffee after his wife complained she couldn\u2019t enjoy the drink after 3 p.m. He experimented with sleep-inducing herbs and supplements in his own home before coming across the plant (and herbal sedative) valerian. Outside of coffee, valerian has been used to ease insomnia, anxiety, nervous restlessness, and stomach cramps.\n\nThe University of Maryland Medical Center cited research that found \u201cvalerian was no more effective than placebo for 14 days, but by 28 days valerian greatly improved sleep for those who were taking it.\u201d Researchers speculated this was the case because it takes valerian a few weeks to take effect. Other studies have shown valerian is more effective than placebo almost immediately, and one study analysis wasn\u2019t convinced valerian works to treat insomnia.\n\nSince valerian also has a strong, sharp smell, it\u2019s usually mixed with other herbs, like hops and lemon balm. Jessop decided to mask the smell with decaffeinated coffee, \u201cthus sleep coffee was born.\u201d Now, coffee drinkers can choose from Bedtime Blend/40 winks, the original sleep coffee, or Lights Out!, which makes for a stronger cup. Each is made from a blend of Swiss Water decaf coffee and organic valerian root; the stronger coffee packs more valerian and a bolder taste.\n\n\u201cInstead of a glass of wine, we\u2019ll brew up a cup of coffee instead,\u201d Jessop said.\n\nBut is it safe for consumption? Jessop said valerian is approved for use in food by the Food and Drug Administration, emphasizing this product is a food product, not drug product. And Stephen Bent, an associate professor at the University of California San Francisco, told Time there\u2019s little-known side effects apart from drowsiness. \u201cIn the studies that have been done, it\u2019s been show to be safe,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are, however, some disclaimers on the company's website. For one, since this is a food product, it is not intended to treat sleeping disorders. Additionally, people react differently to valerian, \"depending how sensitive they are to it.\" Still, the company has found most people report a cup of coffee before bed is enjoyable and gives them no problems sleeping.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "have, trouble, sleeping, counting, sheep, coffee, helps, you, fall, asleep, mixing, decaf, herbs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Counting Sheep Coffee is a new food product that mixes sleep-inducing herbs and decaffeinated coffee to help coffee drinkers fall asleep.", "title": "Now You Can Drink Your Coffee And Fall Asleep, Too", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/have-trouble-sleeping-counting-sheep-coffee-helps-you-fall-asleep-mixing-decaf-herbs-319252", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/24/coffee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Counting Sheep Coffee is a new food product that mixes sleep-inducing herbs and decaffeinated coffee to help coffee drinkers fall asleep.", "title": "Now You Can Drink Your Coffee And Fall Asleep, Too", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/have-trouble-sleeping-counting-sheep-coffee-helps-you-fall-asleep-mixing-decaf-herbs-319252", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/24/coffee.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/24/coffee.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-24T12:17:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-24T12:17:20-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Counting Sheep Coffee is a new food product that mixes sleep-inducing herbs and decaffeinated coffee to help coffee drinkers fall asleep."}, "article_summary": "Outside of coffee, valerian has been used to ease insomnia, anxiety, nervous restlessness, and stomach cramps.\nJessop decided to mask the smell with decaffeinated coffee, \u201cthus sleep coffee was born.\u201d Now, coffee drinkers can choose from Bedtime Blend/40 winks, the original sleep coffee, or Lights Out!, which makes for a stronger cup.\nJessop said valerian is approved for use in food by the Food and Drug Administration, emphasizing this product is a food product, not drug product.\nFor one, since this is a food product, it is not intended to treat sleeping disorders.\nIn 2013, Time reported that Jessop founded Counting Sheep Coffee after his wife complained she couldn\u2019t enjoy the drink after 3 p.m."}
