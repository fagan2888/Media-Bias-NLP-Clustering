We have never had a recovery in modern history like this. We should be growing by at least 2 or 3 annual percentage points more than we are now.\u201d\n\nKissel spoke to about 480 members and guests at the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce\u2019s season\u2019s kick-off breakfast, the first of monthly events that will continue through April.\n\nShiny Shots: Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce\n\nThe impact of the economy\u2019s sluggish growth \u2014 amid wrongheaded moves by Obama and the many \u201cbureaucrats\u201d he has relied on to guide the recovery \u2014 has resonated among voters looking for a solution, said Kissel, 38.\n\n\u201cThe conservative movement is in upheaval, because conservatives, like many liberals in this country, are upset about the \u20182-percent economy\u2019 and their limited prospects for personal advancement,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Tea Party and the Occupy Wall Street movement, I think, spring from exactly the same place. They spring from a place of deep economic discontent \u2014 the system is somehow rigged and they don\u2019t understand why.\u201d\n\nBut they do want action, she said.\n\n\u2018Political outsiders\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s popularity is telling, she said, although she warned that if he were elected, his anti-immigration stance would hurt international trade.\n\n\u201cHow can we have a businessman-cum-entertainer touting an anti-trade, anti-immigrant platform \u2014 completely antithetical to what this country was based on, our founding mission \u2014 leading the GOP polls, in some instances by 20 points? That\u2019s nothing to sniff at. Why are political outsiders garnering, at this moment in time, more than half of the likely GOP vote?\u201d\n\nDuring her speech, she never named Trump but adopted a rhetorical device to wryly refer to him only as \u201cthe businessman from New York.\u201d\n\n\u2018Thanks, Dad\u2019\n\nThe breakfast was a homecoming, of sorts, for Kissel, who was raised in Jupiter and graduated from Dreyfoos School of the Arts before completing undergraduate work in government at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s in international studies from Johns Hopkins University. Her career has included stints in London at the Goldman Sachs investment bank and five years as editorial page editor for the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Asia edition.\n\nNow at the Journal\u2019s New York flagship, the Brooklyn resident writes about politics and policy for the unsigned \u201cReview & Outlook\u201d column and hosts \u201cOpinion Journal\u201d on WSJ Video. She also co-hosts a nationally syndicated news magazine on Cumulus Media Networks, and appears regularly on Fox news and business programs.\n\nHer parents attended the breakfast, and her father, Greg Kissel, introduced her on the dais. \u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d she said, adding that she typically doesn\u2019t get to use those words when she makes a speech.\n\n\u2018Risk-and-reward decisions\u2019\n\nAs champion of \u201csmall and energetic government,\u201d she repeatedly slammed the Obama administration\u2019s policies, which she said had led to bloated government, over-regulation and a \u201cdistortion of the price of credit,\u201d thanks to the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s refusal to raise interest rates. She also described the Affordable Health Care Act, known as Obamacare, as \u201ca grand expansion of Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe economy, she said, should be guided not by Washington \u201cbureaucratic experts\u201d but by \u201cprivate individuals\u201d whose businesses put them \u201cout there every day making risk-and-reward decisions.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, she added, did the party no favors with the public by making \u201chyperbolic promises\u201d they couldn\u2019t keep after being swept into Congress in 2010 \u2013 and then shutting the government down for 13 days in 2013. Among the results of those public-relations debacles has been the growing split between \u201cpopulist\u201d candidates \u2013 including Trump \u2014 and the more \u201cmoderate\u201d candidates within the GOP, such as former Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is that the longer the businessman from New York stays in the race, the harder it will be for the GOP to unite,\u201d she said.\n\nFor retired small businessman Bill Tylander, Kissel hit all the right notes.\n\n\u201cOur economy hasn\u2019t performed, and government hasn\u2019t performed,\u201d Tylander said. \u201cAnd government has shackled the economy.\u201d\n\nAttendee Kim Jones of Celedinas Insurance Group said Kissel\u2019s speech gave her a chance to \u201chear things I had never heard before. More Americans should have the opportunity to hear someone like that, even if they disagree. I think we all need to become educated about our policies, our politics and our roles as individuals.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reflecting a simmering schism within the Republican Party, Donald Trump\u2019s rising presidential star is anchored in a profound sense of dissatisfaction among Americans who believe the economy and the Obama administration have failed them, Wall Street Journal editorial board member Mary Kissel said Monday morning at The Breakers.", "og": {"url": "http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/local/chamber-speaker-explores-conservative-upheaval/nnfKF/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/15/b1/14/Kissel.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Reflecting a simmering schism within the Republican Party, Donald Trump\u2019s rising presidential star is anchored in a profound sense of dissatisfaction among Americans who believe the economy and the Obama administration have failed them, Wall Street Journal editorial board member Mary Kissel said Monday morning at The Breakers.", "title": "Journal's Kissel discusses Trump, GOP troubles in Palm Beach"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/09/15/b1/14/Kissel.jpg", "description": "Reflecting a simmering schism within the Republican Party, Donald Trump&rsquo;s rising presidential star is anchored in a profound sense of dissatisfaction among Americans who believe the economy and the Obama administration have failed them, Wall Street Journal editorial board member Mary Kissel said Monday morning at The Breakers.", "site": "@shinysheet", "card": "summary", "title": "Chamber speaker explores \u2018conservative upheaval\u2019"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "palmbeachdailynews", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/local/chamber-speaker-explores-conservative-upheaval/nnfKF/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3062006/news/news/local/chamber-speaker-explores-conservative-upheaval/nnfKF/", "keywords": "trump,newsfeed", "google-site-verification": "lgU00SzU_ChqK0qFbu4lYha8V6ghHO9uTf0LHHcoQ98", "news_keywords": "TopStory"}, "article_summary": "Speaker Mary Kissel of the \u2018Wall Street Journal\u2019 discussed Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the sluggish economy and Obamacare Monday at the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce\u2019s season kickoff breakfast.\nHer career has included stints in London at the Goldman Sachs investment bank and five years as editorial page editor for the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Asia edition.\n\u201cThe Tea Party and the Occupy Wall Street movement, I think, spring from exactly the same place.\nAnd that disgruntlement is tied directly to the economy\u2019s anemic annual growth rate of 2 percent, she added.\nHer parents attended the breakfast, and her father, Greg Kissel, introduced her on the dais."}
