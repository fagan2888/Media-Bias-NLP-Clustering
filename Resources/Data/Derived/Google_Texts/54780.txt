Carly Fiorina says she never had a master plan on becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company.

She took on one challenge, then another, and another, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard told a crowd of 100 people at New Jersey City University in Jersey City this week.

“If you gave me a job, I saw possibilities,” Fiorina said at the National Society for Leadership and Success lecture that was simulcast to colleges across the country. “If someone said, ‘Don’t take that job it’s too hard,’ I’d say ‘That looks interesting.’ If you take on hard things, people take notice.”

Fiorina said she once thought leadership was about who had the best office, the best title, the most staff or the biggest salary.

Now she says it’s “about seeing possibilities. Leadership is about seizing possibilities and leadership, most importantly, is about unlocking the potential in others.”

Fiorina, 59, advised those attending to “have the courage and take the time to find you own way.”

She encourages people to take risks and make mistakes.

“If you are not making mistakes you are not taking risks ... The goal is not to make the same mistake twice.”

Starting as a secretary and working herself through school, Fiorina went on to serve as the chairman and CEO at HP from 1999 to 2005. She was named Fortune’s Most Powerful Woman in Business for six consecutive years.

She said there is no substitute for hard work and it is not the strongest or smartest who survive, but “those most adaptive to change.”

She currently serves as chairman of the board of Good360, the world’s largest product philanthropy organization, and is the founder and CEO of Carly Fiorina Enterprises.

“Lastly, never sell you soul,” Fiorina told the audience. “Figure out who you are. Own yourself and don’t sell your soul ever because, if you do, no one will ever sell it back.”
