The Broncos have signed long snapper Kevin McDermott to their practice squad.

To make room for McDermott, the Browns have agreed to sign rookie offensive lineman Vinston Painter to their 53-man roster, pending his physical.

Painter was selected in the sixth round (No. 173) of the 2013 draft out of Virginia Tech and spent most of last season on the Broncos’ practice squad.

For Painter, being added to Cleveland’s 53-man roster has considerable advantages: He will earn $420,000 and full NFL benefits on the Browns’ roster, while he would have received $107,100 with almost no benefits on the Broncos’ practice squad.

McDermott is considered one of the best pure snappers in the league. He snapped every game for the San Francisco 49ers last season and was a surprise cut last week, beaten out by Kyle Nelson, who doubles as a fourth tight end.

The new practice squad rules made McDermott eligible despite playing in 19 games, counting playoffs last season.

McDermott worked out Monday with the New England Patriots, then Tuesday morning with the Broncos.

McDermott — who will likely compete this week with Aaron Brewer, the Broncos’ long snapper the past two years — already won one snap-off competition at Broncos’ headquarters this week. Besides McDermott, the Broncos brought in long snappers Danny Aiken, recently cut by New England, and Jake Ingram, who has snapped for four NFL teams, for a tryout Tuesday morning.

McDermott was the one the Broncos signed to their practice squad Tuesday, according to an NFL source.

The 24-year-old grew up in Nashville, where in high school he was a three-year starter in lacrosse, basketball and football. He was a recruited walk-on to UCLA and eventually received a full scholarship from coach Rick Neuheisel.

As an undrafted rookie last season, McDermott beat out Brian Jennings, the 49ers’ longsnapper the previous 13 years.
