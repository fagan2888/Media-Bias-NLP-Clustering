In seven cases, the regulator approved rate hikes that are lower than what the companies proposed, but in one case \u2013 ConnectiCare Benefits, which covers the most customers who buy plans through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange \u2013 the insurance department\u2019s adjustments led to an average 1.3 percent decrease from current rates.\n\nThe insurance department is also requiring one company, HealthyCT, to raise rates by more than the company sought, after determining that its proposed rates were inadequate.\n\nOverall, the approved average rate changes range from ConnectiCare Benefits\u2019 1.3 percent decrease to a 21.7 percent increase for UnitedHealthcare plans sold outside the state\u2019s health insurance exchange. Those figures are averages; specific plans sold by each carrier could have higher or lower rate changes.\n\nAbout 167,000 people buy insurance in the state\u2019s individual insurance market, including 96,966 who purchased policies through Connecticut\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT. For any given customer, the size of the rate change will depend on the person\u2019s age, county and health plan.\n\nIn addition, for many exchange customers \u2013 72,583 as of last month \u2013 the rate hikes won\u2019t translate directly into price changes because they receive federal subsidies to discount their premiums.\n\nInsurance premium costs have drawn particular attention in the wake of the federal health law, which made significant changes to insurance market rules, including requiring nearly all people to have coverage and prohibiting insurers from rejecting customers based on their medical history, starting in 2014.\n\nInsurers anticipated that those newly covered in 2014 would have higher health care costs because of pent-up medical needs that hadn\u2019t been addressed, but several carriers this year said they no longer anticipated a need to account for pent-up demand.\n\n\n\n2016 individual market insurance rate changes Insurers submitted rate proposals in April, but some submitted revised proposals. The table below shows those proposals and the final rates approved by the Connecticut Insurance Department. Three companies found to have proposed excessive rates must revise their proposals based on guidance from the department; in those cases, marked TBD, the final rates are expected to be lower than what was proposed. The rate changes listed here are averages, and will vary based on the specific plan; the range of changes within each company's plans is listed below. Some companies are listed multiple times because they sell plans under separate licenses or file separate rate proposals for their plans sold on and off the exchange. Company Original request Revised request Approved request Range People covered On/off exchange Aetna 5.60% NA 1.40% 0% to 3.8% 7,291 Off Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield 6.70% 4.70% TBD TBD 55,000 Both Celtic 15.95% NA 15.95% 15.95% 0 Off Cigna 14.27% NA 9.55% 3.4% to 24.7% 660 Off ConnectiCare Benefits Inc. 2% 0.70% -1.30% -7.0% to 3.3% 39,850 On ConnectiCare Inc. 5.20% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 435 Off ConnectiCare Insurance Co. 10.10% 9.80% TBD TBD 34,400 Off Golden Rule 18.50% NA TBD TBD 3,414 Off HealthyCT 13.96% 3.43% 7.20% -10.5% to 14.3% 23,485 Both UnitedHealthcare 32.90% NA 21.70% 3.2% to 30% 712 Off UnitedHealthcare 12.40% 11.40% 5.50% 0.5% to 14.5% 1,686 On Connecticut Insurance Department\n\nIn seeking rate hikes for 2016, carriers cited anticipated increases in the cost of care for members \u2013 either from members' using more services or more intensive types of care, or from higher prices for care or medication.\n\nIn six cases, the insurance department determined that the level of medical inflation the insurers built into their 2016 rates was too high, and approved rate changes based on lower figures.\n\nThat includes the three companies whose rate proposals were the subject of a July public hearing \u2013 Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ConnectiCare Insurance Company, and Golden Rule. The department deemed each request excessive and gave the carriers instructions on how to revise the rates, but did not calculate the size of the rate hikes that would generate. The carriers must recalculate based on the department\u2019s guidance and submit their rates by Sept. 3.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nFor the other proposals, the department approved specific changes. That included allowing a 5.5 percent average rate hike for UnitedHealthcare plans sold on the exchange, down from the 11.4 percent the company proposed; and a 1.4 percent average increase for Aetna plans sold outside the exchange, down from the company\u2019s 5.6 percent requested increase.\n\nState law allows the insurance regulator to reject rates deemed either excessive or inadequate \u2013 that is, unlikely to bring in enough in premiums to pay members\u2019 claims.\n\nIn requiring HealthyCT to raise rates by more than proposed, the department determined that the company had underestimated medical inflation and overestimated potential savings from initiatives intended to reduce costs or improve members' health. HealthyCT, now in its second year of selling plans, is a consumer operated and oriented plan, or CO-OP, created with funding made available through the federal health law.\n\nThe rate increase the department approved for HealthyCT \u2013 7.2 percent on average \u2013 is higher than the 3.43 percent the company proposed, but lower than the 13.96 percent rate hike the company originally sought in April. Carriers were allowed to revise their requests until late June, and several lowered their requests.\n\nIn a statement, HealthyCT CEO Ken Lalime said it wasn\u2019t yet clear how the decision would affect the company. \u201cConsumers in Connecticut can be sure that the Insurance Department was sensitive to their pricing needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to work with HealthyCT members to be sure that our products are working to provide value for them.\u201d\n\nAnother factor the department cited in requiring Anthem and ConnectiCare Insurance Company to revise their rates is the anticipated cost of a change to the state\u2019s mandated coverage for infertility. Beginning Jan. 1, insurers will no longer be able to limit those benefits to people under 40. ConnectiCare projected that change would add $1.14 to the monthly premium of each member, and Anthem projected a $2 increase, but the insurance department anticipates a lower cost and required the carriers to reduce the added monthly cost to 25 cents.\n\nThe two proposals that were approved unchanged were a 5.1 percent increase for ConnectiCare Inc., which has 435 members, and a 15.95 percent increase for Celtic Insurance, which has no current members.\n\nConnectiCare sells plans through three separately licensed companies, each of which has a separate risk pool and rate proposal.\n\nConnectiCare said in a statement Monday that the company typically does not comment before all filed rates are approved, and noted that some are still pending. \u201cWe are mindful of the impact rate increases have on our policyholders and we are doing everything possible to control costs,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe take our responsibility to control costs very seriously.\u201d\n\nThrough a spokeswoman, Anthem declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/29/regulator-lowers-most-proposed-health-insurance-rate-hikes/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, 2016 insurance rates, Access Health CT, Aetna, Affordable Care Act, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, connecticare, Golden Rule, healthyct, insurance", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/29/regulator-lowers-most-proposed-health-insurance-rate-hikes/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Most insurance companies selling health plans in the state\u2019s individual market will get to raise customers\u2019 premiums in 2016, but not by as much as they proposed, and one major carrier will have to lower its rates, according to decisions released by the Connecticut Insurance Department Saturday.", "title": "Regulator lowers most proposed health insurance rate hikes", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/29/regulator-lowers-most-proposed-health-insurance-rate-hikes/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/08/Katie-Wade.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/29/regulator-lowers-most-proposed-health-insurance-rate-hikes/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda861\"", "article_summary": "2016 individual market insurance rate changes Insurers submitted rate proposals in April, but some submitted revised proposals.\n\u201cConsumers in Connecticut can be sure that the Insurance Department was sensitive to their pricing needs,\u201d he said.\nOverall, the approved average rate changes range from ConnectiCare Benefits\u2019 1.3 percent decrease to a 21.7 percent increase for UnitedHealthcare plans sold outside the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\nThat includes the three companies whose rate proposals were the subject of a July public hearing \u2013 Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ConnectiCare Insurance Company, and Golden Rule.\nThose figures are averages; specific plans sold by each carrier could have higher or lower rate changes."}
