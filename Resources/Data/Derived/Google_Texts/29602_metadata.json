She added that the rallies were aimed at making young people aware that Valentine's Day is not part of Islamic culture.\n\nThe bans were imposed in many Indonesian cities. A similar rally by junior high school students was held in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.\n\nIn Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province, a noted Muslim youth group, Pemuda Muslimin Indonesia, called on Muslims in the province to stay away from the celebration.\n\nThe influential Indonesian Council of Clerics has repeatedly declared the Feb. 14 celebration as an observance stemming from another faith, saying that celebrating it would be the same as promoting faiths other than Islam.\n\nNearly 90 percent of Indonesia's 265 million people are Muslims, with most practicing a moderate form of the faith.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indonesian officials, clerics ban Valentine's Day observance - AP News: JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Officials and clerics in the world's .05/27/2016 0:40:48AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Officials and clerics in the world's most populous Muslim nation have", "title": "AP News - Indonesian officials, clerics ban Valentine's Day observance", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/02/14/indonesian-officials-clerics-ban-valentines-day-observance-n2119432", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\45\\96eba688-db6a-4be9-8106-363fd0a542f6.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Officials and clerics in the world's most populous Muslim nation have", "title": "AP News - Indonesian officials, clerics ban Valentine's Day observance", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/02/14/indonesian-officials-clerics-ban-valentines-day-observance-n2119432", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/45/96eba688-db6a-4be9-8106-363fd0a542f6.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Indonesian officials, clerics ban Valentine's Day observance, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Officials and clerics in the world's most populous Muslim nation have banned young Indonesian Muslims from celebrating Valentine's Day, arguing that the observance runs against Islamic teachings.\n\"The Valentine's Day celebration has become a culture,\" Illiza said.\nBanda Aceh's mayor, Illiza Sa'aduddin Djamal, and Shariah officials joined Saturday's rallies, held in four locations in the city's downtown area.\nIn Banda Aceh, the capital of the devout Muslim province of Aceh, thousands of high school students held rallies rejecting the celebration of Valentine's Day.\nShe added that the rallies were aimed at making young people aware that Valentine's Day is not part of Islamic culture."}
