Drug giant Merck & Co. agreed to buy antibiotics maker Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. for $8.4 billion.

The deal, which also includes the assumption of $1.1 billion in debt, is worth $102 a share, a 37% premium to Friday’s close.

Cubist US:CBST specializes in drugs to treat infectious diseases and other conditions, primarily in a hospital setting. Its flagship drug is Cubicin, an intravenous antibiotic used to treat serious infections that had $967 million in sales in 2013. Analysts expect sales of the drug will continue to rise in coming years.

Merck’s MRK, -0.32% interest in Cubist appears to stem from a strategy announced in 2013 to narrow its focus to areas including diabetes, acute hospital care, vaccines and oncology.

Merck has an aging drug portfolio and its top selling product, diabetes treatment Januvia, isn’t growing like it used to. The company recently got a cancer immunotherapy called Keytruda approved. In August, Merck acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc., a developer of hepatitis C drugs, for about $3.9 billion.
