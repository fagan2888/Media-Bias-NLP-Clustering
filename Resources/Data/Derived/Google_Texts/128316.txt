A civilian rescued two people after their boat flipped over on the Navesink River Monday morning, police said.

Authorities responded to an overturned boat after 11 a.m., Red Bank Police Chief Darren McConnell confirmed. A civilian was already on the scene and rescued two people who fell into the water within 15 minutes.

They made it back to shore, after which emergency personnel treated the victims for exposure to the cold, McConnell said.

The Coast Guard is on the river recovering the boat, McConnell said. It is unclear at this time what caused the boat to flip over. McConnell said he did have additional information at this time.
