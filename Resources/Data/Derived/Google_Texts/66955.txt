Rest assured Zendaya isn’t losing a wink of sleep over critics who were against the casting choice of the actress/singer/dancer as Aaliyah in the upcoming biopic. She’s too busy working.

The star took to Twitter to announce that she will be the new face of pop icon Madonna’s Material Girl fashion line:

“So honored to be chosen by Madonna and her amazing daughter Lola as the new face of Material Girl!…”

The 17-year-old will be featured in the line’s “Boardwalk Babe” campaign, showcasing her playful side on Brooklyn’s Coney Island. She recently told Access Hollywood the brand was a good match for her own personal style:

“I like the fact that it’s affordable, but it’s still edgy and cool.” “I just think it was a perfect fit for me and my personal style.”

Madonna shared in a press release the reason behind her decision:

“Zendaya exudes a confident, free spirit. We love having her as the new face of Material Girl.”

Her daughter Lourdes Leon added:

“I love how Zendaya makes her own style rules to fit her personality — that’s who Material Girl is all about, being yourself to the fullest.”

Lourdes will also model for Material Girl.

Taylor Momsen and Georgia May Jagger have modeled for Material Girl in the past.

Say what you want about Zendaya’s acting and singing, but the girl can dress her behind off. Judging by her Instagram posts, I’m surprised that some fashion line hasn’t scooped her up until now. The girl is definitely winning and I would guess we’ll probably be seeing her face all over the place soon.
