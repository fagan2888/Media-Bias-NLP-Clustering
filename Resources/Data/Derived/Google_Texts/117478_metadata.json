Everyone\u2019s favorite freckled redhead is set to die in an upcoming issue of Life with Archie, after sacrificing himself for a friend.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that Archie is gone forever. The Life with Archie series is based upon theoretical future storylines of Archie after graduating from Riverdale High School, where he has been perpetually stuck since 1941. The bumbling teenager held dear by comic fans for decades will still live on in the \u201cpresent day\u201d comics.\n\nArchie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater spoke with CNN, explaining why they started the new series.\n\n\u201cMost fans are familiar with Archie as a high schooler, hanging out at Pop\u2019s Chocklit Shop with his friends. \u2018Life With Archie\u2019 shows what happens when Archie becomes an adult and starts dealing with grownup issues.\u201d\n\nEach issue of the series is split into two storylines to give readers a look into his future with both Betty and Veronica, but this will change in the summer. \u201cThe final issue, however, will show readers Archie\u2019s final fate in both timelines \u2014 and they\u2019re the same.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why kill off Archie Andrews at all, Goldwater said it seemed like a natural conclusion.\n\n\u201cHe dies saving the life of a friend, and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us \u2014 the best of us. Our strengths and our faults.\u201d\n\nKnowing the sensitivity of the event, Goldwater defends the decision.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a random one-off or \u2018what-if\u2019 story that we\u2019re doing as a gag. This is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought. This is the death of Archie as we see it, and we\u2019re treating it with that same level of gravitas and import. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we are being very considerate about it.\u201d\n\nGoldwater hopes that fans will be intrigued by the news and that it will inspire people to pick up the issue this July. \u201cAs a company, we are not afraid to take risks. We\u2019re not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we\u2019re building here at Archie.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Archie Comics introduced the series\u2019 first regular gay character with Kevin Kellar. An issue that showed Kellar kissing another male character was protested against when One Million Moms requested that Life with Archie Issue #16 not be displayed near check-out lines. The issue sold so well that a second print run was ordered.\n\nWhat do you think about good ol\u2019 Arch biting the dust? Is it truly the natural conclusion and will you be picking up the issue of Life with Archie in July?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everyone's favorite freckled redhead is set to die in an upcoming issue of Life with Archie, after sacrificing himself for a friend.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Everyone\u2019s favorite freckled redhead is set to die in an upcoming issue of Life with Archie, after sacrificing himself for a friend.", "title": "Archie Andrews\u2019 Death Was The \u2018Natural Conclusion\u2019 Says Archie Comics CEO", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1206600/archie-andrews-death-was-the-natural-conclusion-says-archie-comics-ceo/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Archie-Death.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-09T19:19:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-09T19:35:02+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Archie-Death.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-04-09T19:19:02+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "archie andrews,jon goldwater,archie comics,life with archie,entertainment", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Archie-Death.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Everyone\u2019s favorite freckled redhead is set to die in an upcoming issue of Life with Archie, after sacrificing himself for a friend."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1efa\"", "article_summary": "Is it truly the natural conclusion and will you be picking up the issue of Life with Archie in July?\nThe Life with Archie series is based upon theoretical future storylines of Archie after graduating from Riverdale High School, where he has been perpetually stuck since 1941.\nFor fans of iconic comic book character Archie Andrews, something big is coming.\nArchie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater spoke with CNN, explaining why they started the new series.\nEveryone\u2019s favorite freckled redhead is set to die in an upcoming issue of Life with Archie, after sacrificing himself for a friend."}
