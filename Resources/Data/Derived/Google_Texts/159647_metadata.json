Hatch of Utah became chairman of the Finance Committee overseeing the federal tax code. As the chamber\u2019s longest-serving Republican, Mr. Hatch, 80, is also Senate president pro tempore \u2014 third in the line of presidential succession after the vice president and the speaker of the House.\n\nAs Republicans struggled to pass a Homeland Security budget on Friday, Mr. Hatch sat down to discuss taxes, trade and the 2016 race for president. What follows is an edited transcript of the conversation.\n\nQ: If something as vital as Homeland Security can\u2019t get funded in an orderly manner, how could you ever dream to get something as difficult as tax reform through the Congress?\n\nHATCH: I think it will get funded. But tax reform is very difficult. It took three years to do the \u201986 bill. It\u2019s much more difficult today than it was then. There\u2019s much more bitterness and partisanship. We\u2019ve got to overcome those things. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to overcome them.\n\nQ: Dave Camp, the former chairman of House Ways and Means, last year laid out a tax reform proposal. Does that look to you like a decent road map?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHATCH: There were some very good concepts in that bill \u2014 a revenue neutral bill that would\u2019ve put us on a path towards balancing the budget. The consumption tax does appeal to me, because you determine how much you pay by what you buy. If you\u2019re going to buy a Cadillac, you\u2019re going to pay more in taxes. The problem with the consumption tax is that it leads to value-added taxes that can be easily added on by a profligate Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s probably going to take longer than two years. The president said he\u2019s interested in a business tax bill. That\u2019s easy to say. I\u2019ve suggested to them, \u201csend us up a bill that you believe will solve that problem.\u201d So far, nothing.\n\nQ: The administration\u2019s corporate tax proposal for mandatory repatriation of overseas profits with the taxes being used for infrastructure \u2014 is that dead?\n\nHATCH: It\u2019s pretty well dead. That\u2019s a one-time shot. That\u2019s not the way to try and solve our problems. He wants to tax the monies again that have already been taxed in the foreign countries in order to bring them back. The corporate world\u2019s not stupid. They\u2019re not going to do that. And neither are we.\n\nQ: How close are you to a deal with Ron Wyden on trade promotion authority?\n\nHATCH: We have given him transparency language and a number of other things. Some of the demands that are being made are demands that we can\u2019t meet. What I\u2019m not for is making trade promotion authority something that anybody can stop. If you start playing around with that, no country in the world\u2019s going to want to deal with us.\n\nVideo\n\nQ: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s got a lot of clout in the Democratic caucus. Do you think she, and the populists on your side who don\u2019t like trade, have enough juice to stop the Trans-Pacific deal?\n\nHATCH: No, I don\u2019t. If we have some reasonable Democrats who understand that we need to engage in free trade, we\u2019ll have enough.\n\nQ: If the Supreme Court in King v. Burwell strikes down those federal subsidies, what are you going to do for those residents of Utah who signed up for health coverage on the belief that they\u2019re going to get federal subsidies?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHATCH: We\u2019re going to have to have an approach that will take care of that. It\u2019s not going to be some simple approach that just leads us into more spending, costs, taxes, bureaucratic ensnarlments. I\u2019ve been in meetings all week on, \u201cHow do we resolve this problem?\u201d The Democrats are going to just say, \u201cLet\u2019s just keep Obamacare going.\u201d Obamacare is going to bankrupt the country. Once people get hooked on it, the only answer is to move this country to socialism. If anybody really believes that socialism\u2019s a better system than our free market system, they\u2019re nuts.\n\nQ: As a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, do you agree with Eric Holder that there should be a lower standard of proof in civil rights cases given how difficult it\u2019s been to achieve prosecutions in cases like Trayvon Martin\u2019s?\n\nHATCH: No. Our laws are pretty tough. I don\u2019t think you need to lower the bar. It\u2019s not difficult to bring civil rights cases. But you have to have the facts on your side. They didn\u2019t have any real facts on their side under the circumstances.\n\nQ: You were one of the young hotheads in the Republican caucus. Now I read in National Review about the G.O.P.\u2019s \u201cOrrin Hatch Problem\u201d \u2014 how you\u2019ve become a go-along, get-along moderate. How did that happen?\n\nHATCH: It\u2019s funny, they come to me when they really get in trouble. I think a lot of it is being reasonable and not taking these positions that are really too far to the right. I don\u2019t think anybody can sincerely say that Orrin Hatch has left the conservative cause. But we\u2019ve got a small segment \u2014 they\u2019re not really Republicans, they\u2019re independents who are so far to the right that they don\u2019t see anything good in working with the people on the left at all.\n\nQ: At CPAC yesterday, Ted Cruz said, \u201cthe real divide is not between Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s between career politicians in Washington and the people who those career politicians ignore.\u201d Is he right?\n\nHATCH: That\u2019s kind of a clich\u00e9. I don\u2019t think anybody wants to be a career politician. I\u2019ve never considered this a job. I didn\u2019t need this. I think if you ask him directly, \u201cDoes that mean Orrin Hatch?\u201d \u2014 if he says, \u201cYes,\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cTough. Tough crap, buddy.\u201d\n\nQ: You have three Senate colleagues running for president \u2014 Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz. Would all three be outstanding presidents who you\u2019d be delighted to be your party\u2019s nominee?\n\nHATCH: I don\u2019t think that senators have much chance of running for president. The reason is, if they\u2019re doing their job, they can\u2019t run. If they don\u2019t do their job, then that\u2019ll be used against them. We have at least five really outstanding governors. Any one of them would make a better president than what we have right now, or what the Democrats are likely to put up in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150301200039, "twitter": {"description": "The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is a key figure in efforts at revising the tax code, but he says partisanship will be an obstacle.", "title": "10 Questions for Senator Orrin Hatch", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/us/politics/10-questions-for-senator-orrin-hatch.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003543702"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "JohnJHarwood", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/02/us/02harwood-web/02harwood-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/us/politics/10-questions-for-senator-orrin-hatch.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003543702", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/us/politics/10-questions-for-senator-orrin-hatch.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "March 1, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Senate Committee on Finance", "keywords": "United States Politics and Government,Federal Taxes (US),Republican Party,Senate,Senate Committee on Finance,Hatch  Orrin G", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "John Harwood", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Hatch, Orrin G", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JOHN HARWOOD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is a key figure in efforts at revising the tax code, but he says partisanship will be an obstacle.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/02/us/02harwood-web/02harwood-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is a key figure in efforts at revising the tax code, but he says partisanship will be an obstacle.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/john_harwood/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-03-02", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Hatch, Orrin G", "published": "2015-03-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "02harwood", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150302030609, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/us/politics/10-questions-for-senator-orrin-hatch.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/02/us/02harwood-web/02harwood-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is a key figure in efforts at revising the tax code, but he says partisanship will be an obstacle.", "title": "10 Questions for Senator Orrin Hatch"}, "pdate": 20150301, "des": "Federal Taxes (US)", "articleid": 100000003543702, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "10 Questions for Senator Orrin Hatch", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/02/us/02harwood-web/02harwood-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t think anybody can sincerely say that Orrin Hatch has left the conservative cause.\nI think if you ask him directly, \u201cDoes that mean Orrin Hatch?\u201d \u2014 if he says, \u201cYes,\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cTough.\nHATCH: I don\u2019t think that senators have much chance of running for president.\nPhotoWhen Republicans recaptured the Senate last fall, Orrin G.
