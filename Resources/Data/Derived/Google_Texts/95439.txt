The Los Angeles Times quotes a U.S. official who says President Obama wants an attack "just muscular enough not to get mocked."

"They are looking at what is just enough to mean something, just enough to be more than symbolic."

And there you have the Obama foreign policy reduced to a bumper sticker: "Don't mock me, bro!"

But how can we not mock a president who says he's "made the decision" that military action against Assad is a moral imperative and essential to U.S. security; and that he's "made a second decision" to not make a decision but to wait for Congress to decide.

A president making these two completely contradictory statements is bad. But to make them in the same speech?

No wonder Jimmy Carter is smiling.
