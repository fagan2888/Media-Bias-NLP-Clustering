For a year, he played for the Blue Devils. Then, he transferred to Syracuse. Despite choosing to bring him in, Orange coach Jim Boeheim was not impressed.\n\n\u201cI had only seen him one time and I didn\u2019t like him at all,\u201d Boeheim said earlier in the week. \u201cAnd then he went to Duke, and I really didn\u2019t think that was \u2014 that he was that good to be honest with you, because he couldn\u2019t shoot and he was not really a guard.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Memories of unhappy endings in Chicago for Tony Bennett, Jim Boeheim\n\nSyracuse assistant coach Adrian Autry convinced Boeheim that Gbinije was worth a chance.\n\nAutry was right. Gbnije averaged 17.8 points this season. He shot 47.3 percent from the field and 40.6 percent from behind the 3-point line. He\u2019s the best player on a Syracuse team that has surprised throughout the tournament.\n\nVirginia coach Tony Bennett had more faith in Gbinije than Boeheim did at first.\n\nSEE ALSO: Virginia is one step from the Final Four because it opened with force\n\n\u201cWe tried to recruit him real hard, so we know how good he is,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe\u2019s really been a key and led that team and taken them obviously to this point, which is special.\u201d\n\nBoeheim\u2019s comments about Gbnije circled back to him. On Saturday, the senior was asked what his reaction was the first time Boeheim told him he didn\u2019t think he was very good.\n\n\u201cNext question,\u201d Gbinije said with a smile.\n\n\u201cI tell him that a lot in full \u2014 I forgot the word now,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cFull disclosure, yeah. I wasn\u2019t that good in English. But full disclosure, I told him that a lot the first year, I think. That\u2019s fair to say, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair, yeah,\u201d Gbinije said.\n\nThe season Gbinije sat out he worked to get in better shape. He needed to be better handling the ball, so he practiced that daily. Each year he has been on the floor since, his numbers have gone up. His field-goal percent is up 9.3 percent from his first season with Syracuse. His scoring average has grown by 14.4 points. He adds two steals, four assists and four rebounds per game. Boeheim is so high on Gbinije now, that he argued on Saturday that his value is comparable to that of ACC player of the year and Virginia point guard Malcolm Brogdon.\n\n\u201cI like Malcolm Brogdon,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cI think he was the best player in the league this year, but I think you could make a case for Michael for being as valuable to his team as Malcolm is, and in fact, I think that Virginia has been able to overcome Malcolm having a bad game. We really can\u2019t overcome Michael having a bad game. His numbers, what he\u2019s done, speak for themselves. He led the league in steals, four rebounds, four assists, shot 42 percent from the three-point line, 47 from the field. He\u2019s our best defensive player.\n\n\u201cThose awards \u2014 and I tell the players this all the time. The Player of the Year, first-team league, always goes to the top-four teams in the league. That\u2019s where it goes. And I don\u2019t have a dispute with that at all. But Mike has been as valuable as anybody this year for his team.\u201d\n\nGbinije was an offensive problem for the Cavaliers in their lone game against Syracuse this season. He scored 24 points on 13 shots. Of his 13 shots, nine were 3-point attempts. His four steals countered his four turnovers. Only three other times this season did Gbinije score 24 points or more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tony Bennett tried to convince Gbinije, a Richmond native, to come to Charlottesville.
