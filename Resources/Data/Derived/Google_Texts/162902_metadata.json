According to UCSD, the injury must be between the seventh and 12th thoracic vertebrae.\n\n\"The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of transplanting neural stem cells into the spine for what one day could be a treatment for spinal cord injuries,\" said Dr. Joseph Ciacci, the study's principal investigator and a neurosurgeon at UC San Diego Health System. \"The study's immediate goal, however, is to determine whether injecting these neural stem cells into the spine of patients with spinal cord injury is safe.\"\n\nThe doctors also want to know how long the transplanted stem cells will last, and whether drugs designed to prevent rejection by the immune system are effective, according to UCSD Health.\n\nThe researchers will also look for possible changes in motor and sensory function, bowel and bladder function, and pain levels.\n\nThe stem cells were tested in laboratory rats by Ciacci and Dr. Martin Marsala, of the UC San Diego School of Medicine. They detected signs of improved motor function with minimal side effects. The cells have also been tested for safety in human patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \u2014 commonly known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease.\n\nUCSD cautioned prospective test subjects that since human tests are just beginning, unforeseen risks, complications or unpredictable outcomes are possible.\n\nThe clinical trial at UC San Diego Health System is funded by Neuralstem Inc. and was launched and supported by the UC San Diego Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center. The center was recently created to \"advance leading-edge stem cell medicine and science, protect and counsel patients, and accelerate innovative stem cell research into patient diagnostics and therapy,\" according to UCSD.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The study will take place over five years and will test of the safety of a new treatment involving neural stem cells.", "author": "City News Service", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "The study will take place over five years and will test of the safety of a new treatment involving neural stem cells.", "title": "UCSD Looking For Spinal Cord Injury Patients To Test Stem Cell Treatment", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/aug/12/ucsd-looking-spinal-cord-injury-patients-test-stem/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static/kpbs/images/homepage/logo.gif", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "141912 %##% UCSD Looking For Spinal Cord Injury Patients To Test Stem Cell Treatment", "keywords": "CNS, Health, Conditions and Diseases", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "The clinical trial at UC San Diego Health System is funded by Neuralstem Inc. and was launched and supported by the UC San Diego Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center.\n\"The study's immediate goal, however, is to determine whether injecting these neural stem cells into the spine of patients with spinal cord injury is safe.\"\nThe UC San Diego Health System put out a call Monday for eight spinal cord injury patients to take part in a five-year test of the safety of a new treatment involving neural stem cells.\nThe stem cells were tested in laboratory rats by Ciacci and Dr. Martin Marsala, of the UC San Diego School of Medicine.\nThe center was recently created to \"advance leading-edge stem cell medicine and science, protect and counsel patients, and accelerate innovative stem cell research into patient diagnostics and therapy,\" according to UCSD."}
