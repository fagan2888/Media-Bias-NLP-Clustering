Hearing the girls trying to speak their language again made me want to learn again, and I started remembering.\u201d\n\nHer daughter, Jennifer Malone, explains how Wilcox would write words on whatever scraps of paper she had lying around.\n\n\u201cI was very surprised that she could remember all that,\u201d Malone says in the vide. \u201cShe just started writing down her words on envelopes and papers.\u201d\n\nWilcox gathered those scraps of paper up and started typing them slowly into a computer to create a Wukchumni dictionary. It took Wilcox and Malone about seven years to complete the dictionary. Now, Wilcox\u2019s great-grandson, Donovan Treglown, is helping her record the dictionary.\n\nEven Wilcox isn\u2019t sure what the future holds for her language.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m uncertain about my language and who wants to keep it alive, just a few\u2014it\u2019s sad,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seems weird that I am the last one. It\u2019ll just be gone one of these days maybe, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBut she isn\u2019t alone, the tribe uses the dictionary Wilcox and her daughter created for weekly language classes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent short documentary by Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee for the New York Times profiles Marie Wilcox, of the Wukchumni, who is trying to save her language.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/24/video-last-fluent-wukchumni-speaker-fights-save-her-language-156527", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/marie-wilcox-new-york-times.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Video: Last Fluent Wukchumni Speaker Fights to Save Her Language"}, "abstract": "A recent short documentary by Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee for the New York Times profiles Marie Wilcox, of the Wukchumni, who is trying to save her language.", "dc": {"title": "Video: Last Fluent Wukchumni Speaker Fights to Save Her Language"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/24/video-last-fluent-wukchumni-speaker-fights-save-her-language-156527", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native American Languages, Language Preservation, California", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 3}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-24T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Video: Last Fluent Wukchumni Speaker Fights to Save Her Language"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019ll just be gone one of these days maybe, I don\u2019t know.\u201dBut she isn\u2019t alone, the tribe uses the dictionary Wilcox and her daughter created for weekly language classes.\n\u201cI left my Indian language behind when my grandma died,\u201d she says in the video.\nA recent short documentary by Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee for the New York Times profiles Marie Wilcox, of the Wukchumni, a Yokuts Tribe native to Central California.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t speak the language anymore until my sisters started to teach the kids.\nWilcox, who was born on Thanksgiving Day in 1933, grew up speaking mostly Wukchumni."}
