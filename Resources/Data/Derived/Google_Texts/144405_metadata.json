Researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation published a study that identifies the 10 regional markets in the United States where health insurance costs are the cheapest.\n\nPathology groups and medical laboratories serving these 10 regions are thus probably getting paid less fee-for-service reimbursement than in other more expensive regions of the United States. The study shows how variable the cost of the same healthcare insurance plan can be from one city to the next across the nation.\n\nRankings Based on Lowest Cost of a Silver Plan\n\nThe Kaiser study focused on the lowest cost for the Silver plan in a region. These Silver plans are offered by health insurance exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nAccording the report, published by Kaiser Health News, most consumers are choosing the Silver plan, which is a mid-range option. The other plans are called Bronze, Gold, and Platinum.\n\nBoth the Kaiser study, and another study also released in February, determined that Minnesota is one of the cheapest states for health insurance. In its report, the Minnesota Department of Commerce certified that \u201cMinnesota\u2019s rates for health insurance policies available through MNsure, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace, starting October 1, 2013, are confirmed as the lowest rates compared with the other states that have released rates, including the District of Columbia\u2014across all metal levels.\u201d\n\nAnd true to a lesson from a marketing 101 class, the cheapest health insurance costs\u2014as measured by insurance premiums\u2014are found in communities where there is intense competition among providers. The Kaiser study noted that when multiple hospitals and doctors vie for business, health insurance companies usually lower rates.\n\nIn fact, healthcare consumers in managed care-haven Minnesota, northwestern Pennsylvania and Tucson, Arizona, are getting \u201cthe best bargains from the health care law\u2019s new insurance marketplaces,\u201d reported Kaiser Health News in its summary of the 10 least expensive health insurance markets in the U.S..\n\nThe Affordable Care Act created state marketplaces. Each state\u2019s health insurance exchange offers consumers health insurance organized by level of care: bronze, silver, gold and platinum with the latter offering the most coverage and the former the least.\n\nKaiser Family Foundation researchers ranked least expensive health insurance markets by the lowest-cost Silver premium for a 40-year-old. The lowest monthly Silver premium in the nation is $154 in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.\n\nRanking of 10 Least Expensive Health Insurance Markets\n\nThe table below, showing areas and counties, ranks the 10 least expensive U.S. health insurance markets, as reported by Kaiser Health News.\n\n$154; Minneapolis-St. Paul, as well as Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, Sherburne and Washington counties. $164; Pittsburgh and Northwestern Pennsylvania, including Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Crawford, Erie, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, McKean, Mercer, Warren, Washington and Westmoreland counties. $166; Middle Minnesota, including Benton, Stearns and Wright counties. $167; Tucson, Arizona, as well as Pima County. $171; Northwestern Minnesota, including Clearwater, Kittson, Mahnomen, Marshall, Norman, Pennington, Polk and Red Lake counties. $173; Salt Lake City, as well as Davis and Salt Lake counties. $176; Hawaii. $180; Knoxville, Tennessee, as well as Anderson, Blount, Campbell, Claiborne, Cocke, Grainger, Hamblen, Jefferson, Knox, Loudon, Monroe, Morgan, Roane, Scott, Sevier & Union. $180; Western and North Central Minnesota, including Aitkin, Becker, Beltrami, Big Stone, Cass, Chippewa, Clay, Crow Wing, Douglas, Grant, Hubbard, Isanti, Kanabec, Kandiyohi, Lac qui Parle, Lyon, McLeod, Meeker, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Otter Tail, Pine, Pope, Renville, Roseau, Sibley, Stevens, Swift, Todd, Traverse, Wadena Wilkin and Yellow Medicine counties (Chisago County\u2019s lowest premium is $162). $181; Chattanooga, Tennessee, as well as Bledsoe, Bradley, Franklin, Grundy, Hamilton, Marion, McMinn, Meigs, Polk, Rhea and Sequatchie counties.\n\nCharacteristics of Least Expensive Health Insurance Market\n\nAs to its ranking as the state with the lowest insurance rates in most of its territories, Minnesota officials credit the state\u2019s managed care experience, health-reform history and Commerce Department\u2019s insurance rate review process, according to a news release from the state\u2019s Commerce Department.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s rate review process is one of 31 states in the country that can deny rates requested by insurance companies based upon whether the rates are justified. The process works, the news release said, as Commerce Department actuaries conduct statistical analyses and \u201cclosely scrutinize the assumptions that health insurance companies use to develop rates.\u201d\n\nConsumers Share Views on Health Insurance Premiums\n\nIn yet a third recently released report\u2014this one published by the Urban Institute Health Policy Center\u2014the public\u2019s perceptions of the ACA were studied. The Health Reform Monitoring Survey was conducted just before the launch of the ACA\u2019s marketplaces. It surveyed people age 18 to 64 on issues including their views on insurance coverage premiums. The study revealed that:\n\n\u2022 36.4% of respondents expect to be worse-off in 2014 in terms of health insurance premiums.\n\n\u2022 34.1% of people surveyed expect to be worse-off in regard to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThese findings provide an appropriate segue to an upcoming Dark Daily, addressing the most expensive health insurance markets in the U.S.\n\nFor pathologists, medical technologists, and other clinical laboratory leaders and professionals, health insurance marketplace issues are important to understand. Lessons can be learned from regions like Minnesota, Salt Lake City and Hawaii. These are areas where either competition or collaboration among primary-care providers and specialists have contributed to regional markets where consumers with health insurance may perceive they are getting the most healthcare value and choice, at prices much less than in other areas of the United States.\n\n\u2014Donna Marie Pocius\n\nRelated Information:\n\nThe 10 Least Expensive Health Insurance Markets in the U.S.\n\nAffordable Care Act & Health Insurance Marketplace\n\nCommerce Department Releases Rate Analysis\u2014Minnesota Retains the Number One Rates in the Country\n\nExpectations for Health Care Quality, Access, and Costs in 2014", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, 10 lowest-price markets for health insurance, silver plan, kaiser family foundation, laboratory news, kaiser health news, states, health reform, insurance, health costs, affordable care act, marketplace, minnesota, kaiser health foundation, mnsure, minnesota department of commerce, michael rothman,10 lowest-price markets for health insurance,affordable care act,clinical laboratory,health costs,health reform,insurance,kaiser family foundation,kaiser health foundation,kaiser health news,laboratory news,marketplace,medical laboratory,michael rothman,minnesota,minnesota department of commerce,mnsure,silver plan,states,laboratory hiring & human resources,laboratory management and operations,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology,management & operations", "description": "Are you lucky to live in one of the nation\u2019s 10 lowest-cost markets for health insurance?
