Xavier Becerra last week commended the health care provider for decades of work to ensure residents in low-income communities have access to quality health care.\n\nHis remarks came during an event celebrating National Health Center Week (NHCW), an annual observance to recognize community health centers that deliver comprehensive, preventive and primary healthcare to patients regardless of issues such as ability to pay or legal status.\n\nOur clinics are for the community and by the community, said Arroyo Vista Board President Roger Estrada during last week\u2019s event. He called Becerra a champion of healthcare and said the nonprofit is honored to have the congressman\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cPlaces like this one is where families can come, even if they don\u2019t qualify for health insurance or federal assistance,\u201d Becerra said, pointing out there is still much work to be done on the issue of access.\n\n\u201cWe want every single person in this country, regardless of their [immigration] status, to have an opportunity to have health care,\u201d Becerra said.\n\nThe Arroyo Vista healthcare network includes five community health clinics and a mobile clinic. In the greater Northeast L.A. area alone, clinics serve over 25,000 people a year, according to Arroyo Vista spokesperson Irene Holguin.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to offer access to high quality, comprehensive and affordable healthcare services,\u201d she said.\n\nAn outgrowth of the Health Center Program that started in 1965 with just two clinics \u2014 one in Mississippi, the other in South Boston \u2014 Arroyo Vista is one of 1,300 health centers today providing primary health care to nearly 23 million underserved individuals across the country.\n\nProviding healthcare to children is one of the most important reasons these clinics exists, Becerra told EGP. He said too many families and individuals still struggle with whether \u201cthey can take their son or daughter to the doctor or to the hospital\u201d because of the cost.\n\nBecerra said he was \u201clucky\u201d growing up because his father had a union job that included health coverage, so his family of seven never worried about healthcare. \u201cEverybody should be able to say the same,\u201d he said.\n\nArroyo Vista and other community clinics are a safety net for low-income families and individuals, whether legally in the country or not. They provide a range of medical, dental, and other healthcare services, such as optometry, imaging and access to medications, often at no or very little cost. Arroyo Vista\u2019s health fairs offer free health screenings and education, flu vaccines and childhood immunizations.\n\nAccording to Becerra, healthcare ranks high on his list of priorities, right next to education.\n\n\u201cJust because you work hard and earn less, that doesn\u2019t mean you should be treated differently,\u201d Becerra said. Not being able to take off work when you are ill because you can\u2019t afford to miss a day\u2019s pay in unacceptable, he said. It\u2019s even harder if you are undocumented, Becerra said.\n\nThe congressman voted for the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, signed into law in 2010. The law, intended to lower the number of medically uninsured in the U.S., mandates levels of care to be provided by health insurers and provides wider access to affordable healthcare insurance through both public and private providers.\n\nJohn Sawyer, director of federal affairs with the National Association of Community Health Centers, said his group is very proud to be working hand in hand with the congressman to provide resources to clinics that are seeing droves of \u201cnew people coming as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nWithout federal funding, clinics wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle all the people, Becerra told EGP. \u201cThey would\u2019ve had to cut some of the doctors and nurses or tell some of the people \u2018you can\u2019t come,\u2019\u201d Becerra said. \u201cOr they would\u2019ve had to charge a lot of people more than what they could afford,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether the healthcare battle will be resolved by the 2016 presidential elections is unclear, but according to Becerra, Congress has to work out a solution because it is \u201cembarrassing\u201d that the U.S. is still \u201cthe only industrialized nation in the world that does not offer all its people affordable healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came a lot closer with the Affordable Care Act; 17 million families now have insurance and they can walk into a facility with dignity\u2026[but] we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Becerra said.\n\n\u201cIt took more than 40 years to get ACA done, how quickly will we perfect this? Who knows, but we will continue working on it.\u201d\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"distribution": "global", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "robots": "follow, all", "language": "en, sv"}, "article_summary": "Our clinics are for the community and by the community, said Arroyo Vista Board President Roger Estrada during last week\u2019s event.\nThe Arroyo Vista healthcare network includes five community health clinics and a mobile clinic.\n\u201cWe want every single person in this country, regardless of their [immigration] status, to have an opportunity to have health care,\u201d Becerra said.\nArroyo Vista and other community clinics are a safety net for low-income families and individuals, whether legally in the country or not.\nCommunity Clinics Vital, Says BecerraCongressman salutes work of local provider."}
