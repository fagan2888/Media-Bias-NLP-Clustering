Context always matters. Let us not forget, however, why context matters: It is a tool for understanding the terms of the law, not an excuse for rewriting them\u2026 Far from offering the overwhelming evidence of meaning needed to justify the Court\u2019s interpretation, other contextual clues undermine it at every turn. To begin with, other parts of the Act sharply distinguish between the establishment of an Exchange by a State and the establishment of an Exchange by the Federal Government\u2026.Provisions such as these destroy any pretense that a federal Exchange is in some sense also established by a State\u2026\n\nThe Court has not come close to presenting the compelling contextual case necessary to justify departing from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the law. Quite the contrary, context only underscores the outlandishness of the Court\u2019s interpretation. Reading the Act as a whole leaves no doubt about the matter: \u201cExchange established by the State\u201d means what it looks like it means.\n\nJustice Scalia says it was the job of Congress to fix the law, not the court\u2019s (pages 19, 20):\n\nRather than rewriting the law under the pretense of interpreting it, the Court should have left it to Congress to decide what to do about the Act\u2019s limitation of tax credits to state Exchanges\u2026The Court\u2019s insistence on making a choice that should be made by Congress both aggrandizes judicial power and encourages congressional lassitude.\n\nOn the consequences of the court\u2019s decision (page 20):\n\nJust ponder the significance of the Court\u2019s decision to take matters into its own hands. The Court\u2019s revision of the law authorizes the Internal Revenue Service to spend tens of billions of dollars every year in tax credits on federal Exchanges. It affects the price of insurance for millions of Americans. It diminishes the participation of the States in the implementation of the Act. It vastly expands the reach of the Act\u2019s individual mandate, whose scope depends in part on the availability of credits\u2026.\n\nThe dissent accuses the majority of playing favorites with the law (pages 20, 21):", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Supreme Court's decision to uphold Affordable Care Act health-insurance subsidies purchased by lower-income Americans across the country drew a scathing response from Justice Antonin Scalia.
