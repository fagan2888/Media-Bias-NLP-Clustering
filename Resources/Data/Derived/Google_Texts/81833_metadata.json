Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are making a movie about sisterhood and are hosting the Golden Globes, again, while Abbi and Ilana\u2019s platonic love affair, both on \u201cBroad City\u201d and in real life, feels more genuine than anything else on TV this year. Perhaps most famously, Taylor Swift has renounced her search for Prince Charming (sort of) in favor of assembling an all-female BFF-army that would make the Spice Girls quake in their platforms. But perhaps the greatest female relationship the world has witnessed in 2014 is the alliance of Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9. With the release of the \u201cFlawless\u201d remix, and yesterday\u2019s \u201cFeeling Myself,\u201d this year has gifted us with one of the greatest and most unlikely female team-ups in the biz.\n\nI say unlikely, because neither Nicki nor Beyonc\u00e9 is historically known for their willingness to share the stage with other women. While both are feminist icons, they both come across as guys\u2019 girls: Nicki will happily share a track with Drake or Lil\u2019 Wayne, but most of her interactions with other famous women involve throwing shade (the handy resource \u201cWiki Minaj\u201d lists 85 male collaborators compared to 27 females). Beyonc\u00e9, meanwhile, has been something of an island since her notoriously fraught Destiny\u2019s Child partnership, and all the artists she shared a track with on \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u201d \u2014 Drake, Jay Z, Frank Ocean \u2014 were guys (Blue Ivy\u2019s cooing and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s TED talk excerpt not withstanding). While both Nicki and Beyonc\u00e9 pay lip service to female solidarity, each simultaneously projects an aura of holier-than-thou detachment. It\u2019s no coincidence that both have co-opted the label \u201cQueen\u201d \u2014 their cultural vantage points are those of women elevated on a royal pedestals, separate from the average chicks below.\n\nThis has been an unusual year for female collaborations in a professional sense: As New York Magazine music critic Lindsay Zoladz pointed out in a piece earlier this year, this was the year the female buddy anthem came into its own: Iggy Azalea and Charli XCX\u2019s \u201cFancy,\u201d Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cProblem,\u201d Ariana Grande, Jessie J. and Minaj\u2019s \u201cBang Bang,\u201d etc. This wave of girl-power tracks is particularly unusual because of how rare these sorts of collaborations have been historically. As Zoladz writes, \u201cThe preferred pronoun is I rather than we; self-empowerment is held as a higher virtue than solidarity; the most blissful fantasy is the one where you feel like the only girl in the world.\u201d And the Nicki/Beyonc\u00e9 team-up might be the most significant of all, simply because of the power each wields: These women are the two most important female figures in the male-dominated hip hop industry, and instead of competing with each other, they\u2019ve joined forces, working to bring out the best in each other (As Nicki described Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s directions to her while recording the \u201cFlawless\u201d remix: \u201cDo your thing! Don\u2019t hold back! Go in!\u201d) Seeing them work together is evidence that two badass women working together can be even better than one, and it\u2019s no coincidence that both \u201cFeeling Myself\u201d and \u201cFlawless\u201d are odes to how awesome they both are.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This year has gifted us with one of the greatest and most unlikely female alliances in the biz", "author": "Anna Silman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "This year has gifted us with one of the greatest and most unlikely female alliances in the biz", "title": "They\u2019re flawless: Why Beyonc\u00e9 and Nicki Minaj had 2014\u2019s best female celebrity friendship", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/12/theyre_flawless_why_beyonce_and_nicki_minaj_had_2014s_best_female_celebrity_friendship/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/beyonce_minaj.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This year has gifted us with one of the greatest and most unlikely female alliances in the biz", "creator": "@annaesilman", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/beyonce_minaj.jpg", "title": "They\u2019re flawless: Why Beyonc\u00e9 and Nicki Minaj had 2014\u2019s best female celebrity friendship", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "They\u2019re flawless: Why Beyonc\u00e9 and Nicki Minaj had 2014\u2019s best female celebrity friendship", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ***flawless, Beyonce, feeling myself, friendship, Nicki Minaj", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde7c4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: ***flawless, Beyonce, feeling myself, friendship, Nicki Minaj, Entertainment NewsThis has been a banner year for female celebrity camaraderie.\nBut perhaps the greatest female relationship the world has witnessed in 2014 is the alliance of Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9.\nWhile both Nicki and Beyonc\u00e9 pay lip service to female solidarity, each simultaneously projects an aura of holier-than-thou detachment.\nI say unlikely, because neither Nicki nor Beyonc\u00e9 is historically known for their willingness to share the stage with other women.\nWith the release of the \u201cFlawless\u201d remix, and yesterday\u2019s \u201cFeeling Myself,\u201d this year has gifted us with one of the greatest and most unlikely female team-ups in the biz."}
