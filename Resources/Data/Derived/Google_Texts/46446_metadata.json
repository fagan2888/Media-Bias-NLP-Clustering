Times vary by specialty as well as by location \u2014 the longest wait was clocked in El Paso, Texas, at just shy of 30 minutes; the shortest was in Seattle, at 16 minutes, 15 seconds. However, the theme is the same: While there are often perfectly valid reasons why a physician cannot see a patient immediately \u2014 such as ensuring adequate time with all patients \u2014 the increasing demand on physicians\u2019 time frequently leaves patients disgruntled.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clear tie-over time between what\u2019s going on economically and utilization of healthcare services,\u201d says Phil Miller, Vice President of Communications for Texas-based physician search and consulting firm Merritt Hawkins, a company of AMN Healthcare. \u201cWe can anticipate that as coverage increases, as it is with the Affordable Care Act, and the economy improves, \u2026 the demand for physicians\u2019 services and utilization will increase.\u201d\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWait-friendly Apps SNAP Practice The SNAP Practice application from Seamless Medical Systems allows patients to check in, fill out forms and access health-related content while waiting. MyCareText MyCareText alerts approved friends and family about a patient\u2019s progress by integrating with EHR. Practices can also distribute information such as medication reminders and procedural preparation information using the system. InfoSlate Using InfoSlate, practices can push custom selected material to tablets used by patients. The material can include entertaining content, surveys and electronic medical forms. Emma The Emma app from Collaborative Chronic Care Network teaches children with inflammatory bowel disease about their condition through a series of games focused on quality of life, wellness, patient nutrition and general nutrition.\n\nConsulting group Alacer recently published a report about a client \u2014 identified only as \u201ca major Midwestern hospital\u201d \u2014 that was losing $400,000 annually in its outpatient pediatric clinic due to follow-up appointments caused by long wait times. Appointments were running long, patients were running out of time, and frequently they had to return for blood work or other tests.\n\nStaffing adjustments and a better understanding of patient surges allowed the clinic to improve the number of on-schedule appointments, increase patient capacity, eliminate many costly follow-up appointments and add $560,000 in annual revenue.\n\nClearly, appointment time management affects practice revenue, but efficiency is just part of the picture.\n\nAsked about the impact of longer in-office wait times, Laura Palmer, FACMPE, Senior Industry Analyst for the Medical Group Management Association, says, \u201cAs we get more and more focused on patient quality and the patient experience, we\u2019re certainly going to see some impact on patient satisfaction and their perception of offices\u2019 ability to meet their needs.\u201d\n\nWidespread irritation, if not exasperation, regarding time spent in waiting rooms is evident \u2014 and not only when that time is unusually extended. In a 2013 Software Advice survey of 5,003 patients, 97 percent said they were frustrated by the time they spent waiting to see a physician. Yet 45 percent of respondents had wait times of less than 15 minutes.\n\nA Shift in Perception\n\nThe reception environment and waiting room set the tone for patient visits. By focusing on this possibly overlooked element, practices can preempt a significant source of patient stress and dissatisfaction.\n\n\u201cCertain specialties, such as plastic surgery, dermatology, some of the women\u2019s health areas and pediatrics, have done a great job customizing their environments to make them a little more friendly and less threatening,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cChanging colors, changing lighting, choosing softer lights \u2014 some of those things can defuse the anxiety level. The whole point is to try to help make the [patient] experience a more positive one that relieves anxiety, allays fears and keeps communication channels open.\u201d\n\nFor many clients, she recommends customer service training. Simple techniques such as making eye contact, accommodating physical limitations in waiting areas and providing frequent follow-ups to keep patients updated can go a long way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of perception and communication,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cPatients are a lot more understanding when they know what\u2019s going on. If the exam room is cold, offer a blanket. If they\u2019re thirsty, offer a beverage. If the physician is delayed coming into the room, we coach them to apologize.\u201d\n\nUseful Diversions\n\nVoting with Their Feet In Vitals\u2019 2014 Physician Wait Time Report, 10 percent of respondents said they would leave their physician and seek care elsewhere if wait times exceeded 30 minutes.\n\nOffices may also consider making wait times more constructive to boost patient satisfaction, using questionnaires or prompt sheets to help make time with the doctor more productive, or providing educational materials. Some practices even bring on specialized waiting room managers to guide patient flow and facilitate education.\n\nWhile these techniques may not address the physician shortage and potentially increased patient loads that may fuel longer wait times, they do put the focus on the patient experience, a key component of the changing healthcare industry.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "Local News, National News, International Medical News, Peer Perspective, Accounting, Appointments, Case Studies/Studies, Charity Care, Clinical Trials, Ethics, Legal, Legislative, Medical Devices, Medical Facility News, Politics, Practice Management, Profiles, Regulatory and Compliance, Risk Management, Technology, Treatments and Techniques, Anesthesiology, Bariatrics, Cardiology, Cosmetic Surgery, Critical Care, Dermatology, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Fertility, Gastroenterology, Genetics, Geriatrics, Hematology, Hematology and Oncology, Infectious Disease, Integrative Medicine, Internal Medicine, Men's Health, Mental Health, Nephrology, Neurology, Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Oncology, Ophthalmology, Orthopedics, Otolaryngology, Pathology, Pediatrics, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy/Rehabilitation, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Pulmonology, Radiology, Sleep Medicine, Sports Medicine, Surgery, Urology, Women's Health, Wound Care", "google-site-verification": "_jHasar6_ZKbetuzBtUV7LhporLpglBaTa3I0Yn46cs", "Description": "The time patients spend in waiting rooms is widely expected to climb as healthcare reform progresses and millions of previously uninsured individuals seek medical care.
