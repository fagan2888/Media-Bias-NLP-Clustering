Michigan Democratic senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary C. Peters are desperately seeking the funds, but Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chair Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and other Republicans are resisting.\n\nMeanwhile, city and state officials are bickering over how best to proceed in replacing Flint\u2019s network of lead pipes and connections, and where the money will come from.\n\nRepublican Gov. Rick Snyder \u2013 who many blame for the crisis -- said his administration this week signed an agreement with a Flint-based engineering firm to \u201cstudy the soundness of the city's water system\u201d and launch a pilot program to replace 30 lead services lines into Flint homes by next month, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nFlint\u2019s new mayor, Karen Weaver, wants to accelerate the process and begin replacing pipe connections to homes as early as next week. She has urged the governor to pressure the state Legislature to move swiftly to appropriate money to fund the first phase of her $55 million \u201cFast Start lead pipe replacement plan.\u201d\n\nRelated: How the Flint Drinking Water Crisis Became a Political Punching Bag\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get this done \u2014 and done quickly \u2014 by any and every means necessary,\u201d Weaver said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe people of my city have simply run out of patience, and I have a moral obligation to act.\u201d\n\nBut with so many officials pulling in different directions or talking past one another, it is far from clear how soon we can expect to see any meaningful action.\n\nThe biggest victims, of course, are the estimated 8,000 children under the age of six who may have been exposed to lead in Flint\u2019s water during the past two years before the scandalous mismanagement of the municipal water system was revealed.\n\nMany of those children may eventually suffer brain damage or developmental problems from tap water with lead levels ten times higher than those recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency. And given the limited physician and health care services likely to be made available to them, the long-term prognosis is not good, some experts say.\n\nRelated: Flint\u2019s Drinking Water Crisis Just Got More Toxic with Legionnaire\u2019s Disease\n\nMany critics blame both the city and the state for gross negligence and disregard for the welfare of the residents. Not unexpectedly, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Rodham Clinton have made the Flint crisis a cause celebre and insist that more would have been done by now if Flint had been an affluent, majority white community. Sanders has called for Snyder\u2019s resignation.\n\nThere is evidence that state, city and federal environmental and health officials did not respond urgently to the crisis. For instance, some of the emails released by the governor\u2019s office in April cited a resident who complained in January 2015, a state nurse pooh-poohed the significance of her son\u2019s elevated blood lead level, according to The New York Times. \u201cIt is just a few IQ points,\u201d the nurse reportedly said. \u201cIt is not the end of the world.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, residents of the once economically vibrant city that manufactured General Motors vehicles are struggling to get by without water out of the tap to drink and bathe in. A now common routine is to line up in the morning to pick up a supply of bottled water or filters, but that often means taking time off from work.\n\nSome restaurants and shops have closed their doors because of the water crisis. And real estate values have plummeted \u2013 making it virtually impossible for many to sell their homes and escape Flint if they wanted to leave.\n\nRelated: Michigan governor to request federal aid in Flint water crisis\n\nAdding insult to injury, Flint residents paid the highest water rates in America even as the water was being poisoned with lead from leaching pipes, according to a national study released Tuesday by the public interest group Food and Water Watch.\n\nThe survey of the 500 largest U.S. water systems was conducted last year. It found that, on average, Flint residents paid about $864 a year for water service. That was almost double the national average and about three-and-a-half times as much as residents of Detroit were paying, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nFlint\u2019s drinking water became contaminated with excessive lead after the city switched its water supply from Lake Huron (via the Detroit water system) to the heavily polluted and corroding Flint River in 2014. That switch was made to save money at a time when the deficit-ridden city was under state financial management.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Flint\u2019s crisis over lead-contaminated drinking water has evolved into a national disgr", "title": "Outraged Americans Want Immediate Action on Flint Water Crisis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/18/Outraged-Americans-Want-Immediate-Action-Flint-Water-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/flint-water-top.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/18/Outraged-Americans-Want-Immediate-Action-Flint-Water-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/flint-water-top.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Flint\u2019s crisis over lead-contaminated drinking water has evolved into a national disgr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Some restaurants and shops have closed their doors because of the water crisis.\nIt found that, on average, Flint residents paid about $864 a year for water service.\nThere is evidence that state, city and federal environmental and health officials did not respond urgently to the crisis.\nNot unexpectedly, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Rodham Clinton have made the Flint crisis a cause celebre and insist that more would have been done by now if Flint had been an affluent, majority white community.\nFlint\u2019s drinking water became contaminated with excessive lead after the city switched its water supply from Lake Huron (via the Detroit water system) to the heavily polluted and corroding Flint River in 2014."}
