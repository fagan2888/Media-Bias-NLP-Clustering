Advertisement\n\n\n\nIn his 2012 book, It\u2019s Enough to Make You Sick, about the American health-care system, Chico neurosurgeon Jeff Lobosky warns that the Affordable Care Act has serious problems.\n\nTo mention just one flaw Lobosky sees: The ACA moves millions of low-income people into Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California), but there aren\u2019t even enough doctors for current Medicaid patients. \u201cIt will get them a card,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cbut it won\u2019t get them care.\u201d\n\nAs of Jan. 31, more than 1.6 million Californians had signed up for either Covered California health-insurance plans or low-cost or no-cost Medi-Cal. Locally, some of those patients are finding health care, but many aren\u2019t.\n\nJulie Light is one of the lucky ones. A part-time substitute teacher, the Corning woman had been getting care at a local clinic that accepted cash payments on a sliding scale. When she signed up for Obamacare insurance, she continued to use the clinic.\n\nOn her one visit since getting her insurance card, she saw a physician assistant and got some lab work done. Her co-pay was $3.\n\nThe clinics are rapidly filling up, however, as more and more people obtain ACA coverage. In Chico, Northern Valley Indian Health\u2019s East Avenue clinic is seeing six to eight new patients a day, Beya Villegas, its site manager, reported in a phone interview. The clinic is \u201cclose to capacity,\u201d she said, and the pressure to see more people \u201chas taken a toll on the clinic. \u2026 I wonder where patients will go when we fill up.\u201d\n\nThe Chico Children\u2019s Center, the pediatric clinic formerly run by Enloe Medical System but now part of NVIH, is similarly filled up. \u201cWe\u2019re probably booked out six weeks for some providers,\u201d Villegas said.\n\nThe number of patients these clinics can see depends on the number of providers\u2014doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners\u2014on staff. But it\u2019s not easy to find qualified people who want to work in a clinic setting. \u201cGod, no,\u201d Villegas said. \u201cNormally it takes six months to a year [to fill an opening].\u201d\n\nThe largest federally qualified clinic in the Chico area is the Ampla facility on Cohasset Road, which offers dental as well as medical care. It recently underwent a major remodeling and expansion, but even so, it\u2019s now at capacity.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to faze Ampla\u2019s Yuba City-based CEO, Benjamin H. Flores. Ampla has 12 clinics spread among rural towns such as Orland, Willows and Gridley, and many of them are not yet at capacity. Besides, Flores said during a phone interview, \u201cWe will continue growing and expanding services as demand requires.\u201d\n\nFlores\u2019 optimism echoes that of Anthony Wright, executive director of the consumer-advocacy group Health Access. The hope, he told the California Health Report last June, is that \u201c[i]f you create a lot more paying customers by getting them insured \u2026 the market will adjust in terms of having more [doctors] there.\u201d\n\nMaybe so, maybe not. Richard Thorp, who in addition to being a primary-care doctor in Paradise is president of the California Medical Association, points out that the historic problem with Medi-Cal\u2014its low rate of reimburse-ment\u2014has been carried forward under the ACA.\n\nAn office visit is valued at $23 or $24, he said, \u201cabout what you\u2019d pay for an extra-large pizza.\u201d The rates are so low, he added, that every Medi-Cal patient is a money loser for his or her doctor.\n\nThe rates under Covered California\u2019s insurance plans aren\u2019t any better, Thorp said. The most affordable \u201cbronze\u201d plan reimburses at 70 percent of the same insurance company\u2019s commercial rate, which in turn is lower than the Medicare reimbursement rate.\n\nIs it any wonder, he asked, that doctors aren\u2019t eager to accept new Medi-Cal and Covered California patients? \u201cDoctors are in business,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have significant overhead. They have to make decisions that enable them to stay in business.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has faced a shortage of primary-care doctors since long before implementation of the ACA. This is especially true in rural areas, where many old-style family docs are retiring and not being replaced. Unfortunately, most young doctors are not attracted to working in small towns.\n\nIndeed, most young doctors aren\u2019t attracted to being family doctors, period. A specialist\u2019s hours are better and so is the pay.\n\nThe trend is to make increased use of doctor surrogates\u2014physician assistants and nurse practitioners\u2014to compensate for the physician shortage by handling uncomplicated cases under a doctor\u2019s supervision. This is especially true in clinics, where a team model is often used to provide the most efficient and effective care possible.\n\nEven if the shortage of primary-care physicians is solved\u2014a huge \u201cif\u201d\u2014it won\u2019t make specialists any more willing to accept Medi-Cal or ACA patients.\n\nJust recently, Lobosky and his partners at Northstate Neurosurgical Associates received five or six referrals from the Redding area in one week. All were Medi-Cal patients who had been turned away by local neurosurgeons.\n\nAs the Redding doctors knew, the NNA neurosurgeons are the only ones in the area who accept Medi-Cal. In these cases, however, they too turned away the patients. They can barely afford to take Chico\u2019s Medi-Cal patients, Lobosky explained.\n\nIs Obamacare going to work? He\u2019s doubtful. \u201cObamacare is counting on the doctors to say, \u201cOh, screw it. I\u2019ll see them. The costs are going up, up, up, and they\u2019re going to stick it to the docs and hospitals.\u201d\n\nIf Obamacare fails, he said, one group will benefit: supporters of a single-payer system, or Medicare for all. \u201cBut it\u2019s far too early to tell,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast, Ampla\u2019s Flores is upbeat. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s an exciting time,\u201d he said.\n\nIndependent reporting for this story was made possible through a grant from HealthyCal.org.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "By Robert Speer.
