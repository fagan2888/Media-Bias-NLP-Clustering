I think the Republican Party today has moved so far to the right that they are way-way out of touch with where the American people are. These are people who almost without exception do not even recognize the reality of climate change, let alone want to do anything about it. They want to cut Social Security and give tax breaks to billionaires. They want to end the affordable care act, but they have nothing to replace it with. I will do everything in my power to make sure that no Republican gets into the White House in this election.\n\nThe Sanders campaign is at a crossroads. There are still contests left, and Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t clinched the nomination. However, Clinton is set to have another big night on Tuesday, and the statement by Sanders at the MSNBC town hall suggests that he is both going to do right by his supporters by fighting hard to win the nomination, but if he fails, Sen. Sanders will support the Democratic nominee and do everything he can to stop the Republicans from winning the White House.\n\nBernie Sanders isn\u2019t going to harm the Democratic Party\u2019s chances, and he has made it crystal clear that he will go above and beyond to help to defeat the Republican nominee this fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the MSNBC town hall with Chris Hayes, Bernie Sanders promised to do everything in his power to stop make sure that no Republican gets into the White House.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "At the MSNBC town hall with Chris Hayes, Bernie Sanders promised to do everything in his power to stop make sure that no Republican gets into the White House.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Makes His Strongest Statement Yet Suggesting He Will Support Clinton", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/04/25/bernie-sanders-strongest-statement-suggesting-support-clinton.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sanders-support-clinton.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-25T20:37:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders,Editors' Picks,Featured News,Bernie Sanders promises to work to stop Republicans from winning the White House,chris hayes,MSNBC town hall,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2016-04-25T20:37:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T20:37:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Bernie Sanders promises to work to stop Republicans from winning the White House, chris hayes, MSNBC town hall"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1786\"", "article_summary": "Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t going to harm the Democratic Party\u2019s chances, and he has made it crystal clear that he will go above and beyond to help to defeat the Republican nominee this fall.\nAt the MSNBC town hall with Chris Hayes, Bernie Sanders promised to do everything in his power to stop make sure that no Republican gets into the White House.\nI will do everything in my power to make sure that no Republican gets into the White House in this election.\nSanders was asked what role he has when it is time to end his campaign:I work with Republicans in the Senate and I see what they do in the House.\nI think the Republican Party today has moved so far to the right that they are way-way out of touch with where the American people are."}
