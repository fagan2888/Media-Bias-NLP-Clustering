Lucas Oil co-founder Charlotte Lucas apologized Saturday for a Facebook post where she ranted against minorities.

“I’m sick and tired of minorities running our country!” she wrote Friday, a local ABC affiliate reported.

Ms. Lucas, who founded Lucas Oil with her husband in 1989 and currently serves as executive vice president of Lucas Oil Products, asked her followers, “Is everyone so scared that they can’t fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?”

“As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think that atheists (minority), Muslims (minority) nor any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here,” she said.

Ms. Lucas told the ABC affiliate that she was “very upset” when she wrote the post. She later issued a statement of apology.

“I apologize to everyone for the insensitive comments posted on my Facebook account,” she said Saturday. “My comments did not reflect my personal views about any individual or minority group, only my frustration that our government system sometimes seems out of balance. We live in a great country, but the agenda for our elected officials is too often dictated by special interest groups. My comments did not reflect my true feelings, and I am sorry for anyone may have been offended.”

Robert Patison, general counsel for Lucas Oil Products, also issued a statement on Saturday: “We provide significant financial support for a broad range of organizations that serve the needs of veterans, women, other minority groups, and disadvantaged individuals throughout the United States. Fairness and equality are core values of our company,” the station reported.
