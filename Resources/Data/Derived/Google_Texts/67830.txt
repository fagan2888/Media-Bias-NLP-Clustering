When MSNBC reported this week that the federal government would provide information about Obamacare by phone in 150 languages , ProEnglish sprang into action. The organization -- dedicated to requiring the government to communicate to its citizens in English only -- called on its supporters to tell Congress "to STOP the taxpayer funding of costly and unnecessary Obamacare translators!"
