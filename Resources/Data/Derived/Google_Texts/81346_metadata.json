I know which one is the child molester, just saying.\u201d\n\nThe Comedy Central host then detailed how Hillary Clinton looks to be \u201cpretty inevitable\u201d to win the Democratic nomination before launching into his GOP smear:\n\nOn the GOP there\u2019s Rubio, Paul and Cruz, or as I call them the horrible prize at the bottom of the GOP crackerjack box. You got Ben Carson, the only black guy running. He said ObamaCare is the worst thing to happen to the country since slavery. To be fair to Ben Carson, he may have been talking about the Britney Spears \u201cSlave4u\u201d video. There's Carly Fiorina former tech CEO. She\u2019s like Steve Jobs if Steve Jobs never made anything that worked and fired 30,000 people. More like Steve No-Jobs. Bam.\n\nWilmore then turned his sights on Mike Huckabee who he assumed was \u201crunning just to amuse me personally\u201d before moving on to the rest of the Republicans running for president:\n\nJeb Bush is going to announce on June 15th. Sorry, Jeb, but I saw the first two movies and you need to stop remaking this s***. All right. Who else, who else? George Pataki, I don\u2019t even know who that is. Seriously, I have no idea. Rick Perry. Oh yeah, Rick Perry, man, didn\u2019t he have a funny name for his house or something? I can\u2019t recall. It had a certain ring. Was it like figurehead ranch, or ginger head ranch? What was it? Oh, yeah. Right, right, f*** that guy. And we got, yeah f*** that guy.\n\nWhile Wilmore eagerly bashed each and every one of the 2016 Republican presidential candidates, during the show\u2019s panel discussion the liberal comedian lamented that self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders hadn\u2019t gained much traction nationally because \u201ctruth teller[s]\u201d like him rarely win elections.\n\nSince the Nightly Show debuted in January, Wilmore has repeatedly deemed 2016 as the \u201cunblackening\u201d of America and even accused Ted Cruz\u2019s candidacy of being \u201cblacklash at its finest.\u201d\n\nSee relevant transcript below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "On Monday\u2019s Nightly Show, Comedy Central\u2019s Larry Wilmore took time out of his race-obsessed show to return to his favorite hobby, bashing Republicans, specifically the 2016 GOP presidential candidates who are engaged in the \u201cunblackening\u201d of America.", "title": "Larry Wilmore Blasts 2016 GOP Field in Latest \u2018Unblackening\u2019 Segment", "url": "http://social.newsbusters.org/blogs/jeffrey-meyer/2015/06/09/larry-wilmore-blasts-2016-gop-field-latest-unblackening-segment", "image": "http://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/COMEDYwilmore.jpg", "video": {"width": 640, "type": "text/html", "height": 360}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Monday\u2019s Nightly Show, Comedy Central\u2019s Larry Wilmore took time out of his race-obsessed show to return to his favorite hobby, bashing Republicans, specifically the 2016 GOP presidential candidates who are engaged in the \u201cunblackening\u201d of America.", "title": "Larry Wilmore Blasts 2016 GOP Field in Latest \u2018Unblackening\u2019 Segment", "url": "http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeffrey-meyer/2015/06/09/larry-wilmore-blasts-2016-gop-field-latest-unblackening-segment", "image": "http://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/COMEDYwilmore.jpg", "creator": "@JeffreyPMeyer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "On Monday\u2019s Nightly Show, Comedy Central\u2019s Larry Wilmore took time out of his race-obsessed show to return to his favorite hobby, bashing Republicans, specifically the 2016 GOP presidential candidates who are engaged in the \u201cunblackening\u201d of America.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Right, right, f*** that guy.\nWilmore began his attack on the GOP by joking that \u201cthere are so many candidates running they have their own TLC show.\nOn Monday\u2019s Nightly Show, Comedy Central\u2019s Larry Wilmore took time out of his race-obsessed show to return to his favorite hobby, bashing Republicans, specifically the 2016 GOP presidential candidates who are engaged in the \u201cunblackening\u201d of America.\nSince the Nightly Show debuted in January, Wilmore has repeatedly deemed 2016 as the \u201cunblackening\u201d of America and even accused Ted Cruz\u2019s candidacy of being \u201cblacklash at its finest.\u201dSee relevant transcript below.\nShe\u2019s like Steve Jobs if Steve Jobs never made anything that worked and fired 30,000 people."}
