South Korea\u2019s star attacker Son Heung-min hit the top of the crossbar with a looping shot after seven minutes.\n\nOman\u2019s running led to openings that attackers Qasim Said and Abdulaziz Al-Maqbali could not capitalize on.\n\nThe only goal of the match came when former English Premier League goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi could only parry a Koo Ja-cheol shot and Cho poked the rebound home.\n\nKoo went close to extending South Korea\u2019s lead just before the hour but his fierce header was tipped over the bar by Al Habsi.\n\nSouth Korea dominated the second half when Lee Chung-yong and Son went close to extending their team\u2019s lead.\n\nThe winning side almost paid the price for failing to finish off the game after 75 minutes, but Oman striker Abdulaziz Al Maqbali miskicked when free at the back post.\n\n\u201cI prefer to start a tournament like today in a tough game and learn from our mistakes \u2026 compared to winning 5-0 and everyone saying that you will win the Cup,\u201d Stielike said.\n\n\u201cIn the second half, we did things very much calmer and cooler and our game was much better.\u201d\n\nOman\u2019s French coach Paul Le Guen said his team \u201cgave their best and fought on the pitch.\u201d He could only look forward to his team\u2019s next match Tuesday against Australia in Sydney.\n\n\u201cIt will be tough against Australia for many reasons but we will fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a good team and are at home and have one more day recovery, but I like the fighting spirit of my team.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea stays in Canberra to take on Kuwait, also on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "South Korea began its Asian Cup campaign with a difficult 1-0 win over Oman on Saturday through Cho Yong-cheol's goal in first-half stoppage time.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "South Korea began its Asian Cup campaign with a difficult 1-0 win over Oman on Saturday through Cho Yong-cheol\u2019s goal in first-half stoppage time.", "title": "Asian Cup: South Korea beats Oman 1-0 at Asian Cup", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/10/asian-cup-south-korea-beats-oman-1-0-at-asian-cup/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/10/504b380b9d73ce016a0f6a706700b2ae.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/10/504b380b9d73ce016a0f6a706700b2ae.jpg", "description": "South Korea began its Asian Cup campaign with a difficult 1-0 win over Oman on Saturday through Cho Yong-cheol's goal in first-half stoppage time.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Asian Cup: South Korea beats Oman 1-0 at Asian Cup"}, "Author": "JOHN DUERDEN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce24d\"", "article_summary": "CANBERRA, Australia (AP) - South Korea began its Asian Cup campaign with a difficult 1-0 win over Oman on Saturday through Cho Yong-cheol\u2019s goal in first-half stoppage time.\nSouth Korea dominated the second half when Lee Chung-yong and Son went close to extending their team\u2019s lead.\nSouth Korea joined Australia on three points in Group A, although the Socceroos are top on goal difference after a 4-1 win over Kuwait on Friday.\nWinning coach Uli Stielike said he hoped the close victory would give his team added incentive as the tournament progressed.\nSouth Korea\u2019s star attacker Son Heung-min hit the top of the crossbar with a looping shot after seven minutes."}
