Reporters asked about virtually nothing else at the press secretary\u2019s daily briefing. Aides described the president\u2019s calls to five world leaders.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Obama faced mounting public criticism from Republicans on the campaign trail, many of them calling for West Africa travel restrictions.\n\nThe events echo another crisis: the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. It took weeks of political turmoil before Mr. Obama and his aides adopted a crisis footing that involved around-the-clock briefings and a barrel-chested Coast Guard commander heading up the response. In June, two months after the explosion, Mr. Obama canceled a trip to Indonesia and Australia so he could oversee efforts to cap the gushing oil.\n\nWhite House aides later said privately that the oil spill prevented them from dealing with much else that summer.\n\nWill the Ebola crisis have the same impact? Late Wednesday evening, the White House canceled a second day of trips, including an economic-themed speech in Rhode Island and fund-raising in New York City on Thursday.\n\nBut what seems clear is that a switch has been flipped at the White House. And it\u2019s unlikely to switch back until the Ebola threat subsides.\n\n\u2014 Michael D. Shear\n\nIt lacks the ferocity of Operation Desert Storm in Iraq or the idealism of Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya. Instead, United States military officials took a more delicate and ambiguous approach in their belated naming of the campaign against the Islamic State \u2014 Operation Inherent Resolve.\n\nAnd that may be the point.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have that boo-yah attitude,\u201d said Dean Crutchfield, a business consultant and brand expert. \u201cIt\u2019s not ferocious, or too hard or frightening in a way that would make America seem to be the aggressor. It\u2019s coming to protect.\u201d\n\nThe military names operations for administrative and public relations purposes. Yet Inherent Resolve, which was disclosed on Wednesday, may not bring up images of enemy annihilation as much as it does household chores.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that came to mind was that this didn\u2019t make me think about hitting the bad guys in Syria and Iraq, it made me think about cleaning my carpet,\u201d said Jonathan Schanzer, a former Treasury Department analyst, \u201cISIS being among the tough stains it would get out.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nIt was perhaps the most bewildering seven minutes of this election cycle.\n\nA high-profile televised debate between Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, and former Gov. Charlie Crist was held up for what seemed like an eternity Wednesday night over a surprising dispute over sweating and an electric fan.\n\nThe perennially tanned Mr. Crist had placed an electric fan at his feet, as he often does, to prevent him from perspiring on stage. But Mr. Scott refused to come out after his aides showed debate organizers the rules, which prohibited its use.\n\nThat left a table of moderators and panelists facing a single candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t know, what can we say?\u201d one moderator said.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentleman,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have an extremely peculiar situation right now.\u201d\n\nAfter seven minutes of a lot of back and forth between the Scott team and the organizers, Mr. Scott finally appeared, the fan stayed in place, and, by the debate\u2019s end, no one was sweating that we could see.\n\nIn the explosion of Twitter jokes that followed, Ben Smith of BuzzFeed may have summed it up best. It was, he said, \u201cthe dumbest, most Florida thing.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Steve Kenny\n\nThe unemployment rate is down, but the percentage of Americans who actually have a job has hardly budged. Housing prices are on the rise, except where they aren\u2019t. Corporate profits have soared, but wages have stagnated.\n\nIn this \u201con the one hand, on the other\u201d economy, the stock market has been one of the few unambiguous bright spots, with Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rising nearly 30 percent last year alone.\n\nBut now, less than three weeks before the midterm elections, the markets are gyrating on fears of a global economic slowdown, adding a dose of uncertainty for voters already unnerved by the Ebola, Islamic State and Ukrainian crises.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not likely to help the Democrats, whose fortunes are tied closely to those of President Obama.\n\nThe stock market has always been a much debated measure of the economy. Yet bull markets \u2013 especially during the 1990s \u2013 have made Americans more optimistic, improved economic fortunes on Main Street as well as Wall Street, and benefited the party that controls the White House.\n\nBut this week\u2019s dismal stock market performance has dimmed, if not killed, any hope that voters will see such a \u201cwealth effect\u201d before Nov. 4 that will buoy Democratic chances.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Weisman\n\nPresident Obama remains at the White House, where he will meet with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and monitor the Ebola response.\n\nOfficials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee at noon.\n\nJames B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., will make his first major policy speech at the Brookings Institition in Washington.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky swings through New Hampshire for campaign rallies.\n\nRepresentative Bruce Braley and Joni Ernst hold their final debate in Iowa at 8 p.m.\n\nMitt Romney has lost none of his fervor in calling the Obama administration a failure.\n\nHe made that clear on Wednesday when he made a return campaign trip to Hudson, N.H. to stump for Republican Scott P. Brown.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re trying to reduce income inequality \u2013 that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said, ticking off an anti-Obama checklist. \u201cThey misjudged the importance of having our forces remain in Iraq. They made so many mistakes.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans have been trying to persuade Mr. Romney to mount another presidential campaign in 2016. But he gave little indication that his latest trip to Hudson was a warm-up.\n\nHis wife, Ann, has pretty much quashed that notion.\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d she told The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday. \u201cCompletely. Not only Mitt and I are done, but the kids are done. Done. Done. Done.\u201d\n\nAfter his brief speech, Mr. Romney introduced Mr. Brown\u2019s wife, Gail Huff. So eager was he to call Mr. Brown \u201cthe next senator from New Hampshire\u201d that he accidentally called Ms. Huff \u201cthe next wife\u201d of the next senator.\n\nMs. Huff laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I could deal with that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 Katharine Q. Seelye\n\nRepresentative Michele Bachmann may be leaving the Hill, but Roll Call says she\u2019s \u201cstill in the game.\u201d\n\nMs. Magazine lists the state ballot measures that it says are most important for women\u2019s rights.\n\nAttorney General Greg Abbott of Texas, the Republican nominee for governor, talks to Esquire about the jogging accident that paralyzed him.\n\nThe Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Pa., profiles the state representative who engaged in a shootout with a robbery suspect this week near the State Capitol. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had such a run-in.\n\nNew York magazine looks at what it says is the right-wing campaign against Mayor Annise Parker of Houston, the first openly gay mayor of a major American city.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post misstated the party affiliation of Attorney General Greg Abbott of Texas. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.", "article_metadata": {"BN": "first-draft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2014/10/16", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "First Draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "robots": "noodp", "sourceApp": "blogs", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-10162014.jsonp", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/16/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc182\"", "article_summary": "It took weeks of political turmoil before Mr. Obama and his aides adopted a crisis footing that involved around-the-clock briefings and a barrel-chested Coast Guard commander heading up the response.\nWhite House aides later said privately that the oil spill prevented them from dealing with much else that summer.\nBut what seems clear is that a switch has been flipped at the White House.\nIn June, two months after the explosion, Mr. Obama canceled a trip to Indonesia and Australia so he could oversee efforts to cap the gushing oil.\nLate Wednesday evening, the White House canceled a second day of trips, including an economic-themed speech in Rhode Island and fund-raising in New York City on Thursday."}
