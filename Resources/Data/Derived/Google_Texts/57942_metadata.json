During it, the left-hander has received just eight runs of support in 29 1-3 innings. He tied a season high with four walks.\n\n\u201cEach game is a little bit different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out this time.\u201d\n\nKershaw still has just one victory to his credit in seven career playoff games.\n\n\u201cWe lost the game and that\u2019s kind of how you\u2019re measured at this time of year,\u201d catcher A.J. Ellis said.\n\nDeGrom struck out 13 over seven scoreless innings in his postseason debut and Daniel Murphy homered off Kershaw for the Mets.\n\nDeGrom (1-0) limited the Dodgers to five hits and one walk. The right-hander\u2019s strikeouts tied the franchise playoff record set by Tom Seaver in Game 1 of the 1973 NL Championship Series.\n\nKershaw (0-1) gave up the seventh playoff homer of his career. Last season\u2019s NL Cy Young Award winner allowed three runs and four hits in 6 2-3 innings.\n\n\u201cI got outpitched, plain and simple,\u201d he said.\n\nKershaw walked the bases loaded in the seventh, before Mets captain David Wright had a two-out, two-run single off Pedro Baez that put New York up 3-0.\n\n\u201cObviously, you can\u2019t walk that many guys,\u201d Kershaw said.\n\nRuns will likely again be at a premium when the Dodgers try to even the series Saturday night in Game 2. They start major league ERA leader Zack Greinke against Noah Syndergaard of the Mets.\n\nWith an unseasonable game-time temperature of 92 degrees, both pitchers came out throwing heat. Kershaw, the major league strikeout leader with 301 in the regular season, retired six of his first nine batters. DeGrom, last year\u2019s NL Rookie of the Year, struck out two batters in each of his first four innings.\n\nDeGrom became the first Mets pitcher with 10 or more strikeouts in the playoffs since Dwight Gooden in Game 1 of the 1988 NLCS at Dodger Stadium. DeGrom retired his final 11 batters, subduing the white towel-waving crowd of 54,428.\n\nJeurys Familia got four outs to earn the save.\n\nMurphy homered leading off the fourth to give New York a 1-0 lead before Kershaw retired the next three batters.\n\n\u201cThe Mets had a really good approach, good plan and they really grinded him well,\u201d Ellis said of Kershaw.\n\nThe Dodgers finally scored in the eighth on Adrian Gonzalez\u2019s two-out RBI single off Tyler Clippard that left them trailing 3-1. He struck out in his first three at-bats.\n\nKershaw nearly helped himself in the fourth when the Dodgers trailed by one. With two runners on, he hit a long flyball to center field that was caught by Yoenis Cespedes to end the inning.\n\nThe left-hander threw 22 pitches in the first inning, including 12 on a walk to Wright. In the second, a ball hit by Lucas Duda went off Kershaw\u2019s right foot, but he didn\u2019t appear to be affected and struck out the next two batters to end the inning.\n\nLos Angeles lost its third straight postseason game, having been beaten in four games by St. Louis in last year\u2019s NLDS. The Dodgers lost the final two games, with Kershaw tagged for the loss while pitching on three days\u2019 rest in Game 4.\n\nSTREAKING ELLIS\n\nEllis went 1 for 3 to extend his playoff hitting streak to 11 games, tying Carl Crawford for the longest such run in Dodgers\u2019 franchise history. He is hitting .400 during the streak and has hit safely in 14 of his 15 career playoff games.\n\nSEAGER\u2019S DEBUT\n\nRookie Corey Seager started at shortstop for the Dodgers in his postseason debut. He went 1 for 4 with a double. At 21 years, 165 days, Seager became the youngest position player to start a playoff game in club history and third-youngest ever behind Fernando Valenzuela (20 years, 339 days) in 1981 and Johnny Podres (21 years, 4 days) in 1953.\n\nCESPEDES\u2019 STRIKEOUTS\n\nCespedes was hitless in four at-bats, including three strikeouts, just the second time this season he was fanned three times in a game. He was still playing for Detroit on June 24 at Cleveland when Carlos Carrasco struck him out twice and Cody Allen once.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGreinke (19-3, major league-best 1.66 ERA) starts for the Dodgers against Syndergaard (9-7, 3.24). Greinke beat the Mets 4-3 on July 4 at home in his only start against them this season. Syndergaard had a no-decision in the Mets\u2019 2-1 win at Dodger Stadium on July 3 in his only career start against Los Angeles.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Clayton Kershaw outdueled by Jacob deGrom in Dodgers\u2019 NLDS loss", "title": "Clayton Kershaw outdueled by Jacob deGrom in Dodgers\u2019 NLDS loss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/09/clayton-kershaw-outdueled-by-jacob-degrom-in-dodgers-nlds-loss/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__492086420p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__492086420p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T01:08:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:18:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca69\"", "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Clayton Kershaw struck out 11 only to be thwarted again in the postseason.\nThe Dodgers lost the final two games, with Kershaw tagged for the loss while pitching on three days\u2019 rest in Game 4.\nDeGrom struck out 13 over seven scoreless innings in his postseason debut and Daniel Murphy homered off Kershaw for the Mets.\nDeGrom, last year\u2019s NL Rookie of the Year, struck out two batters in each of his first four innings.\nRuns will likely again be at a premium when the Dodgers try to even the series Saturday night in Game 2."}
