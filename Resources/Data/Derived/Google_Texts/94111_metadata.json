Well, let\u2019s wrap up the weekend with a bit of mudslinging from upper chamber. Doing an interview with the New York Times, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell addressed the issue of three high profile Republican senators who are facing primary challenges from the Right. His conclusion?\n\nWe\u2019re going to crush you like the worms that you are, peasants.\n\nRepublican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted the GOP establishment will destroy conservative insurgents attempting to unseat a trio incumbents in an interview with the New York Times published on Sunday. \u201cI think we are going to crush them everywhere,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country.\u201d McConnell is one of three establishment Republicans who are facing primary challengers backed by Tea Party conservative groups. The Senate Conservatives Fund, The Madison Project, and FreedomWorks are supporting Matt Bevin, McConnell\u2019s rival in Kentucky. All three groups as well as the anti-tax Club For Growth are also throwing their fundraising weight behind Chris McDaniel\u2019s run against Republican Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran. The Madison Project and the Senate Conservatives Fund are also spending to support Milton Wolf, who is challenging Kansas Senator Pat Roberts.\n\nIt\u2019s always hard to tell whether statements like this are just hubris for show in an attempt to buy some media traction or true confidence. But in this case, it just may turn out that McConnell is finding some room to relax. Chris McDaniel has made some gains in Mississippi, but it looks like Thad Cochran is still holding enough of a lead to feel comfortable. Of course, that primary isn\u2019t until June and a lot can change between now and then. Milton Wolf has definitely eroded Pat Roberts\u2019 favorability numbers in recent months, but the last polling we\u2019ve seen still shows Roberts with a two to one advantage.\n\nAs for the long game of McConnell and Matt Bevin, well\u2026 what can you say? That 55 to 29 spread doesn\u2019t seem to be budging. But you have to wonder what McConnell was thinking in doing this interview. Even if you\u2019re feeling your oats in the primaries, is the close of CPAC and the dawn of the primary season really the time to be taking a victory lap and doing a bit of an in your face dance for opponents in your own party? November will be all about turnout \u2013 as the off years always are \u2013 and leaving a sour taste in the mouths of supporters of any of these \u201cupstart whacko-birds\u201d probably isn\u2019t going to do much for the grassroots enthusiasm in the final weeks.\n\nBut hey\u2026 the guy looks really good doing a Cold Dead Hands impression, eh?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cPolitics doesn\u2019t like losers\u201d", "title": "On notice: Mitch McConnell is ready to \u201ccrush\u201d the Tea Party", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/09/on-notice-mitch-mcconnell-is-ready-to-crush-the-tea-party/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-09T22:31:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T00:46:28+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, conservatives, Mitch McConnell, senate conservatives fund, Tea Party,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce6b\"", "article_summary": "Doing an interview with the New York Times, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell addressed the issue of three high profile Republican senators who are facing primary challenges from the Right.\n\u201cI think we are going to crush them everywhere,\u201d McConnell said.\nRepublican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted the GOP establishment will destroy conservative insurgents attempting to unseat a trio incumbents in an interview with the New York Times published on Sunday.\nWe\u2019re going to crush you like the worms that you are, peasants.\nBut you have to wonder what McConnell was thinking in doing this interview."}
