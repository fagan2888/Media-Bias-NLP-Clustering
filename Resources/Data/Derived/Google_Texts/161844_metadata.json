John Kasich\u2019s home-state win against presidential front-runner Donald Trump last week brought him bigger crowds, campaign cash and media exposure, but on Sunday he clamored for something more \u2014 a little respect.\n\nThe Republican governor says he single-handedly thwarted Mr. Trump\u2019s coronation by defending his home turf Tuesday, denying the flamboyant businessman a second trophy after he had thumped Sen. Marco Rubio out of the race with a double-digit victory in Florida.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t win Ohio, guess what? Trump is the nominee. I win Ohio. Now they want me to get out?\u201d an incredulous Mr. Kasich said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich has a mathematical problem: Even if he were to run the table, he cannot grab enough delegates needed to secure the nomination ahead of the party convention in Cleveland in July.\n\nAs it stands, Mr. Trump leads with 678 delegates, compared to 423 for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and 143 for Mr. Kasich. A candidate needs 1,237 to secure the nomination.\n\nMr. Trump on Sunday predicted he would cruise to that tally, though others aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nHoping to stall the mogul\u2019s momentum, 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney recently argued that a vote for Mr. Kasich is a vote for \u201cTrumpism.\u201d He said Republicans need to rally around Mr. Cruz.\n\nMr. Kasich was clearly fed up with the maneuvering on Sunday, saying that he\u2019s \u201cnot a plotter or a schemer\u201d and that people who think he should cede to Mr. Cruz are letting the three-man race \u201cdeteriorate into a political science class\u201d or some type of \u201cparlor game.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, this is a crazy idea,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWho actually could be president of the United States and do a good job? When the delegates think about that, I think we will do very well, and we will go to the convention with momentum.\u201d\n\nThe way he sees it, each of the remaining candidates is in the same boat, so his record as a conservative governor and budget-balancing congressman should keep him afloat until July.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to have enough delegates,\u201d Mr. Kasich told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re are going to go to a convention, it\u2019s going to be open.\u201d\n\nHis campaign blasted out a fundraising email Sunday that mentions Tuesday\u2019s primary in Utah and an April 5 contest in Wisconsin, yet casts the convention floor as the real battleground.\n\n\u201cWe WILL stop Trump from getting the nomination and we WILL win at the convention \u2014 and then we\u2019ll go on to defeat Hillary [Clinton] this fall and begin the hard work of fixing America, together,\u201d his campaign says.\n\nGOP strategists are fretting and relishing the notion of a contested convention, with the so-called \u201cStop Trump\u201d movement scrambling to line up alternate candidates or routes around the mogul\u2019s candidacy.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Mr. Trump won\u2019t have a lock on the nomination if he heads to Cleveland with only a plurality of delegates \u2014 exactly the type of scenario that Mr. Kasich is hoping for.\n\n\u201cPlurality is a minority, and a minority doesn\u2019t choose for the majority. So you have to have a majority of the delegates in order to be the nominee,\u201d Mr. Priebus told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about the number. It\u2019s 50 percent plus one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Kasich said Sunday he is ready to take his presidential candidacy all the way to the Republican convention this summer.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "John Kasich said Sunday he is ready to take his presidential candidacy all the way to the Republican convention this summer.", "title": "John Kasich, Ohio governor: No one is going to have enough delegates", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/20/john-kasich-ohio-governor-no-one-is-going-to-have-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/18/GOP_2016_Kasich.JPEG-0326d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/18/GOP_2016_Kasich.JPEG-0326d.jpg", "description": "John Kasich said Sunday he is ready to take his presidential candidacy all the way to the Republican convention this summer.", "card": "summary", "title": "John Kasich, Ohio governor: No one is going to have enough delegates"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, John Kasich, Donald Trump"}, "article_summary": "As it stands, Mr. Trump leads with 678 delegates, compared to 423 for Sen.
