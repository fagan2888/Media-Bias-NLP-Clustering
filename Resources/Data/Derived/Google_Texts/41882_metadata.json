Facing backlash from patent-reliant tech companies like IBM, Goodlatte removed the patent quality provision.\n\nThose watching the patent reform debate are waiting to see if Leahy will take up the issue in the Senate. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has pushed for a patent reform bill that would allow defendants to challenge low quality software patents at the Patent Office, and Leahy has committed to working with Schumer on the issue.\n\nTech companies and groups are also watching to see how Leahy deals with the end user or customer stay provision, which would allow tech companies to intervene when their customers are sued for patent infringement.\n\nThe National Retail Federation sent a letter on Monday opposing Leahy\u2019s current customer stay provision.\n\nThe bill would leave customers with too little room to later defend themselves if they invoke the customer stay provision, the group wrote in letters to Leahy and Judiciary Committee ranking member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).\n\nThe retailers group called the provision a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would keep customers from asking tech companies to intervene when they\u2019re being sued for patent infringement.\n\nGetting the customer stay provision right \u201cis a tricky balance,\u201d Dana Rao, vice president of intellectual property at Adobe and a witness for Tuesday\u2019s hearing, said.\n\nRao said he hopes that Congress will \u201cchange the economics\u201d so that meritless patent cases aren\u2019t profitable.\n\nAdobe \u2014 which defends itself and its customers when accused of patent infringement \u2014 wants a patent reform bill that would require more transparency for patent infringement claims and increase the costs of bringing a meritless lawsuit, according to Rao.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Groups on
