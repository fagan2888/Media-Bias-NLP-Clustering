Plus, entrepreneurs will use more business credit cards to make purchases for their companies.\n\nAs 2015 winds down, NerdWallet believes 2016 will be a big year for small businesses, especially when it comes to financing and the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\u201cSmall-business owners, who fuel the U.S. economy, deserve more and better access to financing and other resources to help them thrive,\u201d NerdWallet small-business expert Cindy Yang says.\n\nNerdWallet analyzed third-party data and tapped our team of small-business gurus to craft five predictions about what\u2019s in store for 2016.\n\nWhat to expect in 2016 for small-business loans and more\n\nSummary:\n\nEntrepreneurs will go online more for small-business loans.\n\nOnline small-business loans account for 2% of all such loans today. That number is expected to rise to 16% by 2020.\n\nMore women will become small-business owners.\n\n43% of small businesses will be owned by women in 2016, and 50% by 2020, assuming the current growth rate of women-owned businesses continues. That\u2019s up from 36% in 2012.\n\nGrowing industries for women entrepreneurs include agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting; accommodation and food services; and manufacturing.\n\nSBA loan amounts will continue to increase.\n\nThe average SBA loan size increased 82% from 2007 to 2015. The SBA 7(a) program \u2014 the organization\u2019s most popular loan \u2014 reached an all-time high in the 2015 fiscal year, with 63,000 loans totaling $23.6 billion.\n\nSmartBiz, an online lender that originates SBA loans, processed about $1.7 billion in SBA loan applications in 2015, up from $440 million in 2014 .\n\nThe 2016 presidential election will affect small-business issues.\n\nThe minimum wage, tax reform and health care are the top three issues at stake for small-business owners.\n\nSmall-business owners will use more business credit cards.\n\nThe total number of business credit cards in use from the top three issuers \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Capital One \u2014 grew from 9.9 million to 10.1 million between 2010 and 2015.\n\nNerdWallet small-business predictions 2016\n\nEntrepreneurs will skip the bank and go online more for small-business loans.\n\nEntrepreneurs don\u2019t have to walk into a bank anymore to get a small-business loan. Increasingly, they can find the financing they need online in a fraction of the time. As bank lending continues to decrease for small-business loans, online lending is increasing, according to data in a 2014 Harvard Business School working paper.\n\nToday, online small-business loans from lenders including OnDeck, Lending Club, Funding Circle, Dealstruck and SmartBiz account for about 2% of all small-business loans. But they are expected to comprise 16% of the total small-business loan volume by 2020, according to a 2015 report by Morgan Stanley.\n\nOnline lenders offer middle-of-the-road options for borrowers who fail to qualify for a traditional bank loan but don\u2019t want to pay the high cost of a merchant cash advance. For a merchant cash advance, a non-bank company advances money to a business upfront, and the business pays it back daily based on a percentage of its credit card sales. Banks typically charge less than a 10% annual percentage rate, while merchant cash advance companies can charge as much as 200% APR. Online lenders charge anywhere from 7% to 113% APR.\n\n\u201cWith online lending expanding, Main Street small businesses have more ways than ever to access the capital they need to grow,\u201d Yang says. \u201cBut it\u2019s crucial that small-business owners identify the type of financing that\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nBusiness owners can compare a range of online financing options \u2014 including term loans, lines of credit and accounts receivable financing \u2014 on NerdWallet\u2019s small-business loans page. The comparisons are based on factors including APR, loan size and what it takes to qualify.\n\nMore women will become small-business owners.\n\nEntrepreneurship still has a gender gap, although it has been slowly shrinking \u2014 36% of small-business owners were women in 2012, up from 29% in 2007, according to the 2007 and 2012 U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Business Owners. NerdWallet expects this trend to continue, especially as more small-business loans for women become available.\n\n\u201cAs more women become business owners, it\u2019s becoming necessary that there be more small-business funding options for women,\u201d Yang says. \u201cOnline lending is making that possible.\u201d\n\nAssuming the number of women-owned businesses grows at the same rate it did from 2007 to 2012, 43% of all businesses will be owned by women in 2016, and 50% of all businesses by 2020, according to a NerdWallet analysis of the census data.\n\nEvery industry category had an increased proportion of women entrepreneurs from 2007 to 2012, including some that may surprise, given their male-dominated roots. The industries with the largest increase of women business owners included agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (a 40.5% increase); accommodation and food services (29.8% higher); and manufacturing (29.3%).\n\nSBA loan amounts will continue to increase.\n\nSBA loans are among the least expensive small-business loans available, with APRs in the single digits. As online lending has increased, the SBA has lent more small-business dollars. The average SBA loan size increased 82% from 2007 to 2015, although the total number of SBA loans decreased by 34% in that time. The SBA 7(a) program \u2014 the organization\u2019s most popular loan \u2014 reached an all-time high in fiscal 2015, with 63,000 loans totaling $23.6 billion.\n\nThe massive increase in average SBA loan amounts is partly due to online lending, Yang says.\n\nAccording to Judy Balint, chief marketing officer for SmartBiz, which originates SBA loans through its online platform, borrowers applied for about $1.7 billion in SmartBiz loans in 2015. That\u2019s up from $440 million in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe technology that enables small businesses to get short-term loans quickly and conveniently online is also allowing them to get longer-term, low-cost financing much faster through lenders like SmartBiz,\u201d Yang notes.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election will affect small businesses.\n\nRegardless of their politics, small-business owners will be impacted by the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The minimum wage, taxes and health care are the top issues affecting small-business owners this election. The chart below summarizes the top candidates\u2019 stances on these issues.\n\nMinimum wage Taxes Health care Hillary Clinton (D) Wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $12/hour. Wants to simplify tax filing and offer tax relief for small businesses. Supports the Affordable Care Act. Bernie Sanders (D) Wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $15/hour by 2020. Wants to increase payroll taxes to finance more generous family leave policies. Wants to expand Medicare to all Americans. Donald Trump (R) Opposes minimum wage increases. Wants to simplify the tax code and offer tax relief for the middle class. Wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Ted Cruz (R) Opposes minimum wage increases. Wants to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and replace it with a flat tax. Wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Marco Rubio (R) Opposes minimum wage increases. Wants to cut taxes for small-business owners. Wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Ben Carson (R) Has changed views but most recently said he opposed minimum wage increases. Wants to simplify the tax code. Opposes the Affordable Care Act.\n\n*Candidates listed by party and their ranks in the Huffington Post polls on Dec. 11, 2015.\n\n\u201cRegardless of your political views on these issues, this will be a critical election for small-business owners,\u201d Yang says. \u201cPresidential elections naturally thrust small businesses into the national spotlight because so many issues affect them directly.\u201d\n\nSmall-business owners will use more business credit cards.\n\nEntrepreneurs are turning to more business credit cards to make purchases, and NerdWallet expects that trend to continue throughout 2016. From 2010 to 2015, the total number of business credit cards in use from the top three issuers \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Capital One \u2014 grew from 9.9 million to 10.1 million, according to Nilson Report data. Business credit cards from the top issuer, JPMorgan, grew from 4.7 million to 5 million.\n\nThis increase makes sense to NerdWallet credit card expert Sean McQuay.\n\n\u201cIt can be extremely advantageous for business owners to use business credit cards over personal credit cards or cash,\u201d McQuay says. \u201cBusiness credit cards offer better rewards than consumer cards, including higher rewards rates for cash back or points.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d he adds, \u201cbusiness owners need to be careful about carrying a balance. Credit cards are not always your lowest-cost option.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway\n\nWith the upcoming presidential election, an increase in small-business lending and a shrinking gender gap in entrepreneurship, small-business owners have reason to be optimistic for 2016.\n\n\u201cOf all the changes in store for small-business owners, I believe access to capital is the most impactful,\u201d Yang says.\n\nBut with so many new financing options available, including business credit cards, bank loans and online small-business loans, it can be hard for business owners to find the one that\u2019s right for them.
