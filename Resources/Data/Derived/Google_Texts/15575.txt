Netflix customer service rep boldly goes the extra mile (or light year)

The Obamacare customer service chat room: a brainless ‘help’ representative directing a customer to dial a phone number. (“What does the chat service do then?”)

The Netflix customer service chat room: Star Trek Into Awesomeness.

A subscriber to the media service provider was preparing to report a problem via an online help chat when a customer service rep, ahem, warped into action.

“This is Cpt. Mike of the good ship Netflix, which member of the crew am I speaking with today?” the representative asked.

The customer played along, identifying himself as “Lt. Norm” and writing that ‘engineering’ had a problem to report. (No word if Scotty was unavailable at the time.)

“Visual displays are erratic, sir,” Norm wrote. “Season 5, episode 13 of Parks and Recreation is behaving badly.”

How badly?

“The visual creates a temporal loop,” the customer continued, perhaps marking the first time that a playback glitch on a television program was likened to a complex physics anomaly.

The full conversation — which the Huffington Post verified was real, per a Netflix official — is below.
