Howie, Chip and [president] Don [Smolenski] are all united in their desire to win. Together, we decided this approach was the best course of action for the Philadelphia Eagles.\u201d\n\nKelly has led the Eagles to consecutive 10-6 seasons. He already had final say on the 53-man roster. Now he\u2019ll hire a new personnel executive who will answer directly to him.\n\n\u201cI am very confident about where we are headed as a team and as an organization,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI look forward to continue working with Jeffrey and Howie as well as the personnel department. This is not a one-man operation. It will truly take a team effort to acquire and develop the best football players and then put the best team on the field each week. It will take all of us working together.\u201d\n\nThe 39-year-old Roseman had been the youngest GM in the NFL and held the position for five seasons. He began his career with the Eagles as an unpaid intern in 2000.\n\n\u201cMy No. 1 goal is to help bring a championship to this city and that will never change,\u201d Roseman said. \u201cI believe this will solidify the trust we have all placed in Coach Kelly.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles won the NFC East in 2013, a year after finishing 4-12 under Andy Reid. They lost a playoff game at home to New Orleans. This year, they became only the third team since 1990 to miss the playoffs after a 9-3 start.\n\nLurie said after the season finale last Sunday that Roseman would return as GM. That was before Gamble was let go and reports of a rift between Roseman and Kelly began circulating.\n\n\u201cAfter carefully listening and reflecting on the lengthy discussions that I had with our senior team, I changed my mind [about Roseman staying as GM],\u201d Lurie said. \u201cI have a very good relationship with Chip that continues to grow stronger and stronger. When we spoke, he was thoughtful, thorough and professional. There were no demands, no threats; quite the contrary, he was passionate, engaged and articulated a dynamic and clear vision on how this fully integrated approach will work. We look forward to seeing it come to life over time.\u201d\n\nWhen Kelly left Oregon to join the Eagles two years ago, he made it clear he wasn\u2019t interested in total control.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard questions that I want control over this, control over that,\u201d Kelly said on Jan. 17, 2013. \u201cThat has never been an issue, never is an issue for me. I\u2019m a football coach. I\u2019m not a general manager. I\u2019m not a salary-cap guy. I coach football. I need people who can go out there and say, \u2018Hey this is what you want. These are the people.\u2019 And it\u2019s going to be a collaboration. We\u2019re all going to be on the same page. I\u2019ve got no delusions of saying that I want all these different titles. I just want to coach football.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kelly gained control of the Eagles' player personnel department on Friday after Howie Roseman was promoted from general manager to executive vice president of football operations.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Kelly gained control of the Eagles\u2019 player personnel department on Friday after Howie Roseman was promoted from general manager to executive vice president of football operations.", "title": "Eagles coach Chip Kelly takes larger role with personnel power", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/3/eagles-coach-chip-kelly-takes-larger-role-personne/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/20/eagles-redskins-football-jpeg-0743b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/20/eagles-redskins-football-jpeg-0743b.jpg", "description": "Kelly gained control of the Eagles' player personnel department on Friday after Howie Roseman was promoted from general manager to executive vice president of football operations.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Eagles coach Chip Kelly takes larger role with personnel power"}, "Author": "Rob Maaddi", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Chip Kelly, Football, Philadelphia Eagles, Howie Roseman"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc5d\"", "article_summary": "I coach football.\nKelly got control of the Philadelphia Eagles\u2018 player personnel department on Friday after Howie Roseman was promoted from general manager to executive vice president of football operations.\nI just want to coach football.\u201d\nI\u2019m a football coach.\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Before winning his first playoff game, Chip Kelly won a power struggle."}
