Although he continues to say otherwise, his policy priorities say that he really is not concerned with getting people back to work.\n\nThe real way to reduce income inequality is to ensure that the lowest income earners are able to find jobs and learn useful skills, which ultimately results in higher wages.\n\nInstead, the President acted to reduce the number of hours low-skilled employees work, increase the number of people willing to work at low wages, and discourage employers from hiring.\n\nRead More: Funding Democracy: The Economics of Freedom\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSince the ACA defines a full-time employee as anyone working at least 30 hours per week, not the 40 hours that has been the standard for 75 years, employers have cut back on the number of hours offered to workers and made up the difference by hiring more part-time workers. While the national unemployment rate has fallen considerably as a result of this, most of the jobs created are part-time.\n\nSo how have these workers been surviving?\n\nThe President has also greatly expanded the food-stamp program and relaxed the requirements to receive welfare. Taxpayers are picking up the tab. Workers are screaming for more hours, but employers simply cannot afford to offer them and incur the additional cost required by the ACA. As a result, the number of people receiving welfare and food stamps has exploded\n\nRead More: The next Obamacare deception will clobber the productive middle class\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t an increased minimum wage help?\n\nThe President raised the minimum wage for Federal workers and wants the national minimum wage raised to $10.10 per hour, up from the current level of $7.25. Some of the President\u2019s advisors want the minimum wage raised even higher, perhaps to $15 per hour.\n\nRegardless of how anyone spins this, the higher wages will result in fewer jobs and an increase in unemployment.\n\nAlthough the national unemployment rate is 5.8 percent, the unemployment rate for workers paid at minimum wage is more than three times that figure. Teenage unemployment is about 19 percent.\n\nHow will amnesty negatively affect unemployment?\n\nThe President recently issued executive orders which will give legal status to almost 5 million adults. Obama pointed out that these people will now be able to avoid deportation, come out from the shadows, and be legally hired by employers.\n\nThey are not, however, entitled to the benefits offered Americans citizens. This means an employer does not have to offer these workers health care benefits. So who are you going to hire \u2014 the American who comes with extra costs, or the amnestied immigrant who you can pay minimum wage?\n\nRead More: Immigration reform is needed, but executive action is not the answer\n\nStarting in January when the employer mandate kicks in, companies will have to offer health care benefits to any employee working more than 30 hours per week, or pay a fine of $2,000 to $3,000 per year per employee. As a result, if the firm hires these new, now-quasilegal immigrants, they can avoid paying for health benefits and avoid paying the fine, since those immigrants are not entitled to this benefit.\n\nIn addition, the immigrants will generally work for lower wages, putting downward pressure on all wages. The bottom line is that there will be fewer jobs available to American citizens, leading to higher unemployment of Americans when amnesty gluts the job market.\n\nRead More: Obama\u2019s growth recession continues\n\nPresident Obama was never really concerned about an economy that provides good jobs and reduces unemployment. Instead, he pushed a stimulus package that spent close to $1 trillion and didn\u2019t stimulate anything, eventually saying that the shovel ready jobs were not as shovel ready as he thought.\n\nHe pushed through the disastrous ACA by deceiving the American public. While this act has provided health insurance to about 7 million previously uninsured, it has driven up costs, reduced the quality of healthcare and increased taxes for more than 250 million Americans.\n\nWith the new Congress being sworn into office in about a month, the hope is that these policies can be reversed so that the health care system is repaired, the immigration laws revised and wages can be set according to the value of the output of the worker rather than by some artificial floor set by the government.\n\nMost importantly, the new Congress should concentrate on policies to encourage economic growth rather than holding it back. That\u2019s really the only long-term solution to the unemployment problem.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although he continues to say otherwise, by examining the effects of his policies, it is easy to conclude that he really is not concerned with getting people", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Michael Busler", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Although he continues to say otherwise, by examining the effects of his policies, it is easy to conclude that he really is not concerned with getting people back to work.", "title": "How ObamaCare, minimum wage and amnesty will ruin America", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/business-2/economics-economy/how-obamacare-minimum-wage-and-amnesty-will-ruin-america-30566/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/obama-hmm.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although he continues to say otherwise, by examining the effects of his policies, it is easy to conclude that he really is not concerned with getting people back to work.", "title": "How ObamaCare, minimum wage and amnesty will ruin America", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/obama-hmm-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@mbusler", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "amnesty,obamacare,affordable care act,minimum wage,unemployment,employment,immigration", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-29T20:47:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-30T00:50:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Amnesty, Minimum wage, unemployment"}, "article_summary": "The President raised the minimum wage for Federal workers and wants the national minimum wage raised to $10.10 per hour, up from the current level of $7.25.\nSome of the President\u2019s advisors want the minimum wage raised even higher, perhaps to $15 per hour.\nSo who are you going to hire \u2014 the American who comes with extra costs, or the amnestied immigrant who you can pay minimum wage?\nAlthough the national unemployment rate is 5.8 percent, the unemployment rate for workers paid at minimum wage is more than three times that figure.\nAs a result, the number of people receiving welfare and food stamps has explodedRead More: The next Obamacare deception will clobber the productive middle classWhy doesn\u2019t an increased minimum wage help?"}
