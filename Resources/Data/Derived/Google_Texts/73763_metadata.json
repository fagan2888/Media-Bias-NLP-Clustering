It\u2019s a creation of the Legislature, a not-for-profit, tax-exempt government insurer backed up by the full faith and credit of the taxpayers of Florida.\n\nBy 2013, legislators felt the government insurer had become much too large, holding 1 in every 5 homeowners\u2019 policies. They felt it was unfairly competing with private business and had exposed the state to excessive potential losses of $406 billion, according to a legislative report.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s solution was to rapidly force Citizens\u2019 customers into a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d where insurers, many of them new startups, could shop for homeowners, and homeowners would have no choice but to accept their offers, so long as they were comparable.\n\nAs the Post\u2019s Charles Elmore reported Tuesday, the clearinghouse works opposite of the Obamacare health insurance exchanges.\n\nInstead of consumers having the ability to shop for the best-run, most stable of the private insurance companies, it\u2019s the insurers that get to choose the policies they like.\n\nThe insurance companies divvying up the clearinghouse policies aren\u2019t exactly top-tier. Many could qualify as startups. They keep the minimum amount of cash in reserves on hand and rely on offshore reinsurance companies to pay claims in a disaster of any size.\n\nA state safety net pays claims if they become insolvent, something that seems likely \u2013 it has already happened to eight out of 22 Citizens takeout insurers, even without a major storm. The profits are what\u2019s privatized. The risk stays with the public.\n\nThere are several ratings companies that evaluate the health of the insurers. The most-cited is Demotech, which is paid by the insurance companies. Demotech\u2019s highest rating is A-double prime unsurpassed.\n\n\u201cIf somebody wants a company that absolutely, positively is going to be there, get an A-double-prime company,\u201d said company president Joseph Petreli.\n\nSo how many of the Citizens clearinghouse insurers meet that standard?\n\nNone.\n\nThe only one on the list that meets Demotech\u2019s second-highest rating, A-prime unsurpassed, is Safe Harbor. The rest were rated A-Exceptional.\n\nIf it sounds like Demotech gives every company an \u201cA,\u201d it\u2019s because they basically do \u2013 those that aren\u2019t As don\u2019t want to be listed and don\u2019t pay. The paying insurance companies gladly report their \u201cA Execptional\u201d ratings on their web site without explaining that it\u2019s the third highest rating, more like a \u201cC.\u201d\n\nConsumers will want to do their homework if they are plucked from Citizens by one of these clearinghouse insurers. Not that they have much of a choice.\n\nObamacare may have its flaws but doesn\u2019t it feel more \u201cfree\u201d than this clearinghouse?", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Opinion Zone", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://opinionzone.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2014/09/26/citizens-clearinghouse-or-obamacares-marketplace-which-is-more-free/", "image": "http://cmgpbpopinionzone.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo-2004-blue-roofs.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Citizens Insurance is supposed to be Florida\u2019s wind-storm insurer of last resort.
