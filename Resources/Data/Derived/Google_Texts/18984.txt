Kathleen Kinslow, CEO of Aria Health (the former Frankford hospital group in Northeast Philly), knows rising health insurance premiums, especially for small firms, "remain a strain on many businesses." But the Affordable Care Act has also "created unbelievable opportunities" for hospital networks to attract more insured patients and more employer and provider partners, Kinslow told Greater Philadlephia Chamber of Commerce members at this morning's yearly economic outlook breakfast.

That's not enough to keep all our familiar hospitals in business: "In this area, there will be a lot of consolidation," Kinslow told the crowd. Remember how the city's banks merged and sold to out-of-state companies in the 1980s and 1990s? The hospital situation "is parallel to that," Kinslow added. "Some hospitals are doing very well. Some are not... We are still slightly overbedded in this region. You will see some closures."

She gave Obamacare credit for shifting the focus of the healthcare industry from making sure it works for doctors and other providers, to "finally put(ting) the patient in the middle of the conversation" by expanding coverage for people with chronic diseases, adult children and more poor people: "All those are real positives."

Kinslow is concerned that too many people are still choosing the lower-cost, high-deductible plans, and then delaying or refusing doctor-recommended procedures when they realize they'll have to pay $5,000 or $10,000 out-of-pocket.

But overall, the Aria chief expects that the aspects of the law that are still "problematic, will correct themselves" as doctors, insurers, hospitals, employers keep adapting. The health system will "look very different in the next several years."
