After all, their elected officials consistently have embarrassingly low approval ratings. The latest approval rating for Congress was at a dismal 18 percent, according to Real Clear Politics. That\u2019s actually an improvement from the end of last year when approval was just 13 percent, topping the record low of 9 percent during the government shutdown in 2013.\n\nRelated: Top Problem for Americans Now\u2014U.S. Government\n\nPresident Obama hasn\u2019t fared well either. His approval rating has hovered in the low 40\u2019s for months\u2014especially after the midterm elections when it hit 40 percent.\n\n\u201cWhile dissatisfaction with government is by no means a new issue to the American people, it has not in recent months been as clearly the leading problem as it is now, given that fewer Americans mention the economy,\u201d Gallup\u2019s Justin McCarthy wrote in a post.\n\nThe economy has slowly moved down the list as it begins to improve. About 11 percent of people list it as the top problem this month\u2014down from 16 percent in February.\n\nThe public\u2019s opinion of other issues, like health care, has also improved.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite international turmoil, threats from extreme terror groups, economic inequality", "title": "Americans Say Their Biggest Problem Is Their Government", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/12/Americans-Say-Their-Biggest-Problem-Their-Government", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10312013_Puck_Gridlock_Partisan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/12/Americans-Say-Their-Biggest-Problem-Their-Government", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10312013_Puck_Gridlock_Partisan.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Despite international turmoil, threats from extreme terror groups, economic inequality", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The latest approval rating for Congress was at a dismal 18 percent, according to Real Clear Politics.\nHis approval rating has hovered in the low 40\u2019s for months\u2014especially after the midterm elections when it hit 40 percent.\nAfter all, their elected officials consistently have embarrassingly low approval ratings.\nRelated: Top Problem for Americans Now\u2014U.S.\nA new Gallup poll released this morning reveals that for the fourth consecutive month more Americans\u201418 percent\u2014identify the government as the country\u2019s biggest problem, beating out the economy and unemployment."}
