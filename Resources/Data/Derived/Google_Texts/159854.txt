Meridian Mayor Percy Bland will nominate former police chief Benny Dubose as the city's new police chief.

Mayor Bland tells Newscenter 11 he will present Dubose to the city council during a meeting scheduled for Tuesday morning. The council members will then vote on whether to approve the nomination.

Newscenter 11 reached out to multiple council members on Sunday afternoon for comment about Dubose's pending nomination. All declined to comment.

Dubose served as police chief for several years before he was fired in 2009 by the city's former mayor, Cheri Barry. Dubose was replaced by Lee Shelbourn, who served as chief until June 2012. Shelbourn was replaced by James Reed the following month. Reed resigned in February 2013 for personal reasons. Bland nominated James Lee as chief in July 2013. Lee was fired in May 2014.

Tuesday's city council meeting is scheduled for 9 a.m. on the third floor of Meridian City Hall.
