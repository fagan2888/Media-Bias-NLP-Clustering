Some of the things that [the auditors] found were a byproduct of our caution.\u201d\n\nReport for Congress\n\nThe issues were identified as part of an audit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Office of Inspector General conducted on three exchanges -- Access Health CT, the federal marketplace used by 36 states, and California\u2019s exchange, Covered California. Congress required the auditors to report on the effectiveness of safeguards to prevent people from submitting inaccurate or fraudulent data when applying for health insurance.\n\nThe findings -- along with a separate report that found that the federal exchange had been unable to resolve 2.6 million application inconsistencies in the first three months of open enrollment because of problems with the eligibility system -- are likely to generate renewed criticism of the rollout of the health law.\n\n\u201cThe reports underscore the perils of the administration\u2019s incompetence, the reckless rollout, and the systemic disregard for taxpayer dollars,\u201d U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a Michigan Republican, said in a statement.\n\nIn their report on the Connecticut, California and federal exchanges, the auditors raised questions about exchanges\u2019 ability to verify applicants\u2019 residency and family size after finding that the three exchanges relied solely on the information that applicants provided. According to the auditors\u2019 report, Access Health officials said the federal government had not identified a data source to use to verify applicants\u2019 residency, although the exchange said it verifies that the addresses people give are valid.\n\nThe report also noted that exchanges rely on applicants\u2019 information about family size without verifying it. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the exchanges, had planned to use data from the Internal Revenue Service to verify family size, but determined it might not correspond to actual family seize, according to the auditors.\n\nThe audit identified three areas of deficiency in the internal controls used by federal and Connecticut exchanges, and five in California\u2019s exchange, as well as additional issues that weren\u2019t directly related to internal controls. The examination covered October through December 2013, the first three months of the open-enrollment period for health plans sold by the exchanges.\n\nThe auditors noted that deficiencies they found don\u2019t necessarily mean people enrolled in coverage improperly because other mechanisms exist that could remedy problems.\n\nInaccurate eligibility determinations\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nDuring the period covered by the audit, 34,095 people signed up for private insurance through Access Health, according to the audit report. But some had problems, according to the report.\n\nThere were 223 people who were eligible for Medicaid, but who Access Health inaccurately determined were eligible to buy private insurance with financial aid from the federal government. The exchange also inaccurately determined that 619 people who selected catastrophic health plans were eligible for federal help reducing their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs, even though those discounts can\u2019t be used on catastrophic plans.\n\nAccess Health officials said they found soon after open enrollment began that the system was determining that some applicants were eligible for both Medicaid and discounted private insurance if changes were made to their applications after they were submitted. The exchange said the issue was corrected on Dec. 21, before anyone\u2019s coverage began. Sigal said people were contacted and asked to re-enroll.\n\nSigal said the problem with catastrophic plans occurred because of a coding error that was later fixed. The auditors reported that customers weren\u2019t affected because the insurance companies didn\u2019t apply the cost-sharing reductions to the plans.\n\nDelays in sending information to insurers\n\nThe auditors also reported that Access Health didn\u2019t promptly send insurance companies the enrollment records of 139 applicants. According to the auditors, this occurred because the exchange staff identified issues with the applications but didn\u2019t inform the staff responsible for correcting the issues. Some applicants later told the exchange that insurers hadn\u2019t received their information, the auditors wrote.\n\nAccess Health ultimately resolved the issues for 121 of the applicants and sent their information to the insurers, but the exchange was unable to reach the other 18 despite making three attempts.\n\nSigal said the applicant information was held back from the carriers so exchange staff could address the problems in the files. He said he didn\u2019t know if the people responsible for fixing the files hadn\u2019t been informed about them, as the auditors reported.\n\nThere was \u201ca lot of stuff going on here while we were trying to scramble, get people enrolled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may have keyed in on some of the controlled chaos that was happening.\u201d\n\nTelephone identity verification\n\nThe auditors also took issue with the way Connecticut handles applicants\u2019 calls. Federal guidance calls for state exchanges to conduct \u201cidentity proofing\u201d before accepting phone or online applications, to assure that the right person has access to restricted data. In the case of one applicant who applied by phone, whose case was examined by the auditors, Access Health didn\u2019t perform identity proofing in accordance with the federal guidance, the auditors wrote.\n\nAccess Health officials disagreed with the auditors\u2019 view that the internal controls weren\u2019t effective.\n\nSigal said the exchange decided not to verify new applicants\u2019 identities at the beginning of a phone call because it would slow down the process. Sometimes, people call because they\u2019re having trouble using the exchange\u2019s website, and having to go through identity proofing first would have made the phone call and wait times longer, Sigal said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t begin to solve their issue if you\u2019re going to have difficulty right away with identity proofing,\u201d he said.\n\nBut exchange officials noted that people\u2019s identity is verified when they submit their applications. And if someone calls back after submitting an application, identity proofing is done, they said.\n\nAfter reviewing Access Health\u2019s response, the auditors said they stood by their recommendation that the exchange develop a procedure to perform identity proofing of phone applicants consistent with federal guidance.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/07/01/federal-auditors-question-access-health-cts-internal-controls/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Steven Sigal, U.S. Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Office of Inspector General", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/07/01/federal-auditors-question-access-health-cts-internal-controls/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Federal auditors reported Tuesday that they found deficiencies in the internal controls used by the health insurance exchanges run by Connecticut, California and the federal government.
