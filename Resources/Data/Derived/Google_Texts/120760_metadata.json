The church learned that it had to refinance because of the name change, and Origen was patient while Beacon unsuccessfully searched for a lender, Akpassa said.\n\nIn September, 2014, \u201cwe came to a decision that we couldn\u2019t keep it, and then we were OK with that,\u201d said the pastor. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t God\u2019s will . we\u2019d move somewhere else with less responsibility.\u201d Soon they were offered a meeting place rent-free.\n\n\u201cWell, Sept. 19 was our final answer, and we told them we just can\u2019t do it and we\u2019re going to let it go,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cIt was already on the market to be auctioned off in November.\u201d\n\nThe congregation decided its last there Sunday would be Oct. 26. Two weeks before, they would celebrate Akpassa\u2019s second anniversary as pastor and her birthday.\n\nThen the pastor\u2019s nephew who serves on the church board received an email from Origen with an offer to give Beacon the church. Origen officials planned to fly in the next day for a meeting, which was so brief that Pastor Akpassa missed it when she drove her daughter to school.\n\nBut the news was good. On the anniversary Sunday, she told the congregation that Origen gave them the church.\n\n\u201cWe figured the asset was better off in their hands,\u201d said Jordan Fallman of Origen. \u201cI had a chance personally to go and meet the congregation and the heads of the church out there, and it seemed to me that they have a positive effect on their community and they\u2019re a warm, growing congregation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you talk about rejoicing,\u201d Akpassa said. The congregation \u201cran around the church in tears. My mother, who was our former first lady, I had to hold her up because I knew she was really hurting to leave the church. . Our heart is this community; it really is. We all pretty much come from this community, born and raised somewhere near here.\u201d\n\nThe pastor said that \u201cWe did a lot of thanking them, a lot of thank yous. It took a load off. Of course, the building needed some work, it\u2019s an old building, but with the release of that amount of money a month for a mortgage, it helps us to do the things we need to do for it.\u201d\n\nThe ownership shift, according to real estate records, has Bethel Apostolic Temple selling the property on Dec. 29 to Origen Bancroft LLC, part of Origen Ventures, for no cost other than a 50-cent transfer fee. On Dec. 30, Beacon Churches International bought it from Origen, again at no cost.\n\nThe building has undergone change before.\n\n\u201cI went here when I was young, really, really young. I\u2019m talking, like, 3 and 4 years old. I remember it looked totally different back then,\u201d said Monique TaChae of Beacon\u2019s administrative team, who returned to the church two years ago, after college. \u201cI love the change and everything that\u2019s going on with the church. I\u2019m just excited to be a part of the movement.\u201d\n\nBethel formally bought the former Bancroft United Methodist Church in 1989, according to Lucas County records, with the selling price $155,000, but The Blade reported that the United Methodists agreed to the sale in 1979. Akpassa said that Bethel rented before making the 1989 purchase. Built in 1930, the church had also been home to United Brethren and Evangelical United Brethren congregations.\n\nAkpassa became the pastor after her father retired as the church\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cI never had an ambition to be a pastor or was looking for it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said that Beacon now would like to have a weekend flea market along with vendors selling fresh fruit and vegetables in the summer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a big property out here; we want to use it,\u201d Akpassa said.\n\n\u201cLook for us in a big way. We\u2019re going to come out into our community. We\u2019re going to be out of these four walls a lot, and be out serving our people and serving our community.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Blade, http://www.toledoblade.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "The congregation of the Beacon Church received a special gift in early January: It got the deed to its property.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/15/real-estate-firm-gives-ohio-church-deed-to-propert/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The congregation of the Beacon Church received a special gift in early January: It got the deed to its property.", "title": "Real estate firm gives Ohio church deed to property"}, "twitter": {"description": "The congregation of the Beacon Church received a special gift in early January: It got the deed to its property.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Real estate firm gives Ohio church deed to property"}, "Author": "TK BARGER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3af7\"", "article_summary": "TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) - The congregation of the Beacon Church received a special gift in early January: It got the deed to its property.\n\u201cI went here when I was young, really, really young.\nThen the pastor\u2019s nephew who serves on the church board received an email from Origen with an offer to give Beacon the church.\nBethel Apostolic Temple, which the church was known as until recently, had large debt, and Origen acquired the mortgage when the church changed its name to Beacon.\nOn the anniversary Sunday, she told the congregation that Origen gave them the church."}
