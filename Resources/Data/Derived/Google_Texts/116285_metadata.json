Gabreski Airport in Westhampton, according to Federal Aviation Administration records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe chopper \u2013 estimated to be worth around $7 million \u2013 also flew to East Hampton\u2019s airport on June 30th and Newport, RI, on July 13th, the records show.\n\nGabreski Airport is a busy stopover for Hamptons visitors like Mr. Bloomberg, who owns a mansion in Southampton, a 20-minute drive from the airport.\n\n\u201cIt is a seasonal airport. We generally get not only helicopters but corporate jets, mainly from Memorial Day to Labor Day,\u201d said Gabreski Airport\u2019s manager, Anthony C. Ceglio.\n\n\u201cWe are still open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, throughout the year,\u201d Mr. Ceglio said. \u201cBut the majority of the traffic is here for the beaches or the summer homes that are open here in the warm months.\u201d\n\nThe airport handles from 1,100 to 1,200 helicopter flights a year, said Mr. Ceglio, who said that with so many flights, he had no recollection of the mayor having visited. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know one from the next,\u201d he said.\n\nNot all the helicopter\u2019s movements are documented. The FAA may not have records of flights when a pilot does not file a flight plan, or is not in contact with air controllers. There\u2019s also no official record of who piloted the helicopter on the AW109SP\u2019s trips \u2013 though Mr. Bloomberg is a seasoned helicopter pilot.\n\nThe chopper\u2019s first recorded flight was May 28, from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, which is AgustaWestland\u2019s U.S. base, to Morristown Airport in New Jersey, where the helicopter is based, federal records show.\n\nOn May 29, the new chopper hopped around the area, from Morristown Airport to La Guardia Airport, the East 34th Street Heliport and finally to Westhampton. The chopper made another trip on May 30 from Morristown directly to Westhampton, the records show.\n\nOn June 30, it flew from Westhampton to Westchester County Airport in White Plains, and on July 2 it made a trip from Westhampton to Morristown, the records show.\n\nOn July 13, the helicopter was recorded as flying from La Guardia Airport to Newport. It flew from Morristown to Baltimore, MD on July 23, the records show.\n\nThe AW109SP was registered in June to Wing & Rotor Transportation Holdings LLC, according to FAA records. Other aircraft owned by that company, according to an FAA database, are operated by Bloomberg Services LLC. And aircraft operated by Bloomberg Services LLC are used by Mr. Bloomberg and executives at Bloomberg LP, the mayor\u2019s private financial-information firm, according to a person aware of the matter.\n\nThe cost of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s travel on the planes, even for city business, is paid by the mayor, not taxpayers, aides have said.\n\nMarc La Vorgna, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s city hall spokesman, declined comment. A spokesman for Bloomberg LP did not immediately return a message seeking comment.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The new, state-of-the-art helicopter that Mayor Michael Bloomberg has at his disposal was busy flying to vacation hotspots this summer, according to federal records.", "title": "Bloomberg Helicopter Hit The Hamptons, Newport This Summer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/18/bloomberg-helicopter-hit-the-hamptons-newport-this-summer/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AA835_nybloo_G_20131017171720.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Bloomberg Helicopter Hit The Hamptons, Newport This Summer", "description": "The new, state-of-the-art helicopter that Mayor Michael Bloomberg has at his disposal was busy flying to vacation hotspots this summer, according to federal records.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Tom Namako", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The new, state-of-the-art helicopter that Mayor Michael Bloomberg has at his disposal was busy flying to vacation hotspots this summer, according to federal records.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-18T14:26:44-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/18/bloomberg-helicopter-hit-the-hamptons-newport-this-summer/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18816", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The new, state-of-the-art helicopter that Mayor Michael Bloomberg has at his disposal was busy flying to vacation hotspots this summer, according to federal records.", "title": "Bloomberg Helicopter Hit The Hamptons, Newport This Summer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/18/bloomberg-helicopter-hit-the-hamptons-newport-this-summer/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AA835_nybloo_G_20131017171720.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18816", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-18T14:30:58-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c1f\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s also no official record of who piloted the helicopter on the AW109SP\u2019s trips \u2013 though Mr. Bloomberg is a seasoned helicopter pilot.\nGabreski Airport is a busy stopover for Hamptons visitors like Mr. Bloomberg, who owns a mansion in Southampton, a 20-minute drive from the airport.\nAnd aircraft operated by Bloomberg Services LLC are used by Mr. Bloomberg and executives at Bloomberg LP, the mayor\u2019s private financial-information firm, according to a person aware of the matter.\nAn AgustaWestland AW109SPBy Bill SandersonThe new, state-of-the-art helicopter that Mayor Michael Bloomberg has at his disposal was busy flying to vacation hotspots this summer, according to federal records.\nThe chopper \u2013 estimated to be worth around $7 million \u2013 also flew to East Hampton\u2019s airport on June 30th and Newport, RI, on July 13th, the records show."}
