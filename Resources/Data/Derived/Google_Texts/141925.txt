Wasserstein Acquires Beauty Products Group Paris Presents

The deal follows beauty buys from TPG Growth and Estée Lauder

New York private equity firm Wasserstein & Co. LP has acquired Paris Presents Inc. for an undisclosed amount.

Gurnee, Illinois-based Paris Presents provides branded cosmetic and bath accessories to mass merchants, drug stores, specialty beauty stores and online retailers. The company's brands include Real Techniques, Eco Tools and Body Benefits. Paris Presents' products are sold in the U.S. and more than 20 other countries.

BNP Paribas provided financing for the deal. Jones Day acted as Wasserstein's legal counsel.

Wasserstein made the investment from its third fund. In September, Wasserstein agreed to sell Turtle Mountain LLC, a dairy-free food product company, to White Wave Foods. In July, the firm bought ALM Media, a business to business publication for the legal and commercial real estate markets. In January 2013, the firm bought audio book group Recorded Books LLC for an undisclosed amount.

Other recent consumer goods deals in the beauty space include TPG Growth's investment in Beautycounter, a personal care company, and the Estée Lauder Cos. (NYSE: EL) acquisition of luxury perfume group Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, in November.
