LOUIS, Mo. \u2014 In Saturday night\u2019s game against the St. Louis Blues, Avalanche coach Patrick Roy is sticking with the same lineup that produced Thursday\u2019s 5-0 triumph against the New York Islanders.\n\nThus, Semyon Varlamov is the starter in goal and forward Daniel Briere and defenseman Zach Redmond will be the healthy scratches. Forward Jesse Winchester and defenseman Ryan Wilson remain out with injuries.\n\nRoy isn\u2019t changing a thing. Center Matt Duchene will continue to play with wingers Gabe Landeskog and Ryan O\u2019Reilly on the Nine Line \u2014 sweater numbers 9, 92 and 90, respectively \u2014 and the other lines and defensive pairings are the same from Colorado\u2019s best performance of the young season.\n\nThe Avs (3-4-4) are on a five-game points streak (2-0-3) and Varlamov has led the team to points in his last six starts.\n\nSt. Louis (5-3-1) will be without center Paul Stastny (shoulder), the former Av, and T.J. Oshie (concussion). Blues captain David Backes has been cleared to play after missing Thursday\u2019s 2-0 win over Anaheim with a head injury, and center Joakim Lindstrom (bacteria infection) is questionable.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "On heels of season\u2019s best game, Avs stick with lineup at St. Louis", "title": "On heels of season\u2019s best game, Avs stick with lineup at St. Louis", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/01/on-heels-of-seasons-best-game-avs-stick-with-lineup-at-st-louis/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141101_125418_matt-duchene.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141101_125418_matt-duchene.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-01T12:52:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T17:14:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd51c\"", "article_summary": "ST.
