(KTVI) - When you look at the St. Louis skyline, the image of the Gateway Arch is unmistakably St. Louis. The Arch is the symbol of this city and also an iconic architectural site.

Now is your chance to express what you think about the Arch with a new project called the "My Arch Story" project.

Fox 2 discusses the project with Ryan McClure from City Arch River.
