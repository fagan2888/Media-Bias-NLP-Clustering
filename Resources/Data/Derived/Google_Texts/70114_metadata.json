By 2013, that number had plunged to 46.3 percent. In 2000, Michigan\u2019s median income, adjusted for inflation, was $61,551. By 2013 the number plummeted to $48,273.\n\nThe middle class, according to Pew, is defined as those Americans earning between \u201c67 percent and 200 percent\u201d of a state\u2019s median income.\n\nCongressman Tim Walberg, R-MI-7, puts part of the blame for the declining fortunes of his constituents on the spiraling growth of the federal government during the Obama administration\u2019s tenure.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama sent Congress a $4 trillion big government wish list. His budget had all the hallmarks of an unserious proposal; namely, a $2.1 trillion tax increase and a $2.4 trillion spending increase. We should be helping middle class families increase their take-home pay, not asking them and their children to shoulder a bigger tax and debt burden,\u201d stated Walberg in a Hillsdale Daily News op-ed.\n\nWalberg also singles out the Affordable Care Act for downsizing full-time employment from 40 hours per week to 30 hours.\n\nThe state of Michigan, however, isn\u2019t exactly a bastion of economic freedom. Despite the current Republican Gov. Rick Snyder signing right-to-work measures and reforming personal property taxes, Michigan, unlike Florida and Texas, still has a state income tax.\n\nMichigan could also stand to be more accommodating of Main Street entrepreneurs. Thumbtack.com\u2019s 2013 Small Business Friendliness Survey gave the Great Lakes State a cumulative grade of D due, in part, to its onerous regulations and tax code.\n\nManufacturing jobs, once the backbone of the Rust Belt, are also waning. Michigan Capitol Confidential, a free-market blog, reported last year, \u201cThe auto industry accounted for one of every 13.5 jobs in Michigan in 2000, but just one in 24.5 jobs in 2014.\u201d\n\nThe Pew map also notes increases in the cost of housing. In 2000, 24 percent of households in Michigan spent at least 30 percent of their income on housing, but by 2013 that number had climbed to 31 percent of households. The Tax Foundation, an independent policy research outfit, has listed Michigan among the \u201cworst states\u201d for property taxes (matched to the value of the home).\n\nIf the current leadership in Lansing hope to retain control of Michigan\u2019s political reins, numbers like these will have to improve.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The drop in income and middle class households in Michigan from 2000 to 2013 calls for a re-evaluation of the state's policy decisions.", "title": "American Dream shrinking for Michigan's middle class - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/shutterstock_153027737.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-25T14:35:08+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/208352/middle-class-michigan/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "tag": "Jobs,Middle Class,property taxes", "published_time": "2015-03-25T14:31:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T14:35:08+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The drop in income and middle class households in Michigan from 2000 to 2013 calls for a re-evaluation of the state's policy decisions.", "title": "American Dream shrinking for Michigan's middle class - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/shutterstock_153027737.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The drop in income and middle class households in Michigan from 2000 to 2013 calls for a re-evaluation of the state's policy decisions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd4b\"", "article_summary": "The middle class, according to Pew, is defined as those Americans earning between \u201c67 percent and 200 percent\u201d of a state\u2019s median income.\nHis budget had all the hallmarks of an unserious proposal; namely, a $2.1 trillion tax increase and a $2.4 trillion spending increase.\nBy Izzy Lyman | Watchdog ArenaMichigan\u2019s middle class is shrinking, according to a map produced by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-profit organization dedicated to \u201cinvigorating civic life.\u201dIn 2000, the percentage of Michigan households that were categorized as \u201cmiddle class\u201d was 50.6 percent.\nWe should be helping middle class families increase their take-home pay, not asking them and their children to shoulder a bigger tax and debt burden,\u201d stated Walberg in a Hillsdale Daily News op-ed.\nIf the current leadership in Lansing hope to retain control of Michigan\u2019s political reins, numbers like these will have to improve."}
