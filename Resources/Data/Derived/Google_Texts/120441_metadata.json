Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) trying to pass a national labelling law for genetically-modified organisms (GMOs)? Well, to appease Europe of course.\n\nFrom the American Farm Bureau to the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a lot of the people who run America\u2019s food system say we need Pompeo\u2019s bill to stop the spread of a patchwork of state-level GMO labelling laws. But it\u2019s not as though these laws have been a runaway success. Many were voted down, and the ones that passed face court challenges, leading many to suggest Pompeo\u2019s bill is like taking a sledgehammer to a fly.\n\nWhatever happened to informing voters before they go to the ballot box? And why isn\u2019t Pompeo invoking the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (Article I, \u00a7 8) which precludes states from interfering in interstate commerce?\n\nRick Tolman, former CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, says stopping local anti-GMO measures is only part of Pompeo\u2019s goal. America\u2019s trade relations also have to be considered. But how exactly does a law that applies only to Americans bear upon our trade relations?\n\n\"Nothing but a front\"\n\nAlas, it turns out the GMO-labelling portion of Pompeo\u2019s bill is nothing but a front. It\u2019s actually an international trade bill in disguise. Buried within H.R. 1599 is the following:\n\nThe Secretary shall promulgate regulations to specify a maximum permissible level of food consisting of a bioengineered organism that may be inadvertently present in food bearing claims [that bioengineering was not used]. (SEC. 425, emphasis added.)\n\nA threshold limit on something renders it a potential contaminant, and you can rest assured America would not be the world leader in GMO farming today had GMO crops been labelled as contaminants when introduced in the 1990s. This codification of a maximum permissible level will make it possible, for the first time ever in America, for organic farmers to sue their neighbors when their neighbors\u2019 GMO crops \u201ccontaminate\u201d their organic crop above that level.\n\nBut if GMOs actually pose a threat to organic crops, would it not behoove Pompeo to include the precise point at which this threat becomes reality? Instead, the bill leaves it to \u201cThe Secretary,\u201d a political appointee, to \u201cpromulgate regulations\u201d after this law is passed, reminiscent of when Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of Obamacare that \"We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d\n\nArbitrary limit\n\nThe reason Pompeo avoids being specific is because he knows full well any such limit will be arbitrary. GMOs pose no threat to organic crops. Nonetheless, here's the European Union\u2019s regulation that will be cribbed in order to maintain America\u2019s trade relations with anti-GMO nations:\n\nOrganic production outlaws the use of genetically modified organisms. However, the regulation on genetically modified food and feed lays down a threshold (0.9%) under which a product's GMO content does not have to be indicated. [Only] Products with GMO content below this threshold can be labelled organic.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how you screw American GMO farmers while facilitating \u201cregulatory cooperation\u201d with Europe, Japan, China and Russia.\n\nElitist leaders in these anti-GMO nations prevent their farmers from growing GMOs even as they import millions of tons of GMOs from America every year. And they have now managed to force a Republican and a Democrat (G.K. Butterfield) to join hands here in America to pass a law that ostensibly allows for the voluntary labelling of GMO foods, but which is really designed to force America to adopt a European-style, make-believe threshold limit on GMOs in organic food.\n\nAn American invention\n\nAmerica invented GMOs. And we\u2019re the leader in this field precisely because we do not have a threshold limit on GMO content. Why would we? Even European scientists say GMOs are perfectly safe. As such, American organic stakeholders agreed not to set a threshold limit for GMO \u201ccontamination\u201d of an organic crop back in 1997 during President Clinton\u2019s second term when America\u2019s National Organic Program (NOP) was written.\n\nSynthetic pesticides, by contrast, do have a threshold limit because they can be dangerous. But GMOs are not. So American organic farmers are only prevented from making use of GMOs, and can\u2019t claim damage from them. And by all accounts, this arrangement has served the American organic industry very well, resulting in \u201cremarkable growth domestically and globally.\u201d\n\nBut, alas, activists want more. They want it all in fact. And by caving in to them, Pompeo and Butterfield are not only trashing the 2002 bipartisan Act of Congress that passed America\u2019s NOP into law; they\u2019re also putting the future of every American GMO farm on the line, while providing a huge disincentive for researchers to develop new GMO crops. Indeed, where are the farmers crazy enough to grow new GMO crops when the threat of a lawsuit hangs over their heads?\n\nGMO labelling is bad for America whether at the state or federal level, which is why organic activists are so muted in their opposition to Pompeo\u2019s bill. It plays right into their hands.\n\n---\n\nMischa Popoff is a former organic farmer and USDA-contract organic inspector, and is the author of \"Is it Organic?\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/browserconfig.9a449e447575.xml", "description": "Why is Rep.
