Last year, the state exchange helped 73,000 Nevadans find coverage.\n\n\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell offered a national perspective.\n\n\n\n\"Since the ACA's provisions have taken effect and before this open-enrollment even began, an estimated 17.6 million Americans have found health coverage,\" she said. \"That includes 4 million Latinos. Nationally, with this progress, we've reached the lowest levels of uninsured on record.\"\n\n\n\nShe said the Latino community still suffers from higher rates of asthma, diabetes and certain cancers compared with the general population. Advocates hope that increased access to primary care and cancer screenings will level out these disparities.\n\n\n\nMore information is online at NevadaHealthLink.com.\n\nSuzanne Potter, Public News Service - NV", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAS VEGAS - Nevada has about 350,000 uninsured residents, by some estimates, and close to 40 percent of them are Latino.
