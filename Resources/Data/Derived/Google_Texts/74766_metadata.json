We\u2019ll see if at the end of November, if they meet their additional promises, but once it does work, there\u2019s no guarantee policies will be attractive to people.\u201d\n\nBut Davis says he\u2019s not part of the political debate.\n\nHe just wants to help people. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is a lot of enthusiasm for ACA.\u201d\n\nAfter President Obama\u2019s meeting late Wednesday afternoon at Temple Emanu-El, he will attend two fundraisers in Dallas, the main purpose of his trip. He will then return to the White House.\n\nLatest News:\n\nTop Trending:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid all of the controversy surrounding the troubled roll-out of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama will meet Wednesday with North Texas volunteers to thank them for helping to spread the word about the healthcare reform law.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/11/04/president-obama-visiting-dallas-to-thank-affordable-care-act-volunteers/", "image": {"width": 594, "secure_url": "https://cbsdallas.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/178936792.jpg?w=594", "identifier": "https://cbsdallas.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/178936792.jpg?w=594", "height": 392}, "type": "article", "description": "Amid all of the controversy surrounding the troubled roll-out of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama will meet Wednesday with North Texas volunteers to thank them for helping to spread the word about the healthcare reform law.", "title": "President Obama To Thank Affordable Care Act Volunteers During Dallas Visit"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSDFW", "image": "https://cbsdallas.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/178936792.jpg?w=594", "description": "Amid all of the controversy surrounding the troubled roll-out of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama will meet Wednesday with North Texas volunteers to thank them for helping to spread the word about the healthcare reform law.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "President Obama To Thank Affordable Care Act Volunteers During Dallas Visit"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of DFW", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Dallas / Fort Worth", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSDFW", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSDFW"}, "keywords": "health, local, news, politics, syndicated local, texas, watch + listen, affordable care act, governor rick perry, healthcare reform, jack fink, judge clay jenkins, medicaid, obamacare, president obama, temple emanu-el, volunteers", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d84b3f65c780e092277ee393cdbaeb66?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, governor rick perry, healthcare reform, jack fink, judge clay jenkins, medicaid, obamacare, president obama, temple emanu-el, volunteers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee0f\"", "article_summary": "Dallas County Republican Party Chairman Wade Emmert says the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t work.\nDALLAS (CBS 11 NEWS) \u2013 Amid all of the controversy surrounding the troubled roll-out of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama will meet Wednesday with North Texas volunteers to thank them for helping to spread the word about the healthcare reform law.\nWe\u2019ll see if at the end of November, if they meet their additional promises, but once it does work, there\u2019s no guarantee policies will be attractive to people.\u201dBut Davis says he\u2019s not part of the political debate.\nGovernor Rick Perry and the Legislature aren\u2019t expanding Medicaid, the health program for the poor.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is a lot of enthusiasm for ACA.\u201dAfter President Obama\u2019s meeting late Wednesday afternoon at Temple Emanu-El, he will attend two fundraisers in Dallas, the main purpose of his trip."}
