Gene Green (D-Texas) both urged the EPA to hurry. \u201cIf there was one message you can send up the chain, it\u2019s that we\u2019d like to have something maybe earlier than 2017,\u201d Upton said. \u201cThat\u2019s a long ways off.\u201d\n\nBeauvais did offer a hint to one possible revision. Green noted that the current rule \u201crequires corrective action when high lead levels are found but does not penalize systems for those initial high lead levels.\u201d He asked Beauvais if he the EPA\u2019s revision would \u201cinclude changes to incentivize systems to prevent lead contamination, not just a remedy if it\u2019s found?\u201d Beauvais said he expects the new rule to include that change.\n\nBut the lead contamination problem in Flint should have been prevented under the current rule, according to Beauvais. As it stands now, the rule would not have allowed the city, under the state government\u2019s direction, to change water sources to the Flint River without applying corrosion control.\n\nBeauvais said the agency received recommendations for revisions to its rule in December from the National Drinking Water Advisory Council. Green questioned why five months could pass and still leave the agency nearly a year away from finishing the revision.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "A representative from the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday was hesitant to say how quickly the agency could propose a revision to its lead and copper rule in the wake of the Flint, Mich., water crisis. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to say is that we expect to propose in 2017, and I certainly hope that... read more", "title": "Lawmakers Urge EPA for Faster Revision on Lead and Copper Rule - Morning Consult", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/themes/morning-consult/img/MC_logo_twitter_fb.png", "url": "https://morningconsult.com/alert/lawmakers-urge-epa-faster-revision-lead-copper-rule/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A representative from the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday was hesitant to say how quickly the agency could propose a revision to its lead and copper rule in the wake of the Flint, Mich., water crisis. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to say is that we expect to propose in 2017, and I certainly hope that... read more", "title": "Lawmakers Urge EPA for Faster Revision on Lead and Copper Rule - Morning Consult", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/themes/morning-consult/img/MC_logo_twitter_fb.png", "creator": "@morningconsult", "site": "@morningconsult", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Morning-Consult-183517831660100/", "section": "Energy"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf there was one message you can send up the chain, it\u2019s that we\u2019d like to have something maybe earlier than 2017,\u201d Upton said.\nBut the lead contamination problem in Flint should have been prevented under the current rule, according to Beauvais.\nGreen questioned why five months could pass and still leave the agency nearly a year away from finishing the revision.\nBeauvais said the agency received recommendations for revisions to its rule in December from the National Drinking Water Advisory Council.\nA representative from the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday was hesitant to say how quickly the agency could propose a revision to its lead and copper rule in the wake of the Flint, Mich., water crisis."}
