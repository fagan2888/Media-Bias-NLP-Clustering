The Lab, DePaul\u2019s breakdancing club, started in 2010 and meets at the Ray on Mondays and Wednesdays. They perform at events together every now and then and have created a bond that needs to be seen to be understood.\n\nThough they meet on campus, The Lab isn\u2019t comprised of only DePaul students. Some of the dancers in attendance were graduates and some were just random friends of the members. One of the dancers was 17-year-old Patrick Blanton, a high school student who discovered The Lab through his friend Frances Herrera-Lim, vice president of the club.\n\nBlanton said he\u2019s only been dancing for five months, though his skill set wouldn\u2019t show it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been dedicated,\u201d Blanton said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been at it and they really help you out a lot.\u201d \u2018\n\nBlanton is an actor for St. Patrick High School\u2019s theater program and said the school doesn\u2019t offer anything like The Lab. In fact, the entire breakdancing community doesn\u2019t do clubs at all.\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s a crew that\u2019s been around for like 32 years and you earn your way [by]smoking the whole crew or trying to at least,\u201d Herrera-Lim said. Crews aren\u2019t as open as The Lab because the breakdancing culture has always been competitive. Over the years crews gather at what\u2019s called a \u201cjam\u201d and battle occasionally for money but oftentimes just for street credibility. During the \u201980s and \u201990s, in the era of Richard \u201cCrazy Legs\u201d Colon and Kenneth \u201cKen Swift\u201d Gabbert, breakers could get as violent as gangs. It is, after all, an art form that infuses street life with music and Kung Fu.\n\nSince breakdancing is extremely competitive and breakers don\u2019t typically help others outside of their crew, it isn\u2019t hard to tell why the scene of The Lab\u2019s meeting felt refreshingly unified. There were a lot of thumps as breakers in the club hit the floor after slipping, along with many people grabbing body parts in pain. Almost instantly another dancer would walk up and ask them to do it again so they could see what went wrong. From there, if they could, they would show each other a better way to do it.\n\nIt was an environment like this that drew DePaul freshman Polly Draganova to the club in November. She heard about a cypher in the Student Center through one of her friends. In a cypher, The Lab turns the music up, gets in a circle, and lets everyone jump in one at a time and do his or her thing. Draganova originally went only to stop by but ended up staying the whole four hours. Club members convinced Draganova to come check out one of the meetings and ensured her that it wasn\u2019t intimidating, which she later found out was true. After one practice she felt welcomed enough to keep going. \u201cThey\u2019re not intimidating,\u201d Draganova said. \u201cThey\u2019ll teach you from whatever level you\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nOne of the many instructors everyone kept addressing was DePaul graduate Peter Elliot. Elliot was involved with The Lab the entirety of his college career and has since become a part of Chicago street crew Phaze II. In the meantime, he regularly attends The Lab\u2019s practices and helps out virtually everyone in the room.\n\nHe walked around the room almost in the way grade school teachers do during a test looking for cheaters. When he would see someone on the verge of needing their \u201cObamacare,\u201d he would stop them and walk them through a move step-by-step. Since it is a school club, Elliot said that the goal is to not get everyone jam ready.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not competitive or anything to be in it, people come and want to hang out,\u201d Elliot said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve noticed, some people kind of sit around and talk the whole time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true. The majority of the group came in and immediately changed shoes and started dancing in the mirror to the mix playing over the large speakers. Others just stood watching the majority of the time as the number of people rose from eight to 21, then back to nine. The vibe in the room felt like an afterschool program. Everyone seemed to have known each other for years though some of them have only been dancing for a few months.\n\nThe Lab welcomes all students and their friends to come check them out on practice days at 9:15 p.m. Everything wraps up at 11 p.m. when The Ray closes usually with a cypher. \u201cWe (breakdance) together and it\u2019s kind of intimate,\u201d Herrera-Lim said. \u201cSo, you can\u2019t help but become a community when it\u2019s your body and your personality put into it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Lab, DePaul\u2019s breakdancing club, started in 2010 and meets at the Ray on Mondays and Wednesdays.", "generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 1.14.3", "og": {"site_name": "The DePaulia", "description": "The Lab, DePaul\u2019s breakdancing club, started in 2010 and meets at the Ray on Mondays and Wednesdays.", "title": "DePaul\u2019s breakdancing club The Lab still going strong", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://depauliaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MG_0201-1.jpg", "height": 365}, "updated_time": "2015-02-15T18:45:19-05:00", "url": "http://depauliaonline.com/2015/02/15/depaul-breakdancing-club-the-lab/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Lab, DePaul\u2019s breakdancing club, started in 2010 and meets at the Ray on Mondays and Wednesdays.", "creator": "@thedepaulia", "image": "http://depauliaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MG_0201-1.jpg", "title": "DePaul\u2019s breakdancing club The Lab still going strong", "site": "@thedepaulia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 108424530298}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDePaulia/", "section": "Features", "tag": "the lab", "published_time": "2015-02-15T17:11:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-15T18:45:19-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Lab, DePaul\u2019s breakdancing club, started in 2010 and meets at the Ray on Mondays and Wednesdays.\nSince it is a school club, Elliot said that the goal is to not get everyone jam ready.\nElliot was involved with The Lab the entirety of his college career and has since become a part of Chicago street crew Phaze II.\nCrews aren\u2019t as open as The Lab because the breakdancing culture has always been competitive.\nOne of the dancers was 17-year-old Patrick Blanton, a high school student who discovered The Lab through his friend Frances Herrera-Lim, vice president of the club."}
