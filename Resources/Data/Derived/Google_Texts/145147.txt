Fraudsters riding a rising tide of consumer identity theft and cyber-crime will steal a shocking $26 billion from 2015 tax refunds this year — the equivalent of about $25 in fraud for each IRS tax return, according to data compiled by the IRS and financial analysts.

The brazen theft is not yet an epidemic, and most of the estimated 250 million filers should safely receive their refunds (the average was $2,800 last year), but the problem is escalating.

The Federal Trade Commission counted a 50 percent surge in identity theft complaints from 2013 to last year, when the caseload hit about 220,000.

The biggest contributor to the rise was tax-refund fraud. It’s the “largest and fastest growing ID theft category” the commission tracks, says FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez.

As the FTC ramps up its crime-busting tactics, other experts have their own advice for filers.

“Computer hygiene is the first step consumers should consider when safeguarding their personal information,” Jason Witty, chief information security officer at U.S. Bank, told The Post. “If consumers kept up with basic computer hygiene, such as updating device software, it would prevent 80 to 90 percent of cyber-attacks.”

Bruce Diner, an accountant and planner at BD Financial Services, says the sooner the return is filed, the less time thieves have to do mischief. “Pick up your returns in person from your accountant,” he said. “Thieves sometimes follow the postman.”

The IRS contacts you by mail, so do not give personal information via phone such as your Social Security number — no matter what your caller ID reads.”
