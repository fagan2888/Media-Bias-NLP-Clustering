I'm not in favor of socialized medicine, so I'm not in favor of Obamacare. But it's the best thing that's happened to this industry in 26 years. It's the biggest tax change, and every person that's impacted -- whether you pay your insurance or you don't pay -- you're required to report that on your tax return, and you have a complex calculation. If you paid your insurance, you get a credit, and that's calculated over 12 months and you have to do each month. And if you haven't paid, you pay a penalty, and that's a complicated issue. It's going to force more people to assisted preparers, away from doing [taxes] yourself, and we charge based on complexity. So I'm torn. I don't think it's good for America, but for our business it's phenomenal.
