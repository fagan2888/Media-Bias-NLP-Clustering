Ricardo Lara is carrying a bill to allow people living in the country illegally to purchase health insurance \u2014 on their own dime \u2014 through the state exchange.\n\nThe proposal needs federal approval to modify the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act, which specifically prohibits such immigrants from joining the exchanges. Lara\u2019s bill SB10 would compel California to seek that approval.\n\nThe measure \u201cis consistent with [President Obama\u2019s] values of immigrant integration,\u201d said Lara. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident we\u2019re going to be able to get this done.\u201d\n\nLara put an urgency clause on the legislation to increase the chances the request will reach Washington, D.C. before Obama leaves office in January. Bills with urgency clauses require a two-thirds majority to pass California\u2019s Legislature, and with the current make-up of the State House, Lara\u2019s measure would need at least a few Republican votes. Its next test is in the Assembly appropriations committee on Wednesday.\n\nLeaders of the California Republican caucus in both legislative chambers declined to comment on whether the bill has enough support to pass. But a Republican strategist said the California GOP might be more likely to support the measure than its national counterpart, to avoid ceding the state\u2019s Latino vote to the Democrats.\n\n\u201cElected Republicans in California know the party has no future in speaking out [against} those issues,\u201d said Rob Stutzman of Stutzman Public Affairs in Sacramento. \u201cThey need to be able to add immigrant voters down the road.\u201d\n\nProponents say they believe they\u2019ll also get Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s signature. He\u2019s signed off on other benefits for undocumented immigrants, including driver\u2019s licenses and student financial aid.\n\nEven if the proposal is approved by California lawmakers, however, it faces significant obstacles after that \u2014 even under the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cIt would be \u2026 a struggle to get a proposal in a form that it could be approved by this administration,\u201d said Michael Kolber, who, as a healthcare associate with the New York law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, advises the private and public sector on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor one thing, public comment and federal review requirements could cause delays, Kolber said.\n\nAnd even if the proposal works its way through that maze and is reviewed by the Obama administration, he said, it may not be approved because of current federal guidelines.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has strict rules for modifying the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They might have been put in place to avoid creating a precedent that opens the door to future changes the current administration would deem \u201cless palatable,\u201d Kolber said.\n\nStill, advocates would rather bet on this administration than risk dealing with a new one \u2014 particularly a Trump administration.\n\nThe fate of the proposal \u201cdoes depend on which president is in the White House, and we\u2019re talking about who\u2019s in the White House in 2017,\u201d Kolber said.\n\nPresumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump says he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and has vowed to deport undocumented immigrants from the United States.\n\nBoth Democratic presidential candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, support the idea of unauthorized immigrants buying unsubsidized health coverage. But whether their administrations would be able to follow through is uncertain.\n\nAdministrative hurdles aside, the proposed change in California would have to withstand the storm of the nation\u2019s immigration debate.\n\nThose who seek stronger immigration controls don\u2019t look kindly on extending benefits to people in the country illegally \u2014 a tack California has repeatedly taken, most recently in the realm of health care: This month, undocumented children will start receiving full Medi-Cal benefits, and dozens of Northern California counties will start covering primary care and prescription drugs for the undocumented.\n\nAllowing adults on the insurance exchange \u201cis another step in California\u2019s relentless effort to \u2026 eliminate any kind of distinction between people who are in the country illegally and people who are here legally,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, media director for the Washington D.C.-based Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\nMehlman said the Covered California proposal could lead to taxpayer-funded health care for people who have violated the law.\n\n\u201cFirst you say they should be eligible, then you come back and say no one can afford it, so now we have to start subsidizing it,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvocates of the change see it entirely differently. California would be opening up a marketplace to potential buyers, not giving a \u201chandout,\u201d said Sonya Schwartz, a research fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families.\n\n\u201cThese immigrants \u201cshould be able to have a basic quality of life,\u201d Schwartz said, adding that their good health is important to everyone.\n\n\u201cThese are families who are in our same supermarket \u2014 we want to make sure they\u2019re getting inoculations,\u201d she said.\n\nAs many as 320,000 immigrants now excluded from coverage on the exchange in California could be in the market to buy plans through Covered California, according to the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center.\n\nThough these immigrants may already purchase health plans on the private individual market, proponents of the change say allowing them to enroll through Covered California would make it easier for families with mixed immigration status. Family members could enroll all at once through the state exchange system \u2014 though Covered California insurance would not necessarily be less expensive than the private market for the ones who are in the country illegally.\n\nThe potential new market for health plans sold on the exchange would include the landscapers, restaurant owners and bakery workers whom Covered California enrollment assistant Adriana Jimenez meets every year in Anaheim.\n\nMany times the parents are here illegally and are ineligible for Covered California or Medi-Cal \u2014 but their kids qualify for coverage, said Jimenez, program director at Give For a Smile, a nonprofit that helps low-income families navigate the healthcare system.\n\nJimenez acknowledged that even if the families were allowed to buy insurance through Covered California, they could be priced out of the market without government subsidies.\n\n\u201cBut at least they [would] have the option to buy something\u201d to cover everyone, she said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
