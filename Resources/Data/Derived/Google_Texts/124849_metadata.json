Secretary General Ban Ki-moon set up the U.N. Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) mission in September to coordinate global efforts.\n\n\"We have not come anywhere close to ending the crisis. We\u2019ve done a lot in 90 days in a very successful response but we have a long and difficult way to go,\" Anthony Banbury told reporters in Accra, where the U.N. mission is based.\n\n\"It's going to go on for not just weeks but some months more. But I believe we will do it in 2015 and we\u2019re going to do it by working very closely not just with governments of the countries but the communities,\" he said.\n\nBanbury will be replaced by veteran humanitarian official Ould Cheikh Ahmed of Mauritania on Saturday.\n\nA spike of cases in Sierra Leone meant UNMEER missed its target of ensuring that by early December 70 percent of all Ebola patients were being treated in isolation units and 70 percent of all those who died from Ebola were buried properly.\n\nBanbury said there were now enough functioning treatment centers in the region.\n\nThe target of 100 percent safe burials by end of January 2015 was on track now that there were some 254 safe burial teams operating in the affected countries.\n\nSix other countries, including Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, the United States, Spain and Britain, have reported cases imported from the worst affected countries.\n\nLast week, a nurse was diagnosed with the virus in Britain upon her return from Sierra Leone. She is being treated with blood plasma from a survivor of the virus and an experimental antiviral drug, according to the London hospital treating her.\n\n(Reporting by Kwasi Kpodo; Editing by David Lewis and Robin Pomeroy)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ebola, anthony banbury, u.n. ebola emergency response, unmeer, ould cheikh ahmed", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In his outgoing speech, anti-Ebola mission chief Anthony Banbury said that the Ebola fight remains tough, but may still be won this year.", "title": "New United Nations Ebola Mission Chief to Start Saturday", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ould-cheikh-ahmed-replace-anthony-banbury-united-nations-ebola-mission-chief-316076", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/ebola-patients-kailahun.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In his outgoing speech, anti-Ebola mission chief Anthony Banbury said that the Ebola fight remains tough, but may still be won this year.", "title": "New United Nations Ebola Mission Chief to Start Saturday", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ould-cheikh-ahmed-replace-anthony-banbury-united-nations-ebola-mission-chief-316076", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/ebola-patients-kailahun.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/ebola-patients-kailahun.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-02T15:07:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T15:07:33-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In his outgoing speech, anti-Ebola mission chief Anthony Banbury said that the Ebola fight remains tough, but may still be won this year."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd417f\"", "article_summary": "Last week, a nurse was diagnosed with the virus in Britain upon her return from Sierra Leone.\nFaced with criticism the world was not doing enough, U.N.
