Georgia, in fact, declined in the number of people who had publicly provided coverage, according to the National Health Interview Survey.\n\nThe state did see one of the biggest increases in people gaining private insurance in the past year \u2013 a trend noticed by clinics in Augusta that serve low-income and uninsured residents.\n\nNationally, the rate of people who reported they were uninsured fell from 11.5 percent in 2014 to 9.1 percent in 2015, a decline of 7.4 million people, according to the survey. For those ages 18 to 64, the rate was 12.8 percent, down from 22.3 percent in 2010, according to the survey.\n\nThe rates for adults are significantly different for states that expanded Medi\u00adcaid compared with those, including Georgia and South Caro\u00adlina, that did not: The uninsured rate for adults in expansion states went from 18.4 percent in 2013 to 9.8 percent last year, while non-expansion states declined from 22.7 percent to 17.5 percent over the same period.\n\nGeorgia saw a similar decline for adults, dropping from an uninsured rate of 27.2 percent in 2013 to 15.9 percent last year, a rate still significantly above the national average. Part of that could be explained in a sudden drop in public coverage among adults of 16.5 percent in 2014 to 13.9 percent last year, the fourth-largest among states.\n\nThe state benefited, however, from a big jump in private insurance coverage, from 64.3 percent to 71.5 percent, the third-largest among states last year. Part of that undoubtedly is people gaining private insurance through the Affordable Care Act, Augusta clinic directors said.\n\nBoth Medical Associates Plus@Belle Terrace and Christ Community Health Services, the two federally qualified health centers in Augusta, have seen decreases in the uninsured and increases in patients with private insurance.\n\n\u201cWe are also seeing that trend, which is a good thing for us because although we are premised to see the uninsured we still have to keep our lights on, so we want as many of the insured as possible as well,\u201d said J.R. Rich\u00adards, the CEO of Medical Asso\u00adciates Plus. \u201cWe\u2019ll have fewer that can\u2019t pay and those with the private insurance, that insurance can then offset some of the costs we have to eat every year for providing uncompensated care.\u201d\n\nThat comes to about $1.5 million each year, he said.\n\nHaving more patients with insurance should improve patient results, said Jeff Drake, the executive director of Christ Community.\n\n\u201cIt is an encouraging sign that more people have payer sources, and hopefully that means that more people will actually use the insurance they are getting and will stay healthier and have more consistent care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe concern would be whether that will continue if the costs of premiums rise, Drake said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing rumblings that premiums are going to go up and that some insurers are not going to do as much Affordable Care Act work as they have in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cIs the system sustainable?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "The rate of uninsured residents continues to fall across the country and particularly in Georgia as more people gain private health insurance, according to an annual survey released today.", "title": "U.S. Georgia, see big increase in insured", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2016-05-17/us-georgia-see-big-increase-insured", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f84\"", "article_summary": "The state benefited, however, from a big jump in private insurance coverage, from 64.3 percent to 71.5 percent, the third-largest among states last year.\nBut Georgia and other states that did not expand Me\u00addi\u00adcaid continue to have higher uninsured rates than those that did.\nGeorgia, in fact, declined in the number of people who had publicly provided coverage, according to the National Health Interview Survey.\nPart of that undoubtedly is people gaining private insurance through the Affordable Care Act, Augusta clinic directors said.\nGeorgia saw a similar decline for adults, dropping from an uninsured rate of 27.2 percent in 2013 to 15.9 percent last year, a rate still significantly above the national average."}
