Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff Denis McDonough and the second keynote was former senator and abortion rights advocate Tom Daschle.\n\nMcDonough, a graduate of Georgetown's foreign service master\u2019s program, represented the Obama administration\u2014the most radically pro-abortion rights administration in the country\u2019s history.\n\nLifeSiteNews.com has described former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle as \u201cone of the US\u2019s most outspoken and determined \u2018Catholic\u2019 abortion-supporting politicians.\u201d\n\nDaschle once even wrote a fundraising letter on behalf of the National Abortion Rights Action League, (NARAL), which clearly stated his efforts as majority leader to further their agenda. In 2003, The National Catholic Register reported that Bishop Robert Carlson\u2014then shepherd of the Sioux Falls (S.D.) Diocese where Daschle resided\u2014ordered the politician to stop identifying himself as Catholic in his official biography because Daschle\u2019s pro-abortion rights record was so extreme.\n\nA panel discussion followed the two keynotes speeches. The panel included former congressional candidate and Georgetown professor Judith Feder, who ran for congress in Virginia as an outspoken advocate of both abortion rights and same-sex marriage.\n\nDiane Lewis\u2014executive board chair for Washington, D.C.\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange Authority, which earlier this year approved grants for hundreds of thousands of dollars to Planned Parenthood, was also featured on the panel.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to create these partnerships with trusted organizations that have deep roots in the communities that make up the District of Columbia,\u201dLewis stated in a press release announcing the grants in August 2013 \u201cThe new health law offers essential benefits that will improve the health and security of the residents of our city. It is critically important that we have trained experts available to help ensure those benefits reach the people who need them.\u201d\n\nFormer Republican Senator Robert Bennett, who moderated the panel, pointed out its lack of ideological diversity. Bennett said he was the only dissenting voice, but admitted that he too was supportive of the individual mandate.\n\nCatholic Education Daily is an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society.
