Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nIn my latest book, \u201cThe Ultimate Obama Survival Guide\u201d released in Spring 2013, I called Obama a \u201cstealth Marxist\u201d out to destroy capitalism and make Americans dependent on government.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just guesswork. Obama and I were classmates at Columbia University, where we were taught how to overwhelm the system until the economy collapses with spending, debt, and entitlements. In my book, I called Obamacare the perfect \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d that would make it all happen.\n\nHave you paid attention to the Obama news of the past week? It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s mind-boggling. It\u2019s unimaginable. It was a week of unimaginable destruction.\n\nThe cloak is off. Obama is no longer hiding his plans to destroy America. Share:\n\nThe cloak is off. Obama is no longer hiding his plans to destroy America. For anyone who isn\u2019t blind, deaf or very dumb, it\u2019s now all out in the open.\n\nThe news of this past week proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Obama is accelerating the destruction of America. Why the sudden rush? Obama and his Marxist cabal see the writing on the wall. Their internal polls show they are headed for a landslide defeat in November. Now that the disastrous effects of Obamacare are clear for the voters to see, they know Democrats are about to be destroyed at the polls.\n\nKnowing Democrats can no longer get elected, or re-elected, Obama has decided to go it alone. Without regard for the law, the Constitution, or the American people he (and those pulling his strings behind the scenes) have obviously decided to do the most damage possible to America during his final three years. He\u2019s finally taken off the mask and shown himself to be the true communist tyrant he is.\n\nLook at the facts.\n\nThis week the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office finally reported the truth \u2013 Obamacare is the perfect job-killing machine. Millions have already been downsized from full-time to part-time work and now we know from the CBO that an additional 2.3 million jobs will be eliminated. As I predicted from day one, this is exactly what Obamacare was intended to do \u2013 destroy the middle class and make us all dependent on government checks to survive.\n\nObama\u2019s Kool-Aid drinking supporters are so far in the tank that when the CBO courageously pointed out that Obamacare makes it less likely millions of Americans will want to work, they called it \u201cchoice.\u201d Obama\u2019s propagandists painted it as a wonderful development. But letting middle class wage earners and small businesses pay for all those who want to be freed from the need to work, so they can enjoy their free time and pursue their hobbies isn\u2019t \u201cchoice.\u201d It\u2019s theft.\n\nFolks, it is time to stop treading lightly and being politically correct. Let\u2019s call it what it is. This is communism, pure and simple.\n\nAnyone who thinks \u201cthe American Dream\u201d is to choose to stay home, not work, and collect a government check is reading directly from Karl Marx. Anyone who thinks some people (who vote 100 percent Democrat) should have a \u201cchoice\u201d not to work, by stealing the money of others, is reading directly from \u201cthe Communist Manifesto.\u201d\n\nBut if you need to steal my money so you don\u2019t have to work, that\u2019s called theft, not choice. Share:\n\nPersonally, I think \u201cchoice\u201d is great. You can choose to not work anytime you want. But if you need to steal my money to do it, that\u2019s called theft, not choice. Middle class wage earners are being ripped off to pay for free-loaders. That means middle class people are having their \u201cchoices\u201d taken away from them. I guess in Obama\u2019s playbook one man\u2019s choice is another man\u2019s slavery.\n\nBut, that was only the start of the week. Next Obama illegally re-wrote his own Obamacare law - again. Mimicking the traits of communist dictators and tin-pot tyrants, Obama obviously believes he can change any law he wants, at any given hour, of any given day.\n\nOne of the main chapters of my book was titled: \u201cAmerica the Banana Republic.\u201d Just this week Charles Krauthammer said what\u2019s happening under Obama \u201cis the stuff you do in a banana republic.\u201d Welcome to the club, Charles. It\u2019s nice to see D.C. establishment Republicans are finally seeing the light.\n\nIn America it\u2019s a violation of the Constitution for the president to wake up on the wrong side of the bed and decide to make, arbitrarily change, or break laws. This is the behavior of Fidel Castro, or the late tyrant Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut wait, it gets far worse. As part of the new illegal Obamacare directive to postpone the law for businesses with 50 to 99 employees, Obama put the IRS in direct control of critical U.S. business decisions. He demanded that businesses must \u201cjustify\u201d hiring and firing decisions to the IRS to qualify for the exemption. Plain and simple, putting government in charge of the decisions of a private business is the very foundation of communism. It is how communist economies like North Korea, Cuba, the old Soviet Union, and East Germany have always been run.\n\nStill, Obama wasn\u2019t done.\n\nTo show his total distain for Congress and the American people he unilaterally loosened the rules for citizenship to allow foreigners with only a \u201cminor\u201d connection to terrorism to become citizens. Dennis Miller once said on Monday Night Football, \u201cthere is no such thing as a minor groin injury.\u201d Well there is no such thing as a \u201cminor\u201d terrorist either.\n\nWhy is our president desperate to open the borders and let in \u201cminor\u201d terrorists? It\u2019s not like we have a surplus of jobs. What is the pressing need in a country with 92 million unemployed working-age Americans? Has corporate America put out an emergency request for \u201cminor\u201d terrorist employees? Or is this how Obama creates instant Democratic voters?\n\nMuch along the same lines, Obama\u2019s Attorney General Eric Holder announced this week how \u201cunjust\u201d it is to not allow felons to vote.\n\nNo Mr. Attorney General, the only thing \u201cunjust\u201d was the crimes these felons committed. What\u2019s the emergency here? Is there a shortage of Democratic voters? Obama\u2019s game plan is clearly to combine felons with radical Muslim terrorists in order to guarantee Democrat dominance for years to come.\n\nThis was just one week in America. The evil and terrible news is coming in waves. And it\u2019s all coming from one man. A man no longer hiding the fact that he is a tyrant, dictator, communist, and hater of America, capitalism and Judeo Christian values.\n\nObama no longer cares to hide his radical Marxist ideology. It\u2019s now clear it\u2019s \u201cpedal to the metal\u201d towards the destruction of America.\n\nThe question is\u2026Who will stop him?\n\nWayne\u2019s latest book is: \u201cThe Ultimate Obama Survival Guide: How to Survive, Thrive, and Prosper During Obamageddon.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
