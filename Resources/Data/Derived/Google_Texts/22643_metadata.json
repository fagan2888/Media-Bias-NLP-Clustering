Drug companies, meanwhile, want the government to require participants to demonstrate those savings go toward patient care.Meanwhile, 340B drug sales have grown. An analysis conducted by the Berkeley Research Group found that drug purchases made at the 340B price rose from $1.1 billion in 1997 to more than $7 billion by 2013, with projections of reaching more than $16 billion by 2020.Barrett said rhetoric regarding the increase in the number of hospitals that have participated in 340B in recent years fails to take into account the huge drive for the program's growth since 2010 has been facilities with 25 beds or less located in rural areas, which currently make up 53% of all 340B hospitals.More than half of the hospitals in the 340B drug discount program are small rural and cancer facilities that joined after 2010. These providers represent only 3% of 340B annual spending. Meanwhile, the number of DSH hospitals has actually declined 4% since 2012.One of the key topics expected to be covered at the upcoming 340B conference is the much-awaited release of HRSA's \u201cmega\u201d guidance on the program that is intended to clarify issues like eligibility.Last week, regulators issued their first piece of that guidance when they released proposed regulations establishing a new method for drugmakers to calculate \u201cceiling prices\u201d for covered outpatient drugs, and set fines for manufacturers who intentionally overcharge hospitals for medications.The 19th annual conference of the 340B Coalition is scheduled July 13-15 in Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Safety net
