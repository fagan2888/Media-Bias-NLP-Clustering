“Into the Woods,” the new Disney film that opened Thursday, is not for kids or even some young teenagers. If Walt Disney were alive today, his company would not be producing this movie.

I saw “Into the Woods” years ago in New York when it was a musical on Broadway. It’s very clever and, at times, funny and there are some beautiful songs but, ultimately, it’s dark and cynical.

Its creator, Stephen Sondheim, is a musical genius, a lyricist and composer. But Sondheim’s sad childhood has colored his view of life and relationships. His mother was psychologically abusive, his parents divorced and he, though given all the comforts money could buy, was emotionally neglected and often left without the support and comfort of a real family.

The first part tells the traditional fairy takes of Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Rapunzel, but the second half is Sondheim’s take on what happens after “and they lived happily ever after” — and it’s not happy. For the movie, there have been some changes, but characters die and scary things happen to them all.

I’ve been a family therapist for 30 years. Children have enough to deal with — school shootings, terrorists, broken families and a growing focus in the media and in video games on presenting evil as a non-stop, all-encompassing force. It’s not hard to guess why suicide is on the rise in teenagers.

We need stories with happy endings. Even though there’s pain in life, there’s also beauty, joy and love.

See this movie first before you decide to take a young person to it.
