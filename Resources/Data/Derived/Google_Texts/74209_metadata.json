She is running against incumbent John Huppenthal.\n\nDouglas is laser-focused on getting rid of Common Core in Arizona. She writes on her website, that she wants to \"...stop the Common Core Standards in Arizona and return control over your children\u2019s education to you through your locally elected school boards.\"\n\nShe states clearly, \"Common Core is to education what ObamaCare is to healthcare \u2013 top down, one size fits all federal government control.\"\n\nOn June 12, Douglas spoke to the Republican Women of Prescott (RWOP), where she found a largely receptive audience for her message. Superintendent Huppenthal had also been scheduled to attend, but he canceled citing another commitment. Having the RWOP constituents to herself, Douglas was able to articulate and clarify her concerns and perspective on Common Core, taking her time to explain the issue from her perspective.\n\nWatch her conversation with Dr. Billie Orr here:\n\nDiane Douglas: Website | Facebook | Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Diane Douglas Says to RWOP: Stop Common Core!", "generator": "Prescott Arizona News", "title": "Diane Douglas Says to RWOP: Stop Common Core!", "og": {"site_name": "Prescott eNews", "description": "'Stop Common Core' is Diane Douglas' campaign slogan.", "title": "Diane Douglas Says to RWOP: Stop Common Core!", "url": "http://www.prescottenews.com/index.php/news/current-news/item/23710-diane-douglas-says-to-rwop-stop-common-core", "image": "http://www.prescottenews.com/media/k2/items/cache/c0c3964cd597231e9fac5f17a7394bf4_XL.jpg", "locale": "en_gb", "type": "Article"}, "image": "http://www.prescottenews.com/media/k2/items/cache/c0c3964cd597231e9fac5f17a7394bf4_M.jpg", "rights": "@2016 by PrescotteNews.
