In an unusual break, police captured three of the rival 18th Street gangsters and chased others into this arroyo with the fresh graves to help them locate the bodies.\n\nBut Ticas is working against the clock. By law, the government has 72 hours to produce evidence of murder or the suspects will be released. It is slow going, as the bodies have been beheaded and dismembered, and though they are not long dead, worms have begun to feed on them.\n\nTicas is up to his armpits in dirt. Hour after hour, he moves bits of earth with an archeologist\u2019s precision, his face streaked with sweat and soil. He urges his team not to make errors.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an exhumation. It is a crime scene,\u201d he reminds them.\n\nSome would argue digging up graves is a fool\u2019s errand in El Salvador, which has the world\u2019s second highest per capita homicide rate, and from which thousands of men, women and children flee each year. But this is a vocation for Ticas, a stocky systems engineer turned police detective who looks younger than his 51 years.\n\nHe was a young police intelligence agent during the US-backed government\u2019s war against Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas in the 1980s. Today, those former guerrillas hold the presidency, and Ticas works for an independently named attorney general as the department\u2019s only criminologist.\n\nHe says he is not political and considers all killers to be devils, no matter their affiliation. But Ticas knows the risks of his work better than anyone. He sees the evidence of gang rape and sadistic methods of murder such as \u201cthe pinata,\u201d where a victim is hung upside down from a tree and hacked to death with machetes, like children batting a candy-filled pinata.\n\nHis work sometimes serves as political ammunition. In 2012 and 2013, El Salvador\u2019s previous leftist government helped negotiate a truce between the gangs, during which it claimed that homicides fell by 60 percent. Detractors, including Ticas\u2019s boss, Attorney General Luis Martinez, saw the truce as government collusion with criminals. They argue that the killings continued and the dead simply were dumped in clandestine graves by the country\u2019s tens of thousands of gang members.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salvador detective won\u2019t let the dead lie silent", "author": "Alberto Arce", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salvador detective won\u2019t let the dead lie silent", "title": "Salvador detective won\u2019t let the dead lie silent", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/salvador_detective_wont_let_the_dead_lie_silent/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/el-salvador-digging-up-the-dead.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salvador detective won\u2019t let the dead lie silent", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/el-salvador-digging-up-the-dead.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Salvador detective won\u2019t let the dead lie silent", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Salvador detective won\u2019t let the dead lie silent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfbc\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsSAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) \u2014 Israel Ticas calls himself the \u201clawyer for the dead,\u201d the man who can bring justice to the buried victims of El Salvador\u2019s brutal violence.\nThey argue that the killings continued and the dead simply were dumped in clandestine graves by the country\u2019s tens of thousands of gang members.\nToday his team is looking for members of the Mara Salvatrucha gang who were snatched from a bus station days before.\nBut this is a vocation for Ticas, a stocky systems engineer turned police detective who looks younger than his 51 years.\nBy law, the government has 72 hours to produce evidence of murder or the suspects will be released."}
