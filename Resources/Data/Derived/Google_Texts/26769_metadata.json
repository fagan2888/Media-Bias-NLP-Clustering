It represents the biggest regulatory shake-up to telecommunications providers in almost two decades.\n\nAdditional Images Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, center, and his wife Janet Hill, right, joins members of the audience in applauding at an open hearing at the Federal Communications Commission in Washington on Thursday. The FCC voted in favor of rules aimed at enforcing what\u2019s called \u201cnet neutrality.\u201d The Associated Press Related Headlines FCC\u2019s Internet proposal could fuel more competition in Maine WHAT THE DECISION MEANS Here is a quick look at Thursday\u2019s ruling and what may happen next. LITTLE HAS CHANGED: With few exceptions, the cable and wireless companies that provide much of the nation\u2019s broadband already operate under the idea of net neutrality. This means they don\u2019t discriminate among similar types of Web traffic, and don\u2019t intentionally slow or block data. The FCC decision was intended to make sure that the Internet as we know it doesn\u2019t change. INTERNET NOW A UTILITY: The FCC put the Internet in the same regulatory camp as the telephone, regulating it like a public utility. That means whatever company provides your Internet connection, even if it\u2019s to your phone, will now have to act in the public interest and not do anything that might be considered \u201cunjust or unreasonable.\u201d If they don\u2019t, you can complain and the FCC can step in to investigate. LAWSUITS EXPECTED: Broadband providers are expected to sue. It\u2019s likely they will ask the courts to delay implementation of the rules pending judicial review. And if a judge agrees, the legal wrangling could slip well into the next president\u2019s first term. CONGRESS GETTING INVOLVED: While broadband providers turn to their lawyers to mount a legal protest to the FCC rules, Republican lawmakers say they will push for a legislative fix. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, is expected to lead this fight, starting with March 18 hearings. \u2013 The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nThe new rules require that any company providing a broadband connection to your home or phone act in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d and refrain from using \u201cunjust or unreasonable\u201d business practices. The goal is to prevent providers from striking deals with content providers like Google, Netflix or Twitter to move their data faster.\n\n\u201cToday is a red-letter day for Internet freedom,\u201d said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, whose remarks at Thursday\u2019s meeting frequently prompted applause by Internet activists in the audience.\n\nPresident Obama, who had come out in favor of net neutrality in the fall, portrayed the decision as a victory for democracy in the digital age. In an online letter, he thanked the millions who wrote to the FCC and spoke out on social media in support of the change.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s FCC decision will protect innovation and create a level playing field for the next generation of entrepreneurs \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t have happened without Americans like you,\u201d he wrote.\n\nVerizon saw it differently, using the Twitter hashtag (hash)ThrowbackThursday to draw attention to the FCC\u2019s reliance on 1934 legislation to regulate the Internet. Likewise, AT&T suggested the FCC had damaged its reputation as an independent federal regulator by embracing such a liberal policy.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone really think Washington needs yet another partisan fight? Particularly a fight around the Internet, one of the greatest engines of economic growth, investment and innovation in history?\u201d said Jim Cicconi, AT&T\u2019s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs.\n\nNet neutrality is the idea that websites or videos load at about the same speed. That means you won\u2019t be more inclined to watch a particular show on Amazon Prime instead of on Netflix because Amazon has struck a deal with your service provider to load its data faster.\n\nFor years, providers mostly agreed not to pick winners and losers among Web traffic because they didn\u2019t want to encourage regulators to step in and because they said consumers demanded it. But that started to change around 2005, when YouTube came online and Netflix became increasingly popular. On-demand video began hogging bandwidth, and evidence surfaced that some providers were manipulating traffic without telling consumers.\n\nBy 2010, the FCC enacted open Internet rules, but the agency\u2019s legal approach was eventually struck down in the courts. The vote Thursday was intended by Wheeler to erase any legal ambiguity by no longer classifying the Internet as an \u201cinformation service\u201d but a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d subject to Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.\n\nThat would dramatically expand regulators\u2019 power over the industry and hold broadband providers to the higher standard of operating in the public interest.\n\nThe FCC says it won\u2019t apply some sections of Title II, including price controls. That means rates charged to customers for Internet access won\u2019t be subject to pre-approval. But the law allows the government to investigate if consumers complain that costs are unfair.\n\nIndustry officials and congressional Republicans fought bitterly to stave off the new regulations, which they said constitutes dangerous overreach and would eventually raise costs for consumers. The broadband industry was expected to sue.\n\n\u201cWith years of uncertainty and unintended consequences ahead of us, it falls to Congress to step in,\u201d said Michael Powell, head of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association.\n\nGOP lawmakers said they would push for legislation, although it was unlikely Obama would sign such a bill.\n\n\u201cOnly action by Congress can fix the damage and uncertainty this FCC order has inflicted on the Internet,\u201d Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said in a statement.\n\nAlso at stake Thursday was Obama\u2019s goal of helping local governments build their own fast, cheap broadband.
