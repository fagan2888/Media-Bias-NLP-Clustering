Now that people are finding out what is actually in the Affordable Care Act, they are starting to like it.\n\nIn an article for Time magazine, Steven Brill tells the story of an Ohio couple who were initially against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Obamacare will help us. I don\u2019t want anything to do with it. I hear a lot of bad things about it\u2013that it doesn\u2019t cover pre-existing conditions and it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d said Stephanie Recchi, whose husband Sean was diagnosed with cancer last year.\n\nWhen Sean received his diagnosis and started to seek treatment, the Ohio couple found out that the insurance plan they did have was essentially worthless and paid nearly $84,000 in advance just to develop a treatment plan.\n\nAccording to Brill\u2019s report, shortly after the launch of the healthcare exchanges, the Recchis met with an insurance broker who helped them navigate the marketplaces. The pair discovered that their health insurance would go from $469 a month for a plan that was essentially worthless to $17 dollars a month, which included a subsidy provided by the ACA. The new plan would cover their entire family and have a $12,000 deductible.\n\nEven better for the family, once the broker calculated their health care costs based on their actual earned income the family learned that their health insurance would be free. That\u2019s because of Republican Gov. John Kasich\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid coverage in Ohio.\n\nJust more than half of the states in the country have expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA. Many states, especially states with Republican legislatures or governors have decided not to expand the coverage. A fact that Vice President Biden mentioned during a speech on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf Republican governors and the state legislatures the states of Texas, Florida, and North Carolina and others would act responsibly,\u201d said Biden, \u201cwe could cover another 5 million people with the stroke of a pen.\u201d\n\nResistance to the law remains firm in many states, but in Ohio Stephanie Rechhi has a new view on the Affordable Care Act calling the law \u201cwonderful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "One Ohio family's experience with the Affordable Care Act turned them from opponents into supporters.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/the-lovehate-obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "One Ohio family's experience with the Affordable Care Act turned them from opponents into supporters.", "title": "The Love/Hate of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/the-lovehate-obamacare", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/ap205720300023.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/the-lovehate-obamacare", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/ap205720300023.jpg?itok=ySCJGJJs", "height": 553}, "title": "The Love/Hate of Obamacare", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "One Ohio family's experience with the Affordable Care Act turned them from opponents into supporters."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-24T18:01:36-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "xuanthai", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,obamacare,ohio,the-last-word", "title": "The Love/Hate of Obamacare", "published": 1, "date": "01/24/2014 18:01:36 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/the-lovehate-obamacare"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "One Ohio family's experience with the Affordable Care Act turned them from opponents into supporters.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Ohio"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd43\"", "article_summary": "Now that people are finding out what is actually in the Affordable Care Act, they are starting to like it.\nWhat Republicans feared most about the Affordable Care Act is happening.\nIn an article for Time magazine, Steven Brill tells the story of an Ohio couple who were initially against the Affordable Care Act.\nEven better for the family, once the broker calculated their health care costs based on their actual earned income the family learned that their health insurance would be free.\nMany states, especially states with Republican legislatures or governors have decided not to expand the coverage."}
