An Arapahoe County jail inmate died after he was assaulted by another inmate, according to sheriff’s office.

The attack began in a cell on the upper tier of a housing unit at the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office Detention Facility at 2:50 p.m. Friday according to a new release.

The assault lasted about 45 seconds and was over before deputies could intervene.

Eric Stewart, 43, is suspected of killing Michael Roy Craven Jr., 43.

The two lived in adjoining cells, said Julie Brooks, sheriff’s office spokeswoman.

The attack lasted approximately 45 seconds and was over before deputies were able to intervene.

“No weapons were involved,” Brooks said.

There were about 38 other inmates present in the housing unit at the time of the assault.

The two had been housed in the same housing unit since December, 2014, and hadn’t had any known conflicts prior to the assault.

Stewart has been at the facility since December 2014 and was awaiting trial on charges of attempted first-degree murder, menacing, third-degree assault and possession of a weapon by a previous offender.
