(AP) - The Pink Eagles are like a Girl Scouts troop created just for Memphis. For the past seven years, the nonprofit has helped area girls ages 5 to 19 build self-confidence, leadership skills and financial literacy. The weekly meetings and seasonal events are free for the participants thanks to the leadership of founder Loretta McNary.\n\nHer efforts with Pink Eagles have shown more than 500 girls the way to soar. Every girl that has graduated high school while in the program has gone on to college, and none of them has become a teenage mother or been arrested.\n\n\u201cI have four boys, but I\u2019ve always had a heart for girls,\u201d McNary said. \u201cI wanted girls to understand you don\u2019t have to make bad decisions to get people to love you. You can love yourself and be awesome, valuable, incredible, strong and independent.\u201d\n\nMcNary, a local TV talk-show host and producer, was inspired to highlight alternative narratives for at-risk girls. In 2009, she piloted the program while working with transitional families at Metropolitan Inter-Faith Association. The Pink Eagles\u2019 tenets of self-esteem, effective communication, community involvement, academic engagement, financial literacy and entrepreneurship were duly tested by a group that needed the greatest support.\n\n\u201cThey lived lives that I even as an adult couldn\u2019t survive,\u201d McNary said. \u201cThey were the most emotionally damaged, toughest girls who moved from home to home and took on a lot of responsibility at an early age. I walked out twice because they were not getting it.\u201d\n\nAfter the first six weeks, McNary called for an extension that eventually brought the program to a six-month tenure. By the time the 25 Pink Eagles graduated from the program, McNary and her girls were inseparable.\n\n\u201cThey call me Momma,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2011, the Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s Office came on board as an adopter. The department\u2019s employees attended meetings, donated supplies and supported McNary as she got her Pink Eagles off the ground.\n\nSince that time, the group has been housed everywhere from church meeting rooms to McNary\u2019s television studio in the Hickory Ridge Mall. Girls from all over the city are invited to sign up for the six-week program or to drop in when it\u2019s convenient. The current roster comes in at 90 girls.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday night, 15 girls gathered at a classroom in the National College campus at 2576 Thousand Oaks Blvd. to learn how to make their own lip glosses and fill out personal checks. As a self-made media personality, McNary puts special emphasis on teaching the girls how to make their way while uplifting each other.\n\n\u201cNo one will have to take care of these girls. The government will not have to take care of these girls. They will be self-sustainable. They will know how to work for themselves outside of their careers if they have to. They\u2019ve been taught and that\u2019s what they see with me and our speakers.\u201d\n\nRecently, McNary has taken the girls into the entrepreneurial world. She launched a candle company, Candle Lights by L, to raise funds for the Pink Eagles.\n\nThe girls learn how to make soy candles and pitch a sale to their family members. When McNary buys supplies, she shares her receipts with the girls as an opportunity to teach how to keep a budget. She hopes to bring on single parents of girls in the program as commission-receiving sales consultants.\n\nFunds raised from Candle Lights by L will go back into providing supplies for the weekly meetings and seasonal events like the Miss Eagles Pageant. At the annual showcase, the girls are outfitted with new evening gowns and practice speaking critically and clearly on stage. At the Pink Eagles Night Indoor Camping Retreat held at the Girl Scouts Professional Training Center, the girls prepare their own meals and design a fun, fulfilling evening. McNary also regularly schedules college tour visits for Memphis youth.\n\nNext year, McNary is looking to add a Teen Girls Summit where girls can attend panels and teleconferences with successful women professionals. She\u2019s also looking to organize the Blue Eagles, a boys\u2019 empowerment group that bears a similar model.\n\n\u201cTheir parents always tell me how the girls have changed. Most of my girls don\u2019t want to be there at first. Those girls become my best ever advocates,\u201d McNary said. \u201cThey realize that whatever happened to them, it wasn\u2019t their fault, and they can do whatever they dream of doing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Memphis Daily News, http://www.memphisdailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pink Eagles are like a Girl Scouts troop created just for Memphis.
