A Hutchinson woman faces attempted murder charges after firing shots at a pickup she was chasing Saturday morning.

Officers were called around 8:40 a.m. to the report of a vehicle crashing into the Midas auto service center in the 1100 block of North Lorraine. That’s on Hutchinson’s east side.

Three people in the pickup said they were confronted by a woman in the parking lot of a nearby Walmart. After a brief argument, the three fled the area and headed south on K-61. Police say the suspect pursued and shot at them repeatedly until they crashed into the Midas.

Dale Jester was working at the Midas when the vehicle crashed into the building. "We heard noises but at the time we didn't know it was gunshot...and here laid the truck," he said outside the Midas.

The suspect left the scene but later turned herself in. Police identified her as 35-year-old Nichole Rene Green of Hutchinson.

Green was booked into the Reno County Jail on three counts of attempted second-degree murder and criminal discharge of a firearm. Her bond was set at $100,000.

No one was hurt during the ordeal. Police are still investigating.
