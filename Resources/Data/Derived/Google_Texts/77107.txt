STEVE DOOCY: Meanwhile, British born actress Emily Blunt was at the Toronto Film Festival. She was talking to The Hollywood Reporter. And she said -- she just recently became an American citizen -- and she said this, it's going to anger a number of Republicans. She said quote, 'I became an American citizen recently and that night we decided to watch the Republican debate, and I thought this was a terrible mistake. What have I done?'

ANNA KOOIMAN: She goes on to say this about becoming an American citizen, 'I'm not sure I'm entirely thrilled about it. People ask me about the whole day. They were like, oh it must have been so emotional. I was like it wasnt, it was sad. I like being British.' Well you know what, then why don't you leave Hollywood, California, and let some American women take on the roles that you're getting, because Americans are watching your movies and lining your pockets. She's been in movies like Devil Wears Prada--

BRIAN KILMEADE: Actually, I agree with you, Anna, too. She went on to say, 'It's weird. I get to keep both my British citizenship, you have to renounce the queen, so it's kind of typically American. Not to be rude, but I had to renounce her in the room but I don't actually technically renounce her. They were like, 'Just say it. You don't have to mean it, just say it.' Why is that typical American? By the way, she lived with Michael Buble in Vancouver and then married John Krasinski, who was very good on The Office.

STEVE DOOCY: You know what Emily Blunt just did? She just Dixie Chicked herself. She has alienated half the country, that now will think twice about going to one of her movies.

KILMEADE: I actually didn't know who she was.

DOOCY: You've seen her in movies.

KOOIMAN: She's very pretty.

KILMEADE: I'm sure she -- ok, well congratulations. You're an American citizen and you're very unhappy. Do you believe -- will Emily Blunt's feelings about American citizenship blunt the way you feel about her movies?
