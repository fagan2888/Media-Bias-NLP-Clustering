Then he looked uncomfortable, trying to brush away the unexpected guest, who appeared to be in his teens, before a guard led the spectator away. And in the end, Federer was angry at what he considered a serious lapse in security.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy about it. Obviously, not (for) one second (am I) happy about it,\u201d Federer said, adding that something similar happened a day earlier, when several kids interrupted his practice session at Roland Garros. \u201cNormally I only speak on behalf of myself, but in this situation, I think I can speak on behalf of all the players \u2014 that that\u2019s where you do your job, that\u2019s where you want to feel safe.\u201d\n\nTournament director Gilbert Ysern headed to the locker room to offer a personal apology and also spoke to Federer\u2019s wife, Mirka, in the players\u2019 lounge. Ysern called it \u201cembarrassing\u201d and acknowledged Federer \u201chas good grounds for being unhappy,\u201d but chalked the whole thing up to \u201clack of judgment\u201d on the part of the security staff that let the intruder get by.\n\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Ysern said at a news conference, \u201cat this stage, there is no reason for us to change the security procedures.\u201d\n\nYsern noted that tennis security was beefed up worldwide after then-No. 1 Monica Seles was stabbed in the back by someone who came out of the stands during a changeover at a tournament in Germany in 1993.\n\n\u201cGiven what happened with Seles and \u2026 (that) we live in a civilization that has gone a bit mad, it\u2019s clear that we absolutely owe it to the players to allow them to play on the court,\u201d Ysern said. \u201cFortunately, our sport doesn\u2019t have fences and barbed wire around the courts. There\u2019s not that physical separation that isn\u2019t very pleasant.\u201d\n\nIt was, certainly as far as Federer was concerned, the most noteworthy development on Day 1 at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament.
