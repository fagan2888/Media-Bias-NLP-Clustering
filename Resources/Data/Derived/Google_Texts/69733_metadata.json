Mark Udall, D-Colo., is on the ropes in his bid for re-election, his cousin, Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., is now trying to fend off the momentum of retired U.S. Marine Corps Col. Allen Weh, who is near or within the margin of error in the latest polls.\n\nJust a week ago, Udall led Weh by 16 points. Since then, an Albuquerque Journal survey shows a seven-point race (50-43) while a Vox Populi poll released Monday suggests a 47-43 Udall lead. Weh said another poll has the margin down to two percentage points, and there are good reasons for the 11th-hour momentum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve presented a sharp contrast to Tom Udall. It\u2019s been done based on his record. I\u2019ve made no personal attacks on the man and don\u2019t intend to and don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Weh, citing the economy, health care, national security and \u201cother lesser-related issues in New Mexico\u201d as the areas of sharpest difference.\n\n\u201cOn every one of those, Tom Udall\u2019s on the wrong side of the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cHe cast the deciding vote for Obamacare that stripped $716 billion out of Medicare, and that\u2019s starting to hurt seniors right now as we speak. That was a train wreck. He made it worse.\u201d\n\nOn the economy, Weh said the two couldn\u2019t be more different because they come at issues like economic growth and job creation from opposite directions.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a career politician,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s never created a job or saved a job in his life. I created a business, and I can relate to that and I can relate to helping stimulate our economy and what it needs to have done to do that.\u201d\n\nHowever, Weh, a 38-year veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and Reserve, may be most frustrated with Udall\u2019s performance on national security issues. Weh, 71, is a retired USMC colonel who was awarded a Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, three Purple Hearts and five Air Medals among other honors for his heroism in combat. He served the nation in uniform in Vietnam, the Gulf War, Somalia and the Iraq War.\n\nWeh is appalled by Udall\u2019s foreign policy and military records both personally and professionally.\n\n\u201cOn national security, no contest,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s never served in uniform a day in his life. In fact in 1970, when he graduated from college, he decided to go to England to avoid service in Vietnam. That may not matter to a lot of people, but I\u2019ll tell you what. It matters to a whole lot of Vietnam veterans.\u201d\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with retired U.S. Marine Corps Col. Allen Weh:\n\nThis is the arena Weh sees himself having the greatest and most immediate impact if elected to the Senate. He believes President Obama needs to get congressional authorization for a long-term military campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, but first he says the U.S. needs a real plan to win.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a comprehensive strategy. The national command authority, the president, has not woken up to the fact that this is an existential threat to the United States and acted accordingly. He\u2019s dealing with it almost in a way to just make it go away,\u201d said Weh, who accused Udall of marching in lockstep with Obama.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, my opponent, Tom Udall, votes with him 94 percent of the time and on matters of national security hasn\u2019t broken with him. So when the president\u2019s failed leadership, or leading from behind at best, Tom Udall\u2019s never had the political courage to step up and say, \u2018Hey Mr. President, you\u2019re the commander in chief. You\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right to keep America safe and America\u2019s families safe.\u2019 He hasn\u2019t done that,\u201d Weh said.\n\nThe 26-year Marine Corps veteran said his voice is badly needed in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThat particular part of my life is going to be put to good use. Right now, there\u2019s only one combat veteran in the United States Senate (Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.). If I\u2019m elected, I\u2019ll be one of two or three,\u201d said Weh, referring also to Iraq War veteran Tom Cotton who is the GOP nominee in Arkansas.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a whole lot of men who\u2019ve had that experience,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother national security flashpoint also happens to be in New Mexico\u2019s backyard as the debate over border security and immigration reform continues in both parties. Weh describes the borders as porous and directly blames the president for allowing it to happen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to secure the border, and that\u2019s the responsibility of the executive. This executive, this president, this administration does not want to secure the border or else it would have or it could have,\u201d said Weh, who sees one decision above all others hindering border security and another instance of Obama and Udall seeing eye to eye on key policy.\n\n\u201cWhen Barack Obama took office, he suspended construction of the remaining fence that had been authorized in 2006, which by the way, when in the House of Representatives, my opponent Tom Udall voted against,\u201d he said.\n\nThe colonel said the U.S. need only look to the Middle East to see the impact a fence can make on security.\n\n\u201cThe fence is necessary in those built-up urban areas, much like the fence has been very effective in Jerusalem to prevent terrorists from coming into Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe border as it is now is essentially porous simply due to the decisions and actions of this administration.\u201d\n\nThe Udall campaign is returning fire on a number of issues. Like most Democrat candidates this year, Udall is accusing Weh of waging a war against women. In addition, he is hammering the GOP nominee for suggesting he was fine with a $4 minimum wage and alleging Weh is hostile to working families.\n\nWeh said that line of attack is a clear distortion of the truth. He calls it \u201cgotcha politics\u201d and said he is actually taking an innovative approach to the issue by pushing an increase in the minimum wage for Americans 26 years and older but eliminating it altogether for those younger.\n\n\u201cThe traditional party line of Republicans is we\u2019re opposed to the raise,\u201d Weh said. \u201cI said I\u2019m not opposed to raising the minimum wage. It hasn\u2019t been raised in six to seven years. Cost of living has gone up. We ought to raise it. But in exchange for that, I\u2019d want a two-tiered system. We\u2019ve got a terrible youth unemployment problem in this country. It\u2019s particularly bad in New Mexico. Twenty-four percent of Hispanic youths are unemployed. When you have that kind of condition, what you get is a sharp rise in juvenile delinquency and crime.\n\n\u201cSo instead of a kid having a job, if he gets involved in juvenile delinquency in a criminal act, he\u2019s got a strike against him for life instead of a hand up. In that context, I said, \u2018So what if he\u2019s working at Burger King for four bucks an hour? He\u2019s got a job and he\u2019s off the streets and out of trouble and he\u2019s learning something,'\u201d said Weh, who believes this episode raises even more questions about Udall.\n\n\u201cThey had a tracker recording me in that group and then they took that little sound bite and they made an ad on it,\u201d Weh said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem of politics today. I challenged him yesterday in the debate. He brought that up. I said, \u2018Tom, why don\u2019t you engage in a conversation? Why don\u2019t you be constructive in a dialogue to solve the teen unemployment problem? All you care about it gotcha politics.'\u201d\n\nWeh said New Mexico may be a blue state, but it\u2019s not a deeply liberal state, adding that the Democrats there are blue-collar, gun-owning types who have elected Republicans to the Senate and the governor\u2019s mansion in recent years.\n\nAs for a final message, Weh hopes the people of his state relate to him, his story and his vision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a normal guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI came from a middle-class background, worked my way up and have enjoyed the American Dream. I want that opportunity for everybody, and I\u2019m willing to go to Washington to put common sense to work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "While Sen.
