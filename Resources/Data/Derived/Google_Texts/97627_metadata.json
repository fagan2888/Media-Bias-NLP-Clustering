Any time there is a last-minute cancellation for one of our doctors, that gets fed to the Internet.\"\n\nMedical professionals pay to be part of the app database, and there\u2019s a payoff. If a doctor can tighten up scheduling, he or she may get a better review from the patient and more Medicare reimbursements.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act is looking at managing patient populations,\u201d Jersey City Medical Center Operations Chief Kirat Kharode said. \u201cSo the ability to create access points into our system is critical in getting patients to use our system and use our services.\"\n\nThe apps allow the customer to shop around and find a clinic ready to accept patients immediately.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it was definitely worth it, because I spent far less time in the car driving out there than I would have in the waiting room,\u201d InQuicker user Lauren Toth said.\n\nThe apps will list insurance carriers, letting the customer decide immediately if the doctor is in and affordable.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 17:00:00 CST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Alex Hoffman", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "Slowly but steadily, area clinics and hospitals are turning to apps to schedule patients.", "title": "Clinics move toward apps to schedule patients", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/clinics-move-toward-apps-to-schedule-patients/30926508", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/30927022/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/wy3a9t/-/Zoc-Doc-JPG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/clinics-move-toward-apps-to-schedule-patients/30926508", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/30926508", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/30926508", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/30926508"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "description": "Slowly but steadily, area clinics and hospitals are turning to apps to schedule patients.", "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/30926508", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/30926508", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/alex.hoffman.7792052?fref=ts"}, "keywords": "ZocDoc, InQuicker", "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "news_keywords": "ZocDoc, InQuicker"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd14\"", "article_summary": "Slowly but steadily, area clinics and hospitals are turning to apps to schedule patients.\nApps like ZocDoc and InQuicker are tapping into increased competition among urgent care centers and pharmacy clinics.\nThe apps allow the customer to shop around and find a clinic ready to accept patients immediately.\n\u201cThere (are) 1,400 different systems out there.\nThe apps will list insurance carriers, letting the customer decide immediately if the doctor is in and affordable."}
