Their company helps businesses manage labor from human resources, insurance and cost perspectives, so they\u2019re dealing with issues like companies\u2019 bringing on contingent workers rather than full-time employees and needing to address provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nEnterprise resource planning:\n\n\n\nKnowledge Services\u2019 business involves anything having to do with engaging and managing labor. Clients come to it for help with issues such as pay rates, job-title rationalizations (For example, What\u2019s the difference between a senior clerk and junior clerk?), and ensuring that personnel are properly credentialed and recertified, when necessary.\n\n\n\nHow they do it:\n\n\n\nAbout 10 to 12 years ago, the two designed and built a software system they use to help with process automation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of paperwork involved with contracts, payments, credentialing, certification, insurance requirements that go into managing labor,\u201d said Joe, who\u2019s executive vice president. \u201cOur job is to continue to be relevant and provide ever-increasing value to our customers.\u201d\n\n\n\nReimaging itself:\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago, Julie Bielawski started Knowledge Services as a rentable computer training facility. The company has been through concentrations in public education, consulting, software systems development and, now, labor services. \u201cYou continually have to reinvent yourself,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWe spend a lot of time asking ourselves, \u2018How could we become irrelevant a year from now?\u2019 If we can conceive of that, we should be the ones to come up with a solution that could change the industry a year from now.\u201d\n\n\n\nBack again:\n\n\n\nJoe Bielawski said this year is looking strong for Knowledge Services, and he expects the company to return to IBJ\u2019s list of the fastest-growing companies. \u201cWe\u2019re introducing new capabilities and services that we\u2019ll be piloting later this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThose will provide continued growth in a very meaningful way.\u201d \u2022\n\nCheck out more of IBJ\u2019s ranking of Indy\u2019s fastest-growing companies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since the recession, Julie and Joe Bielawski have found their services more in demand than ever.", "csrf-token": "PiUkofkTEX30M3AK8ReFG70M2bvJNwAli+1Vyu/0VE4=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/IBJ-Print2/2015/07-July/072015/fast25-knowledge-services-15col.jpg?1437201123", "description": "Since the recession, Julie and Joe Bielawski have found their services more in demand than ever.", "card": "summary", "title": "FAST 25: Knowledge Services"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "Since the recession, Julie and Joe Bielawski have found their services more in demand than ever.", "title": "FAST 25: Knowledge Services"}, "keywords": "human resources,Knowledge Services,Julie Bielawski,fastest-growing private companies,Fast 25,Joe Bielawski", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa72\"", "article_summary": "Enterprise resource planning:Knowledge Services\u2019 business involves anything having to do with engaging and managing labor.\n3-year growth: 153 percent2014 revenue: $214.8 millionNeeding their help:Since the recession, Julie and Joe Bielawski have found their services more in demand than ever.\nThe company has been through concentrations in public education, consulting, software systems development and, now, labor services.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of paperwork involved with contracts, payments, credentialing, certification, insurance requirements that go into managing labor,\u201d said Joe, who\u2019s executive vice president.\n\u201cThose will provide continued growth in a very meaningful way.\u201d \u2022Check out more of IBJ\u2019s ranking of Indy\u2019s fastest-growing companies."}
