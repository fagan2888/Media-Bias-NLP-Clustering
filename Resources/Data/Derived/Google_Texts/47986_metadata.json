It\u2019s a curious contrast from the mood reflected in the presidential contest and recent midterm elections, where some lawmakers have fallen.\n\nMembers of Congress are extremely unpopular, serving as punching bags for Republican and Democratic activists.\n\n\u201cThe old saying is that everyone hates Congress but loves their congressman,\u201d said Republican political consultant Vinny Minchillo.\n\nBut Minchillo and others concede there\u2019s not a lot of love lost for anybody on Capitol Hill. The failure of tea party activists and other conservatives to dislodge members of Congress stems from their lack of resources and inability to slate formidable challengers.\n\n\u201cIn Texas, none of the challengers had the one ingredient absolutely necessary for success in Texas politics \u2014 money,\u201d Minchillo said.\n\nIn one of the most-watched local congressional races, Dallas Republican Pete Sessions beat back a challenge from several challengers, including tea party-backed Russell Ramsland. Two years earlier, Sessions was targeted by tea party activists for what they described as not doing enough to derail the Affordable Care Act. He beat Garland tea party leader Katrina Pierson, who is now the national spokeswoman for GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cPete Sessions, perceived as not conservative enough, allegedly had a target on his back,\u201d Minchillo said. \u201cPete was able to swat away the opponents just as easily as he knocked off Katrina Pierson. Maybe even more easily.\u2019\u2019\n\nFederal lawmakers in Texas have also learned lessons from their fallen counterparts in other places, including the Legislature. In 2014 well-funded challengers shocked local incumbents in the state Senate, including John Carona of Dallas. In that race, businessman Don Huffines had plenty of campaign cash and the backing of a coalition of tea party and libertarian activists.\n\nMembers of the Texas GOP delegation to Congress watched in horror but were able to prepare for challengers to their own seats.\n\nA similar warning shot came in 2012, when Ted Cruz beat establishment stalwart David Dewhurst for the Senate seat once held by Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. John Cornyn, now the state\u2019s senior senator, left nothing to chance. He raised tens of millions and made the proper overtures to grass-roots voters.\n\nNot all congressional incumbents have escaped voters looking for change. Ralph Hall, the long-serving congressman from the Rockwall-based 4th District, was ousted by former Heath Mayor John Ratcliffe in 2014.\n\nBut unlike other challengers, Ratcliffe, a former U.S. attorney, had an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and solid enough fundraising. Even so, it was probably Hall\u2019s age (He was 90 at the time) that most contributed to his loss.\n\nActivists looking to shake up Congress need better candidates with more resources, but they won\u2019t quit. Though staunch Texas conservatives don\u2019t have many victories at the federal level, they have certainly gotten the attention of incumbents, who are now making sure their conservative credentials are intact.\n\nCruz gets unlikely support\n\nFirst, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Now, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nPresidential contender Ted Cruz is finding support in unlikely places. The senator from Texas, known for his push to shut down the government to defund the Affordable Care Act, is generally disliked by his peers in Washington and in the GOP establishment.\n\nBut in his uphill battle against New York businessman Donald Trump, his old enemies are now friends of sort. They see him as their last chance to wrestle the GOP presidential nomination from Trump, who has a solid delegate lead.\n\nCruz has welcomed the support. But will it hurt him with voters who have disdain for the establishment and are looking for an outsider?\n\nMaybe, but he\u2019ll need a united front to have any chance to catch Trump now.\n\nTwitter: @gromerjeffers", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Donald Trump and his loyal base of voters rattle the Republican establishment, Texans in Congress are mostly unscathed by grass-roots activists pushing for sweeping change in Washington.", "og": {"description": "As Donald Trump and his loyal base of voters rattle the Republican establishment, Texans in Congress are mostly unscathed by grass-roots activists pushing for sweeping change in Washington.", "title": "Sweeping change hasn\u2019t swept out Texas incumbents in Congress", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20160323-sweeping-change-hasnt-swept-out-texas-incumbents-in-congress.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20160323-wap.4932_49507341.ece/BINARY/original/WAP.4932_49507341", "height": 858}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-03-23T19:11:21Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-03-23T19:08:42Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Sweeping change hasn\\u2019t swept out Texas incumbents in Congress\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20160323-sweeping-change-hasnt-swept-out-texas-incumbents-in-congress.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20160323-wap.4932_49507341.ece/BINARY/original/WAP.4932_49507341\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2698946\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-03-23T19:08:42Z\", \"section\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"author\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20160323-wap.4932_49507341.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/WAP.4932_49507341", "publishtime": "2016-03-23T19:08:42Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Members of the Texas GOP delegation to Congress watched in horror but were able to prepare for challengers to their own seats.\n\u201cIn Texas, none of the challengers had the one ingredient absolutely necessary for success in Texas politics \u2014 money,\u201d Minchillo said.\nIn that race, businessman Don Huffines had plenty of campaign cash and the backing of a coalition of tea party and libertarian activists.\nAs Donald Trump and his loyal base of voters rattle the Republican establishment, Texans in Congress are mostly unscathed by grass-roots activists pushing for sweeping change in Washington.\nThe failure of tea party activists and other conservatives to dislodge members of Congress stems from their lack of resources and inability to slate formidable challengers."}
