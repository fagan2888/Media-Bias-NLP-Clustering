Nikki Haley, R-S.C., former senator Jim DeMint and Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action.\n\nHaley said that the forum will be an opportunity for the voters of South Carolina to hear from the candidates.\n\n\u201cWe have a strong slate of candidates running for the Republican nomination for president, and ahead of our primary, South Carolina voters want to hear from each candidate personally about the most important issues\u2014from health care to jobs and the economy\u2014facing the states and our nation,\u201d said Haley. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome our candidates to South Carolina and offer them the chance to talk face to face with our voters.\u201d\n\nDeMint and Needham said that the forum will be a productive policy discussion.\n\n\u201cFor too long, the playing field has been tilted toward those who try to game the system, and the American people are tired of it,\u201d said DeMint. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for leaders who demonstrate a principled commitment to opportunity for all Americans. Instead of \u2018gotcha questions\u2019 or the usual political fights, we will discuss solutions on issues that matter to families like education, health care, energy, foreign policy and more.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery candidate runs against Washington because every voter knows the town is a well-oiled machine that works only for the well-connected,\u201d said Needham. \u201cThis will be an opportunity for the candidates to articulate their desire to deliver a bold agenda that will bring opportunity for all and favoritism to none.\u201d\n\nThe forum will be held on Sept. 18 in Greenville, S.C., at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heritage Action for America has announced that it will host a forum for presidential candidates in the early primary state of South Carolina.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Heritage Action for America has announced that it will host a forum for presidential candidates in the early primary state of South Carolina.", "title": "Heritage Action to Host 2016 Presidential Candidate Forum", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150521_RandPaul_StevenPurce.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PyEpeb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Heritage Action for America has announced that it will host a forum for presidential candidates in the early primary state of South Carolina.", "title": "Heritage Action to Host 2016 Presidential Candidate Forum", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150521_RandPaul_StevenPurce.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-05-21T11:31:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Heritage Action, presidential candidates, Jim DeMint, Nikki Haley, 2016 elections"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf3f\"", "article_summary": "Heritage Action for America announced today that it will host a forum for presidential candidates in the early primary state of South Carolina this September.\nAccording to Heritage Action, during the forum, candidates who are seeking the Republican nomination will partake in a \u201cwide-ranging\u201d policy discussion and outline their platforms.\nHaley said that the forum will be an opportunity for the voters of South Carolina to hear from the candidates.\nNikki Haley, R-S.C., former senator Jim DeMint and Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action.\nThe candidates participating in the forum will be joined by Gov."}
