The Affordable Care Act has just provided more access to that dysfunctional system,\u201d iVantage chief Donald Bialek said during an ACA debate at The Economist\u2019s health care forum in Boston on Wednesday. Bialek, for his part, was on the side defending the health care law.\n\nRelated: So Far, Obamacare\u2019s Hospital Reform Isn\u2019t Working\n\nIt\u2019s a common theme for ACA supporters to tout the law as a success in terms of providing access to coverage\u2014after all, some 8 million people signed up for health care on the federal or state exchanges this year. And the national uninsured rate has fallen to record lows since the law\u2019s implementation.\n\nJust this week, the Centers for Disease Control reported that the uninsured rate fell to 13.1 percent during the first three quarters of the year\u2014a 1.3 percent drop from the first quarter of last year, reflecting a decline of 3.8 million uninsured in the country. Even those who were hesitant to embrace the law are starting to see positive results.\n\n\u201cEven though it cost our industry a lot of money, the exchanges are helping bring coverage people that weren\u2019t able to get it before,\u201d Humana\u2019s chief executive Bruce Broussard said.\n\nIf Obamacare Fails, Blame the States\n\nBut where the law falls short, many say, is with the care itself.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act should really be called the Affordable Insurance Premiums Act.\u201d Broussard said although more people have health insurance, the law does nothing to improve the care they receive with that health insurance. \u201cObamacare didn\u2019t really address that and we still have a long way to go in that respect.\u201d\n\nThere are several provisions in the ACA that are meant to improve the quality of care like Hospital Value Based Purchasing, which rewards or penalizes hospitals depending on their performance. However, that provision has not led to any substantial improvements in care so far, one study found.\n\n\n\nAnother measure penalizes or rewards hospitals for their re-admittance rates. That program was flagged earlier this year by a panel of 26 experts who said it could unintentionally hurt hospitals that serve a disproportionately large share of low-income people. Regardless, many experts say it\u2019s still too early to measure the effectiveness of these types of programs.\n\nRelated: Public Opinion on Obamacare Still Unfavorable\n\nMeanwhile, health experts say that when it comes to health care reform, one of the most important issues is the way doctors are paid.\n\nHealth economists agree that the U.S. health care system should shift away from the traditional fee-for-service model.\n\n\u201cThere is a serious problems with incentives and professional culture and expectations of people that needs to be addressed,\u201d said Peter Berman, a professor at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cFee-for-service rewarded us for doing highly interventional things; changing those incentives is key to reform.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BOSTON -- When it comes to the president\u2019s health care law, there\u2019s very little that R", "title": "Obamacare Has a Long Way to Go, ACA Experts Say", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/17/Obamacare-Has-Long-Way-Go-ACA-Experts-Say", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11222013_Obamacare_Buttons.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/17/Obamacare-Has-Long-Way-Go-ACA-Experts-Say", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11222013_Obamacare_Buttons.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BOSTON -- When it comes to the president\u2019s health care law, there\u2019s very little that R", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd292d\"", "article_summary": "Related: Public Opinion on Obamacare Still UnfavorableMeanwhile, health experts say that when it comes to health care reform, one of the most important issues is the way doctors are paid.\nRegardless, many experts say it\u2019s still too early to measure the effectiveness of these types of programs.\nHealth economists agree that the U.S. health care system should shift away from the traditional fee-for-service model.\nBialek, for his part, was on the side defending the health care law.\nIf Obamacare Fails, Blame the StatesBut where the law falls short, many say, is with the care itself."}
