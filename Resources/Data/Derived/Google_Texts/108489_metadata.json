If this bill had passed, it would have undermined Coloradans' Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) by taking fees that the Colorado hospitals collect, and putting them into an \"enterprise fund\" instead of the general fund, where they trigger taxpayer funds.\n\n\n\nIn reaction to today's vote, AFP Colorado State Director Michael Fields released the following statement:\n\n\n\n\"We applaud the state senate for killing a convoluted scheme today in HB- 1420, that would have denied taxpayers their refunds in future years without even giving Coloradans a say. We are now hopeful that the state can get down to the business of addressing the real state budget issues that will not be fixed by enterprising the hospital provider fee. Our network of 127,000 Colorado activists will continue to stand strong for the best interest of all Coloradans.\"\n\n\n\nThis is the second year in a row that the legislature has voted down this legislation. AFP Colorado thanks Senators Hill, Holbert and Neville for standing up for taxpayers.\n\nGREENWOOD VILLAGE, COLO. \u2013 May 10, 2016 \u2013 \u201cThe Colorado Hospital Association (CHA) is extremely disappointed that our legislative leaders couldn\u2019t come to a compromise on the Hospital Provider Fee enterprise this year \u2013 despite bipartisan support and no testimony opposing the bill in its final committee hearing \u2013 and in effect, didn\u2019t listen to their constituents or the broad organizational support through the Fix the Glitch coalition who strongly advocated for this change,\u201d said Steven J. Summer, CHA president and CEO. \u201cHowever, we are grateful to Speaker Hullinghorst and Senator Crowder for their leadership on this issue, as well as to the many others \u2013 including our member hospitals and health systems \u2013 who supported this important effort. Our hospitals recognize the critical nature of the priorities in their communities that are subject to budget constraints this year \u2013 including health care, education and transportation.\n\n\n\nBecause the legislature was unable to fix this glitch this year \u2013 even though it was within their purview to do so \u2013 CHA is committed to finding a long-term solution that supports the vital services provided by our members as well as the broader fiscal, education and infrastructure needs of Coloradans. Otherwise, we risk facing detrimental health care budget cuts \u2013 mostly on the backs of our rural hospitals \u2013 in the years to come.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbout the Colorado Hospital Association\n\nThe Colorado Hospital Association (CHA) is the leading voice of Colorado\u2019s hospital and health system community. Representing more than 100 member hospitals and health systems throughout the state, CHA serves as a trusted, credible and reliable resource on health issues, hospital data and trends for its members, media, policymakers and the general public. Through CHA, Colorado\u2019s hospitals and health systems work together in their shared commitment to improve health and health care in Colorado.\n\n\n\nColorado\u2019s leaders have found a solution to the state\u2019s thorny budget problem. It\u2019s simple; it\u2019s legal and it has the support of nearly every business group from the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce to the Colorado Springs Regional Business Alliance.\n\n\n\nThe solution: Move the hospital provider fee from the general fund to its own enterprise fund. Since it has a dedicated use \u2014 to match federal Medicaid dollars on a one-to-one basis \u2014 it doesn\u2019t belong in the general fund. Since it\u2019s a fee, not a tax, that hospitals pay to reduce their uncompensated debt and charity care, it doesn\u2019t belong in calculated revenue limits under the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights. And there are $60 million reasons why the change is vital.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one man standing in the way: Sen. Bill Cadman. Cadman, who represents a portion of Colorado Springs in the General Assembly, is the Senate president. It\u2019s his job to make sure legislation gets a vote \u2014 but he has said he doesn\u2019t support this change and believes it\u2019s illegal.\n\n\n\nHis stance is in direct opposition to at least two prominent fellow Republicans. Attorney General Cynthia Coffman released a legal opinion earlier this month saying there were no legal barriers to the enterprise fee designation. Springs Mayor John Suthers, who preceded Coffman as attorney general, concurs with her opinion. Supporters say they have enough votes in the full Senate to pass the change.\n\n\n\nSome political insiders believe Cadman has become too close to Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers\u2019 conservative political action group that believes any change to TABOR is a threat to the state. When he became Senate president, Cadman credited AFP and its influence. He also made sure every senator had a copy of AFP\u2019s legislative agenda on the first day of the session.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that Cadman thanked a political action group instead of voters who trusted him to act on their behalf. It shows where his loyalty lies \u2014 not with Colorado Springs.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t just legislative sleight-of-hand designed to increase spending. Without removing the provider fee, the state will have to cut $60 million from its budget because of TABOR.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s almost certain that there will be cuts to higher education, harming low- and middle-income families already struggling to pay high tuition and fees at state institutions.\n\n\n\nBut for Colorado Springs, Cadman\u2019s recalcitrance has added implications.\n\n\n\nThe city is currently celebrating Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s announced plan to place a National Cyber Intelligence Center here. It\u2019s good news for Colorado Springs, already home to more than 80 cyber companies.\n\n\n\nBut without state money, it can\u2019t happen. The Springs\u2019 share of a $5 billion industry, its jobs, its research and development, the cyber defense the nation demands to keep networks safe \u2014 all could disappear.\n\n\n\nBy following AFP\u2019s agenda, Cadman\u2019s ignoring the will of local Republicans who put him in office. He\u2019s damaging the state\u2019s ability to educate its children, meaning that high-paying, high-tech jobs won\u2019t be available to Colorado natives.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s harming the chances for the Springs \u2014 the area he represents \u2014 to bring together cybersecurity leaders, researchers, businesses and community leaders to create a national center.\n\n\n\nThe numbers are clear: Without changes to the state budget, Colorado soon will only be able to pay for Medicare and prisons.\n\n\n\nWhy is Sen. Bill Cadman standing alone? The answer: He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s standing with Americans for Prosperity, and against business development and higher education in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe, which includesfrom Colorado Springs, defeated House Bill 1420, which would have set up a mechanism that would allow hospitals to benefit from fees they collect to help fundThe committee, dominated by, got accolades from the extreme right-wing, largely funded by the, but it got raspberries from the hospital industry.The AFP's release:The hospital association said this:We suppose Hill and his cohorts would, if they could, follow the lead ofof, who led that state's GOP-dominated legislature to not accept the expansion of Medicaid as part of the, while at the same time giving huge tax breaks to businesses and farmers.
