Forty-seven House Democrats joined with Republicans to support the bill, despite a veto threat from the White House.\n\n\u201cBy blocking this measure, Senate Democrats are making it that much harder for us to keep Americans safe. Their vote is irresponsible in a time of grave threats,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a formal statement Wednesday following the Senate\u2019s vote.\n\nProponents of the legislation wanted to give the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the director of National Intelligence the authority to heighten background checks to guarantee that any refugees pursuing asylum from Syria or Iraq are not \u201ca threat to the security\u201d of the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama and Democrats who stood in opposition to the bill argued that the current vetting system is stringent enough and that the SAFE Act would only hinder assistance to those attempting to escape areas enveloped in war and terrorism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bill would have made it more difficult for refugees emigrating from Iraq and Syria to apply for temporary status.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The bill would have made it more difficult for refugees emigrating from Iraq and Syria to apply for temporary status.", "title": "Find Out How Your Senators Voted on the Refugee Bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160120_RefugeeVote_Johnson1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-21T10:26:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1lwDqO3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The bill would have made it more difficult for refugees emigrating from Iraq and Syria to apply for temporary status.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160120_RefugeeVote_Johnson1.jpg"}, "title": "Find Out How Your Senators Voted on the Refugee Bill", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2016-01-20T19:06:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-21T10:26:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Syrian refugees, SAFE Act, national security, Barack Obama, Paul Ryan, terrorism, American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, refugee bill, Senate, vote"}, "article_summary": "The Senate voted 55-43 Wednesday to block legislation that would strengthen the vetting process for refugees seeking haven in the United States.\nThe SAFE Act had sailed through the House in November by a bipartisan vote of 289-137.\n\u201cWith our national security at risk, Congress has a duty to ensure there is a thorough and transparent vetting program in place,\u201d Needham said.\nForty-seven House Democrats joined with Republicans to support the bill, despite a veto threat from the White House.\nThe Republican-backed legislation, called the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act\u2014dubbed the \u201cSAFE Act\u201d by House members\u2014needed to clinch at least 60 votes to avert a filibuster spearheaded by Democrats."}
