Driving from Quincy, Mass., wintry conditions accompanied the journey to Foxborough. So it was a surprise to walk into Gillette Stadium and find no tarp on the field.

Based on ESPN live shots and a time-stamped photo on NFL.com at 9:37 a.m., the field wasn’t covered in the hours leading up to the 2:25 p.m. MT kickoff. The league office directed questions regarding the lack of tarp to the Patriots.



The explanation from a team official? The wind. It was blowing too hard, which would prevent the tarp from staying down even if sandbags, like they use in baseball, were employed.

As a result, a plow-equipped tractor pushed snow off with vertical laps down the field, while five employees used leaf blowers to clear the surface horizontally. They were still using the leaf blowers as a handful of Broncos players began going through drills.

The tractor and leaf blowers sprayed the black rubber pellets — turf bugs some athletes call them — throughout the field turf. Because this is a rivalry game, no element goes unnoticed. Will it create an advantage one way or the other? The players will ultimately provide the answer when asked afterward.
