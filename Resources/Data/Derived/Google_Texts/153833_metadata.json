(MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n4445876\n\nGeorge Orwell said that \u201cin a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\u201d Republican congressman Brian Babin is new to Congress, and this dentist from Woodvine, Texas radiates a love for country while worrying for his grandchildren when he sees the sorry state of our federal government.\n\nBut Babin is unafraid to speak clearly, and Washington should listen to what he has to say.\n\nWhen the Democrats crowed in December about getting \u201call they wanted from Republicans\u201d in the Cromnibus, the newly elected Babin became increasingly skeptical of what House Republicans were doing. On the opening day of the 114th Congress, Babin was one of the 25 who didn\u2019t vote for John Boehner for Speaker, a vote he said \u201cwas not fun,\u201d but which was facilitated by numerous, passionate calls from his district supporting his doubts.\n\nContradicting the notion of compromise with President Obama that most Republican leaders are currently espousing, this freshman says his Texas voters \u201cunequivocally sent a message to stop Obama\u2019s policies. Period.\u201d\n\nWhile Babin believes President Obama \u201cdeserves impeachment,\u201d he can\u2019t see Washington doing it. But the new Republican Senate can allow the 114th Congress to demonstrate the congressional \u201cpower of the purse\u201d as given to it in the Constitution. The president \u201ccan no longer hide behind the skirts of Harry Reid,\u201d he says.\n\nAs a veteran himself and a father of a decorated Navy SEAL, Babin thinks Obama is an \u201cappeaser deluxe\u201d as the Texan watches the decline of our military \u2014 as well as the nation\u2019s stature. Beyond foreign policy failures and the erosion of our military, the \u201cunchecked and unsecured border puts us at risk.\u201d\n\nApart from the implications of open borders, Babin sees the harmful impact of federal leniency on amnesty and borders from his experience as a school board member, mayor and city councilman. He says, \u201cwe can\u2019t afford to take everyone under our wing and lay this burden on the American taxpayer.\u201d\n\nTo those business interests or Republicans obfuscating on immigration policy to appease or pander, Babin calls this a \u201cdangerous precedent.\u201d This will \u201cset the precedent that the Congress has completely abdicated their responsibility,\u201d he believes.\n\nBabin thinks President Obama\u2019s legacy will be one of vacillation and weakness, with American decline on his watch. \u201cWe do not have a Churchill in office here.\u201d\n\nOn Obama\u2019s most infamous achievement, Obamacare, Babin says he will do everything in his power to repeal it. Obamacare, he believes, \u201cis not affordable and it is the gift that keeps on taking.\u201d\n\nOn the emerging threats from the Islamic State, Obama should stand up for American interests. \u201cI\u2019m an old Golden Glover. I\u2019m not saying I was a great fighter or anything, but you need to know how to defend yourself, and when people are intent upon your destruction, bullying you, it\u2019s time to stand up for your people and hit back and hit back real hard.\u201d\n\nFor more on freshman Rep.
