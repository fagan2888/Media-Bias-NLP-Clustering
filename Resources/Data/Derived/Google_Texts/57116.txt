ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The man who endorsed 87 “national security” candidates and donated close to $500,000 during the 2014 midterms is back in action. Former United Nations ambassador John Bolton announced Thursday that he was backing Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana in his gubernatorial quest in the state; Rep. Ron DeSantis, the incumbent Congressman from Florida’s 6th district, and Dr. Paul Chabot, candidate for Congress in California’s 31st district.

Mr. Bolton’s political action committee - Bolton PAC - will donate $10,000 each to Mssrs. Vitter and DeSantis, while Mr.Chabot will receive $5,000. All three are military veterans. This is the first time Mr. Bolton has endorsed hopefuls in primary elections, and these are his first endorsements for 2015.

According to a mission statement, Mr. Bolton’s political action committee supports “candidates who are committed to restoring strong American economic and national security through independent expenditures and campaigns and issue-oriented education. We want leaders who believe that America’s continuing presence in the world is good for America, good for our freedoms, good for our economy, and good for our future. We believe that it is not American strength that is provocative, but American weakness, as the Obama administration has unfortunately proven again and again.”
