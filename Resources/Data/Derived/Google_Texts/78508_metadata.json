A physician is also free to relay his dealings with industry to his patients individually or on a website if he so chooses,\" Adalja adds. \"Under Obamacare, mandates backed by fines for non-compliance replace such judgments.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Adalja, the creation of the list will fall under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which is part of the Affordable Care Act. It stipulates that the names of doctors must be reported regardless of whether the product being marketed is \u2014 or was \u2014 FDA approved for use.\n\n\n\n\"Such a proviso clearly identifies that the true purpose of this regulation, hiding behind the veil of transparency, is to reinforce the reality to physicians that no longer are they the masters of their own livelihoods or autonomous,\" Adalja writes.\n\n\n\n\"They are now mere cogs in what has become almost a total state enterprise in which compliance with any order is the currency.\"\n\n\n\nUrgent: Should GOP Stick to Its Guns on Obamacare?
