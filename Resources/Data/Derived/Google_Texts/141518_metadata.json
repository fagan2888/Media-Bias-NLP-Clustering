Bartells, Selle Supply and PBI Supply\n\nDistribution International Inc. (DI), a distributor and fabricator in the mechanical insulation market, has acquired a target in the sector, 3i Supply Company. The transaction aligns with DI\u2019s growth strategy centered on acquisitions that expand both its geographic presence and capabilities, the company says.\n\n3i Supply is headquartered in Midland, Michigan. DI, which is backed by private equity firm Advent International, is based in Houston, Texas. In December 2014, Advent announced plans to add DI to its portfolio with its purchase of the company from PE firms Audax Group LP and CapStreet Group LLC, which jointly-owned the company since 2010.\n\nDI has 85 branch locations, from which the company provides customers with products and services across the commercial building, chemicals, energy, power, railcar and marine end markets. DI has broadened its reach over the past four years with 14 acquisitions.\n\nIn December, DI acquired Renton, Washington-based E.J. Bartells, a supplier of mechanical and industrial insulation, fabrication, refractory, and HVAC products. This was preceded by DI\u2019s October purchase of Selle Supply Company and sister company PBI Supply Inc., full-line distributors of insulation products and related construction materials, specializing in the lamination of fiberglass insulation for metal buildings.\n\nFinancial details regarding DI\u2019s purchase of 3i have not been disclosed.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"status": "open", "domain": "Mergers & Acquisitions", "sailthru.author": "Jakema Lewis", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-04-07 13:58:00", "og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/building_products/distribution-expands-in-building-materials-market-with-3i-purchase-260071-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/insulation.jpeg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Advent-Backed DI Expands in Building Materials Market with 3i Purchase"}, "type": "Article", "brand": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-07 13:58:00", "wordcount": 207, "sailthru.title": "Advent-Backed DI Expands in Building Materials Market with 3i Purchase", "featured": 0, "sailthru.tags": "News, Building Products, Building Products, Advent-Backed DI Expands in Building Materials Market with 3i Purchase, PBI Supply, Selle Supply Company, Advent, Audax, E.J.
