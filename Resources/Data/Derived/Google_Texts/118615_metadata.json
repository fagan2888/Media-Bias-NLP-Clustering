It would be called \u201cLet\u2019s Eat at Home\u201d and would serve prepared food made from locally-sourced ingredients.\n\nRelated: Putin and Tsipras Get Chummy to Stick It to the West\n\nThe restaurants were proposed to give Russians a patriotic reason to take their business away from Western-owned chains.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this project is to promote import substitution and an alternative to Western fast food chains,\u201d the brothers wrote to Putin in a letter obtained by the newspaper Kommersant. They requested nearly one billion rubles, or about $18.7 million, to get the project off the ground.\n\nAccording to the Kommersant report, Putin met with Mikhalov last month, and assigned Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich to examine the proposal. The brothers hope to launch 41 cafes and an additional 91 food stands selling pre-made meals.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear just how much support the brothers can expect from the Kremlin. On Thursday, Anatoly Kutsenko, a top official with the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, said that a request for funding made to his department appeared to be misdirected.\n\nRelated: Who Hacked the White House? Putin Says, \u2018Not Us\u2019\n\n\u201cThe task of the Agriculture Ministry is to prepare products for consumption but the question is in the format ... This is related to catering business and is not a question to us directly,\u201d Kutsenko told the state-run news agency TASS. \u201cOf course we do not object but it does not meet our aid format, after all it\u2019s a question to the Industry and Trade Ministry.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Putin has taken a personal interest in the project suggests an initial rebuff from the Agriculture Ministry might not spell the end of the project.\n\nMcDonalds has long been used as a political football since its first store opened in Russia in 1990. As recently as last year, a number of franchises, including the chain\u2019s marquee location in Moscow\u2019s Pushkin Square, were shut down by the Russian government over questions about public health.\n\nThe move came as the U.S. and its allies were marshaling sanctions against top Russian officials over the invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year. It was widely viewed as a political message rather than a legitimate public health concern. The restaurants were all later reopened.\n\nThe \u201cLet\u2019s Eat at Home!\u201d brand would also not be the first attempt to unseat McDonalds with a homegrown burger chain. The RusBurger corporation, founded in 2009, markets itself as a Russian alternative to McDonalds and currently operates stores in 25 cities across the country.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A pair of Russian movie directors are appealing to the Kremlin to help fund a chain of domestic fast food restaurants meant to compete with American behemoth McDonalds \u2013 and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounds interested.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Mac Attack Would Take Bite Out of McDonald\u2019s", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/10/Putin-s-Mac-Attack-Would-Take-Bite-Out-McDonald-s", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/hungary-putin_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/10/Putin-s-Mac-Attack-Would-Take-Bite-Out-McDonald-s", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/hungary-putin_2.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A pair of Russian movie directors are appealing to the Kremlin to help fund a chain of domestic fast food restaurants meant to compete with American behemoth McDonalds \u2013 and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounds interested.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde21\"", "article_summary": "Putin Says, \u2018Not Us\u2019\u201cThe task of the Agriculture Ministry is to prepare products for consumption but the question is in the format ...\nOn Thursday, Anatoly Kutsenko, a top official with the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, said that a request for funding made to his department appeared to be misdirected.\nThe \u201cLet\u2019s Eat at Home!\u201d brand would also not be the first attempt to unseat McDonalds with a homegrown burger chain.\nThe RusBurger corporation, founded in 2009, markets itself as a Russian alternative to McDonalds and currently operates stores in 25 cities across the country.\nMcDonalds has long been used as a political football since its first store opened in Russia in 1990."}
