Police have identified the man killed in a house fire last week in Emporia.

Crews were called late Thursday, October 8, to the home in the 1600 block of East Wilman Court. Rescuers found a man who had died in the second story of the home. He is identified as 67-year-old Ronald Roerig.

WIBW reports a preliminary investigation shows Roerig suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and severe burns.

Three firefighters were treated for non-life threatening injuries.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but investigators do not suspect foul play.
