That\u2019s up from the $25,000 the drug lobby group gave in 2012. And the National Cable and Telecommunications Association has contributed $20,000 to American Commitment \u2014 $10,000 in both 2012 and 2013.\n\nAs a \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofit organized under Sec. 501(c)(4) of the tax code, American Commitment is not required to publicly disclose its donors, even though it overtly supports political candidates.\n\nBut separate IRS filings show the bulk of American Commitment\u2019s money has come from these nonprofits, which are legally required to disclose grants they provide to other nonprofit organizations.\n\nAmerican Commitment itself disclosed, as required by law, that in 2013, it received between $100,000 and $150,000 each from four unnamed donors.\n\nTogether, those four donors \u2014 one of which appears to have been the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce \u2014 accounted for half of American Commitment\u2019s $1 million in income last year, according to records filed with the IRS earlier this week.\n\nLed by Phil Kerpen \u2014 a veteran of Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth and the Cato Institute \u2014 American Commitment has vigorously opposed efforts to force donor disclosure on social welfare nonprofit groups.\n\nIt has derided liberal politicians for what it calls \u201cshameful efforts to amend the Constitution to empower politicians to regulate political speech\u201d and \u201cbackdoor regulatory efforts to limit the First Amendment at federal agencies.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, after the IRS unveiled a proposal to regulate politically active nonprofits organized under Sec. 501(c)(4) of the tax code, American Commitment co-wrote a letter to the agency\u2019s commissioner calling for the new rules to be \u201cwithdrawn and abandoned.\u201d\n\nAccording to its website, it\u2019s also helped thousands of people flood the inboxes of their lawmakers with the message: \u201cDon\u2019t let the IRS gut the First Amendment!\u201d\n\nGiven its involvement in elections, American Commitment ranks high among social welfare nonprofits that would be affected by any new IRS rules governing so-called dark money \u2014 cash from publicly undisclosed donors used to boost or bash political candidates.\n\nAhead of the 2014 midterms, American Commitment promoted Republican US Senate candidate Thom Tillis of North Carolina in radio ads. In 2013, it backed Republican US Senate candidate Steve Lonegan in his race against Democrat Cory Booker. And Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) was among politicians American Commitment supported in 2012.\n\nCampaign finance reform activists for years have called upon the tax agency to take a more aggressive stance regarding politically active nonprofits, which gained the ability to fund advertisements explicitly calling for the election or defeat of lawmakers in the wake of the US Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in 2010.\n\nGroups such as Crossroads GPS on the right, which was co-founded by GOP strategist Karl Rove, and Patriot Majority USA on the left, which is run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) have proliferated \u2014 all while legally keeping their donors\u2019 names secret.\n\nThe IRS \u2014 which, earlier this year, postponed a public hearing on its highly contentious plan \u2014 has vowed to issue a new draft of proposed regulations for social welfare nonprofits in early 2015.\n\n\u201cProtecting the privacy of our members is critical to their core First Amendment rights of free speech and free association.\u201d \u2013 Phil Kerpen, president of American Commitment\n\nIndustry lobbying groups such as PhRMA and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA) have also found an ally in American Commitment.\n\nOne of NCTA\u2019s top issues: opposing \u201cNet neutrality\u201d policies that would regulate the Internet like a utility \u2014 a move the trade group says would be \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\n\nAmerican Commitment\u2019s Kerpen, meanwhile, has argued that \u201cregulating and taxing the Internet is obviously a terrible idea.\u201d\n\nJoy Sims, an NCTA spokeswoman, declined to comment about the group\u2019s donation to American Commitment.\n\nAmerican Commitment further describes itself as \u201ccommitted to fully repealing\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and replacing it in a way that \u201cempowers patients and doctors\u201d and unleashes \u201cAmerican ingenuity and creativity to cure diseases.\u201d\n\nRobert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for PhRMA \u2014 which supported the passage of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act but has also funneled money to groups like American Commitment that want it scrapped \u2014 said the trade group often gives out money to \u201corganizations that share PhRMA\u2019s goals of improving the quality of patients\u2019 lives\u201d and \u201csupporting the discovery of new treatments and cures.\u201d\n\nOther donors to American Commitment remain unknown \u2014 exactly how the group wants them to be.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the Warren Court\u2019s landmark 1958 ruling in NAACP v. Alabama that protecting the privacy of our members is critical to their core First Amendment rights of free speech and free association,\u201d Kerpen wrote in an email to the Center for Public Integrity.\n\n(Update, 7:02 p.m., Nov. 20, 2014: This story has been updated to include Kerpen\u2019s reference to the NAACP v. Alabama case.)\n\nIn recent years, the American Future Fund has spent tens of millions of dollars advocating against federal lawmakers, including about $81,000 in late 2013 against Rep. Collin Peterson, the ranking Democratic member of the House Agriculture Committee.\n\nLike American Commitment, it has done so without disclosing its funders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most of the $13 million raised by American Commitment has come from three Koch-backed groups.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "Most of the $13 million raised by American Commitment has come from three Koch-backed groups.", "title": "Koch-linked Organization Uses \u2018Dark Money\u2019 to Fight Political Disclosure | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Lois+Lerner+IRS+Facebook+Campaign-copy.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-03-23T17:57:16-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/11/28/koch-linked-organization-uses-dark-money-fight-political-disclosure/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most of the $13 million raised by American Commitment has come from three Koch-backed groups.", "title": "Koch-linked Organization Uses \u2018Dark Money\u2019 to Fight Political Disclosure | BillMoyers.com", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Lois+Lerner+IRS+Facebook+Campaign-copy.jpg", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-11-28T11:15:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-23T17:57:16-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20141128}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf79b\"", "article_summary": "The Center to Protect Patient Rights \u2014 headed by Koch-connected political consultant Sean Noble \u2014 contributed about $4.8 million to American Commitment in 2012.\nAhead of the 2014 midterms, American Commitment promoted Republican US Senate candidate Thom Tillis of North Carolina in radio ads.\nAnd the National Cable and Telecommunications Association has contributed $20,000 to American Commitment \u2014 $10,000 in both 2012 and 2013.\n501(c)(4) of the tax code, American Commitment is not required to publicly disclose its donors, even though it overtly supports political candidates.\nLike American Commitment, it has done so without disclosing its funders."}
