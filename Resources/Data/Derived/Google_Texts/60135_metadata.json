And for some 39 other hospitals whose data are grouped with sister facilities in California, and many more across the country.\n\nBut a report released March 16 by the Leapfrog Group, which represents employers who buy health coverage, brings some sunshine to this darkness.\n\nIt shows individual rates of infection in intensive care units by individual hospital building, not in combination with other facilities in a larger system. Lower numbers are better.\n\n\u201cInfection rates vary significantly by hospital,\u201d said Melissa Danforth, Leapfrog\u2019s vice president for hospital ratings. \u201cThat\u2019s why Leapfrog requires hospitals to report our annual survey by location \u2014 by bricks and mortar facility \u2014 not by Medicare provider number, which may include up to seven hospitals.\u201d\n\nDanforth said this granularity allows consumers, employers and health plans that select networks, and referring physicians, to have \u201clocation-specific information, information they can actually use to select and compare hospitals.\u201d\n\nCase in point: On Medicare\u2019s quality score website, Hospital Compare, UCSD\u2019s rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infections in its intensive care units is shown as 1.405, a combined rate for both hospital facilities, and one that Hospital Compare says is \u201cworse than national benchmark.\u201d According to the Leapfrog\u2019s survey, however, Thornton Hospital\u2019s rate for these infections, known as CAUTIs, is .746, while the rate for UCSD\u2019s Hillcrest campus is much higher, 2.207.\n\nSimilarly for central-line associated bloodstream infections, or CLABSIs, on Hospital Compare UCSD\u2019s rate is listed at .936, which is \u201cno different than a national benchmark.\u201d But in the Leapfrog survey, the scores are separated, with Thornton having .576 and Hillcrest .941.\n\nLeapfrog segregates data for Scripps Mercy\u2019s two facilities as well. For example, Hospital Compare shows Scripps Mercy\u2019s intensive care unit CAUTI rate as .975, which is \u201cno different than national benchmark.\u201d But in the Leapfrog survey, Scripps Mercy in Hillcrest is shown to have a rate of 1.019, while Scripps Mercy in Chula Vista has a rate of .610.\n\nFor CLABSI, the Hospital Compare rate is .524, \u201cno different than national benchmark.\u201d But the Leapfrog survey shows .228 for Hillcrest and .322 for Chula Vista.\n\nThe Leapfrog Group\u2019s report noted that Sharp Memorial Hospital had a CAUTI rate of 3.038, the 38th highest in the country.\n\nAll the rates reflect a formula that compares the actual number of a hospital ICU\u2019s infections to its \u201cpredicted\u201d number. For example, intensive care units specializing in burn patients are compared with each other, as are units specializing in intensive care for surgical patients and or medical patients. A ratio of 1.0 means a hospital\u2019s infection rate is the same as its expected rate.\n\nNationally, 56 percent of hospitals had an infection rate between 0 and 1 for CAUTI, and 92 percent had a rate between 0 and 1 for CLABSI, according to Leapfrog.\n\nThe information is important for consumers, Danforth said, not just because these infections are preventable, but they\u2019re also expensive and deadly. \u201cThese measures really represent a hospital safety record but also give you a sense of where you may be wasting your dollars,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Leapfrog survey also gives consumers a sense of how well the hospitals have improved. For example, UCSD is said to have made \u201csome progress\u201d on improving its CLABSIs but has made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in its CAUTIs over prior reporting periods.\n\nLeah Binder, Leapfrog Group president and CEO, explains the infection-rate study and why it is important for San Diego County.\n\nFor CLABSIs, the Leapfrog Group considers hospitals to have met its standards if it has a rate of zero. For CAUTIs, a hospital is considered to have met its standard if it has a rate equal to or below .443.\n\n\u201cHospital Compare doesn\u2019t do any true comparative performance analysis for consumers,\u201d Danforth said. Additionally, Hospital Compare reports far too many hospitals as being the same as the national average, \u201cso it\u2019s really asking a lot for consumers to interpret the information that\u2019s on the Hospital Compare website.\u201d The Leapfrog report provides that benchmarking information.\n\nDr. Francesca Torriani, medical director of infection control and epidemiology for both UCSD facilities, said Leapfrog\u2019s reports showing individual hospital infection rates are important for consumers and hospital staff to know, but the measures are not perfect.\n\nThey don\u2019t account for the fact that many of the Hillcrest facility\u2019s patients are more vulnerable to infections, such as those in the ICU awaiting a liver or abdominal transplant.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t say that defensively,\u201d Torriani said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not for us totally adequately adjusted, we accept that\u2019s where we are, and we move on,\u201d using every analysis available to find out if any of those infections could have been prevented.\n\nAdditionally, she said, more recent rates not yet published show both hospitals have improved.\n\nFrank Myers, UCSD\u2019s infection preventionist, and Torriani stressed that patients should not choose a hospital based on the rates of these infections. One hospital in Southern California, he said, had high infection rates, but for patients with advanced cancer, it has one of the best survival rates in the nation.\n\nDr. James LaBelle, chief medical officer for Scripps Health, attributed the difference to the types of patients treated in each hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and a formula that does not adequately adjust for the severity of individual patients\u2019 diseases.\n\nHe said it may be that patients in the ICUs at Scripps Mercy in Hillcrest are indeed sicker. \u201cThere\u2019s a much higher acuity of patients there,\u201d LaBelle said.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of this facility-level data, he said. \u201cWe can compare over time how we\u2019ve done \u2026 are we better today than we were yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely, this is useful. We track (these rates) like we track the bank account.\u201d\n\nHe added that improvement efforts are underway for both facilities. \u201cNationally, we want to be in the top, not the middle of the pack, so there\u2019s years of work to do there.\u201d\n\nA significant drawback in the Leapfrog survey is that it includes fewer than half of all hospitals across the country. That\u2019s because most of the 3,812 hospitals Leapfrog surveyed declined to respond in one or both categories, including Sharp Mary Birch Hospital, Alvarado Hospital, Palomar Medical Center and Pomerado Hospital. Some of those hospitals are not eligible to report or have too few qualifying patients to reliably calculate statistics.\n\nMore than a dozen other California hospital systems with multiple facilities have data merged by Hospital Compare as well.\n\nHospitals report the same data to the Leapfrog survey as they do to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, data that Medicare uses for two programs that penalize hospitals for poor care. The Leapfrog survey uses reporting periods that cover portions of 2014 and 2015. Some of Leapfrog\u2019s data may be more up to date by three months than Hospital Compare\u2019s, Danforth said.\n\nA CDC report in January said that although progress has been made in reducing CLABSIs, some 30,100 infections still occur in ICUs and wards of hospitals each year, increasing cost, mortality risk and prolonging hospital stays. A similar CDC report on CAUTIs says it\u2019s the fourth most common healthcare-associated infection, accounting for 13,000 deaths a year.\n\nWe'll let you know when big things happen.\n\nEmail address:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Diego news from inewsource", "description": "The report by the Leapfrog Group, which represents employers who buy health coverage, provides information consumers can use about two types of potentially deadly infections.
