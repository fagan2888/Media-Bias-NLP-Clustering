His State of the Union speech is likely to ask for that. Here's why he's not likely to get it.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nPresident Barack Obama meets with US Trade Representative Michael Froman in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Monday, Dec. 16, 2013.\n\nIf you disliked \"Obamacare,\" you\u2019re really going to boil over \u201cObamatrade.\u201d\n\nThat is the message from tea-party and other far right Republicans, who are blasting President Obama over his quest for special authority from Congress to move forward in coming months on several international free-trade deals.\n\nNew trade deals are key to meeting the president\u2019s 2010 goal of doubling US exports in five years \u2013 and trade-related jobs, the administration argues, are well-paying jobs that can help to narrow the rich-poor chasm that Mr. Obama sees as dangerous for America.\n\nIn a different era, Republican lawmakers could by and large be counted on \u2013 even by Democratic presidents \u2013 to support free-trade deals. But not now. Tea party Republicans and many grass-roots conservative organizations are having none of it, calling the administration's trade agenda \"Obamatrade.\"\n\nTo critics, ranging from tea party members of Congress and libertarian Sen. Rand Paul (R) of Kentucky, to conservative-causes doyenne Phyllis Schlafly \u2013 the president's trade agenda resembles his unpopular Affordable Care Act \u2013 in particular, they say, in the way it attempts to usurp congressional authority and expand executive power.\n\nAnd borrowing a rallying cry from their grass-roots equivalents on the left, the tea partyers are adding in for good measure that the president\u2019s trade proposals will be job killers.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on what they see as the \u201cbig lie\u201d of Obamacare \u2013 the claim that \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\u201d \u2013 these critics warn that under Obamatrade, \u201cIf you like your job, you can keep it.\u201d\n\nObama is widely expected to say Tuesday night, in his State of the Union speech, that he wants Congress to grant him Trade Promotion Authority. Now listen up here. That's also known as fast-track authority, and it means that Congress can only vote up or down on any trade deal the US completes with foreign countries. No amendments or picking and choosing among parts, thank you very much.\n\nWhy does Obama want this? Fast-track authority would smooth the way for passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a new trade deal the Obama administration is negotiating with 11 Asian and Latin American countries in the Pacific basin. Those countries are reluctant to move ahead on the deal, trade officials say, until they know Obama will face a yes-or-no vote on the pact and not a drawn-out debate. TPP is the economic cornerstone of Obama's \"Asia pivot\" and is instrumental in US efforts to ramp up participation in \u2013 and open greater market access to \u2013 the world's fastest-growing economic region.\n\nThe administration is also negotiating a trade and investment deal with the European Union, as well as global trade measures within the World Trade Organization.\n\nIn 2011, Obama got Congress to sign off on trade accords with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, but those deals were initiated under President George W. Bush and benefited from the fast-track authority that the Bush administration barely won in 2002.\n\nSince then, the politics of trade policy have become more complicated.\n\nObama knew all along that powerful sectors of his own party would oppose him on the Pacific trade pact \u2013 especially the staunchest labor and environmental advocates, some trade experts note. Last fall, about three-quarters of House Democrats signed a letter to Obama opposing fast trade authority. No more NAFTA-style trade deals that send US jobs offshore, many of the Democrats said, referring to the 1994 free-trade pact sealed with Mexico and Canada under President Bill Clinton.\n\nPerhaps even more remarkable is that 23 House Republicans sent Obama their own anti-fast-track letter. Since then, Republican opposition appears to have grown. Free-trade critics laud a coming together of the \u201cgrass-roots right\u201d and the \u201cgrass-roots left\" to oppose what they call the pro-business orientations of the \u201celites\u201d of both parties \u2013 and say it means fast-track is all but dead.\n\nThe no-fast-track letter from House Democrats \u201csignals the end of a controversial Nixon-era procedure used to railroad contentious trade pacts through Congress,\u201d Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, declared when the letter was made public.\n\nNow Ms. Wallach, whose national consumer advocacy group has long opposed most new trade deals, is adopting Obama\u2019s priority on reducing income inequality to wage war against fast-track trade authority.\n\n\u201cEither Obama can prioritize a battle against income equality or he can push more NAFTA-style trade agreements and the trade authority to railroad them through Congress,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he cannot do both.\u201d\n\nAdvocates of TPP and other trade deals scoff at the notion that fast-track authority is already a lost cause in Congress.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a conclusion to TPP [negotiations] this year, and I think we\u2019re going to see a deal that can pass Congress,\u201d says Charles Dittrich, vice president for regional trade initiatives at Washington\u2019s National Foreign Trade Council.\n\nBut the president and his administration will have to become much more engaged in the battle, those trade advocates say, and make the case for trade deals to the American public. They will be watching the State of the Union speech for signs the administration plans to fight the fight and make that case.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "f0dbee3fd93a53207dd48475e7b86b59", "sailthru.author": "Howard LaFranchi", "description": "Obama would make headway in his pursuit of new free trade deals, if only Congress would grant him the authority to 'fast-track' them.
