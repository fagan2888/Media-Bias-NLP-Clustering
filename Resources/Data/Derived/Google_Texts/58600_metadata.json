But in a race that\u2019s become decidedly negative on both sides, one of the nation\u2019s most important issues isn\u2019t driving one of its most important races.\n\nOn the face of it, putting some congressional guardrails on the National Security Agency\u2019s now notorious dragnet collection of citizens\u2019 private communication data seems like the perfect stump for Udall and not a bad bet for Gardner.\n\nInstead, they\u2019re going negative at a point in the campaign when it\u2019s believed that candidates must define their opponents \u2014 negatively. Gardner is flogging Udall for his support of Obamacare, and Udall is all over Gardner\u2019s shifting position on personhood. Substance is a casualty of this war.\n\nBoth lawmakers have voted for bills specifically designed to curtail the collection of private data. The issue itself forms a nice bipartisan bridge between civil liberties and limiting the size of government \u2014 it may be the weightiest bipartisan issue in Congress today. Most of all, privacy is a likely win among the enigmatic Unaffiliated third of Colorado\u2019s voting population on which the Senate race will turn.\n\nEarlier this year, Republican Senator and speculative presidential candidate Rand Paul of Kentucky championed the issue of NSA spying as one which would draw young voters \u2014 who elected President Obama at a ratio of three-to-one \u2014 back to the Republican party. Conservative pundits have likewise tagged the NSA\u2019s snooping as \u201cthe one issue millennials will vote for.\u201d\n\nJon Caldara, the president of the free-market think tank The Independence Institute, said that\u2019s probably true for millennials \u2014 a generation of voters who came of age in an era when job opportunities can be won or lost over one\u2019s Facebook profile.\n\nWith taglines like \u201clet\u2019s shake up the Senate\u201d and repeat references to \u201ca new generation of leadership\u201d, Gardner, 39, is clearly bringing up age in a race where he is the much younger candidate (Udall is 64). Gardner also has a supremely robust and engaging social media program. His twitter feed is full of pictures of himself on the campaign trail and Gardner routinely uses millennial-primary platforms like Facebook.\n\nAnd yet Gardner doesn\u2019t appear to be campaigning on privacy, likely due to the fact that Udall\u2019s record on the issue is too strong and because the issue itself is widely believed to be too broad, even theoretical, to swing votes. Instead, Gardner\u2019s campaign has focused on linking Udall to the Affordable Care Act/ Obamacare and to hitting Udall, a conservationist, on energy policies like the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be nearly the same issue as things like Obamacare and energy, things that are more direct to people\u2019s\u2019 day-to-day lives,\u201d said Caldara of privacy as a major force in the campaign.\n\n\u201cFor most Americans getting spied on is an abstraction,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get upset about things you\u2019re not allowed to know about.\u201d\n\nUdall has been upset about the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of private citizens\u2019 communications for some time. Along with other senators on the Intelligence Committee \u2014 notably Ron Wyden (D-OR) \u2014 Udall has made himself a leader on the issue. He voted against the Patriot Act in 2001 and ten years later fought to amend the act by limiting the scope of the surveillance the NSA could engage in and increasing congressional oversight.\n\n\u201c[A]s a member of the Intelligence Committee, I now have information about how the executive branch is interpreting the law, and I believe Americans would be alarmed if they knew how it was being carried out,\u201d Udall said of the Patriot Act in 2011.\n\nTwo years later, when Edward Snowden leaked news of the NSA spying on American citizens and Udall turned out be bracingly correct about the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court\u2019s legal interpretations of the Patriot Act allowing that collection, the reporter who broke the news, Glenn Greenwald, specifically recognized Udall for trying to warn the public.\n\nUdall himself immediately forged ahead with legislative reforms that would curtail state surveillance. He was an early and vocal co-sponsor of the Intelligence Oversight and Surveillance Reform Act, which Udall said would \u201cprohibit bulk collection of Americans\u2019 records, shield Americans from warrantless searches of their communications and install a constitutional advocate to argue significant cases before the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court.\u201d\n\nThat bill didn\u2019t end up getting as much traction as a modified version known as the USA Freedom Act, which recently passed in the House. Udall has criticized the measure, calling it watered-down, because it contains a loophole that would still allow what are known as \u201cbackdoor\u201d data searches. He\u2019s now advocating a tougher version of that same bill in the Senate.\n\nUdall was outspoken on the issue in Congress before the August recess \u2014 it was his senate office, not his campaign, that tweeted his call for the resignation of CIA Director John Brennan after news that the CIA snooped, NSA-style, on congressional computers in possible violation of separation of powers.\n\nNow on the campaign trail, Udall has largely kept the issue abstract with this tagline: \u201cAt the heart of freedom is the freedom to be left alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a core American understanding of freedom,\u201d said Juan Lindau, a Colorado College political science professor who teaches a course on secrecy and democracy.\n\n\u201cThat space where you\u2019re living your life without harming others is what we define as your space where you\u2019re left alone, where you\u2019re free to do whatever you want.\u201d\n\nWhile the freedom to be left alone line is likely to appeal to exactly the kind of Coloradan Udall needs to vote for him \u2014 namely that fiercely (politically) independent type \u2014 this edict on freedom and privacy also appears to be a serious foundational principle for Udall.\n\nUdall himself brings up privacy as an abstract principle almost every time he appears publicly. He\u2019s even managed to pull that theoretical thread into more concrete issues. Notably, he described his bill to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision as fundamentally about an employee\u2019s privacy.\n\n\u201cPrivacy is an inalienable human right that we\u2019ve codified in the Constitution,\u201d Udall told me when I more or less sprung the privacy-as-principle question on him during an otherwise unrelated press junket. Taking a tour of flood recovery efforts in Rocky Mountain National Park at the time, the senator made sure to add that he not only believes the freedom to be left alone is an American value, but that it is a distinctly Western one.\n\nBut instead of campaigning on what is arguably Udall\u2019s greatest demonstration of leadership and precinct politics in his role on the Senate Intelligence Committee, the pro-Udall strategy has been to run an almost exclusively negative campaign targeting Gardner for everything from his ties to big oil, to his confusing support of personhood, to his conservative record on immigration.\n\nUnder that framework, privacy might not be headlining the re-elect Udall campaign because there\u2019s no clean hit on Gardner when it comes to the NSA. Like many politicians who didn\u2019t lead on the issue or have access to information within the intelligence committees, Gardner\u2019s votes have tacked closer to the rapidly evolving public discourse on the issue than to any party line.\n\nIn 2011 Gardner voted to re-up the Patriot Act inclusive of the very policies Udall was then fighting to amend out. A year later Gardner also voted to extend Bush-era amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act credited with allowing the NSA to wiretap domestically and abroad without an official public warrant so long as their primary objective is to collect foreign intelligence.\n\nGardner was hardly alone in that vote. Of the entire Colorado delegation, only representatives Jared Polis and Diana DeGette joined Udall in voting against it.\n\nAt least two major things happened in 2013 that could have swayed Gardner\u2019s votes on the issue of citizens\u2019 privacy \u2014 Edward Snowden leaked information about the NSA\u2019s spying programs and Gardner decided to run for Senate against Udall.\n\nWhen Greenwald began reporting from the Snowden leaks Gardner called the revelation that Americans\u2019 cellphones were almost universally tapped \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cseriously concerning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we must keep our country safe, we cannot undermine the security of our rights,\u201d Gardner posted to Facebook in June of 2013.\n\nGardner\u2019s votes changed after that. In July of 2013 he joined a minority of Republicans in supporting an amendment to bar blanket data collection under the Patriot Act (the amendment narrowly failed in the House by 12 votes). Just a few months ago Gardner voted for another amendment to strictly limit a government official\u2019s ability to request FISA wiretap records on an American citizen. And most recently, Gardner became a co-sponsor of the newly-passed House version of the USA Freedom Act.\n\nGardner\u2019s office has not returned requests for comment regarding his stance on privacy, but the candidates have both officially committed to debating in Grand Junction on September 6 and at the Denver Post on October 7 where the substantive policy issue is likely to come up.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if privacy does become a feature of those debates, particularly with privacy\u2019s twin issue, disclosure, making headlines after news that the CIA hacked the computers of the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 in possible violation of the separation of powers \u2014 while the Committee was investigating the CIA\u2019s state-sanctioned use of torture.\n\n\u201cThe legislative branch has an oversight function. They are the representatives of the people and I see them as the fundamental guards of democracy,\u201d said Lindau. \u201cYou cannot have a functioning, viable democracy without some measure of transparency.\u201d\n\n[Public Domain image of NSA Utah data center by Akos Kokai]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "On the face of it, putting some congressional guardrails on the National Security Agency\u2019s now notorious dragnet collection of citizens\u2019 private communication data seems like the perfect stump for ...", "title": "Udall so quiet on his big issue even the NSA can\u2019t hear him", "url": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/148583/neither-udall-nor-gardner-campaigning-much-on-nsa-privacy", "image": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/14517578787_5fa65e4279_z.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "i2NY0iV2fHy9AAYv78ajpH43BN_IO8SUYAgP0XBcpQs", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/14517578787_5fa65e4279_z.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@COIndependent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-13T15:13:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-13T22:14:38+00:00", "author": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/author/tessa-cheek"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce219\"", "article_summary": "Gardner is flogging Udall for his support of Obamacare, and Udall is all over Gardner\u2019s shifting position on personhood.\nUnder that framework, privacy might not be headlining the re-elect Udall campaign because there\u2019s no clean hit on Gardner when it comes to the NSA.\nAnd most recently, Gardner became a co-sponsor of the newly-passed House version of the USA Freedom Act.\nAlong with other senators on the Intelligence Committee \u2014 notably Ron Wyden (D-OR) \u2014 Udall has made himself a leader on the issue.\nThe issue itself forms a nice bipartisan bridge between civil liberties and limiting the size of government \u2014 it may be the weightiest bipartisan issue in Congress today."}
