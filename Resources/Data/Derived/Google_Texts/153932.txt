Here’s something we bet you didn’t know…

Over the last five years, Medicare has spent more than $172 million on penis pumps for men with erectile dysfunction.

That’s right. Your tax dollars are being spent on making sure your grandpa can get a boner!

So why then aren't conservatives in Congress up in arms about giving out these free dick-hardening devices?

After all, they’ve been arguing for months now over the Affordable Healthcare Act’s contraceptive mandate that would provide birth control to women!

Leave it to the Daily Show to break down this double standard!

Correspondent Samantha Bee investigated why Washington lawmakers are all for penis pumps but don’t think the government should foot the bill for women’s BC.

Oh that’s right, because the vast majority of them are old men!

A gender injustice that sucks harder than the contraption stuck on Sam’s face!
