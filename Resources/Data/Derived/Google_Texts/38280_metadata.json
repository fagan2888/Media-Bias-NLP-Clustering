California has enrolled just about 80,000 people \u2014 while Oregon has not signed up a single Oregonian.\n\nKennedy Elliot from our graphics department has put together this cool visualization that stacks state numbers up against one another. It includes three data points starting with eligibility, the number of people who turned up at the exchange and were determined eligible to purchase coverage there. Eligibility is a pretty low bar to clear, since it pretty much involves not being in jail and being a legal resident of the state you want to purchase coverage in.\n\nSecond is a look at the numbers as a percent of the state's population. You see a clear trend here that federal marketplace states are getting fewer applications per capita than those that built their own. Texas, for example, has the highest uninsured rate in the country, with 27 percent of its residents lacking coverage, yet one of the lowest application rates: Just 0.42 percent of Texans have applied for coverage.\n\nLast is the success rate: Of the people who submit an application, how many of them make it through all the hoops and actually enroll in a plan. State marketplaces roundly outdo the federal marketplace here, with success rates upwards of 35 percent. Vermont has done the best here, with 39 percent of the people who apply for coverage actually enrolling.\n\nTake a look below to see how your state stacks up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ever since October 1, states--and the federal government--have had markedly different experiences signing their residents up for coverage through the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Ever since October 1, states--and the federal government--have had markedly different experiences signing their residents up for coverage through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Here\u2019s how all the states stack up on Obamacare enrollment", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/11/22/heres-how-all-the-states-stack-up-on-obamacare-enrollment/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/11/coverage-interactive.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/11/22/heres-how-all-the-states-stack-up-on-obamacare-enrollment/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "insurance, coverage, obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "insurance, coverage, obamacare,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc424\"", "article_summary": "Kennedy Elliot from our graphics department has put together this cool visualization that stacks state numbers up against one another.\nTake a look below to see how your state stacks up.\nIt includes three data points starting with eligibility, the number of people who turned up at the exchange and were determined eligible to purchase coverage there.\nLast is the success rate: Of the people who submit an application, how many of them make it through all the hoops and actually enroll in a plan.\nYou see a clear trend here that federal marketplace states are getting fewer applications per capita than those that built their own."}
