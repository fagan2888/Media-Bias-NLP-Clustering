They then pay rent on the remaining share, which is owned by a housing association. The rent can be up to 3% of the association\u2019s share of the value of the property.\n\nAll households earning less than \u00a380,000 in England or \u00a390,000 in London are eligible for the scheme, which is modelled on proposals drawn up by Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister will say that current rules preventing people from benefiting from the scheme to \u201cpart-buy, part-rent properties\u201d more than once will be scrapped. The change will mean that as people have children, or their circumstances change, they will be allowed to use the scheme to move up the property ladder. Rules which limited the scheme to key workers will also be scrapped.\n\nThe prime minister will say: \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve had shared ownership, where you part-buy, part-rent a property. So many people are attracted to this idea, especially those who thought they\u2019d never have a chance of owning a home. But, because it\u2019s been heavily restricted, many of those people have missed out. We\u2019ve had local councils dictating who is eligible, based on everything from salary to profession to where the buyer comes from.\n\n\u201cFrom April next year, that will make 175,000 more people eligible for home ownership. It means some people will be able to buy a house, for example, in Yorkshire, with a deposit of just \u00a31,400. It will be opened up to people of any occupation, the only restriction being that you have to earn under \u00a380,000, and \u00a390,000 in London.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Pledge to benefit 40,000 extra people is part of prime minister\u2019s outlining of his record in implementing Tory manifesto", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Nicholas Watt", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Pledge to benefit 40,000 extra people is part of prime minister\u2019s outlining of his record in implementing Tory manifesto", "title": "Shared home ownership scheme to be extended by Tories", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/07/cameron-expansion-shared-home-ownership-scheme", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f4e7b43df159b8b89d5938e4ca7629d79149e6/0_3_2750_1651/master/2750.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=2b8e6bc9d5e0fb6fe9abbcd2ba2fde03", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://money/2015/dec/07/cameron-expansion-shared-home-ownership-scheme?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/07/cameron-expansion-shared-home-ownership-scheme", "iphone": "gnmguardian://money/2015/dec/07/cameron-expansion-shared-home-ownership-scheme?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/34f4e7b43df159b8b89d5938e4ca7629d79149e6/0_3_2750_1651/master/2750.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://money/2015/dec/07/cameron-expansion-shared-home-ownership-scheme?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Property,UK news,Money,House prices,Family finances,Conservatives,David Cameron,General election 2015,Politics,Iain Duncan Smith,Housing,Communities,Society", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-12-07T00:01:02.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaswatt", "section": "Money", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T14:36:16.000Z", "tag": "Property,UK news,Money,House prices,Family finances,Conservatives,David Cameron,General election 2015,Politics,Iain Duncan Smith,Housing,Communities,Society"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f4e7b43df159b8b89d5938e4ca7629d79149e6/0_3_2750_1651/2750.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=82db98e7022b994c3b8e66e0e6b6d30c", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Property,UK news,Money,House prices,Family finances,Conservatives,David Cameron,General election 2015,Politics,Iain Duncan Smith"}, "article_summary": "As he outlines his record in implementing the Tory manifesto, the prime minister will pledge to end the heavy restrictions on the shared ownership scheme.\nThe prime minister will say: \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve had shared ownership, where you part-buy, part-rent a property.\nDavid Cameron is to announce an easing of the rules of the government\u2019s shared home ownership scheme to allow people to benefit more than once as they move up the property ladder.\nIn a speech in which he will declare that an election manifesto should be a checklist rather than a wishlist, the prime minister will say that the shared ownership scheme will benefit an extra 40,000 people \u2013 up from 135,000 to 175,000.\nThe prime minister will say that current rules preventing people from benefiting from the scheme to \u201cpart-buy, part-rent properties\u201d more than once will be scrapped."}
