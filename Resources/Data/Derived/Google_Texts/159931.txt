A 20-year-old woman died of an apparent heroin overdose last week, and authorities believe that she could have been saved if the people with her hadn’t delayed in calling 911.

The state’s Overdose Prevention Act protects people who report overdoses to authorities.

Police found the woman last Monday after they were called to the Whitehouse Hotel. Officers on the scene attempted to revive the woman by using Narcan, a drug that can counteract the drug’s effects and keep an overdose victim alive.

Narcan has been successfully used numerous times by police officers across the state in recent months in order to revive overdose patients. The state has been seeing a rash of overdose deaths along with a spike in heroin use.

Hunterdon County Prosecutor Anthony P. Kearns III, whose office investigated this case, said “time is of the essence” when it comes to responding to overdoses.

“Police now have the tools to save lives and the Overdose Protection Act protects individuals from certain prosecutions if they call 911 to report an overdose,” Kearns said in a statement released Tuesday announcing the death. “Unfortunately, many people caught up in the circumstances of addiction are either uninformed or fear scrutiny by society and law enforcement.”
