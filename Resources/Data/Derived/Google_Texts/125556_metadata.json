He is the one, you will remember, who said in 2011 that he was going to close three cabinet agencies but could not name the third one.\n\nThe other Republican mentioned in the Times article as a potential third-party choice by disgruntled Republican right -wingers was former Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, an anti-abortion climate change denier who might actually be a worse choice than Mr. Perry, if such a thing is possible.\n\nThe Times said Mr. Coburn has \u201ctold associates\u201d he might be open to running as a third-party alternative to Donald Trump. He has said Mr. Trump \u201cneeds to be stopped\u201d and that he would back an independent alternative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to support that person, and I don\u2019t expect that person to be me,\u201d said Mr. Coburn.\n\nOf course, Mr. Perry did not have much competition for most sensible thing said by a Republican so far this week, and he won\u2019t as long as Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, is still at large.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. McConnell \u2014 whose only original idea was announcing after President Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009 that the Republicans\u2019 sole agenda would be opposing Mr. Obama \u2014 said that the National Rifle Association should have veto power over the next Supreme Court appointment.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News, Mr. McConnell said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine that a Republican majority in the United States Senate would want to confirm, in a lame duck session, a nominee opposed by the National Rifle Association\u201d or the National Federation of Independent Businesses, known primarily for trying to repeal Obamacare.\n\nCome to think of it, I can\u2019t imagine that either.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160321112946, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "per": "McConnell, Mitch;Obama, Barack;Perry, Rick;Trump, Donald J", "org": "National Federation of Independent Business;National Rifle Assn;Republican Party;Supreme Court (US)", "keywords": "McConnell Mitch,Obama Barack,Perry Rick,Trump Donald J,Presidential Election of 2016,United States Politics and Government,National Federation of Independent Business,National Rifle Assn,Republican Party,Supreme Court (US),Oklahoma,Texas,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/This Week\u2019s Most Sensible Comment by a Republican ( 20160321 )", "news_keywords": "Oklahoma,Texas", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Andrew Rosenthal", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Andrew Rosenthal", "byl": "Andrew Rosenthal", "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/this-weeks-most-sensible-comment-by-a-republican/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/21/opinion/21rosenthalWEB/21rosenthalWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "There hasn\u2019t been a lot of competition.
