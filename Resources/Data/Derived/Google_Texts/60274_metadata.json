The survey also found that people\u2019s initial impressions of Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan are more favorable than their views of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.\n\nA slim plurality of 39 percent supports replacing the private health insurance system with a single government-run, taxpayer-funded plan that would cover medical, dental, vision and long-term care, with 33 percent opposed. Only 26 percent say they support Obama\u2019s hard-won health care law.\n\nYet it\u2019s only like an air kiss for \u201cBerniecare.\u201d\n\nAsked whether they would continue to support Sanders\u2019 plan if their own taxes went up, under a third of initial supporters of the plan would keep backing it. About 4 out of 10 flipped to opposition.\n\nAbout the same share of initial backers would ditch single-payer if it meant that people had to give up employer coverage. Twenty-eight percent would continue to support it.\n\nHigher taxes and an end to employer coverage are both a given under the Sanders plan, which would replace private coverage with a taxpayer-funded program, while also offering more generous benefits such as no deductibles and no copayments, not to mention coverage for long-term care.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pie in the sky,\u201d said Patricia Combs, a retired junior-high math teacher from Springboro, Ohio. \u201cIt sounds really good, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s attainable \u2026 people would complain about their taxes being raised.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Medina of Chicago, an office manager not currently working, said she worries that quality would slip.\n\n\u201cOverall it sounds terrific,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah! Let\u2019s go for it! But Europe and Canada have their problems with the single-payer system \u2026 it\u2019s subpar.\u201d\n\nSuch second thoughts over far-reaching policy proposals are common, said Robert Blendon, a professor who tracks public opinion on health care at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nFor example, a \u201cflat tax\u201d may sound appealingly simple as millions of people assemble their W-2 forms, 1099s and lately those new health insurance forms for the annual tax-filing ritual. But it gets tricky when advocates have to decide which popular tax deductions to eliminate and which to keep.\n\n\u201cPeople say they believe in a principle, but when you describe the policy, it often loses support because they don\u2019t like that there are side effects,\u201d said Blendon.\n\nThe poll found increasing doubts about single-payer health care when other potential consequences are considered, such as slower availability of new drugs and treatments, and longer waits for non-emergency services.\n\nUnlike higher taxes and having to give up employer coverage, those are not automatic consequences of converting to a government-run system. But such concerns would surely be raised as a President Sanders tried to lead the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d he promises.\n\nThe poll found that 51 percent of initial single-payer backers would switch to opposition if it took longer for new drugs and treatments to become available. Only 14 percent would continue to support the plan. Such an outcome could happen if drugmakers were required to prove that new medications are therapeutically superior to existing ones. The current standard is that new drugs be safe and effective.\n\nAdditionally, 47 percent of initial supporters would reconsider if \u201cMedicare for all\u201d meant longer wait times for non-emergency medical services.\n\nOverall, the poll found that health care remains a top issue for Americans, with three-fourths calling it extremely crucial or very important.\n\nMemo to those following the Republican presidential primary: Most people doubt that \u201cObamacare\u201d will be repealed even if the GOP wins the White House.\n\nForty-nine percent say the Affordable Care Act will be kept in place with changes, whether major or minor. Another 6 percent say a Republican president will not be able to make any changes to Obama\u2019s law.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who couldn\u2019t have health care before now have health care, so I don\u2019t think you are going to be able to just turn around and strip all those people of their health care,\u201d said Lillian Duren, a recently retired psychiatric emergency nurse from Brooklyn, New York. \u201cYou need to fix what doesn\u2019t work and keep moving.\u201d\n\n(AP)", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Jewish, Jew, Jewish News, Israel, Israeli, Israel News, Israeli News, Rebbe, Rebbe News, Frum, Frum News, Brooklyn Orthodox, Orthodox Jew, Orthodox Jews, NYC Jews, New York City Jews, Yeshiva, Yeshiva News, Yeshivaworld News, Yeshiva World News, Yeshivalife, Bochrim, Kollel, BMG, Lakewood Jews, Satmer, Satmar, Bobov, Viznitz, Bnei Braq, Bnei Brak, Pesach, Purim, Succos, Shavuos, Kotel, Kosel", "revisit-after": "1 day", "og": {"image": "http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bsa.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Poll: Doubts On Sanders \u2018Medicare For All\u2019 Plan"}, "robots": "index, follow"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA lot of people who couldn\u2019t have health care before now have health care, so I don\u2019t think you are going to be able to just turn around and strip all those people of their health care,\u201d said Lillian Duren, a recently retired psychiatric emergency nurse from Brooklyn, New York.\nAt first, many Americans like the idea of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a cradle-to-grave government-run health system that\u2019s a rallying cry for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\nThe survey also found that people\u2019s initial impressions of Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan are more favorable than their views of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.\nThe poll found increasing doubts about single-payer health care when other potential consequences are considered, such as slower availability of new drugs and treatments, and longer waits for non-emergency services.\nOverall, the poll found that health care remains a top issue for Americans, with three-fourths calling it extremely crucial or very important."}
