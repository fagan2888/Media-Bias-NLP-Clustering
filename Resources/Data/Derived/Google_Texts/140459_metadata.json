But in many cases, actual mothers are getting in on the act and nagging their kids to get health insurance, too.\n\nThe retired adult's association, the AARP, is helping to facilitate this nagging during the insurance enrollment period with a set of six pre-made e-cards made for parents to nudge their kids to sign-up.\n\nThe amusing e-cards are appropriate for all kinds of family dynamics.\n\nOne says: \"Get health insurance so I can stop pestering you to sign up and start pressuring you to get married.\"\n\nAnother: \"I don\u2019t mind being the reason you get health insurance. You\u2019re the reason I drink wine out of a box.\"\n\nThe ads from the AARP are witty, but these ads for Obamacare made by the government are truly mortifying. Read more.\n\nIt\u2019s a little strange that this is coming from the AARP, given that the campaign targets young people. But it makes sense when you think about it. Obviously, parents care about their kids\u2019 health, but more importantly, the success of the new health law depends on many young, healthy people to sign up to balance out the higher costs for older or sicker people who take on new plans. So far, the sign-up rate overall has been much lower than expected, in part due to glitches to the federal government\u2019s Healthcare.gov site.\n\nCheer up, kids, it\u2019s just another way for mom to show she cares.", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Parents: Nag Your Kids To Sign Up For Obamacare With These Funny E-Cards", "image": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/11/3022263-poster-1280-aarp.jpg", "description": "If cold, hard logic hasn't convinced your family to sign up for health care, use one of these jokes from the AARP."}, "description": "If cold, hard logic hasn't convinced your family to sign up for health care, use one of these jokes from the AARP.", "og": {"site_name": "Co.Exist", "description": "If cold, hard logic hasn't convinced your family to sign up for health care, use one of these jokes from the AARP.", "title": "Parents: Nag Your Kids To Sign Up For Obamacare With These Funny E-Cards", "url": "http://www.fastcoexist.com/3022263/parents-nag-your-kids-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-with-these-funny-e-cards", "image": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/11/3022263-poster-1280-aarp.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "fastcoexist.com", "description": "If cold, hard logic hasn't convinced your family to sign up for health care, use one of these jokes from the AARP.", "title": "Parents: Nag Your Kids To Sign Up For Obamacare With These Funny E-Cards", "url": "http://www.fastcoexist.com/3022263/parents-nag-your-kids-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-with-these-funny-e-cards", "image": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/11/3022263-poster-1280-aarp.jpg", "creator": "@jessleber", "site": "@FastCoExist", "image5": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2013/11/3022263-slide-aarpacaecard4600imgcacherev1376573960148.png", "image3": "http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2013/11/3022263-slide-aarpacaecard3600imgcacherev1376574033793.png", "image2": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2013/11/3022263-slide-aarpacaecard6600imgcacherev1376573960149.png", "image1": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2013/11/3022263-slide-aarpacaecard5600imgcacherev1376574033706.png", "image0": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2013/11/3022263-slide-aarpacaecard7600imgcacherev1379416663982.jpg", "card": "gallery", "image4": "http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2013/11/3022263-slide-aarpacaecard2600imgcacherev1376573960147.png"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000062710915, "pages": 227383110655483, "app_id": 180431352040909}, "keywords": "federal government,aarp,e-cards,health insurance,insurance enrollment period,health law", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FastCoExist", "section": "Co.Exist", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2013-11-27T12:47:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2013-11-27T15:02:54.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda585\"", "article_summary": "But in many cases, actual mothers are getting in on the act and nagging their kids to get health insurance, too.\nOne says: \"Get health insurance so I can stop pestering you to sign up and start pressuring you to get married.\"\nSome critics say the new Obamacare marketplaces are part of the growing nanny state, with the government urging the nation\u2019s uninsured young adults to sign up.\nAnother: \"I don\u2019t mind being the reason you get health insurance.\nThe ads from the AARP are witty, but these ads for Obamacare made by the government are truly mortifying."}
