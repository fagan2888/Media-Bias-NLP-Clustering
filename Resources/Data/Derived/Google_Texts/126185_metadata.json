And I think you\u2019ll see Republicans come forward with a plan to replace Obamacare. A plan that will actually reduce costs for the American people and make health care more accessible.\u201d\n\nThe surprise here is that Republican leaders might actually put forward a healthcare reform bill of any kind at all. Individual Republicans have proposed healthcare bills designed to replace Obamacare over the years, but none has won the endorsement of skittish party leaders.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t think will come as any surprise is the (likely) content.\n\nFor years now, Republicans have filled the void left by the absence of a replace plan with focus-grouped descriptions of the healthcare ideas they like. These will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s followed the story closely: repeal Obamacare, allow for the sale of insurance across state lines, bolster high-risk pools for people with preexisting medical conditions, equalize the tax treatment of individual and group insurance, block-grant Medicaid and cut its funding, tort reform.\n\nMost of these are bad ideas, and the two that aren\u2019t bad ideas per se are bad ideas in the context of the rest of the reforms. High risk pools could be a defensible alternative to Obamacare\u2019s insurance guarantee, but only if adequately funded, and Republicans have no intention of spending hundreds of billions of dollars to do that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After shouting for years about replacing Obamacare, here's what their new plan is likely to include: Old, bad ideas", "title": "GOP\u2019s sad, pathetic \u201creplace Obamacare\u201d plan may finally be coming", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After shouting for years about replacing Obamacare, here's what their new plan is likely to include: Old, bad ideas", "title": "GOP\u2019s sad, pathetic \u201creplace Obamacare\u201d plan may finally be coming", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/21/gops_sad_pathetic_replace_obamacare_plan_may_finally_be_coming/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/ryan_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After shouting for years about replacing Obamacare, here's what their new plan is likely to include: Old, bad ideas", "title": "GOP\u2019s sad, pathetic \u201creplace Obamacare\u201d plan may finally be coming", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/ryan_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Editor's Picks, GOP, John Boehner, Medicaid, Obamacare, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd43a0\"", "article_summary": "Most of these are bad ideas, and the two that aren\u2019t bad ideas per se are bad ideas in the context of the rest of the reforms.\nAnd I think you\u2019ll see Republicans come forward with a plan to replace Obamacare.\nFor years now, Republicans have filled the void left by the absence of a replace plan with focus-grouped descriptions of the healthcare ideas they like.\nIndividual Republicans have proposed healthcare bills designed to replace Obamacare over the years, but none has won the endorsement of skittish party leaders.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the big issues for conversation in terms of our agenda for this year."}
