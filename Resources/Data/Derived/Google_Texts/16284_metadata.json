The financial barriers to access medical care are always going to have to be considered.\u201d\n\nCheaper Than Liver Transplants\n\nSally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute, says health insurers like Anthem Blue Cross are being short sighted in denying payment for drugs effective at curing hepatitis C.\n\n\u201cWhile Sovaldi, [another drug manufactured by Gilead to treat chronic hep C,] is expensive, costing about $94,000, it is inexpensive compared to the cost of covering a liver transplant, which runs in the range of $500,000, assuming a match is available,\u201d Pipes said.\n\nThere are also nonmonetary costs for a patient undergoing major surgery, such as the cost of research and development for a drug company to develop innovative drugs such as Sovaldi, which run to approximately $1.2 billion, Pipes says. In addition, most new drugs never make it through the lengthy FDA approval process and clinical trials, so in order to continue developing new treatments, pharmaceutical and biotech firms have to be able to recover their costs from those that do finally reach the public.\n\n\"It is short sighted of insurers to deny such treatments,\u201d Pipes said.\n\nShort-Term Thinking\n\nThe hard lesson for many Americans to learn is coverage is not care, particularly since Obamacare handed the entire health care system over to managed-care plans, which by federal law are allowed to make \u201cmedical necessity\u201d decisions in conflict with the interests and health of the patient, says Twila Brase, president of the Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom.\n\nAnd because patients no longer pay most medical bills, they and their doctors have little power over treatment decisions, she says. Insurers are more likely to deny expensive treatment requests because the enrollee they give a $63,000 drug this year may not be in the system next year, and hence they may never realize the cost benefits of that decision over the patient\u2019s lifetime.\n\n\u201cFortunately, many Americans are finding and joining health-sharing organizations, which have far fewer barriers to care,\u201d Brase said.\n\nMatthew Glans (mglans@heartland.org) is a senior policy analyst at The Heartland Institute.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca333\"", "article_summary": "Consumers across the nation are starting to file lawsuits against insurers who deny them access to expensive new hepatitis C treatments.\nHarvoni, the new treatment sold by Gilead Science and AbbVie, cures more than 90 percent of those infected with hepatitis C and costs $63,000 to $94,500, before any discounts, in the United States.\n\"It is short sighted of insurers to deny such treatments,\u201d Pipes said.\nAnd because patients no longer pay most medical bills, they and their doctors have little power over treatment decisions, she says.\n\u201cFortunately, many Americans are finding and joining health-sharing organizations, which have far fewer barriers to care,\u201d Brase said."}
