The outside influence puts a damper on the phrase \"We the People,\" said Gaye Ellis, Okaloosa County GOP Executive Committee.\n\nThe immediate goal of Friday's gathering was to bring the issue to the attention of voters' and help educate them.\n\n\"We want everything to be equal and to ensure that local elections are decided by the local citizens,\" said Raymond Nelson, Okaloosa County NAACP President.\n\n\"I wanted to show Bipartisan support for keeping our local elections local and to keep big money out of our local politics,\" said Beth Blankenship, Okaloosa Democrats.\n\n\"Every PAC in the State of Florida is required to register with the Florida Division of Elections. When you see that an ad is paid for by \"Friends of Darth Vader,\" go to the Division of Elections website and find out who 's behind it,\" said Ellis.\n\nThe long-term goal is to push for more campaign reforms to the state's elections laws.\n\nWe called Matt Gaetz's office for his response, but he did not return our call.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a rare display of bi-partisanship, the executive directors of Okaloosa County's Republican and Democratic parties joined forces Friday to denounce their state representative.
