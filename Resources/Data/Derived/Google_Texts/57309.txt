AARP: Use Funny e-Cards to Nudge Your Kid into Obamacare

By now, most everyone has gotten the word that Obamacare won’t work to reduce the cost of individual health insurance plans unless enough young people sign up.

AARP.org has a strategy to make that happen. It involves getting Mom or Dad to nag (sort of) their adult children into signing up. AARP provides humorous e-cards to email their kids. “Nudge your kid about getting health insurance,” AARP says on their website.

AARP is the prominent nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of more than 37 million Americans over the age of 50.

One AARP e-card says: “As a reward for signing up for health insurance, I’ll defriend you on Facebook. You’re welcome.”

Another reads: “The Bank of Mom and Dad may be closed, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get help paying for health insurance.”
