While, the three broadcast networks acknowledged the elections were bad for Democrats, they mostly ignored the economy and its impact on the election.\n\nInstead, now that Republicans hold a majority of seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, the networks have chosen to preach bipartisanship.\n\nNearly half of voters said the economy was the most important issue to them this election, and 70 percent of voters said the economy was \u201cnot so good or poor,\u201d according to National Election Pool exit polls reported by The Washington Post. In spite of those polls, the networks failed to mention voter\u2019s economic concerns in 84 percent of election stories (37 of 44) in almost a week following the midterms. Of the three networks, only CBS reported that voters ranked the economy as their most pressing concern in exit polls, while ABC and NBC entirely ignored it.\n\nBetween the evenings of November 4 and November 10, CBS consistently reported that the \u201ceconomy is a major issue,\u201d as they said on \u201cEvening News\u201d November 5. Yet ABC and NBC shied away from discussing exactly what motivated voters on Election Day. Instead, they generalized Democrat losses as a \u201cfull-fledged repudiation\u201d of President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile it was true that many voters disapproved of Obama\u2019s performance, ABC\u2019s and NBC\u2019s assessment failed to report that voters listed the economy as their most important issue this election. Both ABC and NBC quoted statistics from exit polls without mentioning voters\u2019 views regarding the economy. An issue the network media have often protected Obama from.\n\nInstead of focusing on the economy, these networks discussed voters\u2019 sentiments in general terms.\n\nFor example, David Muir, anchor of ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News,\u201d said on November 4, 2014, that \u201c65 percent of Americans at the polls today say we are on the wrong track.\u201d George Stephanopoulos, anchor of \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cThis Week,\u201d added that \u201c54 percent disapprove of the job the president is doing right now.\u201d\n\nBrian Williams, anchor of NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News,\u201d said during the broadcast on November 4, 2014, that pollsters had been talking to voters, \u201casking them what\u2019s been driving them this Election Day.\u201d Reporting on the exit polls, correspondent and \u201cToday\u201d co-host Tamron Hall followed up that \u201c48 percent, Brian, say [life] will be worse for the next generation.\u201d\n\nWilliams tritely observed, \u201cThat's why they're using the word \u2018sour\u2019 to describe the mood at the polls for a lot of folks tonight,\u201d failing to delve into more substantive analysis.\n\nChuck Todd, NBC\u2019s Chief White House Correspondent, unintentionally summed up ABC and NBC coverage well when he said, \u201cI mean, this was really about President Obama,\u201d on \u201cToday\u201d November 5.\n\nABC and NBC were correct that many voters were unhappy with Obama and the direction of the country, but that should have prompted them to ask why. Instead, both failed to discuss the specifics, such as the economy, that was \u201cdriving\u201d voter displeasure. While 33 percent of voters said one reason for the way they voted was to \u201cexpress opposition to Barack Obama,\u201d 45 percent said that the main issue on their minds was the economy according to the exit polls sponsored by the National Election Pool. (The National Election Pool is sponsored by all three broadcast news networks and numerous other major news outlets.)\n\nJonathan Karl, Chief White House Correspondent for ABC News, demonstrated this vague style of post-election analysis on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d November 5. \u201cThis morning, the message from the White House is, \u2018We get it,\u2019\u201d Karl said. He did not mention the economy, but simply said voters wanted the administration to \u201cmake Washington work\u201d and focus on bipartisanship.\n\nLester Holt, co-anchor of the weekend edition of \u201cToday\u201d on NBC, similarly relied on generalities, leading him to misinterpret the election\u2019s \u201cmessage\u201d during the November 8, broadcast. Holt told Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., that \u201cthe American people\u201d were primarily concerned about bipartisanship.\n\n\u201cI think if there is any message that came out of this election, people really want you guys to get it together and-- and-- and play nicely together,\u201d Holt said.\n\nUnlike ABC and NBC, CBS correctly and quickly reported that the election had a lot to do with the economy. During \u201cThis Morning\u201d November 5, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., told co-host Charlie Rose that voters went to the polls on Election Day with \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d weighing on their minds. On the same broadcast, John Dickerson, political director of CBS News, said, \u201cvoters are going to punish anybody who isn\u2019t addressing that question.\u201d\n\nEconomic frustration was clear in the National Election Pool exit polls. Anthony Mason, CBS\u2019 Senior Business Correspondent, shared those results with viewers on November 4. He said that \u201c45 percent of voters put it at the top of their list\u201d when asked by pollsters.\n\nIndeed, whether voters supported Democrat or Republican candidates correlated to their assessment of the economy. Voters who said the economy was the most important issue this election split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, while the 70 percent of voters who said the condition of the economy was \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d were more likely to support Republicans, according to exit polling by the National Election Pool.\n\nOf the voters who said the economy\u2019s current state was \u201cnot so good,\u201d 56 percent they preferred Republican candidates. Seventy-eight percent of voters who said the economy was in \u201cpoor\u201d condition said they favored Republicans while 74 percent who said the economy was \u201cexcellent or good\u201d supported Democrats.\n\nOther issues were nowhere near as important for voters as the economy, judging by the exit polls. Only 25 percent of voters said health care was their most important issue this election, while 14 percent said their top issue was illegal immigration and 13 percent said foreign policy.\n\nVoters had reason to be frustrated. Many Americans haven\u2019t benefitted from the economic recovery. James Pethokoukis, columnist at American Enterprise Institute (AEI), wrote on November 10, that workers may be finding jobs, but not \u201cgood\u201d ones that pay well. \u201cWage growth is barely beating inflation,\u201d Pethokoukis pointed out.\n\nIn addition to inflation, Stephen Moore, Chief Economist at The Heritage Foundation, said on October 31, 2014, that ObamaCare was partly to blame for stagnant household incomes.\n\nObamaCare \u201chas made health insurance more expensive for businesses\u201d and has therefore \u201ctaken a bite out of take-home pay,\u201d Moore said. Obama also hiked corporate tax rates in 2013, meaning that \u201ccorporations invest less here at home\u201d and that more jobs were created overseas instead, according to Moore.\n\nMethodology: MRC Business analyzed all the broadcast network news stories which included the term \u201celection\u201d or \u201celections,\u201d and substantially discussed the 2014 midterm election, from the evening of November 4, 2014, through November 10, 2014.
