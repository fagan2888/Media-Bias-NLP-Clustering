Despite the title, though, Obama didn\u2019t \u201crun wild\u201d as much as he \u201cenjoyed a pleasant conversation and snack\u201d with Grylls, a former Special Forces soldier-turned-celebrity survivalist. The two men talked about the environment and fatherhood\u2014along with flatulence, belly button lint, and drinking one\u2019s own urine (which Obama smartly declined to do)\u2014and also drank some tea made from catkins and ate some salmon that had been previously gnawed on by an actual bear. The whole thing was quietly charming, in a geeky father in the woods-type way.\n\nWhen Obama wasn\u2019t playing the straight man to Grylls\u2019 wild man, he was doing his best to make the climate case for protecting the environment. The show took place at the foot of Kenai Fjords National Park\u2019s Exit Glacier, which has receded 187 feet in the last year alone, and more than a mile over the last two centuries. \u201cI\u2019ve two daughters, and I don\u2019t want grandkids too soon, but eventually I hope to have some,\u201d said Obama. \u201cAnd I want to make sure that this is there for them, not just us.\u201d\n\nThe appearance was the latest example of the White House press team getting creative with their messaging. The best example of their out-of-the-box strategy was probably Obama\u2019s appearance on Between Two Ferns during the Obamacare rollout. But the president has also increasingly looked to late-night shows and podcasts to reach those Americans who avoid more traditional news outlets.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "The president smartly declined to drink his own urine.", "sailthru.author": "Josh Voorhees", "description": "President Obama played two roles during his appearance on NBC\u2019s Running Wild With Bear Grylls: climate advocate and dad on a weekend camping trip.
