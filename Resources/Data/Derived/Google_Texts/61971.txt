Fifteen new or recently hired faculty and staff members were formally introduced to their colleagues during the Fall 2014 in-service activities held at Northeastern Junior College in late August. The college holds in-service two times annually, at the start of fall and spring semesters, and it is during these sessions that formal introductions take place.

Denise Dennington, who joined the college late last spring, fills a dual role as the assistant athletic director and assistant Bank of Colorado Event Center manager. Tom Myers is a new Bank of Colorado Event Center supervisor and also oversees the fitness offerings and memberships for this facility.

Three others who joined the campus in recent months who were introduced included Lisa Schaefer, who is the new registrar; Alicea Einspahr, a student communications coordinator in the admissions and recruitment area; and Erin Waitley, who returns to the college as the Director of Purchasing; she previously worked at Northeastern in the financial aid area. Jody Kind has also returned to the college as a nursing instructor. Melinda McKay and Jennifer Crisman join Northeastern as new custodians. Jesse Quinlin is the new administrative assistant in the Liberal Arts Division; Katherine Warner is a new library technician; Catheryne Trenkle is the new transition specialist for student services. Recently hired to oversee residence life and student activities is Courtney Wilkins.
