They might be an adjunct faculty member, teaching a course on the side while juggling another job.\n\nIn the most extreme situations, they might be working part time at multiple schools and cobbling together a living with little chance of professional advancement.\n\n\u201cThis has caused some real challenges for other institutions,\u201d said Bruce Cairns, UNC faculty chairman. \u201cWe just need to make sure we stay ahead of what those issues might be.\u201d\n\nFixed-term and adjunct faculty at universities nationwide now represent nearly 75 percent of undergraduate course instructors \u2014 a reversal of three or four decades ago, when tenured faculty held that majority.\n\nUNC employed more than 5,600 tenured or tenure-track, fixed-term and adjunct faculty as of fall 2013.Nearly 66 percent are not professors, assistant professors or associate professors, which are the only tenured or tenure-track positions.\n\nAnne Whisnant, deputy secretary of the faculty and an adjunct in the history department, said the career situation for fixed-term and adjunct faculty at UNC is not as difficult as it is at some schools.\n\nBut Cairns acknowledged that improving working conditions for these faculty on campus is a top priority for faculty governance this year.\n\n\u201cThe students can tell whether or not we are creating that environment,\u201d he said.\n\nLacking benefits\n\nTim Ives, chairman of the UNC faculty welfare committee, said these faculty have a finite role on campus, making them difficult to track.\n\nFaculty governance leaders are working to define the number of full- or part-time adjuncts on campus and their health care coverage, retention rates and opportunities for advancement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of hiding information, it just hasn\u2019t been brought up yet,\u201d Ives said.\n\nThe median pay for adjuncts at two- and four-year colleges and universities is $2,700 per three-credit course. For research institutions, it\u2019s $3,400 per course.\n\nFor faculty at research universities who teach six courses a year, that translates to an annual base salary of $20,400.\n\nThese faculty often don\u2019t have access to research grants or paid leave, which require tenure, and they might have to share office space.\n\nDonna Bickford, associate director of the Office of Undergraduate Research, said some at UNC aren\u2019t paid to hold office hours and lack access to basic department resources, like copy machines.\n\n\u201cThey could be an outstanding teacher, but they don\u2019t have the support system to do their job,\u201d she said.\n\nJean DeSaix, a teaching professor in the biology department, said she is working with a new Ph.D. student who is struggling with these issues.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s teaching a course at this community college, a course at that community college, maybe a course at one of the small privates around here, but she can\u2019t get a full-time faculty position,\u201d she said.\n\nHealth care in question\n\nThe question of some adjuncts\u2019 health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act has brought the faculty issues to the national stage.\n\nThe law mandates that university faculty who teach 30 hours or more each week qualify for health insurance \u2014 but Maria Maisto, president and executive director of national advocacy group New Faculty Majority, said it\u2019s tough to calculate the hours that part-time faculty work.\n\nAnd for faculty who meet the 30-hour threshold but teach at multiple schools, Ives said, it\u2019s unclear who is responsible for their health coverage.\n\n\u201cAdjuncts are doing piecemeal work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Faculty Assembly, made up of representatives from the 17 UNC-system campuses, unanimously voted to approve a resolution Sept. 5 that all system employees be granted appropriate health coverage.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that they will have some type of coverage for everybody,\u201d Ives said.\n\nDefinitions unclear\n\nNationally, faculty without tenure are often grouped into one category, Whisnant said \u2014 and while some of the issues they face might intersect, situations differ so vastly that it\u2019s difficult to standardize policies for them on campus.\n\nFaculty at UNC can be fixed-term, meaning they are on a contract of one to five years, or they can be adjunct, meaning they are affliated with a department, though their primary role on campus might be administrative or clinical.\n\nBickford said she is known as an alternative academic because she holds an adjunct position in the English department in addition to an Office of Undergraduate Research role.\n\n\u201cMy position is a perfectly reasonable use of an adjunct status,\u201d she said.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case for oth ers. She said there are part-time adjuncts hoping for full-time work, but there aren\u2019t formal UNC policies that pave a path to career advancement.\n\nAnd teaching as an adjunct for a couple of years can make faculty appear less competitive for tenure-track positions, Bickford said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because they are not qualified,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a landscape of the changing intellectual workforce in higher education.\u201d\n\nFixed-term progress\n\nUNC\u2019s fixed-term faculty have had representation in faculty governance for two decades, but job security can be a concern, Whisnant said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really have any automatic expectations that when that\u2019s over that it will be renewed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can feel precarious to people, I think.\u201d\n\nStill, UNC fixed-term faculty have a path of advancement, with three tiers culminating in a teaching professor rank.\n\nBickford said fixed-term faculty advocates like DeSaix have worked for 20 years on policies and practices to support them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a stable full-time employment situation with appropriate benefits,\u201d Bickford said.\n\nBut there is no committee governing adjunct faculty or representing their concerns.\n\n\u201cIf we need to take a look at the committee structure for these folks, then we will,\u201d Cairns said.\n\nProblems in English\n\nNationwide, the number of fixed-term and adjunct faculty is increasing, while tenure-track positions have declined.\n\nThe higher numbers at public universities, Bickford said, correlate somewhat with state budget cuts \u2014 the UNC system has experienced a drop of nearly $500 million in support since 2011.\n\n\u201cThe University is trying to solve its budget problem on the backs of these individual adjuncts,\u201d Bickford said.\n\nBut Maisto said she thinks it could be a political move to make faculty less powerful.\n\nBickford said part-time positions should be a transitional period into full-time work, but some disciplines, particularly English, have used adjuncts more than others.\n\nIntroductory composition courses require English to keep a large staff, Maisto said.\n\nInstead of hiring faculty full-time, schools might hire adjuncts who are on call from semester to semester, Bickford said.\n\n\u201cSome have reported having two weeks notice to teach a course,\u201d she said.\n\nBeverly Taylor, UNC\u2019s English department chairwoman, said the only part-time faculty in her department teach creative writing in addition to writing professionally.\n\nThough fixed-term faculty are often hired at UNC to teach composition, she said, there are half as many fixed-term as tenure-track faculty in English.\n\nBut on e fixed-term faculty member at UNC, who asked to remain anonymous for job security reasons, said faculty in some departments, including English, are exploited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big sort of ugly truth that goes on,\u201d he said.\n\nTaylor said the lowest salary per three-credit course for a fixed-term English faculty member is about $6,000 \u2014 higher than most universities in the southeast.\n\nStill, since UNC saves money by hiring more fixed-term and adjunct faculty, it\u2019s become a recent trend, said the fixed-term faculty member.\n\n\u201cThe University as a whole is moving away from tenure-track faculty simply because it\u2019s a better economic model for them,\u201d he said.\n\nNationally, some hope\n\nOn a national level, adjunct faculty have made progress. A bill that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in July would require schools to report certain information, including working conditions.\n\n\u201cBecause adjuncts are getting more organized and are being more outspoken, we\u2019re able to communicate with legislators,\u201d Maisto said.\n\nThe legislation has been attached to the federal Higher Education Act, which is currently being reauthorized.\n\n\u201cIt keeps a department from hiring somebody year after year on one-year contracts without the world knowing it,\u201d DeSaix said.\n\nAt UNC, Cairns said there has been talk of launching a task force, and he hopes adjunct faculty members with concerns will contact the Office of Faculty Governance.\n\nWhisnant said UNC could be a model for other schools.\n\nBut the anonymous fixed-term faculty member said he isn\u2019t confident that UNC leaders will improve working conditions for faculty like him.\n\n\u201cThe people who have the most to gain are the people who are doing the exploiting.\u201d\n\nCairns doesn\u2019t agree: \u201cI do think we\u2019re being as proactive as we can be in trying to address this.\u201d\n\nStill, the battle to put these faculty on equal footing is far from over, Bickford said.\n\n\u201cWe have an exploited, under-employed, under-compensated group of really skilled and talented people that we\u2019re wasting.\u201d\n\nstate@dailytarheel.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "To students, the professor towering at the front of a UNC classroom might represent the pinnacle of academia: a wealth of scholarly achievements, dozens of published journal articles, a high salary.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Tar Heel", "description": "To students, the professor towering at the front of a UNC classroom might represent the pinnacle of academia: a wealth of scholarly achievements, dozens of published journal articles, a high salary.", "title": "Non-tenured faculty hope for better working conditions", "url": "http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2014/09/non-tenured-faculty-hope-for-better-working conditions", "image": "http://d39xfl750sfsi8.cloudfront.net/201604217ygrp9dscZ/dist/img/DTH-fb-icon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.dailytarheel.com", "site": "@dailytarheel", "card": "summary"}, "publish_date": "2014-09-24 02:10:00", "google-site-verification": "CHlXbXA4sWralvQUEv7pJfpAAlXw8V34QT7XXWre_aU", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailytarheel"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4525\"", "article_summary": "But the anonymous fixed-term faculty member said he isn\u2019t confident that UNC leaders will improve working conditions for faculty like him.\nLacking benefitsTim Ives, chairman of the UNC faculty welfare committee, said these faculty have a finite role on campus, making them difficult to track.\nStill, since UNC saves money by hiring more fixed-term and adjunct faculty, it\u2019s become a recent trend, said the fixed-term faculty member.\nThe professor that students see might be a fixed-term faculty member, hired on a contract with no guarantee of long-term employment.\n\u201cThe University as a whole is moving away from tenure-track faculty simply because it\u2019s a better economic model for them,\u201d he said."}
