Along with Common Cause and three immigrants, it was brought by a quartet of House Democrats who argued that their votes on campaign finance and immigration legislation were nullified by Republicans who blocked the bills from receiving an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. The lead defendant on the challenge, however, was another Democrat, Vice President Joe Biden, in his official capacity as president of the Senate. And while the target was conservative Republicans whom Democrats have labeled as obstructionists, the fact that the legal process dragged on for nearly two years means that it could be Democrats who soon benefit from the court's decision to reject the appeal.\n\nIt could be Democrats who soon benefit from the court's decision to reject the appeal.\n\nThe filibuster has faced challenges before, but courts have generally thrown them out because the individuals or groups bringing the cases did not have the legal standing to do so. \"What made this different is we had four members of Congress,\" said Stephen Spaulding, the policy counsel for Common Cause, in reference to Representatives John Lewis, Michael Michaud, Hank Johnson, and Keith Ellison.\n\nThe Constitution gives the House and the Senate the power to write their own rules, and Senate Democrats earlier this year acted on their own to effectively eliminate the minority's ability to filibuster nominations. But, citing the Federalist Papers, the lawmakers and Common Cause argued that the Framers never intended that a three-fifths supermajority was necessary for any Senate action to move forward, Spaulding said. The Constitution details specific instances where a supermajority is needed, such as impeaching the president or approving treaties. Common Cause argued that these were the exclusive actions that required more than a simple majority and that the Senate could not just raise the bar for any legislation or nomination in the same way as it could, say, bar certain members from voting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The justices rejected a bid by Democrats to throw out the rule that Republicans have repeatedly used to block legislation.
