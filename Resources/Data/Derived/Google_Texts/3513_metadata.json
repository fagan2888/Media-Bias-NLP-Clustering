They are both former journalists \u2013 Ms. Freeland was deputy editor at The Globe and Mail before becoming a managing editor at Thomson Reuters; Ms. McQuaig has been a regular columnist for the Toronto Star and the National Post. And they have both tackled the hot-button topic of income inequality in their books \u2013 Ms. Freeland authored last year\u2019s Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else and Ms. McQuaig\u2019s The Trouble With Billionaires: How the Super-Rich Hijacked the World and How We Can Take It Back was published in 2011. Both women have built political platforms on the need to rectify income inequality, but they\u2019ve yet to debate publicly on how best to do that. They tell The Globe how they would fix the middle-class pinch in Toronto Centre.\n\nWhat issues are the crux of your agenda as it pertains to income inequality?\n\nChrystia Freeland: The really big issue is the middle-class squeeze. In Western developed economies, incomes at the top are pulling away while incomes at the middle and lower ends are stagnating. Most people feel it in our lives, whether in mid-career and suddenly feeling less secure, or graduates with good degrees who can\u2019t get jobs, or seniors feeling they can\u2019t retire. We have to figure out how to retool our political and social policies and institutions to take account of the new way the economy is working.\n\nLinda McQuaig: Sixty-six per cent of the residents in Toronto Centre are renters, which is double the national average. Rents are going crazy in downtown Toronto so it\u2019s created an absolute affordable housing crisis in my riding, as well as others. Currently, 87,000 household units in downtown Toronto are on the list for subsidized housing. Poverty, and particularly homelessness, is a dire problem in Toronto Centre. We need a comprehensive national housing strategy.\n\nDoes income inequality concern you in Toronto Centre and how do you plan to address it?\n\nMs. Freeland: Toronto Centre is, in many ways, a microcosm of Canada, even a microcosm of the world. During the nomination campaign, people kept coming back to three big-picture issues: the middle class squeeze and how do you make the 21st century economy work; the democracy deficit (many people spoke to me about implementing compulsory voting like in Australia); and their concern over Canada\u2019s diminished role as a world player.\n\nMs. McQuaig: Inequality in Toronto Centre is on display in steroids. I plan to fight for badly needed federal funding for affordable housing; to restore the $16-million for the homeless that the Harper government shamefully took out of the Homeless Partnering Strategy; to fight for changes to the Employment Insurance program so that benefits cover far more of the unemployed; to strengthen retirement incomes; reverse Harper\u2019s raising of the retirement age to 67; and push the federal government to assist the provinces in lowering student tuition fees.\n\nHow as an MP, will you navigate a riding so economically diverse as Toronto Centre, with uber-wealthy pockets such as Rosedale juxtaposed to Regent Park?\n\nMs. Freeland: I\u2019m not an MP. Right now, I\u2019m the Liberal candidate and I\u2019m going to work as hard as I can to talk to as many residents of Toronto Centre as possible. What I strongly believe, as does [Liberal Leader] Justin [Trudeau], is that we need an approach that unites, not divides. The big problem of the squeezed middle class is something that people in affluent neighbourhoods such as Rosedale know is an issue, although they might not feel its impact as acutely as in Regent Park. But these are shared concerns, and workable solutions will require buy-in from people who are the winners in the new economy, as well as those who are being squeezed.\n\nMs. McQuaig: All the income gains in the past 30 years have gone to the top 10 per cent of Canadians, and 60 per cent has gone to the top 1 per cent. I would represent everybody but my focus of concern is people who have been ground down under favour-the-wealthy policies of the past three decades.\n\nWhat political decisions in Canada helped to create the \u201csuper elite\u201d? And how does Canada stack up compared to other countries?\n\nMs. Freeland: Globalization and the technological revolution are very significant drivers of the middle-class squeeze. You see the same trends pretty much everywhere [in the world] but political policies can either exacerbate the trend or soften it. Banking regulation in Canada has softened the inequality trend here and has had a dual effect of not leading to the total pull-away incomes at the very top [unlike in the U.S.] Crucially, the Canadian middle class didn\u2019t have the banking crisis with the huge devastation that occured south of the border. On the other hand, Germany is a country that has done a better job of keeping its middle class prosperous by offering effective education and job-focused training. Traditional jobs are going away and Canada needs to focus on becoming more productive. We need to do our best, from a policy perspective, to make our soil the most fertile for new jobs to appear.\n\nMs. McQuaig: A very specific set of political decisions have created the super-elite. Since the eighties, governments in Canada have adopted Thatcherism, Reaganism, and a neo-Liberalism agenda that pushed tax cuts for the rich, social spending cuts, banking deregulation, and a tax on labour. The U.S. has adopted this agenda even more extremely but we\u2019re close behind them. In her book, Chrystia suggests this is a global phenomenon. That\u2019s not actually true. There\u2019s a huge difference between what\u2019s going on in the Anglo-American countries and other countries of the advanced world such as France, Germany and Scandanavia, which are nowhere near our level of inequality.\n\nWho is the most visionary, transformative person you\u2019ve met in your riding?\n\nMs. Freeland: There are several but I\u2019ll give a shout-out to Spiros Papathanasakis, who is doing great work as executive director of the Cabbagetown Youth Centre. Also, Ray Hobin\u2019s organization, Jamii, is organizing arts-based, community-engaged projects in The Esplanade. There is also a very small, but spirited community, the Chechens of Regent Park, who have built a great community centre. And Don Tapscott, who\u2019s long had an understanding of how the economy is changing.\n\nMs. McQuaig: Toronto Centre-Rosedale councillor Pam McConnell has done exciting work in the redevelopment of Regent Park, while still protecting and expanding affordable housing. Fred Hahn, the Ontario president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, has been a huge activist in the Church-Wellesley Village, spearheading progressive policies to help working people.\n\nWho is Canada\u2019s best billionaire (from a civic-minded perspective)? Who is the worst?\n\nMs. Freeland: I\u2019m not going to divide Canadian billionaires into black and white sheep. But we\u2019re lucky to have a lot of very civic-minded business people supporting Toronto Centre universities, sport and artistic institutions.\n\nMs. McQuaig: I don\u2019t know any billionaires personally, unlike Chrystia who I think has hung out with quite a few. A good billionaire might be someone like philanthropist/entrepreneur Jeff Skoll, who has donated millions to \u201csocial entrepreneurship.\u201d The worst billionaire? I don\u2019t know if I want to go there.\n\nDid Occupy Wall Street fail?\n\nMs. Freeland: It didn\u2019t fail. It had a lot of impact in terms of shifting the terms of the inequality debate. It played a big role in drawing our attention to the middle-class squeeze, and showing people are angry about it.\n\nMs. McQuaig: It didn\u2019t fail at all. Until Occupy came along the issue of inequality was not on the horizon. I still don\u2019t know quite how they did it. It seemed like a genuine, spontaneous thing that happened out of an incoherent mass of people coming together. What emerged was an incredibly powerful message that the 1 per cent have too much wealth which is bad for the 99 per cent.\n\nWhy are middle-class Canadians often more outraged by welfare recipients than by bankers/financiers who get multi-million-dollar payouts or salaries?\n\nMs. Freeland: I\u2019m not sure they are. If you\u2019re a person concerned about the squeezed middle class, and a person who thinks part of the answer comes from public policy, one of the things you have be sure is that your government is really delivering value for money. If you want government to be part of the answer, you have to understand the middle class is actually concerned about paying for that government. One of the consequences of the big economic change we\u2019re living through is that parts of the private sector have been transformed more quickly than the public sector. Sometimes our experience as consumers is more rewarding than our experience as citizens. To have a popular mandate for government to act, government has to persuade people that their experience as citizens can be as terrific as their experience as consumers.\n\nMs. McQuaig: I think ordinary Canadians are far more outraged by bankers/financiers\u2019 huge paycheques than they are by welfare recipients. It\u2019s one of those urban legends that the media perpetuates. People feel the system is incredibly unfair. Top CEOs used to make an income roughly 25 times what the average Canadian worker made. Today, it\u2019s about 250 times. That\u2019s outrageous.\n\nHave you come across the subject of income equality in the drawing rooms of Rosedale? Is it a topic the rich are mulling over, or is it taboo?\n\nMs. Freeland: It\u2019s a topic the rich are very much mulling over. They\u2019re really concerned, as they should be. The 1 per cent and the 0.1 per cent are not going to be able to continue to prosper for long when the squeezed middle class can\u2019t buy the things that entrepreneurs and business people produce. No one in Toronto Centre wants our society to devolve into 1980s-style Latin America with gated communities, with the super-rich separated from the ragged masses.\n\nMs. McQuaig: I haven\u2019t been in all the drawing rooms of Rosedale, however I\u2019ve found them very engaged in the issue, and very concerned. My sense is there is this small group of wealthy people and corporations that have pushed hard to put an agenda in place that has so favoured the wealthy, so extremely. Broadly, there\u2019s recognition that things have gone too far.\n\nWhat politician do you most admire?\n\nMs. Freeland: I have to start with Justin Trudeau [who last week appointed Ms. Freeland as co-chair of the party\u2019s economic council of advisers]. He is inspiring to me, and I think all Liberals in Canada. He has the courage to be earnest about politics, and to say \u2018you know what, let\u2019s take the high road and talk about a positive vision.\u2019 Another person all Canadians owe a lot to is Paul Martin who put so many of the economic foundations in place leading to Canada\u2019s relative success in the past decade, both in terms of bank regulations and the budget deficit.\n\nMs. McQuaig: [The NDP\u2019s first leader and founder of universal health care] Tommy Douglas. As for a live one, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair. He\u2019s taking on the Harper government. He\u2019s showing real toughness. I respect how he went after Harper on the Nigel Wright affair and humbled him.\n\nIf you were a billionaire, where would you focus your philanthropy?\n\nMs. Freeland: I\u2019d spend a lot on aboriginal education, which is such a neglected and festering issue that all Canadians should feel a huge sense of personal responsibility around. I would also improve education for the underprivileged kids in Toronto Centre.\n\nMs. McQuaig: I\u2019d focus on measures specifically aimed at helping the poor. I have a real problem with how we\u2019re allowing philanthropy to replace tax revenue as a key source for funding public institutions such as universities and hospitals. The rich tend to give money to their favourite causes \u2013 to their alma maters, private schools, their favourite disease \u2013 and that\u2019s fine. But other areas are sorely neglected. You see names of philanthropists on our hospitals and universities, but do you see them on community centres in the poor parts of town?\n\nHave you read each other\u2019s books?\n\nMs. Freeland: I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t. It\u2019s on my reading list. But Linda is a terrific, stimulating writer, and I congratulate her on winning a tough nomination.\n\nMs. McQuaig: I have read her book and we agree in terms of recognizing the rampant extent of income inequality. That\u2019s where my agreement ends. Chrystia tends to see this dramatic rise in inequality as inevitable, as a sort of byproduct of progress and the global economy. To do her research, she shadowed some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people so she looks at the issue of income inequality through their prism. The reason we have this dramatic rise is not a mystery. It\u2019s a specific set of policies that were devised to protect the ones at the top and create insecurity for those lower down. We\u2019ve had this agenda for 30 years. It\u2019s picked up speed, and moved into full-scale financial crisis in 2008. I\u2019m not against capitalism. I\u2019m against unbridled capitalism.\n\nAre we threatened as a meaningful democracy here in Canada?\n\nMs. Freeland: Yes, I worry from two perspectives. A surprising number of people in Toronto Centre feel that, institutionally and structurally, Canada has become less democratic in recent years. Democracy is also imperilled by the middle-class squeeze. You can\u2019t have an effective mass democracy when the middle is being hollowed out.\n\nMs. McQuaig: We\u2019re extremely threatened. And democracy will be more threatened if we allow income inequality to thrive. The more concentrated economic power is, the more concentrated political power is. We can have democracy or we can have great concentrations of wealthy. We can\u2019t have both.\n\nThe super-rich now are mostly self-made, and they use that as an argument in their defence of the disparity. Does that make the inequality any easier to swallow?\n\nMs. Freeland: It\u2019s a complicated balance to strike. There is a group of people who say there is not a problem at all. Don\u2019t worry about it. Then there\u2019s a group who want to throw the baby out with the bath water, and be in denial about the source of economic growth in the 21st century. That\u2019s why this is a genuinely naughty problem. We need to embrace globalization and technological revolution. Canadians are smart, and they understand what\u2019s going on. They understand it\u2019s a different economy than their parents\u2019, and they understand there are no pat answers.\n\nMs. McQuaig: The assumption that the super-rich are mostly self-made is something the super-rich like to put forward. It\u2019s true there are fewer people inheriting big fortunes and living off that, but let\u2019s not imply that\u2019s gone away. The majority of the super-rich are in fact people who have made their money in the financial sector or at the top of corporations. There are hedgefund managers making over $1-billion a year. That\u2019s insane. There is not a shred of evidence that the financial elite in the early postwar period was any less hard-working than today\u2019s super-elite, but they made a fraction of what today\u2019s elite are making. Today\u2019s elite has control of the rules and they\u2019ve shaped them to serve their own interests.\n\nIf elected, how will you work with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford?\n\nMs. Freeland: I\u2019m not going to do hypothetical. My focus right now is on meeting as many voters in Toronto Centre as possible and trying to persuade them that I\u2019m their strongest representative and that the Liberal party is their best choice.\n\nMs. McQuaig: He\u2019s the mayor so I would work as hard as I could to establish a good relationship with him. Obviously there would be differences in some of our approaches to things, but I\u2019m not against working with people of different attitudes. I fully expect to have an excellent working relationship with Mayor Olivia Chow.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.333", "description": "They\u2019ve both written books about the super-rich.
