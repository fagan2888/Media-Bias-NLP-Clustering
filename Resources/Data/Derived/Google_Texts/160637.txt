As the Denver’s municipal election on Tuesday gets closer, the two leading Denver City Council candidates in District 4 are concentrating on getting out the vote.

Halisi Vinson’s supporters on Saturday held a rally at South Monaco Parkway and East Evans Avenue with the support of Denver firefighters, the Denver Area Labor Federation, SEIU and Unite Here.

“This is the time,” she said, “to exercise our right to vote and send a clear message that we want control of our own neighborhoods.”

Black issued a video reminder to voters about why she is running and she provided ballot drop-off locations in the district.

“It’s a no-frills, unaffected candidate-to-camera appeal for the vote that plays directly to Kendra’s genuine desire to serve her community,” said Sean Walsh, with her campaign.
