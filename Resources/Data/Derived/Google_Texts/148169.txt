A canine crimefighter helped save the day when a suspected robber--allegedly armed with a knife--barricaded himself inside a women's restroom and refused to come out.

Hoping to hide from officers, police say the suspect ran into a Panera Bread after robbing the Kohl's at the University Village shopping center on North Nevada. Officers had been told that the suspect was carrying a knife, so they quickly evacuated the restaurant.

Officer Genta and his four-legged partner Vader then went into the restaurant to find the suspect. Witnesses told them he had run into one of the restrooms.

Genta and Vader found him locked in a stall in the women's bathroom. Police say Genta ordered him to surrender several times, but the suspect repeatedly refused.

Vader was then given to go-ahead to catch the suspect.

"The suspect was contacted on the leg, allowing officers to safely move into the stall and arrest the suspect without further incident," the Colorado Springs Police Department wrote on its K-9 unit Facebook page.

CSPD praised the work Vader and all of its police dogs do on a regular basis.

"We would prefer that suspects peacefully surrender, but we train and prepare to use our canine partners to locate, and when appropriate, apprehend, suspects who pose a danger to our community and to officers, ending evasive and resisting suspect behavior."

The suspect, who received medical treatment, was identified as 21-year-old Robert Mack.
