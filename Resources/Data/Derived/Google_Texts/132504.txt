The health insurer claims it is legally entitled to the payments under the ACA risk corridor program.

A big player in Obamacare insurance markets is tired of waiting for a big pot of money it says the federal government owes, and now it's taking its case to court.

Highmark is suing the government demanding payment of almost $223 million, the full amount to which the health insurer says it is legally entitled for 2014 under an Obamacare program designed to limit the business risk of selling plans.

Highmark's suit, filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, effectively rejects the government's position, announced last year, that it would pay Obamacare insurers only 12.6 percent of what they were claiming under the health-care law's "risk-corridor" program.

Because of that policy, all eligible Obamacare insurers are being paid just $362 million out of the $2.87 billion they had claimed for 2014. Highmark itself has gotten about $27 million.
