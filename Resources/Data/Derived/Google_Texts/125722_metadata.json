Haugen contend the best efforts to help the global poor are thwarted by a \u201cplague of everyday violence\u201d that destroys lives like a \u201chorde of locusts.\u201d\n\nAccording to the authors, the end of poverty requires the end of violence. Violence destroys gains made to improve the lives of the poor, and holds them there\u2014a phenomenon they have dubbed The Locust Effect.\n\nThis week, Boutros spoke to a Heritage Foundation audience about the book.\n\n\u201cThis is the hidden plague of our era that is quietly devastating the hope of the poor\u2014the everyday reality of common, lawless violence,\u201d said Boutros.\n\nBoutros cites gender violence, forced labor, police abuse and theft of land as the main forces holding the poor in poverty.\n\n\u201cThe poor don\u2019t run to the police, they run from the police,\u201d says @BoutrosVictor.\n\nBoutros argues that educating women and girls is a proven way to reduce poverty, but violence \u201cin the home, in the school, and on the way to school\u201d prevents their education, and thus future prosperity.\n\nThe poor in developing countries are \u201cheld in poverty by force through slavery,\u201d and in many parts of the developing world, \u201cin a moment of crisis, the poor don\u2019t run to the police, they run from the police.\n\n\u201cViolence has the power to devour many of the ways in which we assist the poor: The new schoolhouse is of no use to the girl who can\u2019t walk to school without being raped. The new high-yield seeds are of no use to a farmer who\u2019s been thrown off [his] land.\u201d\n\nBoutros points out that all of these violent acts are against the law in developing countries and that legitimate law enforcement would be a big step towards reducing poverty.\n\nHe argues that \u201cviolence causes poverty, rather than the other way around:\n\n\u201cIn every conversation about global poverty, someone should be asking, \u2018What about the violence? How is that impacting this problem?\u2019 We have to start talking about poverty differently, and doing something differently as well.\u201d\n\nAccording to the authors, an estimated 4 billion people worldwide \u201clive outside the protection of the law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to the authors, violence destroys gains made to reduce poverty--a phenomenon they have dubbed The Locust Effect.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "According to the authors, violence destroys gains made to reduce poverty--a phenomenon they have dubbed The Locust Effect.", "title": "\u2018In Order to End Poverty, We Must End Violence\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/148973952.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-10T11:43:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1vbMz1q"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "According to the authors, violence destroys gains made to reduce poverty--a phenomenon they have dubbed The Locust Effect.", "title": "\u2018In Order to End Poverty, We Must End Violence\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/148973952.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "conflict", "published_time": "2014-10-11T03:01:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-10T11:43:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "poverty, global poverty, violence, the heritage foundation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c5f\"", "article_summary": "He argues that \u201cviolence causes poverty, rather than the other way around:\u201cIn every conversation about global poverty, someone should be asking, \u2018What about the violence?\nBoutros cites gender violence, forced labor, police abuse and theft of land as the main forces holding the poor in poverty.\nViolence destroys gains made to improve the lives of the poor, and holds them there\u2014a phenomenon they have dubbed The Locust Effect.\nIn their new book, \u201cThe Locust Effect,\u201d authors Victor Boutros and Gary A.
