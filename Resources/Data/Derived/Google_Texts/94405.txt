On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal gave its readers a helpful tip on how to avoid being scammed by fake Obamacare sites: avoid websites that actually work:

“Important consumer warning: If an insurance shopping website is usable, it’s not the federal government’s,” the Journal quipped in an unsigned editorial.

HealthCare.gov — the federal destination for Obamacare-compliant healthcare — has been famously horrible since Obamacare officially kicked off on Oct. 1.

The Journal notes that there has been a “profusion of identity thieves and scam-artist pages that are now pretending to be Healthcare.gov and are tricking people into divulging sensitive information or buying fake products.”
