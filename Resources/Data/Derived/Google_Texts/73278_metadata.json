Now, how about prescription drug loans?\n\nThat\u2019s one idea for coping with prohibitively expensive drug prices. The unusual proposal is being pitched by academics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University.\n\nWriting last month in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the authors liken drug loans to mortgages, noting that both can enable consumers to buy big-ticket items requiring a hefty up-front payment that they could not otherwise afford.\n\nSome consumer advocates and health insurance experts see it differently.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this why we have health insurance?\u201d asked Mark Rukavina, a Boston-based health care consultant whose work has focused on affordability and medical debt. \u201cInsurance used to protect people from financial ruin for these unpredictable, costly occurrences. Now, with large deductibles, we\u2019ve got coverage for preventive care but not for treatment.\u201d\n\nAndrew Lo, a financial economist at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management, and Dr. David Weinstock, an oncologist at the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, agree that insurance would be a better option. But for many consumers that isn\u2019t enough protection these days.\n\n\u201cThis is a private sector stopgap way to deal with something right now,\u201d said Lo.\n\nTheir proposal calls for the loans to be financed by a pool of investors who would buy bonds and equities issued by an organization that makes the loans to consumers.\n\nWhile it\u2019s \u201cdistasteful\u201d to talk about patients mortgaging their lives for treatment, Lo said, they hope the proposal will spur change.\n\nThe health care installment loans that Lo, Weinstock and their co-author Vahid Montazerhodjat, a former MIT doctoral student who was working with Lo, propose would be aimed at helping people afford \u201ctransformative\u201d therapies that cure potentially lethal conditions such as cancer or hepatitis C. They\u2019re not designed to pay for maintenance drugs that help people deal with chronic illness. It\u2019s easier for insurers to cover maintenance drugs because they\u2019re purchased over an extended period of time, they said.\n\nIn contrast, breakthrough hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, for example, can cure people of the liver-destroying disease in a few months, but the price tag of $84,000 or more has led many insurers to limit coverage to people whose disease has significantly progressed to show signs of liver damage.\n\n\u201cThere are miraculous treatments like Harvoni, but they\u2019re out of reach\u201d for many people, said Lo.\n\nSomeone who wanted that Harvoni treatment might take out a health care loan with a nine-year term at an annual interest rate of about 9 percent, the authors suggest. In a twist on conventional loans, if a therapy doesn\u2019t work or the patient relapses or dies, the patient isn\u2019t obligated to repay the loan.\n\nAre sick patients good loan prospects? Lenders might want to assess not only loan applicants\u2019 creditworthiness but also their health to determine whether the applicant is likely to live long enough to pay it off.\n\nThe study authors say that requiring repayment only if the treatment works will protect patients and provide an incentive for the development of more effective drugs.\n\nThat\u2019s a wrongheaded approach, said A. Mark Fendrick, director of the University of Michigan Center for Value-Based Insurance Design.\n\nMedical treatment isn\u2019t always straightforward. Even highly \u201ctransformative\u201d drugs such as Sovaldi aren\u2019t guaranteed to work, Fendrick said, and other factors come into play. For example, about 10 percent of people who were prescribed Sovaldi for hepatitis C didn\u2019t finish their course of treatment, Fendrick said, referring to an analysis by the CVS Health Research Institute.\n\n\u201cIn this situation, the person who does the right thing and gets the good outcome is penalized and has to pay the money back,\u201d he said. Instead, he argued, patients who follow their doctor\u2019s recommendations and \u201cdo what you\u2019re supposed to do\u201d should not be held liable for the loans.\n\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t address drug prices, except to say that the potential for increase due to higher demand for previously unaffordable therapies needs to be addressed.\n\nPrice increases are a real concern, said Paul Ginsburg, director of public policy at the University of Southern California\u2019s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The health law has made it easier for people to afford expensive drugs. It expanded Medicaid coverage to millions of lower income adults and capped at roughly $7,000 the amount consumers generally spend annually out-of-pocket for care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helped people, but it\u2019s also driven prices higher,\u201d he said. From a drug company\u2019s perspective, \u201cIt just means that more people can afford this drug, so we can charge more for it.\u201d\n\nLo said the MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will host a conference this winter to bring together drug manufacturers, insurers, patient advocates, financial engineers and others to discuss strategies to make expensive drug therapies more affordable. Health care loans will be on the agenda, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Should patients use loans to pay for expensive health care?", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Can't Afford Your Life-Saving Prescription Drugs?
