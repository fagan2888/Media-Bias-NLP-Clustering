Bush committed as stupid and terrible and lasting a crime as any an American President has committed, which means invading Iraq in the shadow of 9/11 even though Iraq had nothing to do with Al Qaeda invading us. Obama has been trying to clean up that mess since he took office and the next President will have to do the same, because of everything Bush and Dick Cheney did to turn that part of the world into even more of a dumpster fire than it already was.\n\nMark Green, a Democrat who nearly got elected mayor of New York City in 2001, said Obama 'can\u2019t just stay calm as ISIS beheads an American or Westerner every 10 days.' (Craig Warga/New York Daily News)\n\nISIS isn\u2019t the worst threat, just the latest. But because of what these people have done, the way they have killed people for show and almost for sport, they have provided Obama a chance to do something he was elected to do:\n\nLead.\n\nHe has not been the failure the bullhorn media says he is. If you are grading him against an epic failure like Bush the Son, there is nothing to discuss. But he has not been the transformative figure we hoped he would be when elected this country\u2019s first African-American President. More than anything, he has been a disappointment.\n\nUniversity of Central Florida (UCF) students hold lit candles during a candlelight vigil in memory of American freelance journalist Steven Sotloff. (ALEX MENENDEZ/EPA)\n\nOnly now comes this new enemy, and what can be a defining moment for him, in front of our own country and in front of the world. Finally, with the meter running on his presidency, he can walk his own talk.\n\nThis will be no easy thing, despite the fact that idiots on the right seem to think it is. Mark Green, a Democrat who nearly got elected mayor of New York City in 2001, who seemed to be on his way to getting elected before the planes hit the buildings, was talking about Obama\u2019s challenge the other day.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s refused to take the bait of the (John) McCains and just be a Bush-like gunslinger,\u201d Green, an Obama loyalist, said. \u201cBut he also can\u2019t just stay calm as ISIS beheads an American or Westerner every 10 days. But the problem for him, and for all of us, is this: The public wants ISIS destroyed, but wants that done without a new war or troops.\u201d\n\nFighters from the Al-Qaida linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) march in Raqqa, Syria. (AP)\n\nGreen then added this: \u201cIf we despise ISIS more than Iran and (Syrian President) Assad, do we go ahead and try to destroy ISIS even if it collaterally helps Assad and Iran? It won\u2019t be pretty, but it wasn\u2019t pretty when Roosevelt and Churchill allied with Stalin to defeat the greater evil of Hitler?\u201d\n\nNo President will ever eliminate jihadists this determined, this hell-bent in all ways, to kidnap and kill innocent Westerners. The President admitted as much in Wales when he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t contain an organization that is running roughshod through that much territory, causing that much havoc, displacing that many people, killing that many innocents, enslaving that many women. The goal has to be to dismantle them.\u201d\n\nIt is his job now, in what can be the defining moment of his presidency, to find a way to do that, to somehow form a coalition that very well might include Assad and Iran, to back it up with special forces and intelligence and air strikes and \u2014 his word \u2014 to \u201cdismantle\u201d ISIS once and for all, at least before the next ISIS comes along.\n\nA Muslim woman releases a dove as a symbol of peace during a rally against the Islamic State group, in Jakarta, Indonesia, Sept. 5, 2014. (Tatan Syuflana/AP)\n\n\u201cIt will be harder after Bush\u2019s dumb war,\u201d Green said, \u201cbut not impossible.\u201d\n\nHe thought his legacy would be health care, as if Obamacare would somehow be remembered like the Voting Rights Act. He was wrong about that. He has been wrong about a lot of things. But he has a chance to make a lot right as he goes after ISIS, not with speeches and rhetoric, he needed none of that before we took out Osama Bin Laden. Just by walking his own big talk, once and for all.\n\nHe was always a terrific candidate. He will almost certainly be a terrific ex-President someday. But if Barack Obama is ever going to be a great President, he has to be one now.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mike Lupica", "twitter": {"description": "Here is what President Obama said on Friday at the end of the NATO summit in Wales.", "title": "Lupica: If Obama manages to defeat ISIS, he will be a great president", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/lupica-obama-manages-defeat-isis-great-president-article-1.1930160", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1930154.1409988102!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/nato-summit.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Mike Lupica", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "barack obama, isis", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-09-06T05:34:19", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/lupica-obama-manages-defeat-isis-great-president-article-1.1930160", "parsely-title": "Lupica: If Obama manages to defeat ISIS, he will be a great president", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-06T01:34:19-0400", "sailthru.title": "Lupica: If Obama manages to defeat ISIS, he will be a great president", "nydn_section": "World", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1930154.1409988102!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/nato-summit.jpg", "description": "Here is what President Obama said on Friday at the end of the NATO summit in Wales.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "World", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Here is what President Obama said on Friday at the end of the NATO summit in Wales.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Here is what President Obama said on Friday at the end of the NATO summit in Wales.", "title": "Lupica: If Obama manages to defeat ISIS, he will be a great president", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/lupica-obama-manages-defeat-isis-great-president-article-1.1930160", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1930154.1409988102!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/nato-summit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "barack obama, isis", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Mike Lupica", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1930154.1409988102!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/nato-summit.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedfa\"", "article_summary": "ISIS has provided President Obama a chance to lead, which is something he was elected to do.\nBut if Barack Obama is ever going to be a great President, he has to be one now.\n\u201cHe\u2019s refused to take the bait of the (John) McCains and just be a Bush-like gunslinger,\u201d Green, an Obama loyalist, said.\nBut he has not been the transformative figure we hoped he would be when elected this country\u2019s first African-American President.\nMark Green, a Democrat who nearly got elected mayor of New York City in 2001, said Obama 'can\u2019t just stay calm as ISIS beheads an American or Westerner every 10 days.'"}
