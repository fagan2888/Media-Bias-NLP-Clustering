Every other industrialized nation has proven outcomes at less cost,\u201d said Robert Weissman of advocacy group Public Citizen.\n\nThe U.S. is one of few industrialized countries which doesn\u2019t offer universal healthcare to its citizens. Weissman and other panelists cited high rates of infant mortality and shortened life expectancy for poor women, even as the U.S. far outspends other countries for healthcare.\n\nIn one respect, however, the American healthcare system is unbeatable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true to call healthcare in America a failure,\u201d said Gerald Friedman, Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. \u201cIt\u2019s very successful, just not at providing healthcare, but at making profits.\u201d\n\nThe heart of the problem is the damaging trend of privatization which began in the 1980\u2032s, pitting profit-making enterprises against the public good.\n\n\u201cCosts have been completely out of control, and the plan is to shift those costs onto individuals,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Coates of Physicians for a National Health Program.\n\nFriedman said access to healthcare in the U.S. is rationed by commodifying it. Thirty percent of Americans have difficulty accessing heathcare, even if they have health insurance. Only four percent of people have difficulty getting healthcare in countries with a single payer system, where government foots the bill for healthcare costs.\n\nAccess to healthcare can also be regarded as a moral issue, according to Michael Lighty, Director of Public Policy for National Nurses United. He said that nurses want to be caregivers and exercise their clinical judgment on behalf of patients \u201cunder a single standard of high quality.\u201d Market-based healthcare makes that impossible, and the Affordable Care Act has not been a solution. Under the ACA, he said, we have a tiered system with services according to ability to pay.\n\nFar from being a step toward a single payer system, as many supporters claim, the Affordable Care Act further entrenches private health insurance. \u201cOur market-based system will continue to increase healthcare spending, leave people out and result in poor health outcomes because the bottom line is profit, not health,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Flowers, a physician and organizer of Popular Resistance. \u201cUntil we change this fundamental dynamic, we will continue to fail to significantly improve the health of our population.\u201d\n\nPoor patients living in Dr. Coates\u2019 area near Vermont can\u2019t afford premiums and co-pays. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is, visits to the ER are going down, while admissions to the hospital are going up. Patients are coming in much sicker.\u201d From his point of view, wealth inequality is leading to a breaking point. \u201cThere are hideous disparities. We concentrate on the top one percent or top one-thousandth of one percent, but the poor are getting poorer,\u201d he said. \u201cIncome inequality creates its own crisis. At some point, something\u2019s got to give.\u201d\n\nHe thinks that establishing healthcare as a right for all is the remedy. \u201cIt would be liberating,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deserve basic human dignity, and we should all be free. It would change our basic political culture.\u201d\n\nPanelists seemed to agree that a grassroots political movement is needed to achieve universal healthcare under a single payer system, a goal which they view as part of a broader struggle.\n\n\u201cWinning single payer will do all kinds of things to advance social justice, because for one it eliminates industry control of an entire sector of the economy,\u201d said Robert Weissman. \u201cSingle payer means we\u2019re all in it together. We believe we\u2019re here to take care of each other.\u201d\n\nSenator Sanders called single payer a political and economic issue. \u201cWe are taking on obviously very powerful special interests,\u201d he said, \u201cwho believe that the function of healthcare is for insurance companies, drug companies and medical equipment suppliers to make as much money as they possibly can.\u201d He believes that the public supports single payer, but mainstream media limits debate and promulgates anti-government sentiment.\n\nAlong with others on the panel, Dr. Flowers believes that progress will be driven from the bottom up. \u201cA national single payer health system will come from steadfast determination and strategic organizing and action,\u201d she said. \u201cSingle payer is never going to be put on the table by people in this town when we have a plutocracy. It\u2019s going to be put on the table by us.\u201d\n\nArchived video of Single Payer Summit here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The US is one of few industrialized countries which doesn't offer universal healthcare to its citizens.", "title": "Single Payer Advocates: How Do We Defeat Health Care for Profit?", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "The US is one of few industrialized countries which doesn't offer universal healthcare to its citizens.", "title": "Single Payer Advocates: How Do We Defeat Health Care for Profit?", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/23897-single-payer-advocates-how-do-we-defeat-healthcare-for-profit", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/tologo.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"site": "@truthout", "creator": "@truthout", "description": "The US is one of few industrialized countries which doesn't offer universal healthcare to its citizens.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Single Payer Advocates: How Do We Defeat Health Care for Profit?"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "Anne Meador", "keywords": "health care, ACA, politics, ACA, Health Care, News Analysis, Politics", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb97b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA national single payer health system will come from steadfast determination and strategic organizing and action,\u201d she said.\nFar from being a step toward a single payer system, as many supporters claim, the Affordable Care Act further entrenches private health insurance.\nWe believe we\u2019re here to take care of each other.\u201dSenator Sanders called single payer a political and economic issue.\n\u201cSingle payer is never going to be put on the table by people in this town when we have a plutocracy.\n\u201cOur market-based system will continue to increase healthcare spending, leave people out and result in poor health outcomes because the bottom line is profit, not health,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Flowers, a physician and organizer of Popular Resistance."}
