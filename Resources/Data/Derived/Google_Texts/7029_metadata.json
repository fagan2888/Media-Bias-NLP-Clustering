Specifically: Is the party screwed in 2016 if Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t run? And does that mean that the party is facing some sort of existential collapse? Are Democrats the Real Troubled Party, as opposed to the commonly held belief that Republicans are in worse shape?\n\nAs in much of his work, Douthat makes isolated strong points in support of a thesis that doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nFor example, there is a belief among certain hubristic Democrats that they\u2019ll never have to worry about another presidential election again. \u201cDemocratic partisans assume that 2016 will inevitably be better for their party than the looming midterms,\u201d Douthat writes, \u201cand many analysts assume that the Republican Party is a long, long way from mounting a substantive challenge to liberalism. My friends on the left have an extensive list of things that the right simply \u2018must\u2019 do before the G.O.P. can be relevant at the presidential level again.\u201d Douthat would do well not to dismiss as tedious liberal lecturing the serious, open-ended demographic disadvantages that the Republican Party faces in presidential elections. (They\u2019re real.)\n\nBut Douthat is still correct to note that just because the Republican Party is facing a long-term abyss and can\u2019t seem to do anything about it right now, that doesn\u2019t mean that the Democratic Party, by contrast, is popular. \u201cPolitical skill builds majorities, but popular policy successes cement them,\u201d he writes, \u201cand that is what has consistently eluded Obama.\u201d The jury is still out on, say, Obamacare, and much of Obama\u2019s legacy. But in general, he\u2019s right: The public hasn\u2019t been particularly impressed with the current Democratic presidency and his poll numbers are reflecting that. And just being better at building national coalitions than Republicans doesn\u2019t alone guarantee some kind of national, enduring approval \u2014 or what\u2019s that awful word, \u201cmandate\u201d? \u2014 for the Democratic Party.\n\nSo what\u2019s the answer for the post-Obama Democratic Party? Hillary Clinton, of course! Douthat explains why she\u2019s such a formidable presidential candidate for the party:\n\nI really have no idea what proposals Clinton will run on, what arguments she\u2019ll make. But as with Franz Josef, it\u2019s not her policies that make her formidable; it\u2019s the multitudes that \u201cHillary\u201d the brand and icon now contains. Academic liberalism and waitress-mom populism and Davos/Wall Street/Bloomberg centrism. Female empowerment and stand-by-your-man martyrdom. The old Clintonian bond with minority voters and her own 2008 primary-trail identification with Scots-Irish whites. And then the great trifecta: continuity with the Obama present, a restoration of the more prosperous Clintonian past and (as the first \u2026 female \u2026 president) a new \u201cyes we can\u201d progressive future.\n\n\u201cBut without her,\u201d Douthat concludes, \u201cthe deluge.\u201d As in, without Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party is a nothingburger that has zilch to offer and isn\u2019t a very strong national force \u2014 and one susceptible to break down along fault lines: \u201cthe liberal coalition\u2019s extraordinary diversity also offers many potential lines of fracture.\u201d\n\nThis is where things fall apart. Actually, they fell apart way earlier in the piece, when Douthat introduced this thesis:\n\nAnd her desire converges almost perfectly with the interests of her party, even if not every liberal quite realizes it yet. That\u2019s because Clinton\u2019s iconic status is, increasingly, the only clear advantage the Democratic Party has. If her position is weakened, diminished or challenged, the entire coalition risks collapse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Times conservative columnist argues that without Hillary Clinton, the Democratic coalition is finished.
