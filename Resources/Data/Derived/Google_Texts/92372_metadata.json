Photo: Reuters\n\nDoug Heye is a former communications director for the Republican National Committee and deputy chief of staff to then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\nIn the past week, a protester at a Trump event in Fayetteville, N.C., was sucker-punched, and the man charged with assault later said, \u201cThe next time we see him, we might have to kill him.\u201d In St. Louis on Friday, a protester had his face bloodied; a Trump supporter was arrested and charged with assault. A Trump rally in Chicago was canceled Friday evening and fights broke out inside and outside the arena. Secret Service agents rushed the stage at a Trump rally on Saturday amid a disturbance in the crowd.\n\nThat many of the altercations have involved fighting between whites and blacks makes this violence even more disquieting.\n\nThis was not merely student activism. MoveOn.org hosted a petition advocating canceling the Chicago event, and the pro-Sanders Twitter account @People4Bernie celebrated the event\u2019s shutdown to its 44,000-plus followers. Some protesters wore Angela Davis shirts and waved banners depicting the Nazi swastika. Yes, there have been student protesters, but organized disruptions by leftist activists play into Mr. Trump\u2019s message of division.\n\nWhat these activists have responded to, and taken advantage of, is the hateful rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump since the first days of his campaign.\n\nThree recent examples:\n\nFeb. 1: \u201cKnock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay, just knock the hell. I promise you, I will pay the legal fees. I promise. I promise.\u201d\n\nFeb. 22: \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They\u2019d be carried out on a stretcher, folks.\u201d\n\nFeb. 27: \u201cIn the good old days, they\u2019d have ripped him out of that seat so fast.\u201d\n\nThe violence has not been limited to ugly scenes in the crowd. The media have also been a target. Reporter Michelle Fields filed assault charges against Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski last week and posted pictures of bruises on her arm after she was grabbed at a Trump event. Sopan Deb, a CBS embed with the Trump campaign who has reported abusive comments directed to him at events, was arrested while covering Friday\u2019s protests in Chicago. Last month a Secret Service agent detailed to the Trump campaign choke-slammed a Time Magazine photographer.\n\nMr. Trump is widely seen as channeling, and benefiting from, the anger of voters across the country. But there is a difference between telling the truth and inciting violence\u2013and his are not garden-variety insults but calls to arms.\n\nTrump surrogates have sought to blame President Barack Obama, the protesters\u2013anyone but the ringleader of this dangerous circus. Some on cable news Friday compared the Chicago protests to the 1968 Democratic convention (as if Hubert H. Humphrey promised to cover the legal bills of his supporters engaged in assault). Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson has said that Mr. Trump calls on event attendees to be respectful though also makes some \u201coff the cuff\u201d comments.\n\nNotice that this violence is happening at events for only one candidate. There have been protests at events for Republicans Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and Marco Rubio, as well as Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, but these were never marred by violence.\n\nDonald Trump, in events that are often televised, is shouting \u201cFire!\u201d in crowded theaters. How far will this go? Will someone be fatally beaten or shot? Will a militia of Trump supporters emerge, similar to the Minutemen, and what would that mean? What would happen if the violence consistently escalates?\n\nMost important: How can Donald Trump keep this country safe if his own events are so dangerous?\n\nALSO IN THINK TANK:\n\nMarco Rubio, John Kasich, and the Republican Establishment\u2019s Last Stand\n\nThe Hole in the \u2018Obama Doctrine\u2019\n\nOn Less Crowded Debate Stage, Donald Trump\u2019s Weaknesses Stand Out\n\nVideo: Scenes from the Chicago arena where the Trump rally was postponed Friday, after the announcement was made:", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Doug Heye: What does the violence at Donald Trump's campaign events suggest about his ability to keep this country safe?", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Rhetoric and the Violence at His Campaign Events", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/13/donald-trumps-rhetoric-and-the-violence-at-his-campaign-events/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NB094_0312go_P_20160312131419.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Rhetoric and the Violence at His Campaign Events", "description": "Doug Heye: What does the violence at Donald Trump's campaign events suggest about his ability to keep this country safe?", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Doug Heye", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Doug Heye: What does the violence at Donald Trump's campaign events suggest about his ability to keep this country safe?", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-03-13T21:05:36-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/13/donald-trumps-rhetoric-and-the-violence-at-his-campaign-events/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-61997", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Doug Heye: What does the violence at Donald Trump's campaign events suggest about his ability to keep this country safe?", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Rhetoric and the Violence at His Campaign Events", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/13/donald-trumps-rhetoric-and-the-violence-at-his-campaign-events/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NB094_0312go_P_20160312131419.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-61997", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-03-13T21:16:07-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Secret Service agents rushed the stage at a Trump rally on Saturday amid a disturbance in the crowd.\nA Trump rally in Chicago was canceled Friday evening and fights broke out inside and outside the arena.\nENLARGE U.S. Secret Service agents surround Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a disturbance as he speaks in Dayton, Ohio, on March.\nMoveOn.org hosted a petition advocating canceling the Chicago event, and the pro-Sanders Twitter account @People4Bernie celebrated the event\u2019s shutdown to its 44,000-plus followers.\nLast month a Secret Service agent detailed to the Trump campaign choke-slammed a Time Magazine photographer."}
