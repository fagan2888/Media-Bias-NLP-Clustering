Then I read the excellent debate between Rebecca Traister and Judith Shulevitz about the future of feminism in the pages of the New Republic. I always find Traister\u2019s work to be insightful, compelling and committed to challenging the continued whiteness of feminism.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: The future of feminism is not up to white women. Not by themselves anyway.\n\nTraister acknowledged this forthrightly, writing: \u201cthe two people embarking on this exchange are white, educated, middle-class women who live in New York City.\u201d\n\nThree weekends ago I sat in a church basement in Ferguson, Missouri, dialoguing with local young people about how to build a gender-inclusive racial justice movement to combat police brutality. My refrain to them was that \u201cour generation must learn the lessons of the \u201960s.\u201d And even though this political moment \u2013 the war on black communities, the police repression of black men, the war on women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2014 feels like the \u201960s, this is the remix. And we have the advantage and hindsight of history to guide us to the world we are fighting for. As I listened to young women tell me how they had been sexually harassed and treated with derision by young men in Ferguson, I kindly offered insights that I gleaned from reading black women like Barbara Smith, Toni Cade Bambara, and Pauli Murray \u2013 black feminist pioneers \u2014 talking about organizing in the \u201960s. Several of the young women came to me and said, \u201cthese things were happening to us, and we didn\u2019t have the language for it.\u201d\n\nFeminism gives us language to name experience. Having language that helped me to understand that sexism matters as much as racism was critically important. In a political moment in which we are expending our political energy fighting for justice for Michael Brown and John Crawford, while black men fail to muster sustained cultural outrage against Ray Rice for brutalizing his wife, that language feels incredibly important. When Daniele Watts is harassed by the LAPD, and the local leader of the NAACP calls on her to apologize, or two black teen girls are slain in Florida and almost no one is talking about it, having a politic that melds the two feels like an unequivocal necessity.\n\nRebecca Traister lays out a range of political imperatives that I agree with 100 percent: federally mandated paid sick leave, federally subsidized childcare, federal equal pay protection, repealing the Hyde Amendment, passing the ERA, and electing a feminist woman president. I know that each and every one of those policy mandates would at some level improve the lives of women of color, and in particular black and Latina women who are disproportionately poor and disproportionately recipients of public aid.\n\nBut it is the disbelief and anxiety (and myopia) that frames the first several responses from Shulevitz that gives me great pause. Her first response declares that \u201cfeminist internet discourse doesn\u2019t do much for me.\u201d And she also cites Michelle Goldberg\u2019s infamous \u201cFeminism\u2019s Toxic Twitter Wars\u201d (in which I\u2019m quoted) as an example of why Internet feminism has nothing to say that she finds compelling.\n\nIt never occurs to Shulevitz that Internet feminism is not ultimately for and about her or her needs in any specific sense. Moreover, her stale and unoriginal attempt to cast Beyonc\u00e9 as feminist straw-woman is seriously bad argumentation. Though I am absolutely here for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s feminism as I have said in multiple places, what I am interested in is the way that women of color, and in particular black women, float in the background of Shulevitz\u2019s responses informing her anxiety about a feminism driven by Beyonc\u00e9 and the Internet.\n\nAs Michelle Goldberg\u2019s piece made clear, Internet feminism is a place where young women of color, black women in particular, hold an inordinate amount of power and influence. This makes many, many white women deeply uncomfortable. Shulevitz, it seems, is one of them. Thus Shulevitz makes clearly problematic claims that seem self-aware, but are ultimately not. She writes:\n\nWould the exclusion of mostly minority home health care workers and others at the low end of the pay scale from paid-sick-leave legislation be grotesque, unjust? Absolutely. Should we take the legislation if we can get it? Absolutely. We build from there.\n\nThose are the kinds of pronouncements that middle-class white women can make definitively without ever thinking twice. But I come from a community where many black women, including some of my female family members, eventually end up as home healthcare aides precisely because job opportunities are limited. They are workers who are most vulnerable to the system and most often in need of sick leave because of the kind of strenuous labor involved in lifting, washing, moving and caring for another person.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Beyonc\u00e9 to the Internet to different policy priorities, white and black feminisms are not the same.
