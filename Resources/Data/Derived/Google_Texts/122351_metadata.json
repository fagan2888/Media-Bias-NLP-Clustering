Marco Rubio came to support the man he called Pinellas County's next congressman on Monday, and David Jolly responded that \"it's the highest honor of my life to have your endorsement.\"\n\nThe senator and the Republican congressional hopeful spoke outside the Lake Seminole Square retirement center Monday and took turns criticizing President Obama and the Affordable Care Act. They also toured the center and spoke to residents having dinner.\n\nRubio said the health care law championed by the president \"takes money out of Medicare, not to save Medicare, but to fund Obamacare.\"\n\nInstead of becoming a rubber-stamp supporter of the president like Democratic candidate Alex Sink, Rubio said Jolly would \"stand up and fight for you, and fight to repeal and replace Obamacare, and fight to bring sanity to the spending and the taxation.\"\n\nThe two men differ on immigration \u2014Rubio supports a \"pathway to citizenship\" for some who are in this country illegally, and Jolly does not.\n\nRubio acknowledged the difference, but said political leaders should work on areas in which there is agreement \u2014 such as better enforcement, better technology and more.\n\n\"The better you do at those things, the more space you'll have politically to do the other parts of it,\" Rubio said.\n\nIn spite of their disagreement Jolly said \"nobody has had more conviction in leading on this issue than Sen. Marco Rubio.\"\n\nA reporter noted that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist now opposes the U.S. embargo on Cuba and Rubio deadpanned, \"I'm not surprised that he's changed his position.\" Rubio beat Crist in the 2010 Senate race, after Crist switched from the Republican Party to independent.\n\nJolly said he supports the embargo.\n\nRubio's appearance with Jolly drew remarks from Democrats.\n\nState Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp said it showed Jolly \"is siding with the most dysfunctional fringe and opposing bipartisan, common sense solutions to the most pressing challenges facing our country.\"\n\nJolly, Sink and Libertarian Lucas Overby are candidates in Pinellas County's 13th Congressional District, which extends from south Pinellas to Dunedin, with portions of downtown and southern St. Petersburg cut out.\n\nMail ballots already have been sent out in the race. Election day is March 11.\n\nThe special election was called after the death in October of Republican U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, who represented Pinellas in Congress for more than 40 years.\n\nStaff writer Curtis Krueger can be reached at ckrueger@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8232.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SEMINOLE \u2014 Republican U.S. Sen.
