Gov. Andrew Cuomo was vocal Sunday about his support of a Congressional measure to close the so-called “terror gap” as the nation again is in a furor over gun control.

Cuomo, who has been pointedly calling for federal action on gun control since a former aide was shot and later died in September, said Sunday that “it is clearer now than ever that members of Congress can no longer sit on their hands and shirk their responsibility to protect the American people – they must close the terror gap.”

“This loophole does nothing more than help radical people kill innocent Americans, and it must be closed,” said Cuomo, who in October went as far as to say federal Democrats should threaten the GOP with a shutdown if they didn’t take up gun control. “The fact that reform continues to languish illustrates the stranglehold the NRA has over Washington, and it’s time for our elected leaders to show the political courage to vote for the safety of the American people.”

The terror gap reference is to federal legislation that would bar those on a federal terrorism watchlist from buying firearms. That measure failed in the U.S. Senate last week. Another proposal for universal background checks also did not pass muster.

On Sunday, Democratic U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer told the Daily News he would push for a new vote on that bill this week.

Those calling for stricter gun control have been emboldened by the shooting of dozens in San Bernardino, Calif. Fourteen people were killed in the shooting, which Cuomo called an “inexplicable tragedy” as he again pressured Congress to act.

President Barack Obama addressed the country with an update on the investigation into the shooting and his administration’s plans to tackle terrorism and the Islamic State. During his speech, Obama called on Congress to approve legislation that would stop gun sales to those on a no-fly list.
