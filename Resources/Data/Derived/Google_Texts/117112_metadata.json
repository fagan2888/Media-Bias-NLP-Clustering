Early voter returns tracking Colorado\u2019s first major election run entirely through mail-in ballots showed that Republicans had turned in 104,000 more ballots than Democrats, though they were hoping to close the gap.\n\nDemocrats had spent the campaign assailing Mr. Gardner\u2019s positions on abortion and birth control, trying to paint him as a Cro-Magnon opponent of women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2014 was their strategy failing them?\n\nMidterm Elections 2014 The latest news, analysis and election results for the 2014 midterm campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about Gardner and Udall,\u201d said Michael Merrifield, a Democrat running for a State Senate seat, who attended the Udall rally. \u201cI\u2019ve even had Democrats say to me, \u2018I\u2019m just tired of hearing about the women\u2019s issue.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI live in a Democratic district,\u201d said Alma Cremonesi, a property manager in nearby Colorado Springs. \u201cThey\u2019re not voting.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Cremonesi said she had a thick stack of papers with the names and contact information of hundreds of likely Democratic voters \u2014 the fruits of sophisticated voter turnout operations that in recent years have helped push Democrats over the top here and in tight elections across the country. There are about 600 registered Democrats in her precinct, and Ms. Cremonesi said her job was to reach the 400 who had not yet mailed in their ballots. \u201cIt was really overwhelming,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nYears of Republican stumbles, combined with booming growth along the diverse and increasingly urban Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, have helped Democrats turn this state\u2019s political roster as blue as the cloudless sky on this autumn morning. Democrats control both Senate seats and the governor\u2019s mansion, and have majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. But this year, Republicans believe they can ride a wave of voter discontent \u2014 with new gun-control laws, health care reform and an uneven economic recovery \u2014 back into power.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s claw back that lost territory,\u201d Bob Beauprez, the Republican hoping to unseat Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, said at a rally last week. \u201cLet\u2019s make Colorado a red state again.\u201d\n\nAs the campaign closes, Democrats are still trying to convince voters that Mr. Gardner is more conservative than the earnest, grinning Republican who has lofted ahead in polls and won an endorsement from The Denver Post. Speaking to students on the campus of Colorado College, in Colorado Springs, Mr. Udall pointed out that Mr. Gardner opposes same-sex marriage, and said Mr. Gardner\u2019s positions on climate change, renewable energy and college loans showed no vision for the future.\n\nAs he does at many stops, Mr. Udall brought up his passion for mountain climbing to describe what has become a bitter, high-spending race. \u201cYou don\u2019t schmooze your way up a mountain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t climb it by accident. You don\u2019t trash-talk your way up a mountain. You just go climb it.\u201d\n\nThe airwaves are a blizzard of Senate campaign ads \u2014 more than 55,000 have aired since January 2013, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. High-powered proxies are flying in to rouse the faithful. Bill Clinton, Michelle Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have come out for Mr. Udall. Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are stumping for Republicans.\n\nLast week, dozens of Republican volunteers packed Mr. Gardner\u2019s campaign offices in the college towns of Boulder and Fort Collins to get a handshake or selfie with the amped-up candidate. Spotting a boy in a Denver Broncos football jersey, Mr. Gardner whipped out his cellphone and showed him a photo of John Elway, the Broncos\u2019 general manager and Hall of Fame quarterback, who has donated to Mr. Gardner\u2019s campaign.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe boy\u2019s father, Dave Holdbrook, a truck driver who has been on disability for several years after a job-related injury, said he had already mailed in his ballot for Mr. Gardner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really concerned about what\u2019s going to happen with Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cSpending\u2019s just out of control, and Udall\u2019s lined up with Obama 100 percent of the way.\u201d\n\nMr. Gardner, pivoting between reporters, voters and volunteers, offered a rapid-fire recitation of his case against the Democrats: Mr. Udall is a \u201csocial-issues warrior\u201d who does not represent the entire state\u2019s values. The economic recovery may have cut unemployment to 4.7 percent in Colorado, but it has left too many people behind, especially in cities like Pueblo and Colorado Springs. Government is choking off small businesses. Coloradans are working harder and harder and falling further behind. People in much of the state feel they have been forgotten. \u201cThere should never be a forgotten Colorado,\u201d Mr. Gardner said.\n\nOutside his Boulder office, a group of students supporting immigration reform lined up to heckle Mr. Gardner about his opposition to granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants. Republican volunteers faced them down, shouting: \u201cUdall lies!\u201d and \u201cDetect! Detain! Deport!\u201d\n\nMr. Gardner had long since left, but the two sides kept yelling at each other as the sun sank behind the mountains.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141101145631,
