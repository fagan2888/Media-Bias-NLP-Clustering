Hillary Clinton said in an interview with an Arizona radio station earlier today that border security isn’t as big an issue as Republicans have made it out to be.

She spoke with KTAR about her beliefs on immigration and pushing for comprehensive reform in Congress, saying that she has a “long track record” on these issues.

On the question of border security, Clinton said, “I think we’ve done a really good job securing the border. I think that those who say we haven’t are not paying attention to everything that was done the last 15 years under President Bush and President Obama.”

She pointed to the increase in border security officers and how “immigration from Mexico has dropped considerably, it’s just not happening anymore.”
