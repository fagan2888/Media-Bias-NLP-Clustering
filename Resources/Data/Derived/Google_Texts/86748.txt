Less than a week after the GOP rolled out a new series of ads featuring a hip, young Republican complaining about how much it costs to fill up his car’s gas tank and parroting the right-wing “all of the above” energy policy talking point, John Oliver’s new HBO show has released their own contributions the campaign. Last Week Tonight doesn’t premiere until Sunday, April 27th, but if this is any indication as to what Oliver has in store for us, it should be good.





In Oliver’s version of the ads, his real-life web producer (and co-author of @SeinfeldToday) Josh Gondelman takes on the role of tortured hipster Republican and is almost believable as the GOP’s Scott Greenberg.

“I don’t like it when people tell me what to do,” he says in one of the spots, “like ‘you should buy health insurance,’ or ‘don’t carry a concealed weapon into this park’ or ‘hey, that leather jacket is way too small for you.” In another, Gondelman says, “I’m a Republican because I’m under the impression that lower costs for energy companies will mean savings passed on to the consumer, which is cray-cray.”

And here are the two actual GOP actual ads they’re mocking:
