Monday afternoon, Boehner, retiring Third District Congressman Tom Latham and candidate Rod Blum held a rally at the Cedar Rapids GOP Victory office. Iowa Speaker of the House Kraig Paulsen was also on hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real simple. If you want higher taxes and you want bigger government, vote for the Democrats. If you like Obamacare, go out there and vote for the Democrats. But if you want a smaller, less costly, more accountable federal government, vote for Joni Ernst and vote for Rod Blum,\u201d Boehner told a crowd of 100 activists packed into the Victory office.\n\nThere is a strong sense among Iowa Republicans that Blum could pull off a big upset in the First District race. Those hopes were bolstered by a new Loras College poll that shows Blum leading Democrat Pat Murphy by a narrow margin, 43.6%-42.1%.\n\n\u201c13 weeks ago, the first poll was taken. We were down 11 \u00bd points. A poll was released today my friends and for the fourth straight week, we are ahead in this race,\u201d Blum said to big cheers from the audience.\n\n\u201cA point and a half ahead. It\u2019s all going to come down to turnout. We can\u2019t take anything for granted in this race or Joni Ernst\u2019s race, correct? We\u2019re in the red zone, we\u2019ve got to push this ball across the end zone,\u201d Blum added.\n\nDue to Blum\u2019s strength as a candidate, the National Republican Campaign Committee recently purchased $400,000 worth of TV advertising time in the Cedar Rapids market to assist the Republican hopeful.\n\nPat Murphy, a former Iowa Speaker of the House, emerged from a crowded primary to become the Democrats\u2019 nominee for the congressional seat. The Democrat-leaning First District is currently represented by U.S. Senate hopeful Bruce Braley. It is a seat the Dems were confident they would easily hold. Now, they see it possibly slipping away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in Rod\u2019s chances here,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cHe\u2019s worked hard over the last couple of years to put himself in this spot. There are seven days left. All we\u2019ve got to do is keeping working the way we have over the last six months for the last seven days and guess what, we\u2019re going to have a brand new congressman from this district right here.\u201d\n\nCongressman Tom Latham, who is close friends with Boehner, is travelling around the state with his colleague to assist the Iowa GOP ticket. Latham is stepping down from his Third District seat after 10 terms in Congress. He speaks very highly about Rod Blum\u2019s potential in the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cThis is such an exciting time for all of us that we have this great opportunity to bring a person with great temperament, somehow who is going to be a real honorable person in Congress, and that is what this gentleman has,\u201d Latham said as the crowd applauded.\n\n\u201cI was telling Speaker Boehner coming in here that he would be an ideal congressman because he gets it, he understands the threats that we have around the world, he understands our economy here, he understands what it really takes to work to get the job done, and to listen you folks,\u201d Latham added.\n\nSpeaker Boehner also campaigned with Second Congressional District hopeful Mariannette Miller-Meeks later Monday and Third District candidate David Young on Sunday.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Emma Aquino-Nemecek", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Speaker Boehner also campaigned with Second Congressional District hopeful Mariannette Miller-Meeks later Monday and Third District candidate David Young on Sunday.\nThere is a strong sense among Iowa Republicans that Blum could pull off a big upset in the First District race.\nMonday afternoon, Boehner, retiring Third District Congressman Tom Latham and candidate Rod Blum held a rally at the Cedar Rapids GOP Victory office.\nA poll was released today my friends and for the fourth straight week, we are ahead in this race,\u201d Blum said to big cheers from the audience.\nLatham is stepping down from his Third District seat after 10 terms in Congress."}
