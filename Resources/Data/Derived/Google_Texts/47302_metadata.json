But he doesn\u2019t have to believe it or live it.\n\nThe senior is 6-foot-5 and 300 pounds, and from Wiggins, a town of 906 residents. But he will never big-time his roots.\n\nAfter he played in the Offense-Defense All-American Bowl in Orlando, Fla., in January, Risner said, \u201cIt was exactly what I needed to prove how a small-town kid can set his goals for the sky and with hard work and passion how anything is possible.\u201d\n\nThe center was voted a team captain and helped his team win 21-19.\n\nHe was still playing football Friday, this time in Arlington, Texas, for Team USA against Canada at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys. It was a couple of days after signing with Kansas State.\n\nNot bad for a kid who played in Colorado\u2019s Class 1A North Central League.\n\n\u201cIt just added to the greatness of the moment,\u201d Risner said.\n\nTruth is, both experiences were necessary for Risner. He wanted a taste of what awaits him in the Big 12 Conference.\n\n\u201cThese guys are good,\u201d Risner said. \u201cIt went really good, the competition (in Arlington) was more stiff than in Orlando. It was the best of the best, guys going to Ohio State and Oregon \u2026 it was good for me to get a look.\u201d\n\nThe plan is for Risner, an excellent student, to redshirt this fall and compete for a starting job as a sophomore. He\u2019s OK with getting acclimated to the program, then watching and learning.\n\nAnother reason Risner, the No. 6 recruit by The Denver Post in Colorado\u2019s Class of 2014, feels fortunate is that he missed the last five games last fall after a fracture in his right foot required surgery.\n\n\u201cIt was an awful process,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it healed up.\u201d\n\nRisner\u2019s injury kept him from playing basketball for the Tigers, but he will be there in the spring to compete in the shot put and discus. He\u2019s a small-town kid and his small-town high school needs him.\n\nAnd he is living proof that athletes from the likes of Wiggins can compete with anyone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really proud of. I was telling everybody that I was playing against guys from 5A and 6A Texas schools that have indoor facilities,\u201d Risner said. \u201cI\u2019m from Wiggins. I got noticed and that was my goal. It has been a dream come true to be there and compete against those guys.\u201d\n\nNeil H.
