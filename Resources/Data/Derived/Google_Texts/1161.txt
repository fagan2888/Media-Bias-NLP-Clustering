Cole Netten hit a 42-yard field goal with two seconds left and Iowa State rallied to beat Iowa, 20-17, on Saturday, picking up its first win of the season.

Sam Richardson had 255 yards passing and 2 TDs for the Cyclones (1-2), who beat the rival Hawkeyes (2-1) for the third time in four tries.

Iowa State took a 17-14 lead with 7:33 left on Richardson's 27-yard TD pass to DeVondrick Nealy. Iowa answered with Marshall Koehn's 44-yard field goal with 4:08 to go.

Netten appeared to miss his first try at the game-winner, but Iowa had already called a timeout.

Netten's second attempt went straight through the uprights.

Jake Rudock threw for 146 yards and an interception for Iowa, which was held to just three points after halftime.

Down, 14-3, midway through the third quarter, Iowa State found itself in desperate need of a spark.

T.J. Mutcherson gave the Cyclones life with their first takeaway of the season, intercepting Rudock and returning it to the Iowa 32. Richardson then found E.J. Bibbs with a jump pass on fourth and inches to pull Iowa State to 14-10 with 6:50 left in the third quarter.

The Cyclones went 92 yards on their initial go-ahead drive — which was aided by a targeting call that got Iowa safety Jordan Lomax ejected and Iowa State's Jarvis West knocked out of the game.

Koehn's game-tying kick was just his third made field goal in six tries.

West Virginia 40, Maryland 37: Clint Trickett passed for 511 yards and four touchdowns, and the Mountaineers (2-1) gave away a 22-point lead before Josh Lambert kicked a 47-yard field goal as time expired to beat the Terrapins (2-1) in College Park, Md.

West Virginia let a 28-6 lead dwindle to 28-27 in the third quarter, then gave away a 10-point advantage in the fourth quarter before Trickett directed a 65-yard drive to set up Lambert's winning kick.

Trickett went 37 for 49, and his passing yardage was the second-most in West Virginia history behind a 656-yard performance by Geno Smith in 2012. The Mountaineers finished with a whopping 694 yards in offense compared to 447 for Maryland.

Bowling Green 45, Indiana 42: James Knapke threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Roger Lewis with 9 seconds to play as the host Falcons (2-1) knocked off the Hoosiers (1-1).

Knapke, a redshirt sophomore making his second career start, set school records for attempts (73) and completed passes (46) as he threw for 395 yards and three touchdowns.

Lewis, a freshman, finished with 16 receptions for 140 yards and a touchdown.

(22) Ohio State 66, Kent State 0: J.T. Barrett matched a school record with six touchdown passes — five in the first half — to lead the Buckeyes (2-1) over the Golden Flashes (0-3) in Columbus, Ohio.

The win was the 39th in a row over an in-state opponent for Ohio State, which hasn't lost since a 7-6 setback to Oberlin in 1921.

Now the Buckeyes, who plummeted 14 spots in the polls and weathered a lot of criticism after last week's 35-21 loss at home to the Hokies, have a bye week before hosting Cincinnati on Sept. 27.

Michigan 34, Miami (Ohio) 10: Derrick Green ran for 137 yards and two touchdowns, and the Wolverines (2-1) overcame three first-half turnovers to beat the RedHawks (0-3) in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Michigan allowed only eight first downs, but it wasn't a particularly impressive win against a Miami team that has lost 19 straight. Michigan was coming off a 31-0 loss to Notre Dame, and the Wolverines struggled to put this game away.

TCU 30, Minnesota 7: Receiver Josh Doctson caught two first-half touchdown receptions and the Horned Frogs' defense smothered the Golden Gophers' run-oriented attack in Fort Worth, Texas.

TCU (2-0) forced five turnovers and held Minnesota (2-1) to 99 yards rushing — 134 below its average.

Washington 44, Illinois 19: Linebacker Shaq Thompson returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown, picked up a fumble and rumbled 52 yards for another score, and the Huskies routed the Illini (2-1), improving to 3-0 under Chris Petersen.
