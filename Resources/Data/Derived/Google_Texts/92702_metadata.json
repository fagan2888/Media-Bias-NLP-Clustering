Joel M. Malina, Cornell vice president for university relations, said that the administrator, \u201cwhatever her personal views,\u201d was \u201cappropriately focused on addressing the apparently urgent need of the person before her and not on any larger political context.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Project Veritas video released today would have you believe an employee was helping a student make a political statement by denigrating the U.S. Constitution,\u201d said Mr. Malina in a Thursday statement. \u201cIn fact, the video shows a \u2018reporter\u2019 misrepresent herself as a student with a mental health crisis. Under the guise of addressing her mental health issues, the \u2018student\u2019 asked the employee to help her shred the document she brought with her that was the apparent source of her anguish.\u201d\n\nAt Oberlin, spokesman Scott Wargo called the episode \u201cdeplorable\u201d in a comment to the Oberlin Review.\n\n\u201cPosing as a student in crisis, secretly recording a private conversation and then strategically editing the footage in order to support a specific, predetermined agenda is deplorable,\u201d Mr. Wargo said.\n\nCollege Fix editor Jennifer Kabbany agreed that the investigator had put up the administrators to destroying the Constitution copies, and that none volunteered to do so until it was suggested.\n\n\u201cSo they are, on some level, trying to ease her \u2018pain,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Kabbany in a Friday commentary. \u201cAnd in fact that is part of their job descriptions.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, she said the biggest surprise was that the administrators actually fell for the Project Veritas con, which she said reveals something about the \u201cwhiny\u201d attitude of students on college campuses.\n\n\u201cBecause in the end, you have got to laugh out loud at these videos as you listen to this chick moan and groan over the Constitution,\u201d she said in a Friday commentary. \u201cIt the most ridiculous thing you\u2019ve ever heard, and these officials swallow it hook, line and sinker.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Keefe, who makes a cameo dressed up as a copy of the Constitution, said he was also surprised that the operation worked.\n\n\u201cWhen this idea came up in our newsroom about campus administrators shredding the Constitution because it\u2019s a trigger against students, we didn\u2019t think people would actually fall for it,\u201d he told Campus Reform. \u201cWe underestimated just how stupid and politically correct these people are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives have long accused academics of shredding the Constitution, figuratively speaking, but a Project Veritas sting operation recently caught them doing it literally.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Conservatives have long accused academics of shredding the Constitution, figuratively speaking, but a Project Veritas sting operation recently caught them doing it literally.", "title": "Yale, Cornell, Syracuse, Vassar, Oberlin administrators agree to rip up Constitution", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/yale-cornell-syracuse-vassar-oberlin-administrator/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/08/JamesOKeefe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/08/JamesOKeefe.jpg", "description": "Conservatives have long accused academics of shredding the Constitution, figuratively speaking, but a Project Veritas sting operation recently caught them doing it literally.", "card": "summary", "title": "Yale, Cornell, Syracuse, Vassar, Oberlin administrators agree to rip u"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0426\"", "article_summary": "Conservatives have long accused academics of shredding the Constitution, figuratively speaking, but a Project Veritas sting operation recently caught them doing it literally.\n\u201cIn fact, the video shows a \u2018reporter\u2019 misrepresent herself as a student with a mental health crisis.\n\u201cIn this latest investigative series we have been to five schools so far and the results have been frightening at each one.\u201dOnly Cornell reacted the videos with an official statement.\nCollege Fix editor Jennifer Kabbany agreed that the investigator had put up the administrators to destroying the Constitution copies, and that none volunteered to do so until it was suggested.\n\u201cWhen this idea came up in our newsroom about campus administrators shredding the Constitution because it\u2019s a trigger against students, we didn\u2019t think people would actually fall for it,\u201d he told Campus Reform."}
