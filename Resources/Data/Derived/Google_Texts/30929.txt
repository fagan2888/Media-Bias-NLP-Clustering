Tonight on One America News Network, Sarah Palin interviewed Donald Trump. No, you aren’t dreaming. Yes, that actually happened.

Palin started out the segment by saying Trump “made the sacrifice to hit the campaign trail” and said Trump fans could be considered either “Trumpeters” or “Trumpservatives.”

She and Trump talked about the economy, the tax code, taking care of America’s vets, and of course, the lamestream “gotcha” media.

Palin asked Trump where he got the “guts” to take on Jorge Ramos as he did, and Trump said he didn’t like Ramos “ranting and raving.”

They also talked about Trump’s love of the Bible, and the entire interview ended with Trump praising Palin as a “terrific person.”
