(Photo: FILE PHOTO)Buy Photo\n\nBRIDGEWATER Several Central Jersey towns will be joining the fight against ovarian cancer by participating in the annual Turn the Towns Teal national campaign.\n\n\n\n\"Volun-teals\" will be tying teal-colored ribbons to trees and utility poles during September in recognition of September as National Ovarian Awareness Month.\n\n\n\nIn Bridgewater, a ribbon-tying campaign will be held in the courtyard of the municipal complex on Commons Way at 6 p.m. Sept. 9.\n\n\n\nMayor Dan Hayes, as he has done in the past, will sign a proclamation. \"Volun-teals\" will hand out information cards that list potential symptoms and risk factors linked to ovarian cancer.\n\n\n\nBridgewater residents or businesses that would like to volunteer to assist with the campaign may contact the Bridgewater Health Department by email at health@bridgewaternj.gov or by phone at 908-725-5750.\n\n\n\nIn Hillsborough, \"volun-teals\" are expected to tie ribbons around trees at the municipal complex on South Branch Road during the first week of September. Ribbons will also be tied around trees in downtown Bernardsville.\n\n\n\nOvarian cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States. Each year, more than 20,000 women are diagnosed with the disease. If detected in its early stages, the survival rate from ovarian cancer is 90 to 95 percent.\n\n\n\nFor more information about Turn the Towns Teal, visit www.turnthetownsteal.org.\n\n\n\nStaff Writer Mike Deak: 908-243-6607; mdeak@mycentraljersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1Uskzyv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "everal Central Jersey towns will be joining the fight against ovarian cancer by participating in the Turn the Towns Teal national campaign.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "everal Central Jersey towns will be joining the fight against ovarian cancer by participating in the Turn the Towns Teal national campaign.", "title": "Towns go Teal in September to fight ovarian cancer", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/09/02/towns-go-teal-september-fight-ovarian-cancer/71576974/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "everal Central Jersey towns will be joining the fight against ovarian cancer by participating in the Turn the Towns Teal national campaign.", "title": "Towns go Teal in September to fight ovarian cancer", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/05685e541ace50937bb1dac3dcf4b1ec129473d4/c=324-0-1612-1288&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/02/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635768048064562991-teal-ribbon.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Ovarian cancer, Bridgewater, Turn the Towns Teal, Hillsborough"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: FILE PHOTO)Buy PhotoBRIDGEWATER Several Central Jersey towns will be joining the fight against ovarian cancer by participating in the annual Turn the Towns Teal national campaign.\nBuy Photo Teal ribbons are part of a national campaign to raise awareness of ovarian cancer.\nIf detected in its early stages, the survival rate from ovarian cancer is 90 to 95 percent.\nFor more information about Turn the Towns Teal, visit www.turnthetownsteal.org.\n\"Volun-teals\" will hand out information cards that list potential symptoms and risk factors linked to ovarian cancer."}
