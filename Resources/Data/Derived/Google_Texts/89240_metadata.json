Sandonato, a former Niagara County legislator and chairman of the City of Niagara Falls Republican Committee, was appointed late Monday as the new Town of Wheatfield human resources director.\n\nThe Town Board\u2019s 4-1 vote to hire Sandonato came after an executive session, during which all members of the audience went home.\n\nSandonato, 29, is to be paid $800 a week for what Supervisor Robert B. Cliffe called a \u201chalf-time\u201d job.\n\nThe appointment is provisional, and Cliffe said if Sandonato wants to hold onto the position long-term, he will need to finish in the top three on a civil service examination, which has yet to be scheduled. The county Human Resources Department said it has no job specifications or list of qualifications on file for the post.\n\nSandonato said he\u2019d \u201cabsolutely\u201d be interested in keeping the job. \u201cI like municipal law. I like administration, contracts,\u201d he said.\n\nCliffe said the job was never advertised or posted. It was last held by former Town Attorney Roberta J. O\u2019Toole, who resigned from both posts at the end of June. She was being paid about $98,000 a year for the double duty.\n\nThe Town Board hired Matthew E. Brooks as town attorney for $54,000 a year, but chose not to give him the human resources job, too.\n\n\u201cInstead of having one person handle all the duties, they wanted to make it two,\u201d Sandonato said.\n\nAsked what human resources background Sandonato has, Cliffe answered, \u201cJust what he learned in college.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s law-related,\u201d said Sandonato, who graduated from the University of Dayton Law School last year and passed the bar exam a year ago. Since then, he said, he\u2019s been doing the legal equivalent of piecework for other local attorneys. But he said he\u2019s been boning up on the impacts of the Affordable Care Act on local governments.\n\n\u201cWhat they need to do is update employee manuals, cover their liabilities from that side,\u201d Sandonato said. \u201cBased on discussions I\u2019ve had, it was more along the lines of doing Obamacare filings, making sure their payroll was up to date, reviewing contracts for the employees and having the town attorney address the legal issues.\u201d\n\nHe said the town approached him after O\u2019Toole handed in her notice in late May.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a budding attorney. We\u2019ll be able to get him as a reasonable rate,\u201d Cliffe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty unique opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nThe job doesn\u2019t require Sandonato to move into Wheatfield or give up his city GOP chairmanship. However, he said he would give up a consulting arrangement he was given by the county GOP in January, under which he has received four payments of $1,500 each.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m off the payroll. I work for the Town of Wheatfield and the Niagara County Republicans will not pay me another penny,\u201d Sandonato said.\n\nThe only vote on the all-Republican Town Board against the hiring came from Councilman Randy Retzlaff. \u201cI would have preferred a little more thorough search among the townspeople,\u201d Retzlaff said. \u201cThat\u2019s always my preference, to hire within the town.\u201d\n\nCounty Democratic Chairman Nicholas J. Forster predicted there will be political fallout in the town from the Sandonato appointment. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy with absolutely no experience. He doesn\u2019t even live in the Town of Wheatfield. He\u2019s never had a job in his life,\u201d Forster charged. \u201cThis is blatant, ugly politics.\u201d\n\nSandonato said, \u201cI think it\u2019s ironic that Nick Forster, who lives in the City of Niagara Falls, is criticizing this cost-saving plan. He champions the mayor of Niagara Falls, and the City of Niagara Falls is on the verge of insolvency.\u201d\n\nemail: tprohaska@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "WHEATFIELD \u2013 Vincent M.
