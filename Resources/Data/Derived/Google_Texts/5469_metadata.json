We\u2019ve had a tumultuous situation from the time that we arrived there. But obviously, emergence of ISIS was not what was anticipated. And it is going to be an issue in the election. On Gloria\u2019s point, all of the democratic candidate held to the notion that we should still accept refugees. I think this is going to be a big flare point with the Republicans candidates. Even before Paris, [Sen.] Ted Cruz (R-TX) was going after [Sen.] Marco Rubio (R-FL) on immigration, because he said it was opening the door to terrorists to come into the country. I think it\u2019s a false argument, but I \u2014 or an overblown argument. But it\u2019s one that\u2019s going to be resonant, more resonant after Paris.\u201d\n\n(h/t Steven Dennis)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Axelrod said the rise of ISIS \"was not what was anticipated\" by the Obama admin \"And it is going to be an issue in the election\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "David Axelrod said the rise of ISIS \"was not what was anticipated\" by the Obama admin \"And it is going to be an issue in the election\"", "title": "Axelrod: Rise Of ISIS 'Not What Was Anticipated' By Obama WH, Will Be Issue In Election - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Axelrod-1114-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/14/axelrod-rise-of-isis-not-what-was-anticipated-by-obama-wh-will-be-issue-in-election/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Axelrod said the rise of ISIS \"was not what was anticipated\" by the Obama admin \"And it is going to be an issue in the election\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Axelrod-1114-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Axelrod: Rise Of ISIS 'Not What Was Anticipated' By Obama WH, Will Be Issue In Election - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, David Axelrod, ISIS, President Obama,Breitbart TV, Middle East, Obama,Axelrod", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "President Obama", "published_time": "2015-11-14T20:41:45-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama,Middle East"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But it\u2019s one that\u2019s going to be resonant, more resonant after Paris.\u201d(h/t Steven Dennis)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCNN Senior Political Commentator and former Obama adviser David Axelrod said that the rise of ISIS \u201cwas not what was anticipated\u201d by the Obama administration \u201cAnd it is going to be an issue in the election\u201d during CNN\u2019s coverage of the Democratic debate on Saturday.\nAnd it is going to be an issue in the election.\nOn Gloria\u2019s point, all of the democratic candidate held to the notion that we should still accept refugees.\nI think this is going to be a big flare point with the Republicans candidates."}
