Here in New York, we still were attending memorial services for our firemen and police. But in the nation\u2019s capital, within sight of a smoldering Pentagon that had been struck by one of the hijacked planes, the predator class was hard at work pursuing private plunder at public expense, gold-diggers in the ashes of tragedy exploiting our fear, sorrow, and loss.\n\nWhat did they want? The usual: tax cuts for the wealthy and big breaks for corporations. They even made an effort to repeal the alternative minimum tax that for fifteen years had prevented companies from taking so many credits and deductions that they owed little if any taxes. And it wasn\u2019t only repeal the mercenaries sought; they wanted those corporations to get back all the minimum tax they had ever been assessed.\n\nThey sought a special tax break for mighty General Electric, although you would never have heard about it if you were watching GE\u2019s news divisions \u2014 NBC News, CNBC, or MSNBC, all made sure to look the other way.\n\nThey wanted to give coal producers more freedom to pollute, open the Alaskan wilderness to drilling, empower the president to keep trade favors for corporations a secret while enabling many of those same corporations to run roughshod over local communities trying the protect the environment and their citizens\u2019 health.\n\nIt was a disgusting bipartisan spectacle. With words reminding us of Harry Truman\u2019s description of the GOP as \u201cguardians of privilege,\u201d the Republican majority leader of the House dared to declare that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be commensurate with the American spirit\u201d to provide unemployment and other benefits to laid-off airline workers. As for post 9/11 Democrats, their national committee used the crisis to call for widening the soft-money loophole in our election laws.\n\nAmerica had just endured a sneak attack that killed thousands of our citizens, was about to go to war against terror, and would soon send an invading army to the Middle East. If ever there was a moment for shared sacrifice, for putting patriotism over profits, this was it. But that fall, operating deep within the shadows of Washington\u2019s Beltway, American business and political mercenaries wrapped themselves in red, white and blue and went about ripping off a country in crisis. H.L. Mencken got it right: \u201cWhenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it.\u201d\n\nFourteen years later, we can see more clearly the implications. After three decades of engineering a winner-take-all economy, and buying the political power to consummate their hold on the wealth created by the system they had rigged in their favor, they were taking the final and irrevocable step of separating themselves permanently from the common course of American life. They would occupy a gated stratosphere far above the madding crowd while their political hirelings below look after their earthly interests.\n\nThe $1.15 trillion spending bill passed by Congress last Friday and quickly signed by President Obama is just the latest triumph in the plutocratic management of politics that has accelerated since 9/11. As Michael Winship and I described here last Thursday, the bill is a bonanza for the donor class \u2013 that powerful combine of corporate executives and superrich individuals whose money drives our electoral process. Within minutes of its passage, congressional leaders of both parties and the president rushed to the television cameras to praise each other for a bipartisan bill that they claimed signaled the end of dysfunction; proof that Washington can work. Mainstream media (including public television and radio), especially the networks and cable channels owned and operated by the conglomerates, didn\u2019t stop to ask: \u201cYes, but work for whom?\u201d Instead, the anchors acted as amplifiers for official spin \u2014 repeating the mantra-of-the-hour that while this is not \u201ca perfect bill,\u201d it does a lot of good things. \u201cBut for whom? At what price?\u201d went unasked.\n\nNow we\u2019re learning. Like the drip-drip-drip of a faucet, over the weekend other provisions in the more than 2000-page bill began to leak. Many of the bad ones we mentioned on Thursday are there \u2014 those extended tax breaks for big business, more gratuities to the fossil fuel industry, the provision to forbid the Securities & Exchange Commission from requiring corporations to disclose their political spending, even to their own shareholders. That one\u2019s a slap in the face even to Anthony Kennedy, the justice who wrote the Supreme Court\u2019s majority opinion in Citizens United. He said: \u201cWith the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions.\u201d\n\nOver our dead body, Congress declared last Friday, proclaiming instead: Secrecy today. Secrecy tomorrow. Secrecy forever. They are determined that we not know who owns them.\n\nThe horrors mount. As Eric Lipton and Liz Moyer reported for The New York Times on Sunday, in the last days before the bill\u2019s passage \u201clobbyists swooped in\u201d to save, at least for now, a loophole worth more than $1 billion to Wall Street investors and the hotel, restaurant and gambling industries. Lobbyists even helped draft crucial language that the Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid furtively inserted into the bill. Lipton and Moyer wrote that, \u201cThe small changes, and the enormous windfall they generated, show the power of connected corporate lobbyists to alter a huge bill that is being put together with little time for lawmakers to consider. Throughout the legislation, there were thousands of other add-ons and hard to decipher tax changes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The horrors mount.
