It's not because they're losing by a laughable degree to Donald Trump or their pipe dream of eradicating Obamacare seeming as dead as Disco. No, the Republicans are angry because they are ready for war. It's been long enough, they say, and it's time to intervene in the Middle East. The threat of ISIS is no longer contained in the area they control and many believe that the United States is in grave danger. \"Our nation is under siege,\" Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said at a cafe in rural Iowa. \"What I believe we're facing is the next world war. This is what we're in right now, already.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, many prominent Republican representative are imploring Obama to take on a bigger position in the Middle East and flex our foreign policy muscle to correct the many injustices committed on both sides of the Syrian civil war.\n\nThe Republicans feel that President Obama is not equipped to deal with the changing nature of the world and cannot handle the impeding fight that America, according to many, will eventually have to join. The candidates further criticized Hillary Clinton for not having the leadership skills to lead America during \"wartime.\"\n\nMarco Rubio, in reference to the Paris Attacks in mid-November, said, \"Forty-eight hours after this is over they're still out there talking about gun control measures. As if somehow terrorists care about what our gun laws are. France has some of the strictest gun laws in the world and they have no problem acquiring an arsenal to kill people.\"\n\nHowever, despite the strong rhetoric of the Republican candidates, none offered a clear solution for how to deal with the Islamic State. The terrorist group has captured large swaths of land in Iraq and Syria and is beginning to launch international attacks on civilians.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "After the attack in San Bernardino, California, many Republican candidates are discussing Obama's failure to maintain the security of the country and are talking war in the Middle East.", "Copyright": "2016 MusicTimes", "Author": "Music Times", "og": {"site_name": "Music Times", "description": "After the attack in San Bernardino, California, many Republican candidates are discussing Obama's failure to maintain the security of the country and are talking war in the Middle East.", "title": "The San Bernardino Attack Has Republicans Like Christie and Rubio Talking of War", "url": "http://www.musictimes.com/articles/57125/20151206/san-bernardino-attack-republicans-christie-rubio-talking-war-middle-east.htm", "image": "http://images.musictimes.com/data/images/full/53614/republican-presidential-candidate-sen-marco-rubio-campaigns-in-new-hampshire.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "musictimes.com", "description": "After the attack in San Bernardino, California, many Republican candidates are discussing Obama's failure to maintain the security of the country and are talking war in the Middle East.", "title": "The San Bernardino Attack Has Republicans Like Christie and Rubio Talking of War", "url": "http://www.musictimes.com/articles/57125/20151206/san-bernardino-attack-republicans-christie-rubio-talking-war-middle-east.htm", "image": "http://images.musictimes.com/data/images/full/53614/republican-presidential-candidate-sen-marco-rubio-campaigns-in-new-hampshire.jpg", "creator": "@themusictimes", "site": "@themusictimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.musictimes.com/articles/57125/20151206/san-bernardino-attack-republicans-christie-rubio-talking-war-middle-east.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "Title": "Music News, Photos, Videos, Blogs, Movies, Music, TV, Celebrities, Art, Theatre - MusicTimes.com", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Music News, Photos, Videos, Blogs, Movies, Music, TV, Celebrities, Art, Theatre", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06"}, "news_keywords": "san bernardino attack, mass shooting makes republicans talk war, republicans want war, san bernardino terror attack, san bernardino, Chris Christie San Bernardino, Mario Rubio San Bernardino, war middle east, war isis, terrorist attacks", "viewport": "width=1050", "Subject": "musictimes.com"}, "article_summary": "It's been long enough, they say, and it's time to intervene in the Middle East.\n\"What I believe we're facing is the next world war.\nFrance has some of the strictest gun laws in the world and they have no problem acquiring an arsenal to kill people.\"\nAs if somehow terrorists care about what our gun laws are.\nNo, the Republicans are angry because they are ready for war."}
