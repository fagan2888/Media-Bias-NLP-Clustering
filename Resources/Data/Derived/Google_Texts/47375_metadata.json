According to an annual global health survey by Men\u2019s Health magazine, Indian men have sex less than once per week and an average of three sexual partners in their lifetime.\n\nSome believe that the strict culture in which Indian men and women are raised leads to a suppressed sexual appetite and desire. Others believe that it might be a lack of privacy and the fact that families all live together, thus causing the low rate of sex.\n\n\u201cMany Indians do not have enough privacy to have sex as often as they might want to because the live in noisy 'joint family' homes with their parents and adult siblings,\u201d said Bobby Varkey, managing editor of Men's Health, to the Telegraph. \u201cThe taboo against sex outside marriage may also explain the finding,\"\n\nVarkey also notes that there is also a link between the lack of sexual activity and the nation\u2019s chronic problems with rape and violence against women. In the past year, countless cases of rape in India have been brought to light. Last year, there were over 24,000 reports of rapes, according to the Indian government\u2019s official records; this, of course, does not account for the thousands of unreported cases.\n\nThirty countries were included in the study, with over 50,000 participants.\n\n\u201cUnlike so many other sex surveys, our poll is not information-heavy, and neither is it just about charting changing trends,\u201d said Jamal Shaikh, editorial director of Men\u2019s Health India. \u201cWe have tried to examine how men from different parts of the world are better than others in certain aspects of sex and relationships, and then tell you how to learn and improve.\u201d\n\nIndian women, on the other hand, are more sexually open than their male counterparts. The survey also found that because of lack of privacy at home, Indian women were six times more likely to have sex in the back of a taxi than American women.\n\nIn a 2011 survery, 15 percent of men between ages 18 and 59 were found to have a low sex drive, according to The Times of India.\n\nDespite this information, Dr. Ranjana Kumari of the Centre for Social Research believes that generalizing Indian culture as sexually repressed and frustrated would be misleading. \u201cNinety five percent of Indians are in arranged marriages and 50 percent of them are hitched by the age of 18,\u201d Kumari said. \"Sexual access is very much there for men.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "indian men, sex, india, sexual desire", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new Men's Health Magazine study finds that Indian men have sex less than once per week.", "title": "Indian Men Have Less Sex Than Other Men: Could Violence Against Women Be To Blame?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/indian-men-have-less-sex-other-men-could-violence-against-women-be-blame-255517", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/indian-women-have-less-sex.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new Men's Health Magazine study finds that Indian men have sex less than once per week.", "title": "Indian Men Have Less Sex Than Other Men: Could Violence Against Women Be To Blame?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/indian-men-have-less-sex-other-men-could-violence-against-women-be-blame-255517", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/indian-women-have-less-sex.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/indian-women-have-less-sex.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-04T15:30:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-04T15:30:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new Men's Health Magazine study finds that Indian men have sex less than once per week."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbabe\"", "article_summary": "Some believe that the strict culture in which Indian men and women are raised leads to a suppressed sexual appetite and desire.\nThe inherent romanticism that lies in Indian culture might not translate to sexual desire when it comes to Indian men.\nThe survey also found that because of lack of privacy at home, Indian women were six times more likely to have sex in the back of a taxi than American women.\nDespite this information, Dr. Ranjana Kumari of the Centre for Social Research believes that generalizing Indian culture as sexually repressed and frustrated would be misleading.\n\u201cThe taboo against sex outside marriage may also explain the finding,\"Varkey also notes that there is also a link between the lack of sexual activity and the nation\u2019s chronic problems with rape and violence against women."}
