Starting today, undocumented immigrants can apply for a "drive only" driver's license in Connecticut.

Connecticut and California join eight other states in allowing undocumented individuals to obtain a driver's license. The licenses are called "drive only" - they cannot be used as an identification card, and does not give the license holder the right to vote.

DMV Commissioner Melody Curry says the purpose of the law is to make Connecticut roads safer. "You have a group of individuals who are presently driving on our roads in the state that are not licensed," says Curry, " they are not insured, and this will give them a driver's license and the ability to seek insurance, so that god forbid if they are in a crash, they will have insurance to cover the costs of that crash."

All undocumented persons wishing to obtain a driver's license must first pass a written test to receive a learner's permit. Drivers 18 and older must have the permit for at least 90 days, longer for 16 and 17 year old drivers, during which time they are required to take 8 hours of driving classes in preparation for the road test. So far the demand for the "drive only" licenses has been overwhelming - since December 1st, 28,000 people have applied online for an appointment to take the written test. Curry is urging everyone who has an appointment to take the written test to study the Connecticut Driver's manual before taking the test. Last January in Nevada, close to 90 percent of undocumented citizens who took the written portion of the test failed.

The Pew Research Center estimated there were about 130,000 undocumented immigrants living in Connecticut in 2012.
