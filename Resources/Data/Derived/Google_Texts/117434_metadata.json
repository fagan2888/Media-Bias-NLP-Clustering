It\u2019s \u201cpart of the long-range plans for Nucleus.\u201d\n\nThe aim is to have a dense \u201ceconomic development cluster\u201d in that area, she added.\n\nThe Dulworth property was vacant but had been leased by another company that bought the furniture business about 10 years ago and then was a call center for a collection firm. It was conveyed to the foundation by Jack and Joe Dulworth, who have an investment business office nearby at 120 S. Brook St., and Mark Milton and Chan D. Milton, listed at the same address in county property valuation records.\n\nJack Dulworth, a former chairman of the city-county planning commission, said last week that the property had been in his family for nearly 50 years and that he\u2019s thrilled that the U of L Foudation bought it. He called the foundation a \u201cprimary catalyst for economic development\u201d in the area.\n\nReferring to all the property in the targeted area, Mark Hebert, a U of L spokesman, added that, \u201cway down the road, in a perfect world, we\u2019d like to have the whole thing.\u201d\n\nAll the other Nucleus buildings \u2014 including an eight-story structure that opened in October \u2014 are full, and, \u201cwe have a need for more space,\u201d Brown said.\n\nA smaller building called the iHub, at 204 S. Floyd St., also is part of the Nucleus park.\n\nAtria Senior Living Group, now on South Fourth Street, will be moving to the new eight-story building, called The Nucleus, in the fall, Brown said.\n\nBrown and Bruce Traughber, Nucleus\u2019 senior vice president for economic development, showed off the burgeoning complex \u2014 the major part of the Nucleus Innovation Park Downtown \u2014 this week from atop the decade-or-so-old Nucleus TechCenter building at Jefferson and Brook.\n\nTraughber said acquiring more property that becomes available in the area \u201cprotects the investment\u201d the foundation already has there.\n\nHe hopes the Nucleus redevelopment in the area might also spur more interest in the ornate and historic former Kurfees Paint building on the northeast corner of Brook and Market, across Market from the Dulworth property.\n\nThe building contains leased or licensed laboratories and offices for start-ups and other companies working on advances in such fields as medicine, health sciences and technology \u2014 sometimes in conjunction with researchers at U of L, to translate their findings into products and processes for real-world use.\n\nA building on East Broadway also is considered part of the Nucleus Innovation Park Downtown, and the U of L Foundation\u2019s Shelbyhurst Research and Office Park on Shelbyville Road and along Hurstbourne Parkway also is considered a Nucleus Innovation Park.\n\nPreliminary work also has started on another park, the Belknap Engineering and Applied Sciences Research Park, south of the J.B. Speed School of Engineering on U of L\u2019s main campus on South Third Street.\n\nNucleus also has a \u201cpresence\u201d in Owensboro, helping with development of health care and agricultural companies at the Center for Business and Research at Western Kentucky University-Owensboro.\n\nReporter Martha Elson can be reached at (502) 582-7061.
