According to iVantage, The index is the industry\u2019s most comprehensive rating of U.S. acute care hospitals, and the only one to include the country\u2019s 1,332 critical access hospitals. The results recognize that these hospitals provide a safety net to communities across rural America \u2013 measuring them across 66 different performance metrics, including quality, outcomes, patient perspective, affordability, population risk and efficiency.\n\n\u201c(Rural health care) plays a vital role for communities across America, serving nearly 80 million people,\u201d iVantage executive vice president John Morrow said. \u201cThe services provided in rural America are similar to those needed in any major metropolitan area, yet the volumes and economic resources provide little economies of scale, making for little benefit from scale. These top 100 critical access hospitals exhibit a focused concern for their community benefits and needs, regardless of scale, reimbursement and people\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d\n\nMRH chief executive officer Robb Austin said the physicians and staff at MRH are dedicated to the mission to put the patient first, deliver quality cost-effective care and promote wellness.\n\n\u201cThis is the second national award that Moab Regional Hospital has received this year, and while the first award recognized the hospital\u2019s significant financial improvement over the last two years, this award recognizes affordability and scope of services; merits which are important to our patients,\u201d he said.\n\nMRH chief financial officer Craig Daniels said it typically costs more for rural hospitals to provide care using the same equipment at the same cost as in urban areas, but with a smaller volume of usage. To ensure that their charges for services were competitively priced and fair, MRH hired Eide Bailey, an independent firm, to perform a review of their pricing compared to other regional hospitals, including St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Grand Junction.\n\nOver the last two years, MRH has worked on improving its financial aid program, community relations director Jen Sadoff said. The hospital's financial aid program consists of a sliding fee scale based on family size.\n\n\u201cA lot of times with financial aid programs, you have to be at 100 percent of poverty to receive any help,\u201d Sadoff said. \u201cThat's not the case with our program. For instance, a family of four with that makes less than $45,960 would be eligible for some financial aid \u2026 A family of four that makes less than $23,550 would potentially be eligible to have their entire hospital bill taken care of.\u201d\n\nTo be eligible for financial aid, Sadoff said, a patient must first apply for Medicaid and be denied, which can be a frustrating process. She said MRH brought in an on-site Medicaid eligibility counselor to ease the application process.\n\nIn fall 2013, MRH offered four community outreach events to educate people on the Affordable Care Act, three of which helped individuals get signed up for coverage, and one which educated employers on the program's nuances. The hospital also launched an advertising campaign.\n\n\u201cWhenever there's something new, you start with education,\u201d Sadoff said. \u201cWe want people to be educated about the options they have.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its financial aid program, MRH has also launched discount programs for uninsured and cash-paying patients in both mammography and Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI), Sadoff said.\n\n\u201cAccess to care is a high priority for Moab Regional Hospital, so we continue to look for opportunities to ensure that community members can afford to access to health care and to improve community health,\u201d she said. \u201cThis commitment is demonstrated in the data, which is why MRH received this award.\u201d\n\nAnother strategy to improve the scope services, Sadoff said, is to develop a volunteer program. Americorps VISTA volunteer Sarah Shea will spend the next year working on building a volunteer program from the ground up by researching successful programs in place at other hospitals and determining which programs will work best at MRH. Sadoff said she envisions the programs matching assets in the community with people's health needs, such as volunteer cooks teaching patients with diabetes about healthier eating habits or musicians playing in the lobby.\n\n\u201cOur goal is by the end of the year to have a volunteer program in place in at least some areas of the hospital,\u201d Sadoff said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "newsfront,news", "og": {"site_name": "moabnewssun.com", "description": "Moab Regional Hospital (MRH) was recently named one of the Top 100 critical access hospitals in the United States by iVantage Health Analytics.", "title": "MRH named in top-100 list", "url": "http://www.moabsunnews.com/news/article_5305be72-2877-11e4-af39-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 840, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/moabsunnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/3b/83b7b25a-2877-11e4-9eac-001a4bcf6878/53f4b2f4e211c.image.jpg?resize=840%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 176896259007058}, "keywords": "newsfront,news", "description": "Moab Regional Hospital (MRH) was recently named one of the Top 100 critical access hospitals in the United States by iVantage Health Analytics."}, "article_summary": "Moab Regional Hospital (MRH) was recently named one of the Top 100 critical access hospitals in the United States by iVantage Health Analytics.\nOver the last two years, MRH has worked on improving its financial aid program, community relations director Jen Sadoff said.\nThe hospital's financial aid program consists of a sliding fee scale based on family size.\nAccording to iVantage, The index is the industry\u2019s most comprehensive rating of U.S. acute care hospitals, and the only one to include the country\u2019s 1,332 critical access hospitals.\n\u201cA lot of times with financial aid programs, you have to be at 100 percent of poverty to receive any help,\u201d Sadoff said."}
