The government says a New Jersey music producer who once worked with stars including Kenny G and Whitney Houston should spend over two decades in prison for swindling investors with a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.

Prosecutors filed papers Monday in Manhattan federal court prior to the sentencing of Charles Huggins later this month. The government said the 68-year-old Edgewater, New Jersey resident should face between 22 years and 27 years in prison after his October conviction on fraud and conspiracy charges.

Lawyers for Huggins say he is ailing and functionally illiterate. They say he should face no more than six years in prison at sentencing later this month.

The lawyers included a video from Huggins’ ex-wife — soul singer Melba Moore — among their court submissions.
