The result, called Mandate for Leadership, epitomized the intellectual ambition of the then-rising conservative movement. Its 20 volumes, totaling more than 3,000 pages, included such proposals as income-tax cuts, inner-city \u201centerprise zones,\u201d a presidential line-item veto, and a new Air Force bomber. Despite the publication's academic prose and mind-boggling level of detail, it caused a sensation. A condensed version -- still more than 1,000 pages -- became a paperback bestseller in Washington. The newly elected Ronald Reagan passed out copies at his first Cabinet meeting, and it quickly became his administration\u2019s blueprint. By the end of Reagan\u2019s first year in office, 60 percent of the Mandate\u2019s 2,000 ideas were being implemented, and the Republican Party\u2019s status as a hotbed of intellectual energy was ratified. It was a Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who would declare in 1981, \u201cOf a sudden, the GOP has become a party of ideas.\u201d\n\nThe story of the conservative movement that has come to dominate the Republican Party over the last four decades is inextricably intertwined with the story of the Heritage Foundation. In that time, it became more than just another think tank. It came to occupy a place of special privilege\u2014a quasi-official arm of GOP administrations and Congresses; a sponsor of scholarship and supplier of legislation; a policy base for the party when out of power. Heritage has shaped American public policy in major ways, from Reagan\u2019s missile-defense initiative to Clinton\u2019s welfare reform: Both originated as Heritage proposals. So, too, did the idea of a universal health-care system based on a mandate that individuals buy insurance. Though Heritage subsequently abandoned it, the individual mandate famously became the basis of health-care reforms proposed by Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama. \"They're destroying the reputation and credibility of the Heritage Foundation. The respect for their policy work has been greatly diminished.\" These days, Heritage has a different crusade. The foundation\u2019s president, the confrontational former Senator Jim DeMint, spent the last month touring the country, drawing cheering crowds as he demanded that Republican politicians insist that Obamacare be defunded\u2014and denouncing those who wouldn\u2019t go along. \u201cRepublicans are afraid,\u201d DeMint told NPR. \u201cAnd if they are, they need to be replaced.\u201d The foundation\u2019s three-year-old activism arm, Heritage Action, spent half a million dollars on online ads targeting 100 Republican House members who didn\u2019t sign on to the defund crusade (\u201cTell Representative Tom Cole to Stop Funding Obamacare\u201d). The push from Heritage helped the defund scheme gather momentum, forcing Republican leaders to pull their proposed funding bill and replace it with one the Senate has committed to block. The resulting confrontation may force a government shutdown. Republicans who once worked out legislative language with the help of Heritage's distinguished Ph.D.s felt whiplash seeing the group cheerlead for collapse. Heritage was supposed to be above politics, they grumbled. Heritage was supposed to be about serious ideas, not tactical fights. White papers, not political campaigns\u2014and certainly not campaigns against Republicans.\n\nMickey Edwards, one of three founding trustees of the Heritage Foundation when it began in 1973, was one of those disturbed by Heritage's turn, which, he told me, \u201cmakes it look like just another hack Tea Party kind of group.\u201d\n\nA former eight-term Republican congressman from Oklahoma, Edwards now serves as vice president of the Aspen Institute. \u201cThey\u2019re destroying the reputation and credibility of the Heritage Foundation,\" he added. \"I think the respect for their [policy] work has been greatly diminished as a result.\u201d The defund push is only the latest in a series of recent political battles Heritage has undertaken\u2014crusades against Republican politicians that have led to a rash of complaints. Representative Renee Ellmers called them \u201cbullies.\u201d Representative Lynn Westmoreland said the think tank had \u201clost credibility with the people that were most supportive of them.\u201d Senator Tom Coburn accused Heritage Action of \u201cdestroying the Republican Party.\u201d Behind the scenes, GOP staffers complained that the organization they once looked to for intellectual ammunition had become a thorn in their side. Brian Walsh\u2019s first Washington internship was with Heritage in 1996. He rose in Republican politics to serve as communications director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In a scathing op-ed for U.S. News headlined \u201cConservatives Eat Their Own for Profit,\u201d Walsh accused Heritage of taking extreme stands to generate fundraising dollars. \u201cIn our great democracy, you affect public policy by offering a vision, influencing a majority of public opinion and winning elections, not by burning down the House, attacking your allies, and falling on your sword,\u201d he wrote. Heritage officials dismiss these gripes as the eternal price of disruptive thinking. \u201cExposing folks, it certainly makes them angry,\u201d DeMint observed to Politico. \u201cHeritage and Heritage Action has gotten in the way of business as usual. And it\u2019s made people mad.\u201d But there is more at stake in Heritage\u2019s transformation from august policy shop to political hit squad than the reputation of a D.C. think tank or even the careers of a few squishy GOP politicians. It is the intellectual project of the conservative movement itself. Without Heritage, the GOP\u2019s intellectual backbone is severely weakened, and the party\u2019s chance to retake its place as a substantive voice in American policy is in jeopardy.\n\nToday, prominent Republicans publicly worry they're becoming the \"stupid party.\" In its prime, Heritage rose to rival the power and capacity of the liberal academic establishment, giving conservatives a reputation as serious thinkers. \u201cThere was a time when leftist intellectuals dismissed conservatives as the party without intellect. Heritage undid that,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThe Republican Party for a while had the high ground. Everyone said that\u2019s where the ideas are, that\u2019s where the intellectual ferment is. When your intellectual ferment is nothing more than a political platform, that [reputation] is undercut. That hurts the conservative movement in general.\u201d After the triumph of the original Mandate for Leadership, Heritage built on its success. Mandate II was issued in 1984, Mandate III in 1988. Subsequent editions were published in 1996 and 2000. In 2005, Heritage released a much slimmed-down Mandate VI. But this version, National Review observed, no longer \u201cbore an uncanny resemblance to a telephone book.\u201d At 156 pages, the conservative publication wrote, \u201cthis year\u2019s version looks more like Cliff\u2019s Notes.\u201d The \u201cCliff\u2019s Notes\u201d would be the final iteration of the document that once served as the grand blueprint for conservative governance and showed Ronald Reagan how to govern the country. Eight years later, there has been no Mandate VII. Outsourcing Policymaking With imposing buildings flanking the Capitol on both sides and a budget of more than $80 million, Heritage looms large in the Washington professional right. More than just another nonprofit peddling legislative ideas, it has become the de facto policy arm of the congressional conservative caucus. \u201cThe Heritage Foundation is where policy agendas are set and tactics are developed hand-in-hand with Hill staff,\u201d a rival researcher wrote last year, describing Republicans in Congress as essentially \u201coutsourcing\u201d their policy work to the foundation.\n\nUnique among nongovernmental organizations, Heritage\u2019s Center for Data Analysis has the number-crunching capacity to compete with the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office in using sophisticated modeling to assess legislation\u2019s impact on the economy. When Representative Paul Ryan drafted his conservative budget proposal in 2011, he submitted it to Heritage as well as to the CBO to be \u201cscored.\u201d (Heritage scored it more favorably.) Nothing better symbolizes Heritage\u2019s integration with Republican policymaking than its longtime partnership with the Republican Study Committee, a conservative caucus in the House that, at 172 members, now claims the majority of the House GOP. Heritage and the committee were both founded in 1973 with the involvement of Ed Feulner, then a Republican congressional staffer. After leaving the Hill, Feulner served as Heritage\u2019s president until DeMint took the reins this year. Related Story The Immigration Fight Is the Battle for the Soul of the GOP Heritage sponsors the RSC's annual retreat, paying for members and their spouses to spend three days at a lavish hotel proximate to D.C. And House Republicans who belong to the RSC meet every Wednesday over lunch to talk policy, plot legislative strategy, and seek out cosponsors for legislation. Each member of Congress may bring only one staffer to the large conference room in the basement of the Capitol where the meetings are held. Outside groups are barred\u2014except Heritage. The foundation\u2019s lobbyists are a fixture at the meetings, which Heritage also has historically catered with sandwiches from Chick-fil-A. But this cozy relationship hit an abrupt snag last month. After a blowup over the farm bill, Heritage was abruptly banned from the RSC's meetings. Heritage Action had initially urged lawmakers to split the farm bill in two, separating the farm-subsidy piece of the legislation from the food-stamp funding bill. But when House Republicans took that advice and split the bill, Heritage decreed the result insufficient. It advised lawmakers to vote against the split bill and warned that a \"yes\" vote would count against them on the organization's scorecard, often used as a metric of members' conservatism.\n\nFurious congressmen assailed the group for what they saw as moving the goalposts. \u201cHeritage was now scoring against Republicans for doing exactly what Heritage had been espousing only a month before,\u201d Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina\u2014a die-hard conservative who had previously earned a 95 percent rating on Heritage\u2019s scorecard\u2014fumed to National Journal. To the Wall Street Journal, he griped, \"We went into battle thinking they were on our side, and we find out they're shooting at us.\" Mulvaney even went so far as to recruit fellow conservatives to co-author a Journal op-ed blasting Heritage. But the group backed down when Heritage got wind of their plan and rushed to head it off. \u201cWe get the point,\u201d a Heritage official assured Mulvaney in an email reported by National Journal. Integrity Questioned The planned op-ed would not have been the first public-relations disaster for Heritage this year. It also made unwanted headlines in May, when one of the authors of a contentious immigration report, Jason Richwine, was found to have previously written a Harvard dissertation arguing that immigrants have lower IQs than white Americans, and that immigration policy should be based on the disparity. Richwine was fired; Heritage condemned the dissertation but stood by the report he\u2019d coauthored. But that was problematic, too. Authored by Heritage scholar Robert Rector, the report argued that passing immigration reform would cost American taxpayers more than $6 trillion. An updated version of a similar Rector study released in 2006, the paper was widely blasted for its shoddy scholarship. The libertarian Cato Institute called it \u201cfatally flawed\u201d; Doug Holtz-Eakin, who directed the Congressional Budget Office during the George W. Bush Administration, said it was \u201cbiased against finding any kind of success.\u201d The CBO\u2019s own assessment was that the immigration bill would be a boon to taxpayers, cutting deficits by $200 billion in the first 10 years.\n\nThough it\u2019s less well-known than the reversal on the individual mandate, Heritage has notably flipped on immigration policy in recent years\u2014from a long history of supporting higher immigration levels and legalization of immigrants, to the current posture of hostility. Throughout the 1980s, Heritage argued in favor of increased immigration as a free-market-based boost to the economy. In 1986, economist Julian Simon, then a Heritage senior fellow, took on the anti-immigration Federation for American Immigration Reform in a well-publicized debate. The tradition of support for comprehensive immigration reform continued in 2006 with a paper authored by Tim Kane, Heritage\u2019s director of international economics. \u201cThe century of globalization will see America either descend into timid isolation or affirm its openness,\u201d Kane concluded. \u201cThroughout history, great nations have declined because they built up walls of insularity, but America has been the exception for over a century.\u201d That sunny assessment was countered a couple of months later, when Rector\u2014a welfare expert with no background in economics\u2014issued his starkly different conclusions. (\u201cAll I\u2019m doing is counting things,\u201d Rector told the McClatchy news service of his economic estimates, which others called wildly off-base.) \"Heritage was the arbiter of serious, conservative scholarship. Now there's no pillar anymore.\" It was the Rector study that the foundation seemed to endorse, publicizing it more than Kane's work and citing it in fundraising pitches. \u201cIt was a bit unfortunate that the [Rector] study became the institutional position, or at least it felt that way,\u201d Kane, now at the Hudson Institute, told me. Kane didn\u2019t want to be perceived as working in opposition to Senator John McCain, the sponsor of immigration reform in the Senate, whose presidential aspirations he supported. He left Heritage for the Kansas City-based Kauffman Foundation. In a blog post on this year\u2019s edition of the Rector report, Kane wrote, \u201cI am disappointed in its poor quality.\u201d Immigration policy is the source of considerable tension on the right. But critics see in Heritage\u2019s flip a case study in the think tank\u2019s recent willingness to discard analytical integrity in favor of partisan red meat. \u201cRector pretended to write an immigration study. There was not an ounce of solid calculation in it,\u201d said Joshua Culling, a pro-immigration-reform conservative policy strategist who formerly worked for Grover Norquist\u2019s Americans for Tax Reform. \u201cBut it got the headlines. It was something they could fundraise off of.\u201d\n\nCulling sees the Richwine debacle and the Rector report as products of the same destructive mindset, one that he blames for alienating Hispanics and \u201closing the next generation\u201d for Republicans. As Heritage has been consumed by politics, he complained, \u201cthere\u2019s been a serious atrophy in the quality of scholarship, which was once legitimate and respected.\u201d Culling and others in conservative policy circles report constantly fielding calls and emails from Heritage staffers shopping their resumes, looking for an out. Numerous top staffers have left in recent years; Heritage insists it is a normal rate of turnover. (Bill Beach, the longtime director of Heritage\u2019s Center for Data Analysis, told me he left for the Senate Budget Committee not out of dissatisfaction with Heritage but because he wanted to work more directly on policy. But Beach also expressed the view that Rector\u2019s report presented an incomplete picture of immigration\u2019s economic effects, and that the CBO\u2019s work was \u201cexcellent.\u201d) If Heritage loses its standing as the right\u2019s font of ideas, Culling wonders what will fill the void. \u201cWe have Cato, a great libertarian think tank, but not all conservatives are libertarians,\u201d Culling said. \u201c[The American Enterprise Institute] does good work here and there, but it doesn\u2019t have the influence. Heritage was the arbiter of serious, conservative scholarship. Now there\u2019s no pillar anymore.\u201d Heritage Responds Phillip Truluck came to Heritage in 1977 to establish the foundation\u2019s research department. Today the executive vice president and chief operating officer, he recalls the Reagan years as a \u201cgolden era\u201d for the foundation and for conservatism. But Capitol Hill has changed since those days, he told me, and Heritage had to get with the times. Too much of the foundation\u2019s worthy research sat moldering on a shelf as politicians, buffeted by demands from lobbyists and activist groups, felt safe to ignore it.\n\n\u201cThe research hasn\u2019t changed. The credibility of the research is still the No. 1 thing, the No. 1 priority,\u201d Truluck said. \u201cHeritage Action is a way to exert a little more pressure and get [Congress] members\u2019 attention.\u201d The structure may have changed, but clashing with Republicans is nothing new for Heritage, Truluck notes. Tom DeLay, incensed by its opposition to George W. Bush\u2019s expensive Medicare expansion, banned Heritage from reserving meeting rooms in the Capitol. George H.W. Bush\u2019s chief of staff, John Sununu, \u201cscreamed at us for not supporting the administration\u201d when Heritage criticized the president for breaking his promise not to raise taxes. Even under Reagan, there were disagreements. Resisting the pleading of presidential Counselor Ed Meese, the foundation refused to support Reagan\u2019s second tax bill. (When Reagan left office, Meese joined Heritage, where he held a chair named for Reagan for more than two decades. He retired earlier this year.) \u201cI understand why some of the politicians get upset. I get it,\u201d Truluck said. \u201cBut our role is not to make politicians happy or angry. Our goal is to get the best policy adopted that we can for the country.\u201d \"I understand why some politicians get upset. But our role is not to make politicians happy. Our goal is to get the best policy adopted.\" If anything, the current uproar shows Heritage\u2019s activism is having an effect, said Mike Needham, the CEO of Heritage Action and a former Heritage Foundation chief of staff. Heritage\u2019s turn to more hard-edged activism is part of a larger trend of increased grassroots influence on politics, enabled by communication technology, he posited. \u201cFor two decades, the two political parties had all the power, controlled the narrative, and told constituents their spin on their votes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, well-informed constituents can form tough questions and challenge members\u2019 monopoly on influence. That\u2019s an exciting change.\u201d As the Republican Party has weakened, outside groups like Heritage have gained strength because they feed the grassroots hunger for true conservatism, said Dan Holler, Heritage Action\u2019s communications director. \u201cFrom 2003 to 2007, our donor base grew astronomically. It went from 250,000 to 600,000,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks were telling us, \u2018I\u2019ve stopped giving to the RNC and the NRCC. I want someone in Washington who\u2019s going to actually fight for conservative principles.\u2019\u201d Heritage\u2019s goal, in Holler\u2019s view, is \u201cto push the policy discussion as far to the right as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "How the Heritage Foundation went from the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement to the GOP&#39;s\u00a0bane\u2014and how it&#39;s hurting the party&#39;s hopes for a turnaround", "author": "Molly Ball", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "How the Heritage Foundation went from the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement to the GOP&#39;s\u00a0bane\u2014and how it&#39;s hurting the party&#39;s hopes for a turnaround", "title": "The Fall of the Heritage Foundation and the Death of Republican Ideas", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/heritagereagan2/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/the-fall-of-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-death-of-republican-ideas/279955/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mollyball"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf05\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019re destroying the reputation and credibility of the Heritage Foundation,\" he added.\n\"They're destroying the reputation and credibility of the Heritage Foundation.\nIf anything, the current uproar shows Heritage\u2019s activism is having an effect, said Mike Needham, the CEO of Heritage Action and a former Heritage Foundation chief of staff.\nThat\u2019s an exciting change.\u201d As the Republican Party has weakened, outside groups like Heritage have gained strength because they feed the grassroots hunger for true conservatism, said Dan Holler, Heritage Action\u2019s communications director.\n\u201cHeritage and Heritage Action has gotten in the way of business as usual."}
