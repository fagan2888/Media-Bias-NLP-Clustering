House Republicans are falling over themselves to rev up the scandal machine in an attempt to sink Obama, but more importantly, stop Hillary Clinton's march to the White House. Even though there have been numerous Congressional (and other) investigations into the Benghazi attacks, Republicans are ready to fire up the ol' Congressional investigation machine once again.\n\nI'm all for investigating government wrongdoing and shady political maneuvers, but this reeks of nothing but political theater. (What, seven investigations and then some weren't enough?) Sure, the Obama White House spun the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi in the best possible light and should've been more forthcoming with information, but nation-quaking scandal, this ain't.\n\nYou can see my pre-scandal cartoon on this incident here. And, yes, the Muhammad YouTube video did play a part in the Benghazi attack, no matter what the conspiracy-mongers say. So enjoy the cartoon and be sure to comment, share and sit back and watch the show trial.
