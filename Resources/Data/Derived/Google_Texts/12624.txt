One of the stated objectives of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was to ensure that more American women were able to have access to a range of birth control methods at little or no cost to themselves. That objective is being met, according to a study published in the journal Contraception.

The research was conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, which surveyed 4,634 women before PPACAâ€™s implementation, during its initial phases, and, most recently, in the spring of 2014.
