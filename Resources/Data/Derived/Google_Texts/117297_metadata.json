During a podcast on the GAO\u2019s website, he described these systems as a \u201ctreasure trove\u201d of taxpayer data that could be used by identity thieves and other tax cheats.\n\nThe report comes as identity theft is increasingly becoming a serious problem.\n\nIn the first half of 2014, The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported that 1.6 million taxpayers were affected by identity theft compared to just 271,000 in 2010, as The Fiscal Times previously reported. Auditors attribute the uptick to an increase in electronic filing.\n\nRelated: Tax Thieves Could Boost Their Income by 262 Percent\n\nThe auditors acknowledged that the agency had improved its security measures slightly from their previous audit, which identified 69 security weaknesses. The agency addressed two dozen, but left at least 20 more unaddressed, leaving GAO to conclude financial and taxpayer data have remained \u201cunnecessarily vulnerable to inappropriate and undetected use.\u201d\n\nThe GAO recommended that the IRS should update its policies and software to address the remaining weaknesses. The agency agreed with the recommendations.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service is failing to secure its massive computer systems--leavin", "title": "GAO: IRS Still Botching Security of Taxpayer Data", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/20/GAO-IRS-Still-Botching-Security-Taxpayer-Data", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01172013_IRS_Envelope.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/20/GAO-IRS-Still-Botching-Security-Taxpayer-Data", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01172013_IRS_Envelope.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service is failing to secure its massive computer systems--leavin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34dd\"", "article_summary": "The Internal Revenue Service is failing to secure its massive computer systems--leaving taxpayer data vulnerable to fraudsters and hackers.\n\u201cAs a result of these weaknesses, IRS had reduced ability to control who was accessing its systems and data,\u201d the GAO said.\nThe probe also found that the IRS isn\u2019t deleting old employee accounts, so former workers can still access the data systems long after they leave the agency.\nDuring a podcast on the GAO\u2019s website, he described these systems as a \u201ctreasure trove\u201d of taxpayer data that could be used by identity thieves and other tax cheats.\nRelated: Tax Thieves Could Boost Their Income by 262 PercentThe auditors acknowledged that the agency had improved its security measures slightly from their previous audit, which identified 69 security weaknesses."}
