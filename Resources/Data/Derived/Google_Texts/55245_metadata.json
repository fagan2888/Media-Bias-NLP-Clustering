Based on early results, Hillenbrand is considering expanding the program to all 900 of its workers in Batesville and possibly to some of the rest of its 6,000 workers worldwide.\n\n\n\nRun by Greenfield-based On Target Health LLC, the program helps participants drop weight by losing only fat tissue, not muscle or other \u201clean body mass.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt does this by determining each participant\u2019s ideal level of daily calorie intake and encouraging them to hit that target. On Target found nearly half the participants weren\u2019t eating enough, especially during their meeting-filled work days.\n\n\n\nOn Target determines calorie targets by conducting two tests: An indirect calorimeter sees how fast each person\u2019s body burns calories, and a machine called a BodPod\u2014which looks like a space capsule from a sci-fi movie\u2014sees how many pounds of fat each person has.\n\n\n\nOn Target then gauges success by measuring participants\u2019 fat content every two weeks, and checking their blood sugar and cholesterol every three months.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can walk stairs now, where I couldn\u2019t hardly walk them before,\u201d said employee Rosie Calhoun, who has dropped 19 pounds of fat in the past five months. Calhoun, 67, now walks three flights of stairs each day\u2014instead of taking the elevator\u2014to her office in Hillenbrand\u2019s headquarters building.\n\n\n\nCalhoun had tried pretty much every weight loss program before\u2014mostly with temporary success.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had been on all of those diets. I was even hypnotized one time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at my age now, you tend to not be successful with those things. Your body changes so much.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring the six months of the On Target program, participants have lost an average of 9-1/2 pounds\u2014or a total of 1,300.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait till we get to 2,000, because I want to say, \u2018We\u2019ve lost a ton of weight,\u2019\u201d said On Target Partner Beth Thompson, who leads the program on Hillenbrand\u2019s campus. \u201cFat tissue causes so many health problems for people. It just needs to be gone.\u201d\n\n\n\nHillenbrand represents a key test of corporate wellness because it offers one of the most comprehensive sets of health care services to employees in corporate America and is doing so at a time employers\u2014about 95 percent of which have some sort of wellness program\u2014are doubling down on the concept because they\u2019re desperate to save money on fast-rising benefits costs. Also, Obamacare is giving employers even more tax incentives to institute wellness programs.\n\n\n\nYet it\u2019s also a time of great skepticism about corporate wellness efforts. Recent research suggests the efforts have almost universally failed and that they influence only a tiny percentage of all spending on health care.\n\n\n\nLong-term test\n\n\n\nThe challenge for Hillenbrand will be to see if the early results hold up for the long term. Thompson, who used to offer the Target Metabolism program through retail stores around Indianapolis, claims that 12 months after the program ends, 74 percent of its clients maintain the weight loss they achieved during the program.\n\n\n\nBut other programs have seen early gains vanish over time.\n\n\n\nAl Lewis, president of the Disease Management Purchasing Consortium in Massachusetts, was stunned to hear about On Target\u2019s program, because it is strikingly similar to a plan tried in the late 1980s on Long Island by a company called United Weight Control. The company offered a liquid diet program, created by a noted obesity researcher named Theodore VanItallie. Lewis was the company\u2019s CEO.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work. Of course,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cPeople dropped out, and obviously, they gained the weight back. And those who stayed in it, went on weight maintenance, and they gained the weight back\u201d after a couple of years.\n\n\n\nFrom a career in corporate wellness and disease management, Lewis, a health economist, has become one of the nation\u2019s foremost critics of corporate wellness efforts. He and health care consultant Vik Khanna published a book this year titled \u201cSurviving Workplace Wellness,\u201d which declared it a mathematical impossibility for corporate wellness efforts to save money.\n\n\n\nLewis developed a list of medical procedures that can be influenced by wellness efforts. Then he examined the percentage of all medical spending coming from those procedures. His conclusion: about 4 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cWellness literally cannot save money,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIn health care, the 80-20 rule is that 80 percent of the time, there is no 80-20 rule. Your spending is spread out in so many places.\u201d\n\n\n\nLewis said more corporate chief financial officers\u2014most of whom don\u2019t think wellness saves money, anyway\u2014should know that wellness programs cost about 10 times more than what a company actually pays out for wellness services. That\u2019s because the screening and questioning of employees to find health problems often induces them to get more care, driving up spending in the employer\u2019s health plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 10 percent of [employers\u2019] health spend,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe numbers are scattered like the dirt in the Great Escape. It takes a lot of digging, no pun intended, to find it all.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt takes a village\n\n\n\nOf course, not everyone is convinced by Lewis\u2019 critique.\n\n\n\nTodd Foushee, vice president of business development for Quad Medical, the Wisconsin-based company that operates Hillenbrand\u2019s on-site health clinic, said Hillenbrand is a leading example of the kind of comprehensive program that works.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt really does take a village to reverse the trends,\u201d said Foushee. \u201cCombine all the services and those patients who are ready to change will seize the opportunity. Many patients are prisoners of their bodies and need an integrated solution to address the physical and mental aspects of the issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe has research to back him up. A 2010 review of wellness studies conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that comprehensive wellness programs\u2014which account for only about 7 percent of all corporate wellness programs\u2014did help improve workers\u2019 health and save employers money.\n\n\n\nThe On Target program links in with all the other things Hillenbrand has done to improve its workers\u2019 health over the past six years: an on-site medical clinic, high-deductible health plans and programs to help employees schedule diagnostic and specialty consults while considering the difference in cost and quality among various health care providers.\n\n\n\nThat suite of services is key in helping workers get healthier, Foushee and Thompson said. That\u2019s true first because the On Target program easily operates under the oversight of the physicians that staff Hillenbrand\u2019s clinic.\n\nRosie Calhoun, a 46-year worker at Hillenbrand, comes twice a month for check-ups of her body fat in the BodPod.

(IBJ Photo/Eric Learned)\n\nThose physicians conduct an initial physical and round of blood tests with each On Target participant, then another physical and set of blood tests at the end.\n\n\n\nHaving a suite of services is also key because employees often plateau in their efforts to be healthier.\n\n\n\nWhen a Hillenbrand worker stops losing weight, Thompson checks for physiological reasons\u2014such as whether the employee\u2019s metabolism has shifted because of the weight loss or if certain medications are no longer necessary.\n\n\n\nShe\u2019ll also check to see if there is a mental issue. If so, Hillenbrand has a counseling program. Or physicians at the clinic can set up an appointment with a mental health worker.\n\n\n\nQuadMedical\u2019s Foushee said having medical professionals make appointments for workers is key, because only about one in seven workers will actually schedule and go to a mental health professional simply because a doctor recommended it.\n\n\n\nCosts contained\n\n\n\nJulie Joerger, Hillenbrand\u2019s director of mergers and acquisitions and human resources services, credits the changes with limiting Hillenbrand\u2019s health benefits spending to about 3 percent to 5 percent per year.\n\n\n\nSince 2008, employer spending on benefits rose 3 percent to 11 percent per year, according to an annual nationwide survey by California-based Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\n\nJoerger doesn\u2019t talk about On Target\u2019s weight loss program primarily as another attempt to control costs. Instead, she said she embraced it when Foushee and Thompson approached her as a way to keep employees focused on health and wellness.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always got to be asking, \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d Joerger said. \u201cBecause employees, they do a weight loss program or an exercise program and then it ends and they say, \u2018OK, now what do I do?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Target has contributed to that culture of wellness at Hillenbrand, employees said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt company meetings, people still order the pizza, but now there\u2019s a big salad ordered with it. Or when we have birthday parties, there is still cake and candy, but now there will be fruit, too. Because they know people are going to be watching their calories,\u201d said Todd Tekulve, manager of Hillenbrand\u2019s Batesville casket products. He has lost 38 pounds on the program since June.\n\n\n\nJoerger and her fellow executives at Hillenbrand will decide whether to expand the On Target program based on its clinical results.\n\n\n\nSo far, all six diabetic and pre-diabetic patients in the program saw their blood sugar levels\u2014measured by the blood particle hemoglobin A1C\u2014go down. The average drop was 0.6 percent over 10 weeks, which, if continued, would be similar in effectiveness to many diabetes medications.\n\n\n\nThe diabetic and pre-diabetic patients also lost eight pounds on average in the program\u2019s first 10 weeks.\n\n\n\nAmong the 20 patients with poor cholesterol and triglyceride levels, 16 increased their HDL, or \u201cgood,\u201d cholesterol, by an average of 19 percent; 14 decreased their LDL, or \u201cbad,\u201d cholesterol, by an average of 15 percent; and 14 decreased their triglycerides, by an average of 22 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s looking pretty good,\u201d Joerger said.\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of companies have instituted weight loss programs for their workers.
