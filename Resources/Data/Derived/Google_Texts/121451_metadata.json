A student in the Gabelli School of Business, senior Felicia Zhang manages to balance a pre-medical coursework among her many other responsibilities and commitments. Moving from the brisk autumn outdoors to a cozy, yet professional, room on the third floor of Hughes Hall, we chatted for a while over coffee while she dictated her life story. Neatly put together, no one would have guessed that she only slept three hours the night before. The only hint of it would be the large cup of coffee in her hand. Caffeine, she says, is what helps her through all of this.\n\n\u201cI have a presentation later,\u201d she told me prior to sitting down. \u201cMy thesis is on drug pricing policy.\u201d\n\nFelicia\u2019s goal is to get a medical degree and enter the vast field of healthcare able to draw parallels between business and patient care. She comments that \u201cthe political aspect [of medicine] \u2014 like the Affordable Care Act and what it\u2019s doing to the industry \u2014 has to do with what it\u2019s like to becoming a provider.\u201d\n\nHailing from the Golden State, she says, \u201c[New Yorkers] are a little more aggressive\u2026Being in this environment has helped become a little less naive \u2014 to push and pull.\u201d\n\nThat is, in fact, what she has done at Fordham. She is one of the few GSB students on the pre-health route. Last year, she co-founded the Business Innovations in Healthcare Club (BIHC) with James Finora, GSB \u201917. She said it is one of her greatest accomplishments. Students on the pre-health route are discouraged by the school\u2019s requirements to pursue both avenues of education. This almost-Janusian combination is difficult to navigate with different requirements from both departments.\n\n\u201c[The administration is coming to know] what our needs are as business/pre-med [students]. Through BIHC, I hope to develop a mentoring program and a precedent for other business/pre-meds.\u201d said Zhang. With a smile on her face, her promise as a dedicated student is evident.\n\n\u201cWould you say your career comes first?\u201d I asked.\n\nThere is a moment of hesitation. \u201cOut of what?\u201d she said. \u201cAt this point, in college with my privilege, I can be a little selfish and focus on myself \u2014 and that means my career.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is one social movement that you think you can place yourself behind?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cBlack Lives Matter. As an Asian, I feel like\u2026\u201d There is a pause. \u201cHow do I put this? As a member of the \u2018model minority\u2019 and as a person of color, I believe that whatever the injustices that Asians and Asian Americans feel that are done to them can only be resolved if all people of color could come together. I believe the gravest injustices are done to the Black American populations. Those injustices have to be addressed before the \u2018lesser\u2019 injustices of my community,\u201d Felicia said.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying BLM should gain priority in social activism?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt should gain priority from that, when [the policing of black and brown bodies] is addressed, other issues that should be addressed will follow,\u201d she said firmly, obviously giving much thought on this topic before I even asked.\n\n\u201cI do miss home. I can talk about my family. They\u2019re important to me, especially my parents. What makes me love my parents so much is the struggles we\u2019ve endured together. I find myself worrying about my parents and their retirement. I think my father finds enjoyment in duty to the family. I can understand that; I think I would too.\u201d\n\nShe is family-oriented. She talks to her parents often and has a genuine concern for them. Caring and studious, I wondered how she balances work while being positive.\n\n\u201cI have this weird sense that I should be doing work in the night hours, and I\u2019d be wasting time if I slept. I feel like sleeping is a waste \u2014\u201d She pauses to reword. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a waste of time \u2014 but I think I could be doing better things.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you back that statement up as a pre-med student?\u201d\n\nShe smiles and almost immediately responds, \u201cHow do hospitals back up how they work resident [students]? I\u2019d rather be saving other people\u2019s lives than sleeping, unless my efficiency is compromised.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Fordham Ram", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Who\u2019s That Kid?
