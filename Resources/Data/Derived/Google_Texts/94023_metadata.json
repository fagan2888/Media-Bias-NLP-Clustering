But by their own measures and by the measures of other retail sites, the administration has failed to fix their bungled website and achieve the easier lift of success on the front end, let alone the as-yet-unconstructed back end of the federal exchange.\n\nEvery week brings another announcement of delays in the law \u2013 delays that are in some cases more than even Republicans had requested to begin with \u2013 from the White House. The small business exchange delay dropped right before Thanksgiving, the decision to kick the can on open enrollment until after the 2014 elections, and the latest decision to scrap the payment system for insurers and rely on manual submissions for at least the first month illustrates how extreme the back end problems are.\n\nHealthcare.gov is even having trouble signing people up for Medicaid, which should be as easy as can be. And we\u2019re just three weeks away from the December 23rd deadline to buy insurance, and the December 31st deadline to pay their premium, before people start getting hit by the mandate penalty.\n\nTaking the president\u2019s public relations campaign rollout claiming \u201ceverything\u2019s fixed!\u201d at face value, Democrats are now reportedly demanding that someone be held accountable for the mismanaged launch of Obamacare.\n\nWhite House officials, asserting that the HealthCare.gov website is largely fixed, are under mounting pressure from Democrats and close allies to hold senior-level people accountable for the botched rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement and to determine who should be fired. For weeks, the president and his aides have said they are not interested in conducting a witch hunt in the middle of the effort to rescue the website. But in the West Wing, the desire for an explanation about how an administration that prides itself on competence bungled so badly remains an urgent mission\u2026 Close aides said that Mr. Obama was unlikely to give in to the demands for a public flogging, but White House officials also said that Mr. Obama had demonstrated a calculated willingness to push people out.\n\nSo they claim. To this point, there\u2019s every indication that the president is too soft to fire anyone who was actually responsible for this. Kathleen Sebelius should feel safe as ever.\n\nBut if you set aside the talking points and look at the real, enduring problems of the federal exchange, the real question Democrats should be asking isn\u2019t who should be pushed out \u2013 it\u2019s who should be brought in.\n\n[S]uccessful businesses have a good management structure. People in charge are familiar with the problems and able to focus effort, and operational employees are empowered to identify and solve problems. The Obama Administration failed in this last task. The team lacked a \u201cCEO\u201d who could focus the efforts, and line employees were stifled or ignored. As a result, deadlines were missed, minority opinions were ignored, and possible problems were not considered. The universal opposition of Republicans to the ACA made the administration\u2019s task more difficult, but it does not excuse the failure. Fixing the administration\u2019s implementation efforts will require more than just fixing the website. It will mean changing the entire organization of the government\u2019s ACA efforts. Undoubtedly, some people need to leave or move on to other positions. More important is who needs to come on board, and that\u2019s people with management skills and experience in startup businesses. There is no successful organization without good senior leadership.\n\nGoing forward, this kind of CEO-style leadership is essential for fixing Obamacare. Back up a moment: one of the lessons about the failure of Obamacare\u2019s launch is that it\u2019s an indication of how the impression of Obama himself was out of sync with his actual approach to leadership. Obama delegates, and he trusts his people. While he ran as a cool under pressure technocrat, the reality is that he\u2019s an ambitious ideologue and a political animal. He left the framing of his namesake legislation to Hill veterans, quickly backing off the promises he\u2019d made while running for the presidency in 2008. The implementation was delegated, too \u2013 to a group of self-styled elite bureaucrats at HHS and CMS who, lacking experience in anything approaching a project of this size, turned out to be terrible project managers.\n\nSo What\u2019s The Answer?\n\nWe\u2019re only beginning to deal with the ramifications of this, politically. But when it comes to the implementation side, there\u2019s one simple step Obama could take to rescue his signature project. It\u2019d be bold. It\u2019d be out of the box. It\u2019d be the sort of thing that the Hope and Change era Obama might\u2019ve done, even if today\u2019s Obama would never think of it.\n\nWhat Obama needs right now more than ever is a turnaround artist. Ideally, he would find someone with executive experience and bipartisan bona fides, someone experienced in the health policy space, who understands how these complicated exchanges are supposed to work. He needs someone with serious management experience and corporate consulting acumen, who\u2019s dealt with a prominent national project while in the public eye, who\u2019s completed a significant Olympic-sized undertaking under the pressure of a hard timeline. He needs someone with no future ambitions or plans to run for office again, a true non-ideological technocrat, someone who won\u2019t manipulate a bureaucratic undertaking toward personal or political ends, but is just interested in solutions, in making things work.\n\nIt might even help if this person was a bit cutthroat, a tad robotic, with that special type of smiling harshness \u2013 someone who can slash the deadwood from a project, prioritize what needs doing and who can do it, and who won\u2019t hesitate for one second to fire people who deserve it. If you\u2019re talking about the perfect candidate, it\u2019d be someone who actuallyliked firing people, who relishes it, and didn\u2019t really give a damn who didn\u2019t like him for it.\n\nThankfully, as Ann Althouse has noted, there is exactly one person in America who has all these qualities. And he\u2019s got time on his hands.\n\nAll Barack Obama has to do is pick up the phone and say the magic words: \u201cHelp me, Mitt Romney. You\u2019re my only hope.\u201d\n\n[Originally published in The Federalist]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/heres-the-one-crazy-thing-barack-obama-can-do-to-save-obamacare/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mystery_man.jpeg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Here\u2019s The One Crazy Thing Barack Obama Can Do To Save Obamacare"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7d2\"", "article_summary": "What Obama needs right now more than ever is a turnaround artist.\nIt\u2019d be the sort of thing that the Hope and Change era Obama might\u2019ve done, even if today\u2019s Obama would never think of it.\nAll Barack Obama has to do is pick up the phone and say the magic words: \u201cHelp me, Mitt Romney.\nBut when it comes to the implementation side, there\u2019s one simple step Obama could take to rescue his signature project.\nMore important is who needs to come on board, and that\u2019s people with management skills and experience in startup businesses."}
