Many saw a sea of angry protesters pouring into Fountain Park in Fountain Hills for the Donald Trump rally Saturday morning.

Dozens of protesters created a roadblock of cars and people, backing up traffic for miles on Shea Boulevard as drivers headed to the rally.

Luke Johnson was on his way to church nearby and within seconds, he was caught, unable to move his work truck and trailer.

“All of a sudden a huge group of people ran into the road and I couldn’t get across. I didn’t know what was going on,” he explained.

That’s when Johnson started to get dozens of calls from people threatening his life. “People saying they were going to hunt my business down and find me and come after me and destroy my business.”

It turns out people had seen his work trailer live on CNN and assumed he was part of the protest even though he wasn’t. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

“I am concerned for my family, that nothing happens to them or where I live,” he said.

Johnson added that he plans on filing a police report but worries that changing his phone number could cost him his business.

But, he explained that there’s an even bigger picture to worry about and that’s the violence on both sides.

“Let’s not spread hatred on either side,” he said.
