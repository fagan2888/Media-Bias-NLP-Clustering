Subscribe here.\n\nThe atmosphere in the room feels more like an old-school black church than it does a campaign event. The crowd that has assembled in Baltimore\u2019s Charles North neighborhood\u2014mostly black women greeting each other like long-lost friends and making small talk\u2014is awaiting the arrival of Democratic Representative Donna Edwards of Maryland\u2019s Fourth District, which is centered in the Washington, D.C., suburbs of the predominantly African American Prince George\u2019s County.\n\nEdwards is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Barbara Mikulski, who, after serving 30 years, announced her retirement last March. Since Maryland is a reliably blue state (the election of Republican Larry Hogan for governor notwithstanding), the winner of the April 26 Democratic primary will likely go on to win in November. Edwards burst onto the Maryland political scene in 2008 after defeating longtime Democratic Representative Albert Wynn. That contest\u2014in which an African American woman challenged a member in good standing of the Congressional Black Caucus\u2014was notable enough. Her victory was even more so.\n\nAt the campaign event in the Chesapeake Building, a murmur persists throughout the introductory remarks from campaign surrogates, as attendees discuss Edwards\u2019s opponent and the presidential race. The chatter is replaced by cheers upon the congresswoman\u2019s arrival.\n\nDressed in a stylish suit, Edwards is small in stature but has a big presence\u2014and a populist message. \u201cWe live our lives on the ground where people work for minimum wage,\u201d she tells the crowd, \u201cand they can work 40, 60 hours in a week and still not make it to the poverty line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live our lives on the ground where you have to juggle the rent, and the mortgage,\u201d she continues. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re late picking your kid up from day care and you get charged a dollar per minute,\u201d Edwards says of the rising cost of child care and the rules that can overburden parents.\n\n\u201cIn Maryland and across the country, our average student ends up with $25,591 in student loans. Student debt restricts young people\u2019s ability to start a business,\u201d she says, \u201cor buy a house or even pay rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr forget that,\u201d she says, changing her tone. \u201cIt constrains their ability to get out of your basement.\u201d\n\nJust as Edwards terms herself a \u201ctrue-blue progressive,\u201d her opponent, Representative Chris Van Hollen, terms himself a progressive who can get things done. Van Hollen came to prominence in the 1990s as a delegate and then state senator in the Maryland General Assembly. Since he first won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002 to represent Maryland\u2019s Eighth District encompassing Montgomery County (home, probably, to more highly politicized liberal professionals than any other American suburb), Van Hollen has handily defeated his opponents in subsequent elections. He has held several leadership positions in the House, including ranking member on the House Budget Committee, and leadership positions in the Democratic Caucus.\n\nIn several ways, the Democratic primary race for Mikulski\u2019s seat mirrors the Democratic primary race for president. Hillary Clinton and Chris Van Hollen represent their party\u2019s establishment wing, while Donna Edwards and Bernie Sanders are newcomers to a larger stage who are known more for their leftist policies than for their ability to make deals. Maryland Democrats will choose between Sanders and Clinton on the same day they choose between Edwards and Van Hollen.\n\nSome of the issues of contention that have arisen between Clinton and Sanders have also surfaced in the Van Hollen\u2013Edwards race. Last April, in the midst of the battle over fast-track authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Edwards campaign criticized Van Hollen\u2019s voting record on free-trade deals. Though Van Hollen came out in opposition to the fast-track bill, the Edwards campaign called his record \u201cinconsistent.\u201d\n\nHer campaign pointed to Van Hollen\u2019s support in 2011 for trade deals with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. Edwards and the majority of Democrats in the House voted against these deals.\n\nThe race between the two candidates has been tight from the beginning, with polls showing them either neck and neck or with one candidate slightly ahead. Both candidates remain popular in their respective home districts. The real fight is in Maryland\u2019s other population center: Baltimore.\n\nDONNA EDWARDS IS A divorced single mother who raised her now-27-year-old son on her own, a facet of her life she\u2019s not afraid to relate to her politics. \u201cWe have to have a voice in the United States Senate who understands how we live our lives,\u201d she told the women who came to the Charles North event. \u201cI want you to know that there will be somebody in the United States Senate who has walked in those shoes.\u201d\n\nEdwards knows that her life story will resonate with a lot of Marylanders. She struggled at times, she says, raising her son as a single mother, and she acknowledges this is something voters may connect with. Maryland voters, she says, will step up and say, \u201cYes, they want somebody in the United States Senate who has walked in their shoes.\u201d\n\nNow that police brutality has moved to the forefront of national conversation after several high-profile incidents, including the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Edwards feels that her presence in the Senate will matter even more. \u201cIt will be critically important to have a voice like mine at the table,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people talking about us, and fixing things for us; we need to be at the table, fixing it for ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe 57-year-old Yanceyville, North Carolina, native is one of 20 black women (including the District of Columbia\u2019s non-voting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Stacey E. Plaskett of the Virgin Islands) serving in the 114th Congress. If she prevails on April 26 and goes on to win the general election in November, Edwards would become the second black woman to serve in the Senate, after Carol Moseley Braun, who served one term as senator of Illinois from 1993 to 1999.\n\nEdwards\u2019s record in Congress places her clearly on the left. Representing a predominantly African American district that bore the brunt of the foreclosure crisis in the Washington, D.C., area, she initially opposed the House version of the $700 billion bailout bill, saying it didn\u2019t do enough to help underwater homeowners. A supporter of single-payer health care who was disappointed when it was taken off the table in 2009, she authored a provision that would hold insurance companies accountable for exorbitant premium increases\u2014a provision that made it into the final text of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBefore entering electoral politics, Edwards headed several progressive organizations, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Arca Foundation, which funds a range of liberal groups. In 2006, Edwards began her first political campaign mounting a challenge to Wynn, who proved vulnerable in part because of a record that included supporting repeal of the estate tax and backing oil- and gas-industry subsidies, not to mention his desire to bring gambling to Prince George\u2019s County. Edwards narrowly lost to Wynn by 2,731 votes.\n\nBut two years later, Edwards defeated Wynn handily with 59 percent of the vote to Wynn\u2019s 37 percent. She went on to win a special election in June 2008 after Wynn resigned early.\n\nIn much the same way that Bernie Sanders has attacked Hillary Clinton, Edwards accuses Van Hollen of being part of the in-crowd. \u201cVan Hollen has been kind of an establishment go-along-to-get-along Democrat,\u201d she says. She acknowledges that their voting records are fairly similar. \u201cBut the question is, where are you going to put your energy and your resources?\u201d she says, positioning herself as a tribune for Maryland\u2019s poor and minority communities.\n\nCHRIS VAN HOLLEN IS one of the stars of the Democratic Party. Born to diplomat parents in Karachi, Pakistan, the 57-year-old legislator\u2014like Edwards, an attorney\u2014worked as a legislative staffer, then served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1990 to 1994 and the Maryland State Senate from 1994 to 2002. When he ran for Congress in 2002, Maryland\u2019s Eighth District was heavily Democratic, but represented by Republican Connie Morella\u2014who often broke with her party to vote with Democrats.\n\nThat year, Van Hollen won a competitive primary over Mark Kennedy Shriver and former Bill Clinton aide Ira Shapiro; he then went on to defeat Morella in the general election. Just three years later and after the Democrats won back control of the House, then\u2013Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2014the political arm of the House Democrats in charge of recruiting and supporting Democratic candidates. In 2010, stepping down from the DCCC, Van Hollen was elected the chair of the House Budget Committee.\n\nIn the House, Van Hollen has played a leading role in promoting campaign-finance reforms. In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision, he authored the DISCLOSE Act, which would have compelled corporations to inform shareholders of their campaign contributions, as well as forbid corporations from contributing to campaigns if they had more than 20 percent foreign ownership or were recipients of Troubled Asset Relief Program funds. In 2010, while the Democrats controlled the House and had a majority but not a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate, the bill passed the House but fell one vote short of achieving cloture in the Senate, and hence never made it to the president\u2019s desk.\n\nIn 2011, Van Hollen sued the Federal Election Commission, alleging that \u201cregulatory capture\u201d had caused it to fail to do any significant regulation of election laws. (Required by law to have three Democratic and three Republican members, the FEC has essentially been paralyzed for years.)\n\nAnother of Van Hollen\u2019s signature issues has been gun control. In 2000, while a member of the Maryland General Assembly, he successfully championed Maryland\u2019s safety trigger-lock law. Eight years later in the House, he voted against repealing portions of the Washington, D.C., firearm ban.\n\nVan Hollen pushes back on the idea that the Maryland race provides any kind of microcosm of the Democratic presidential primary. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like the presidential race,\u201d he told The American Prospect. \u201cIf you\u2019ve spoken to the Maryland progressive community, they\u2019re strongly backing me.\u201d He argues that his endorsements from progressive groups like the Sierra Club and labor unions like the Service Employees International Union, along with his agenda, validate his credentials as a progressive\u2014and not a corporate Democrat.\n\nThe difference between the two candidates isn\u2019t to be found in their admittedly similar voting records, he says, but in results. \u201cI think in Maryland, the issue isn\u2019t voting records. The issue is, who is the candidate who has been able to advance a progressive agenda? If you really want to make a difference, it\u2019s not enough to talk about these issues. You\u2019ve got to get results at the community levels.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2014by far the most widely read paper in D.C.\u2019s populous Maryland suburbs\u2014made a similar argument in endorsing Van Hollen. \u201cThe main difference is that Mr. Van Hollen\u2014pragmatic, detail-oriented, agile\u2014could be a real force for accomplishment,\u201d said the editorial board\u2019s endorsement. \u201cBy contrast, Ms. Edwards, whose many attributes do not include a gift for team play, would reinforce Congress\u2019s tendency toward stalemate along partisan lines.\u201d\n\nWhatever Edwards\u2019s skills, or lack thereof, in \u201cteam play,\u201d she hasn\u2019t been able to win the backing of a number of her African American colleagues \u2014including black Democrats from her district in Prince George\u2019s County. Among the Maryland black elected officials supporting Van Hollen is State Senator Joanne Benson, who said, \u201cWe are looking for somebody who has the fire in their belly to serve, and that\u2019s Chris Van Hollen.\u201d\n\nMore striking still is the decision of the Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee (CBC PAC) not to endorse Edwards. The 21-member board includes Wynn, whom Edwards unseated in 2008.\n\nThe PAC\u2019s decision to not endorse Edwards came on the heels of its endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president. In response, ColorOfChange, a progressive organization, sent out an email blast to its supporters calling out the CBC PAC\u2019s decision. By declining to endorse Edwards, the email said, it was ignoring her \u201chistoric bid to become only the second Black woman to be elected to the Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe elevated both the Clinton endorsement and the sitting out of the Donna Edwards endorsement, because they created confusion for people around who speaks for black people,\u201d ColorOfChange Executive Director Rashad Robinson told The American Prospect.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus PAC and the CBC Foundation have been criticized for taking large corporate donations, and some critics have made a connection between that corporate money and odd votes by some caucus members on regulatory issues favored by big business. Formal caucus endorsements in contested primaries appear to be relatively rare, though the PAC has sometimes made donations to primary contenders, including California U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nEdwards has won support from a range of feminist organizations, among them Emily\u2019s List. Despite that, she lags Van Hollen in fundraising. According to FEC filings, Van Hollen had $3.6 million in cash on hand at the end of 2015, while Edwards had only $300,000. Van Hollen claims that the majority of his monetary support comes from Maryland, while Edwards\u2019s support comes mostly from outside groups.\n\nAS THE PRIMARY approaches, the Van Hollen\u2013Edwards race is shaping up to be a conundrum for liberal voters. Sebastian Johnson, a young progressive running for the Montgomery County Board of Education, has been a Van Hollen supporter for nearly a decade. Johnson was an intern in Van Hollen\u2019s congressional district after graduating from high school in 2006. \u201cThat experience was part of what inspired me to become involved in policy and politics,\u201d he says.\n\nThe 27-year-old Takoma Park, Maryland, native currently works at a progressive tax-policy institute. \u201cVan Hollen has been great on those issues, making sure corporations are paying their fair share of taxes and that they aren\u2019t hiding their profits offshore,\u201d he says of the congressman\u2019s stance on corporate taxes.\n\nValerie Ervin, the former chair of the Montgomery County Council who briefly ran for the congressional seat being vacated by Van Hollen, endorsed Edwards last November. Ervin, who is part of the Working Families Organization, is also a steering committee member of the Maryland for Bernie Sanders campaign.\n\nEdwards\u2019s team considers both the Sanders campaign and the Clinton campaign a boon for Edwards\u2019s prospects. Clinton will turn out African American voters and women, which Edwards considers her base, while Sanders will turn out more progressive voters, also part of her base.\n\nEdwards fares much better with black voters than the senator from Vermont. A January 11\u201316 Gonzales Research and Marketing Strategies poll found that 65 percent of Maryland African Americans were supporting Edwards, compared with Van Hollen\u2019s 15 percent. The same poll showed that African Americans in the state supported Clinton over Sanders by 61 percent to 6 percent. Sanders\u2019s backing has surely risen since January, but a high Hillary turnout among black Maryland voters would almost surely benefit Edwards. In that poll, white Democrats favored Sanders over Clinton by 43 percent to 25 percent\u2014suggesting that in order to win, Van Hollen will have to do well among Sanders supporters.\n\nIn the Maryland Senate race, the generational divide isn\u2019t as clear-cut as it is in the contest between Clinton and Sanders. Van Hollen won a straw poll at the Young Democrats of Maryland convention; the candidates have split union support, like the presidential candidates; and while the CBC PAC declined to endorse Edwards, neither did it endorse Van Hollen. Polls have varied for the Maryland Senate race, but a March 4\u20138 Baltimore Sun/University of Baltimore poll showed Edwards leading Van Hollen by six points. If Edwards wins, she may well be the one candidate this year to have benefited from both Clinton\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s campaigns.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "In the state's Senate primary, an establishment progressive faces a more progressive outsider.
