She\u2019s had a couple of strong debate performances where she\u2019s tossed out good lines, she\u2019s the first woman to lead a Fortune 50 business and she\u2019s portraying herself as an \u201coutsider\u201d in a year when conservatives are justifiably sick of politicians.\n\nLet me paint a different picture of Carly Fiorina and explain why other than Jeb Bush, she\u2019s the candidate I\u2019d least like to see get the nomination. Incidentally, that is really saying something given that I own http://notjebbush.com and the only reason I haven\u2019t bothered to launch it is that Jeb has been so off-putting that watching him speak is like a commercial for \u201cNot Jeb Bush.\u201d Jeb is like the weird, annoying kid in school that no one would ever talk to if he didn\u2019t have a pool. (PS: I\u2019m leaving out Lindsey Graham here because I\u2019m not sure anyone other than his mother will vote for him and I wouldn\u2019t be entirely shocked if even she votes for Walker, Paul or Jindal instead).\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s worth noting that Fiorina may have been the first woman to lead a Fortune 50 business, but she turned out to be just as bad at it as Barack Obama has been at running the country. Despite the spin she tries to put in, Carly Fiorina was a disaster for Hewlett Packard.\n\nFiorina\u2019s story is that she stormed into HP, turned the company around and was unceremoniously fired because she challenged the status quo. In actuality, she insisted on a controversial merger with Compaq, got her way and it decimated the company. Fiorina loves to talk about HP\u2019s increase in raw numbers, but if two large computer companies merge, it\u2019s almost a given that the revenue and the number of patents produced by both companies combined are going to increase. What didn\u2019t increase was HP\u2019s stock price. It dropped from $55 a share when Fiorina took over to a little less than $20 a share under her leadership. There is a reason Fiorina shows up on lists of the Worst CEOs Of All Time (See here, here, here, and here among others) and it\u2019s not because the whole business world is engaged in some kind of conspiracy to portray her as an incompetent.\n\nLet me also add that it\u2019s not fair that Democrats will attack her for firing 30,000 workers because unfortunately, that just comes with the territory when you\u2019re a CEO sometimes. However, if you think it wouldn\u2019t be incredibly effective to point out that Fiorina fired 30,000 workers, tanked the price of the company\u2019s stock, damaged Hewlett Packard so badly that it has yet to recover and STILL walked away with 100 million dollars for being one of the worst CEOs of all time, you\u2019re kidding yourself. For all of his flaws, Mitt Romney was a gifted businessman and the Democrats managed to falsely portray him as a heartless, greedy monster for doing far less than that at Bain Capital.\n\nIf Carly Fiorina were to say that she\u2019d run America like she ran Hewlett Packard, it could be taken as a direct threat against the country. So, what else does she have to offer as a candidate?\n\nOh, right! She\u2019s supposedly a grassroots conservative outsider! Yeah, well about that\u2026.\n\nFiorina has run for office before. During the Tea Party tidal wave of 2010, there seemed to be an outside chance that Republicans might be able to knock off Barbra Boxer in California. Granted, it\u2019s California, so it was always going to be a heavy lift, but after Scott Brown had won earlier in the year in Massachusetts, it didn\u2019t seem impossible that a Republican could pull it off.\n\nSo, as we have often seen in these last few years, a conservative grassroots candidate squared off with a moderate candidate backed by the establishment. The grassroots conservative candidate was Chuck DeVore and the establishment candidate was Carly Fiorina. Almost every big name conservative except for Sarah Palin lined up behind DeVore (and I love Sarah, but if Fiorina had been a man, there\u2019s not a chance in the world she would have gotten that endorsement. That\u2019s why Sarah had to deal with a big backlash from her own fans over backing Fiorina). On the other hand, the NRSC, John McCain and Lindsey Graham were all supporting Fiorina. Interesting question: When have John McCain, Lindsey Graham and the NRSC EVER backed a conservative candidate over a moderate in a competitive race? Yes, that\u2019s right; they don\u2019t do that. Ever.\n\nAfter beating DeVore by outspending him more than 3-to1, Fiorina went toe-to-toe with charisma-free Senator Barbara Boxer and got her brains beaten in. Surprise, surprise -- Fiorina\u2019s disastrous run at Hewlett Packard turned out to be an anchor around her neck and the fact that she was such a terrible politician that she signed off on bizarre garbage like the Demon Sheep ad (IT APPEARS at 2:26) certainly didn\u2019t help. In a year when Republicans picked up 6 Senate seats, Boxer waltzed to a 10 point victory over Fiorina.\n\nSo, Fiorina\u2019s a failed CEO and it would be more accurate to call her an \u201cestablishment favorite\u201d than an outsider, but at least she\u2019s a hardcore conservative, right? Well\u2026.not so much. Here\u2019s Redstate on Carly Fiorina back in 2010.\n\nFrom her praise of Jesse Jackson, to her playing the race and gender cards against DeVore, to her support for the Wall Street bailouts, to her qualified support for the Obama stimulus, to her past support for taxation of sales on the Internet, to her waffling on immigration, to her support for Sonia Sotomayor, to her Master\u2019s thesis advocating greater federal control of local education, to her past support for weakening California\u2019s Proposition 13, to her statement to the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board that Roe v. Wade is \u201ca decided issue,\u201d Carly Fiorina\u2019s oft-repeated claim to be a \u201clifelong conservative\u201d was only plausible in the universe of NRSC staffers who recruited her in the first place.\n\n...She endorsed Federal funding of embryonic stem-cell research for \u201cextra\u201d embyros.\n\nShe endorsed the California DREAM Act, which grants in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.\n\nShe refused to endorse California\u2019s Proposition 23, which suspends the job-killing AB 32 climate-change law.\n\nFiorina also strongly supported Marco Rubio\u2019s amnesty plan that even he claims not to back anymore, endorsed cap & trade and attacked Ted Cruz for being willing to shut down the government to stop Obamacare.\n\nHow do you trust Fiorina on immigration, small government issues, taxes, pro-life issues, global warming or to even try to kill Obamacare after that?\n\nNone of this means Carly Fiorina is a bad person, a liberal, a stalking horse or anything else. If you like Carly Fiorina, support her, but at least know what you\u2019re really getting. If you\u2019re backing Carly Fiorina, you\u2019re backing a 0-1, establishment moderate who was an epic failure at the one thing that is supposed to qualify her for the presidency. On the other hand, Fiorina does seem to be pretty good at debating. Of course, if you\u2019re in the market for a charismatic candidate who\u2019s relatively moderate, Chris Christie or Mike Huckabee would seem to be a much better choice, but opinions vary.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s very difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen in a primary season as crazy as this one has been, the difference between what people THINK Fiorina is and what she ACTUALLY is, is so great that we can hazard one guess: Carly Fiorina is going to follow the 2012 pattern. People will initially get excited about her, find out what her record really looks like and then she\u2019ll quickly implode.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carly Fiorina is surging right now in the GOP Presidential primary and its easy to see why many conservatives like her.
