At this point there is no indication that anything is imminent but the law of averages says the longer you go, the more potential there is for something to happen.\u0094\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the first week of April, pacts will also expire for Suburban Transit Division bus and trolley operators, maintenance and clerical employees who work in the Victory and Frontier districts.\n\nThe Victory District (formerly Red Arrow) covers the Norristown High Speed Line and bus and trolley routes in Delaware County. The Frontier District includes Bucks and Montgomery counties.\n\nIn a March 14 proposal, SEPTA offered a five-year contract with lump sum payments of $500, but no raises, in the first and second year, followed by bumps of 1 percent, 2 percent and 3 percent in years three, four and five.\n\nIt eliminated pensions for new hires \u0097 placing them instead into tax-deferred compensation plans \u0097 and required workers to up their share of health care premiums from 1 to 2.5 percent over the life of the agreement.\n\nA post on the Local 234 website characterized the salary and benefit elements of the proposal as \u0093concessions that should make your BLOOD BOIL!!\u0094\n\n\u0093I would say the two most important issues at this point are the health care and pension,\u0094 Horowitz said. \u0093These are very hardworking people who took these jobs because they offered certain benefits, including retirement, which is something we want to maintain for the younger workers as well.\u0094\n\nBusch said the base salary for a TWU bus or trolley operator is $33,887 and top of scale is $55,620. With overtime, the average operator at top of scale makes $64,847.\n\n\u0093People tend to stay in these jobs for a long time,\u0094 Busch said, adding that it takes four years to get to top of scale. \u0093These are good jobs with good benefits.\u0094\n\nThe March 14 proposal would have covered city and suburban workers and SEPTA historically extends the same wage increases and health care contribution percentages to its non-union employees.\n\nBecause of uncertainties with future health care costs under the Affordable Care Act and who will absorb them, Horowitz said the union is willing to sign off on a two-year contract under same terms as the last agreement or submit to binding arbitration. He said SEPTA negotiators were interested in neither.\n\n\u0093We are always willing to discuss any and all of the union\u0092s proposals at the bargaining table,\u0094 Busch said.\n\nUnion officials claim SEPTA is in much better financial shape than during the 2009 negotiations, which, after a six-day strike by City Transit Division workers, produced a five-year contract that raised salaries by 11.5 percent, required workers to up their contributions to the pension fund from 1.5 to 3 percent, and did not raise health care premiums. The contract also included a $1,250 signing bonus.\n\n\u0093Ridership at SEPTA is way up and finances are far better today,\u0094 Horowitz said. \u0093We are not asking for the moon and the stars.\u0094\n\nBusch noted that passenger fares cover just 40 percent of SEPTA\u0092s operating budget. \u0093Overall, 70 percent of the expenses in the operating budget pay for labor and fringe benefits,\u0094 he said.\n\nA strike by TWU workers would not impact regional trains, whose engineers are represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. That group has been working without a contract since 2010 and presently engaged in federal mediation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Mass transit systems, Mass transit systems news, Norristown Mass transit systems news, PA Mass transit systems news, US Mass transit systems news, world Mass transit systems news.", "title": "Still no settlement between SEPTA, Transport Workers Union Local 234", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesherald.com/article/JR/20140323/NEWS/140329918", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.timesherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/timesherald.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Still no settlement between SEPTA, Transport Workers Union Local 234"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timesherald.com", "description": "With no contract proposals in more than a week and no new talks scheduled, a settlement between SEPTA and its largest union does not appear imminent.", "title": "Still no settlement between SEPTA, Transport Workers Union Local 234", "url": "http://www.timesherald.com/article/JR/20140323/NEWS/140329918", "image": {"src": "http://local.timesherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/timesherald.png?052016"}, "site": "@TimesHeraldPA", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568465234", "iphone": "id525130019", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.timesherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Mass transit systems, Mass transit systems news, Norristown Mass transit systems news, PA Mass transit systems news, US Mass transit systems news, world Mass transit systems news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "With no contract proposals in more than a week and no new talks scheduled, a settlement between SEPTA and its largest union does not appear imminent."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffb7\"", "article_summary": "\u0093I wouldn\u0092t go as far as to say it\u0092s a stalemate,\u0094 said Jamie Horowitz, spokesman for Transport Workers Union Local 234, which represents about 4,700 operators and mechanics in the city transit division.\n!\u0094\u0093I would say the two most important issues at this point are the health care and pension,\u0094 Horowitz said.\nWith no contract proposals in more than a week and no new talks scheduled, a settlement between SEPTA and its largest union does not appear imminent.\nA strike by TWU workers would not impact regional trains, whose engineers are represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen.\n\u0093These are good jobs with good benefits.\u0094The March 14 proposal would have covered city and suburban workers and SEPTA historically extends the same wage increases and health care contribution percentages to its non-union employees."}
