Uber reportedly also considered former White House press secretary Jay Carney for the job, in addition to Democratic strategist Howard Wolfson.\n\nUber CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick wrote a blog post to express his excitement at the company\u2019s decision to hire Plouffe.\n\n\u201cStarting in late September, David will be managing all global policy and political activities, communications, and Uber branding efforts,\u201d explained Kalanick. \u201cI will look to him as a strategic partner on all matters as Uber grows around the world. David\u2019s background needs little introduction. He is a proven field general and strategist who built the startup that elected a president.\u201d\n\nHe added that Plouffe will \u201c[shepherd] us well beyond the challenges of the Big Taxi cartel, and into the brave new world of software-powered transportation.\u201d\n\nPlouffe also shared a few of his own comments in the post, describing himself as \u201cthrilled\u201d to join the Uber team.\n\n\u201cAs Uber succeeds like I believe it can, it will spur the creation of hundreds of thousands of small businesses and directly create millions of jobs; deliver rapid, easy and affordable transportation alternatives to workers, parents, businesses and people out having a good time; make our roads safer, drastically cutting down on drunk and distracted driving; and give those who choose not to purchase an automobile a more viable way to live their lives day to day,\u201d wrote Plouffe.\n\nIn an interview with Re/code last May, Kalanick explained that Uber must wage a \u201cpolitical campaign\u201d to take out taxis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Pinterest where people are putting up pins,\u201d said Kalanick. \u201cYou\u2019re changing the way cities work, and that\u2019s fundamentally a third rail. We\u2019re in a political campaign, and the candidate is Uber and the opponent is an a\u2013hole named Taxi.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Ride-share company Uber has chosen Democratic political consultant and former White House senior advisor David Plouffe to fill the position of senior vice president of policy and strategy for the company.", "title": "Obama advisor David Plouffe beats out Jay Carney for Uber...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 571, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/06/david_plouffe-571x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/19/obama-advisor-david-plouffe-beats-jay-carney-uber-campaign-manager-job/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "uber-ride-share", "published_time": "2014-08-19T17:33:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-19T17:33:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ed5\"", "article_summary": "Uber reportedly also considered former White House press secretary Jay Carney for the job, in addition to Democratic strategist Howard Wolfson.\nPlouffe gained notoriety for running Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, which propelled the president to his first four years in the White House.\nUber CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick wrote a blog post to express his excitement at the company\u2019s decision to hire Plouffe.\nIn an interview with Re/code last May, Kalanick explained that Uber must wage a \u201cpolitical campaign\u201d to take out taxis.\nWe\u2019re in a political campaign, and the candidate is Uber and the opponent is an a\u2013hole named Taxi.\u201d"}
