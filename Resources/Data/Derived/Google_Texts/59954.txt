The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia said it has earned accreditation as Level 2 Accountable Care Organization by National Committee for Quality Assurance for its work in reducing costs, improving quality and improving patient experience.

The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia first earned Level 1 ACO accreditation in 2013, becoming the first children's hospital in the country to earn accreditation and among the first five organizations to be accredited nationally, according to the hospital.

The 535-bed hospital was founded in 1855.

To receive accreditation, CHOP underwent an assessment that focused on the evaluation of 14 standards and 65 elements that included ACO structure and operations; access to needed providers; patient-centered primary care; care management; care coordination and transitions; patient rights and responsibilities; and performance reporting and quality improvement, the hospital said in its statement.

Level 2 ACO accreditation requires organizations to collect and report up to 40 measures of clinical quality and cost in patient experiences.

ACOs are generally defined as provider-based entities that aim to improve the quality of health care and reduce cost growth for a group of people.
