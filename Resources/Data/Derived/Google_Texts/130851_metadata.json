Stateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.\n\nTelemedicine has been praised as a cost-effective way to link doctors and patients, enabling physicians to monitor their medical conditions and consult with specialists in a way that overcomes time and distance.\n\nBut despite a half-century of technological advances, the ready availability of interactive devices, and the full-throated encouragement of the Obama administration, advocates say telemedicine has failed to reach its full potential, due largely to policies in some states that make it difficult to practice, and pay for, such care.\n\n\u201cThe technology has opened up this huge opportunity, this game changer,\u201d said Allison Wils, director of health policy for the ERISA Industry Council, a trade association that advocates on issues related to health care for large, multistate employers. \u201cThe problem is that there are still varying levels of comfort with it across the states.\u201d\n\nSome states require that patients be accompanied by a health professional during telemedicine sessions. Hawaii, Indiana and Ohio limit Medicaid coverage to patients who live a minimum distance from their providers. (In Indiana, for example, the standard is 20 miles.) Another significant hurdle is the requirement that doctors be licensed in every state where they practice medicine, digitally or otherwise.\n\nBecause of those barriers, telemedicine advocates say, the elderly, the infirm, the isolated and the busy are being denied full access to needed health care.\n\nStates that have been slower to embrace telemedicine, including Arkansas, Rhode Island and Texas, are merely being prudent, waiting to be assured that the new technology does not diminish the quality of care patients receive, say some physician regulatory boards. \u201cThere is a concern that whatever is put in place not be dangerous,\u201d said Lisa Robin, chief advocacy officer for the Federation of State Medical Boards, which represents the state boards that license and discipline doctors.\n\nBut those pushing for a less restrictive approach to telemedicine say it is not an inferior form of medicine but a vehicle for extending quality health care to more places. And, they argue, some policies hampering the spread of telemedicine have been motivated by fear of competition among more traditional practitioners.\n\n\u201cIn some states, the issue comes down to protecting their doctors from outside competition,\u201d said Latoya Thomas, director of state health policy at the American Telemedicine Association (ATA). \u201cTheir doctors with brick-and-mortar practices assume that someone who uses telemedicine is trying to take away patients.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Telemedicine allows patients to receive medical treatment regardless of time and distance.
