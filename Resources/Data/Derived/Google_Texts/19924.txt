President Barack Obama’s appearance on “Between Two Ferns” to encourage young people to sign up for Obamacare seems to be working.

White House Senior Communications Advisor Tara McGuinness announced via Twitter Tuesday that the Funny or Die website is currently the top referrer to Healthcare.gov.

With the March 31 deadline to enroll for coverage quickly approaching, the Obama administration is making a push to reach a younger audience, whose participation is vital for the success of Obamacare. The millions of views on the "Between Two Ferns" video in less than 24 hours prove that this unconventional approach has been a success.

Of course, Obama’s comedic acumen didn’t hurt either. He exchanged quips with the bearded funnyman with ease, pointing out in one instance how Bradley Cooper, not Galifianakis, carried "The Hangover" movies.
