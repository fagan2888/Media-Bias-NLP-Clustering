Eiler, a Hia-Ced O\u2019odham, was one of the TON Legislative Representatives for the Hia-Ced District until the Hia-Ced District removed her.\n\nIn the TON Initiative Publicity Pamphlet, there are statements from Eiler and other Tribal Members for and against the Initiative. According to the pamphlet Eiler states the Hia-Ced District is only concerned with money and not supporting or helping Hia-Ced District members.\n\nEiler adds, \u201cThe 2013 Budget line items, salaries, per diem but also mileage of $51,076 and $0 for Membership Assistance. The 2014 Budget also includes an increase in the mileage to $55,500 and total of four line items of $47,000 for membership.\u201d\n\nEiler goes on to talk about an open Hia-Ced District Council meeting she attended in December 2013 and was not happy with the way the District Council members handled decisions.\n\nOn the contrary, Hia-Ced District Chairwoman, Christina Andrews feels that the INT-01-14 is personal and political.\n\n\u201cWhen will this injustice stop not only to the District by the Nation,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cAll we want to do is build homes, develop our community in terms of programs and physical infrastructure. Over the past year we are spending money and time defending the desires of our constituencies.\u201d\n\nWhen the Hia-Ced District found out about the Initiative, they launched a \u201cVOTE NO on INT-01-14 Campaign.\u201d Andrews said the district felt it was important to education TON members on both sides of the U.S./Mexico Border. The district\u2019s presentation touched on unfounded accusations of embezzlement, defining original intent, misrepresentation of dissolution, and Hia-Ced District is a viable district.\n\n\u201cWe are presenting what we feel are the issues since we were never given a presentation by Lorraine Eiler and her supporters (as to why she filed the initiative),\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe also have our attorney Verrin Kewenvoyouma assisting us in researching legal aspects.\u201d\n\nThe Hia-Ced District became the 12th district of the TON in June 2013.The Hia-Ced O\u2019odham is a band of O\u2019odham in Southern Arizona with its traditional lands stretching west to Yuma, Arizona, north to Phoenix and as south as Puerto Penasco, Mexico.\n\nThe Hia-Ced O\u2019odham meaning sand people were never recognized by the federal government and were thought to be extinct at one point. However, in the 1980s the TON did work and help the Hia-Ced O\u2019odham on varies issues like health care and college funding.\n\nIf INT-01-14 passes, the Hia-Ced District will be dissolved. All 2013, 2014 and 2015 funds whether budgeted or not will be returned for equal distribution to the 11 districts. All positions within the district will be terminated and no further payments of any kind will be made or processed whether pending or submitted.\n\nAll enrolled Hia-ced District members will transfer back to their previous district or will be able to select the district or regional area where their parents are from. Hia-ced District property, purchases and rentals will become property of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation.\n\nAll compiled information concerning the Hia-ced O\u2019odham will be entrusted to the Tohono O\u2019odham until legal standing is acquired.\n\nHia-Ced District land becomes an executive branch asset and not part of any district.\n\nResolution 16-84 under the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation will continue in legal and financial assistance to Hia-Ced matters. All Hia-Ced District Resolutions become null and void.\n\nAll confiscated documents pertaining to the Hia-Ced District financial findings will remain with the proper authorities until full adjudication is completed through tribal, state, and federal jurisdictions. And lastly, all actions will commence after the enactment of this initiative.\n\nThe 2015 TON Primary Elections will be April 25 and their General Election will be May 23.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Tohono O\u2019odham Nation may dissolve one of their districts if there are enough votes in their 2015 Primary Elections.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/24/tohono-oodham-vote-saturday-dissolving-troubled-district-160130", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/hia-ced_district_tohono_oodham_nation.png", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Tohono O\u2019odham Vote Saturday on Dissolving Troubled District"}, "abstract": "The Tohono O\u2019odham Nation may dissolve one of their districts if there are enough votes in their 2015 Primary Elections.", "dc": {"title": "Tohono O\u2019odham Vote Saturday on Dissolving Troubled District"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/24/tohono-oodham-vote-saturday-dissolving-troubled-district-160130", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Tohono O\u2019odham, Lorraine Eiler, Hia-Ced District, Christina Andrews, Tohono O\u2019odham Elections, Tribal Elections, Tribal Primary Elections, Tribal Redistricting", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-24T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Tohono O\u2019odham Vote Saturday on Dissolving Troubled District"}, "article_summary": "Eiler, a Hia-Ced O\u2019odham, was one of the TON Legislative Representatives for the Hia-Ced District until the Hia-Ced District removed her.\nAccording to the pamphlet Eiler states the Hia-Ced District is only concerned with money and not supporting or helping Hia-Ced District members.\nAll compiled information concerning the Hia-ced O\u2019odham will be entrusted to the Tohono O\u2019odham until legal standing is acquired.\nAll enrolled Hia-ced District members will transfer back to their previous district or will be able to select the district or regional area where their parents are from.\nThe Tohono O\u2019odham Nation may dissolve one of their districts if there are enough votes in their 2015 Primary Elections."}
