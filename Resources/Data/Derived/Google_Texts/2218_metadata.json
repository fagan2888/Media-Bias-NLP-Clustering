Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach.\n\nDemocrats have a 40-to-31 percent registration advantage in the district and Frankel was re-elected with 58 percent last year against Republican challenger Paul Spain.\n\nBensmihen, 46, founded Boca Home Care Services and United Elder Care Services. Born with cerebral palsy, he has been an advocate for people with disabilities.\n\nBensmihen said he doesn\u2019t believe Frankel is accessible enough to her constituents. He said his top issues are protecting seniors, spurring economic growth and supporting Israel.\n\nLike many Republican candidates, Bensmihen is critical of the Affordable Care Act, saying \u201cthe way it was implemented is not sustainable.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t join many others in the GOP in advocating repeal of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the law of the land. What we have to do is look at what works and what doesn\u2019t and we have to fix it,\u201d Bensmihen said.\n\nBensmihen has tapped Todd Richardson as his general consultant. Richardson has experience in District 22, having worked on several of former Republican state Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff\u2018s campaigns in a district that shares many voters with the congressional district.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Post On Politics", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://postonpolitics.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2015/04/23/boca-raton-businessman-joseph-bensmihen-to-run-for-lois-frankels-house-seat/", "image": "https://cmgpbppostonpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/joseph-bensmihen.jpg?w=300", "type": "article", "description": "Joseph Bensmihen of Boca Raton, a founder of home health care businesses who describes himself as a moderate Republican, says he'll open a campaign for the Palm Beach-Broward District 22 House seat held by Rep.
