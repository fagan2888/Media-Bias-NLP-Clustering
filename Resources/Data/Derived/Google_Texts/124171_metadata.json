There was a momentary pang of disappointment, because she had led after the first of two runs by the imposing margin of 1.38 seconds.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, no, I barely got away with it. But I went as hard as I could!\u2019 \u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cThen I saw the 3.\u201d\n\nAnd that was so mind-boggling, the EagleVail resident didn\u2019t know what to think.\n\nIn a result that thrilled the savvy Aspen crowd and shocked the ski world, Shiffrin\u2019s winning margin of 3.07 seconds was the largest in a women\u2019s slalom race in the history of the World Cup. The previous record of three seconds was set in 1968.\n\n\u201cI was really shocked,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason people don\u2019t win by three seconds. Stars have to line up, and it probably won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nEven for a racer who has won an Olympic gold medal, two world championships gold medals and three World Cup slalom titles before the age of 21, it was a stunning achievement. It also was the first World Cup win for an American in Aspen since Olympic downhill champion Bill Johnson won in 1984, and the first win for an American women here since Tamara McKinney claimed a giant slalom in 1981.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen a slalom won by three seconds,\u201d McKinney said in the crowd before the record was announced. \u201cThat was phenomenal. That was just beautiful and spectacular.\u201d\n\nShiffrin has always conducted herself with humility, but on this occasion it seemed as if she was humbled by the magnitude of her own accomplishment. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what to think or say. Her theory was that her huge lead after the first run made the other racers believe she could not be caught.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t see any of the other girls ski the second run, but I might have been the only person on the hill that didn\u2019t give up today,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cAfter the first run \u2026 if I was in their position I\u2019d think there\u2019s no way (to win). I shouldn\u2019t presume to think that\u2019s what they were thinking. \u2026 It\u2019s just hard mentally to do it.\n\n\u201cI attacked (the second run) as hard as I possibly could. I think there was probably a lot of luck involved, and definitely not all me. My skis were perfect, my setup was perfect, the course reports were great.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin wins Aspen World Cup slalom by record margin", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin wins Aspen World Cup slalom by record margin", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/28/mikaela-shiffrin-wins-aspen-world-cup-slalom-by-record-margin/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128_114547_mikaela-shiffrin-2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128_114547_mikaela-shiffrin-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T11:46:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T05:14:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen a slalom won by three seconds,\u201d McKinney said in the crowd before the record was announced.\n\u201cI attacked (the second run) as hard as I possibly could.\nIn a result that thrilled the savvy Aspen crowd and shocked the ski world, Shiffrin\u2019s winning margin of 3.07 seconds was the largest in a women\u2019s slalom race in the history of the World Cup.\nASPEN \u2014 First she noticed the green light on the leaderboard that indicated she had won the race, but the numbers that went with it took a while for Mikaela Shiffrin to comprehend after she made World Cup history in Saturday\u2019s slalom.\nStars have to line up, and it probably won\u2019t happen again.\u201dEven for a racer who has won an Olympic gold medal, two world championships gold medals and three World Cup slalom titles before the age of 21, it was a stunning achievement."}
