Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.).\n\nThe Florida Democrat appeared on CNN\u2018s State of the Union on Sunday, where host Candy Crowley questioned the Congresswoman about how the Affordable Care Act influenced the gubernatorial election in Virginia.\n\nRepublican Ken Cuccinelli lost by just a few points to Democrat Terry McAuliffe, an outcome that was much closer than most pundits expected. Crowley pointed out that 53 percent of Virginians said they oppose the ACA.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Obamacare specifically, Obamacare did not have anything thing to do with Tuesday\u2019s outcome,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it made the election closer?\u201d Crowley pressed.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t,\u201d the Congresswoman answered.\n\nThe host asked if Obamacare was going to hurt Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections. The Floridian responded that Americans have been experiencing the benefits of the healthcare since 2010.\n\n\u201cI think, actually Candy, that Democratic candidates will be able to run on Obamacare as an advantage, leading into the 2014 election,\u201d she closed.\n\nCrowley then pressed the Congresswoman on how many Floridians had been kicked off their health insurance plans. Wasserman Schultz tried to dodge the question, refusing to say how many people had received notifications that their plans were discontinued. She said people were just transitioning to new plans, calling it a \u201cdistortion\u201d that people were being kicked off their insurance.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Obamacare is going to be an asset for Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections, according to Rep.
