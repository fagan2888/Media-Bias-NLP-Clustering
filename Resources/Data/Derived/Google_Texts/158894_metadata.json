Abduljaleel Alarbash was killed trying to stop a suicide bomber in Saudi Arabia last May.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, he was recognized at a commencement ceremony with a posthumous diploma. Wichita State faculty felt it was important to honor him with one as a sign of gratitude for his sacrifice.\n\nFor his closest friends this ceremony comes with mixed emotions.\n\n\"Because of what he had done for the people, for our community,\" said Alarbash's best friend Abrahim Alhamadah. \"That's so brave of him. He should have that. A person like him, no one has done like him.\"\n\nIn late may, Alarbash and another man were volunteering as security guards at a mosque in Saudi Arabia when they were killed preventing a suicide bomber from entering where dozens were praying.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" said Alarbash's college roommate Mustafa Alsalamah. \"I was sad about what I have heard about his murder, but at the same time, I feel happy and am proud of him because he died as a hero.\"\n\nThose who knew him best say they always had a sense of his selflessness.\n\n\"I'm not surprised what he did, if someone's going to do it, he's the one,\" said Alhamadah.\n\nWhile his diploma reads electrical engineering degree, his best friend on campus says it symbolizes his heroism.\n\n\"He will be remembered in our heart for sure and we will not forget him as long as we are alive,\" said Alhamadah. \"We will pass this to our children and our children will have to pass it to their children.\"\n\nOn Friday, Wichita State dedicated a plaque and student lounge in Alarbash's honor.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Wichita State University continues to honor an international student for his heroic actions that likely saved many lives.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Wichita State University continues to honor an international student for his heroic actions that likely saved many lives.", "title": "WSU student given honorary degree after heroic death", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/-WSU-student-given-honorary-degree-after-heroic-death-361747031.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0E7/3FB/0E73FB5B1D40494799D72542578FF5CB", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D7A/FA5/D7AFA5AC26D24ED0A868A91C1C555427.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Wichita State University continues to honor an international student for his heroic actions that likely saved many lives.", "title": "WSU student given honorary degree after heroic death", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/-WSU-student-given-honorary-degree-after-heroic-death-361747031.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/abduljaleel-alarbash.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "WSU student given honorary degree after heroic death", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "WSU student given honorary degree"}, "article_summary": "\"Because of what he had done for the people, for our community,\" said Alarbash's best friend Abrahim Alhamadah.\nOn Friday, Wichita State dedicated a plaque and student lounge in Alarbash's honor.\nAbduljaleel Alarbash - Facebook photoWichita State University continues to honor an international student for his heroic actions that likely saved many lives.\nWichita State faculty felt it was important to honor him with one as a sign of gratitude for his sacrifice.\nAbduljaleel Alarbash was killed trying to stop a suicide bomber in Saudi Arabia last May."}
