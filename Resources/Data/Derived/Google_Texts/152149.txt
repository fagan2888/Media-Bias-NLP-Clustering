AIR FORCE ACADEMY — Wyoming quarterback Brett Smith took his turn reaching into Air Force’s candy store defense and came away with enough goodies to last the late night ride back home to Laramie.

When it was over Smith had 511 yards of total offense, 138 yards rushing, four touchdowns passing and one rushing to spearhead a 56-23 thrashing of the Falcons Saturday night with 35,389 fans in Falcon Stadium. Jaleel Awini countered Smith with 89 yards passing and 68 yards on the ground with one rushing touchdown.

The game started at 8:15 p.m. to accommodate a national television audience. The game ended well past 11:30 p.m. mountain standard time.

The 56 points were the most ever scored by a winner in the 52 game series between Air Force and Wyoming.

The loss dropped Air Force (1-3, 0-3 MW) two losses in its first three Mountain West games for only the second time since the conference was formed in 1999.

In the previous two conference games, Utah State quarterback Chuckie Keeton thrashed the Falcons for 437 yards of total offense and five passing touchdowns. The Boise State’s Joe Southwick accounted for 340 yards of total offense and a passing and rushing touchdown. Utah State won 52-20 and Boise State won 42-20.

But this may have been the bitterest defeat of all because of the intense rivalry between the Cowboys and Falcons. After the Falcons won 28-27 last year in Laramie, Wyoming coach Dave Christensen aimed inflammatory comments at Air Force coach Troy Calhoun.

There was no need for any bluster in this one. The Cowboys (3-1, 1-0 MW) did all the necessary talking on the field. They weathered Air Force’s early success and then piled on the points.

With the Falcons ahead 10-7 on Will Conant’s 33-yard field goal with 8:50 left in the first, the momentum turned on a defensive play by the Cowboys.

Calhoun elected to gamble on fourth down and one at the Wyoming 34-yard line with 4:40 left in the opening 15 minutes.

But Wyoming defensive end Eddie Yarbrough stopped running back Anthony LaCoste short of the first down.

Smith’s 61-yard touchdown pass to Dominic Rufran, out of Colorado Springs, followed two plays later and the Cowboys were off to the races.

The Cowboys outscored the Falcon 28-7 the rest of the half.

Smith took the Cowboys on an 83-yard scoring march early in the third quarter, running back Shaun collecting the final three yards for a 32-point lead.
