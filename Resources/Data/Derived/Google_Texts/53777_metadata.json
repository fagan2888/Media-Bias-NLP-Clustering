Jordan Buckley, also was shot and was in stable condition, alert and conscious, Indiana State Police said.

No one answered officers' knocks at the door.\n\n\"They got inside the residence, and they were met with gunfire,\" Rogers said. \"As police officers we anticipate things like that, but it comes as a total surprise to us.\n\n\"We plan for it, but you're never fully prepared, of course, for that situation,\" he said.\n\nThe sheriff said he could not recall another death in the line of duty during his 46 years with the Howard County department. Koontz had been a deputy for less than three years, and had a wife and a child about 8 months old.\n\n\"He was an outstanding officer, he had great promise with our agency, and he's going to be greatly missed,\" Rogers said.\n\nRogers said that officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect, but he didn't know which officers did so and it wasn't clear how many were inside the mobile home during the gunfight.\n\nAfter removing neighboring residents from their homes and trying to contact the suspected shooter for two hours, SWAT officers found a person dead inside the mobile home, Rogers said.
