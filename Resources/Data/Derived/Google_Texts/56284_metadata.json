The VA just let him go.\u201d\n\nWilson\u2019s family links his death to the center\u2019s embattled gastrointestinal program.\n\nHospital administrators admitted this week that it botched the clinic so badly that consultations were delayed unnecessarily for 5,100 veterans between 2011 and November 2012.\n\nThe medical center\u2019s executive office has put the death toll at three cancer patients, but Wilson\u2019s family and one former employee said the issue dates back eight years and might include more deaths, possibly connected to the administration of former Director Rebecca Wiley.\n\nAccording to a 2012 report from the VA Inspector Gen\u00ader\u00adal\u2019s Office, Wiley, whose tenure in Augusta lasted from 2007 to 2010, is responsible for nearly 90 percent of the medical center\u2019s unresolved consults, along with the hospital\u2019s loss of full accreditation three years ago.\n\nThe ongoing investigation found that mismanagement during some of Wiley\u2019s time in Columbia, which began in Novem\u00adber 2011, contributed to a backlog of nearly 4,000 gastrointestinal appointment delays, which in turn led to 19 instances of serious injury and six patient deaths.\n\nHospital spokesman Pete Sco\u00advill said Friday that Nor\u00adwood officials have provided information on how to file a lawsuit to seven families in an effort to take responsibility for four serious injuries and three deaths.\n\nCiting patient confidentiality, Scovill would not say whether Wilson\u2019s death is one of the three, but he said the hospital has reached out to the family and is working with them the best it can, possibly to help it collect damages.\n\nHartmann said she has kept all her father\u2019s medical records and her family is speaking with an attorney.\n\nThey said they\u2019ve been told they have a strong case.\n\n\u201cI want them to pay or at least personally apologize for the pain they caused my families and others,\u201d said Kelly Alsuhaim, Wilson\u2019s granddaughter.\n\nHartmann believes her father could have been saved \u2013 or at least been in a lot less pain before his death \u2013 had the VA listened.\n\nStarting in 2010, her father, a non-diabetic, reported elevated liver enzymes and glucose levels that were not high enough for his pancreas to make insulin. Hartmann said her father\u2019s doctor scheduled many appointments at Charlie Norwood for exploratory testing, such as an endoscopy.\n\nEach time the sessions were pushed back and Wil\u00adson was sent home, his pain written off as a product of old age, ulcers, minor gastric problems, lung infection. At one point, the hospital told him it was \u201call in his head,\u201d a byproduct of depression after the death of his wife.\n\n\u201cThey told him to modify his diet, but what really was happening is his bile ducts were being blocked and his pancreas was shutting down,\u201d Hartmann said.\n\nCatherine McAdams, a 28-year operating room nurse at Charlie Norwood who left the hospital\u2019s infection control unit in October 2008, said that under Wiley, it was not uncommon for administrators to turn a blind eye to gastrointestinal patients.\n\nShe believes there might be more deaths related to colonoscopies and incompetent care.\n\nIn June 2005, McAdams went full time as a staff nurse at the medical center\u2019s spinal cord injury unit. During her first week, while shadowing a wound care specialist, she tended to a veteran who had a procedureto reroute his bowels for better bladder control. McAdams and the specialist discovered that two-thirds of the patient\u2019s colon had died, and his vital signs were fading.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d McAdams said. The veteran spent three weeks in intensive care and eventually died. \u201cThey let him sit for seven days on the spinal cord injury unit, writhing in pain.\u201d\n\nShe said she knows of at least four deaths linked to surgeons using leaky feeding tubes or improperly sterilized endoscopes to operate on Army veterans from the Korean and Vietnam wars, some of whom ranked as high as captain.\n\nMcAdams said she reported the incidents in 2008 to the VA. She said she wished she had done so sooner.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand the culture of the VA under Wiley,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was intimidating and retaliatory.\u201d\n\nMcAdams said she plans to contact the House Commit\u00adtee on Veterans Affairs to help with Congress\u2019 investigation into gastrointestinal mismanagement in Augusta and Columbia.\n\nIn September, the committee requested copies of all current accounts of appointment backlogs and patient injuries. It also asked for any records reflecting performance reviews, pay bonuses and disciplinary actions issued since 2002 to those who oversee patient safety in Augusta.\n\nCharlie Norwood officials said they have complied with the request and have added resources and made personnel changes to the hospital\u2019s gastrointestinal program to reduce the backlog to 540 unresolved screenings.\n\nScovill said the hospital takes all complaints seriously and invites all veterans to call its patient advocate director, Donna Ingram, at (706) 733-0188 if they feel they are owed compensation or in need of further assistance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re better off working within our system and giving us a second try to make it right,\u201d Scovill said. \u201cAfter that, they can file an appeal and take it to court.\u201d\n\nHartmann said the VA is out of chances, as far as she is concerned.\n\n\u201cI have been trying to get somebody to listen to me for three years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut nobody would.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Latest News, Wesley Brown", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Alvin Wilson's family links his death to the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center's embattled gastrointestinal program.", "title": "Veteran's family blames delayed care at Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center for death", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2013-11-23/veterans-family-blames-delayed-care-charlie-norwood-va-medical-center-death", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/12842076.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4d9a\"", "article_summary": "The VA just let him go.\u201dWilson\u2019s family links his death to the center\u2019s embattled gastrointestinal program.\nHartmann said she has kept all her father\u2019s medical records and her family is speaking with an attorney.\nHospital administrators admitted this week that it botched the clinic so badly that consultations were delayed unnecessarily for 5,100 veterans between 2011 and November 2012.\nHartmann believes her father could have been saved \u2013 or at least been in a lot less pain before his death \u2013 had the VA listened.\nMcAdams said she reported the incidents in 2008 to the VA.
