(AP) - Prosecutors are trying to block defense allegations of juror misconduct in a capital murder trial that ended with a north Alabama man convicted and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nAttorneys for Joel Moyers recently filed a sworn statement from a holdout juror in Moyers\u2019 trial, alleging members improperly deliberated outside the jury room. The juror, Patrick Scott Gilliam, said he felt pressured to vote for guilt.\n\nBut in court documents, Limestone County prosecutors said the defense was wrongly delving into deliberations and asked a judge to disregard the claims.\n\nA judge considering whether to throw out defense subpoenas seeking testimony from jurors heard arguments Wednesday but didn\u2019t immediately issue any ruling.\n\nMoyers was convicted in May of fatally shooting Brandon Hydrick, 26, in 2012. Hydrick, who was a passenger in a pickup truck driven by his brother, died after being hit with a slug from a rifle fired along a rural road.\n\nMoyers, 55, of Cullman said he didn\u2019t mean to kill Hydrick. He is currently serving his sentence at Kilby prison near Montgomery.\n\nAttorneys for Moyers asked Circuit Judge James Woodruff earlier this month to order a new trial, citing claims by Gilliam that some jury members improperly discussed the case during a lunch break after testimony had concluded.\n\nIn a court document, Gilliam described himself as the only juror who opposed a capital murder conviction. He said five other jurors, during a lunch break at a Zaxby\u2019s restaurant, discussed ways to make him change his mind, which he eventually did \u201cunder pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fought for 8\u00bd hours all by myself and in the end I felt pressured to cast a guilty vote for capital murder,\u201d said Gilliam. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the defendant ever intended to kill that boy and I feel to this day that the state failed to prove that he intended to kill that boy.\u201d\n\nThe defense also argued that many jurors didn\u2019t conclude that Moyers intended to kill Hydrick, a key element in capital murder.\n\nProsecutors asked the judge to strike Gilliam\u2019s statement from the record, arguing that the defense failed to show there was an \u201cextraneous influence\u201d on deliberations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prosecutors are trying to block defense allegations of juror misconduct in a capital murder trial that ended with a north Alabama man convicted and sentenced to life without parole.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/26/juror-misconduct-alleged-in-alabama-murder-trial/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Prosecutors are trying to block defense allegations of juror misconduct in a capital murder trial that ended with a north Alabama man convicted and sentenced to life without parole.", "title": "Juror misconduct alleged in Alabama capital murder trial"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Prosecutors are trying to block defense allegations of juror misconduct in a capital murder trial that ended with a north Alabama man convicted and sentenced to life without parole.", "card": "summary", "title": "Juror misconduct alleged in Alabama capital murder trial"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "ATHENS, Ala.
