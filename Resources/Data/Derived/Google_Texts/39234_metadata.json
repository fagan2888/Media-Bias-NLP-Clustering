A presentation was delivered by various medical entities, including DDH.\n\nAccording to Vickie Newsome, CEO for DDH, the hospital still is preparing to reopen, pending a necessary board meeting in the coming days to address \u201cgeneral housekeeping\u201d issues.\n\nNewsome stated that there are approximately 35 people on the staff currently and that additional hiring will take place before the center opens for business again. DDH also will replace equipment and perform maintenance before reopening.\n\n\u201cHopefully, by late April, we will be back to being a fully-functioning, four-bed acute facility in your community,\u201d said Newsome. \u201cThe facility is ready to go and we are very excited.\u201d\n\nEDC President Willie Carter spoke on the purpose of the newly-developed task force, saying that it had been created to serve as the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the community.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we get quality medical care for our community,\u201d said Carter.\n\nA presentation was also given by Ken McCormack of the Patients/Physicians Cooperatives, in which he described a different type of facility he considers to be ideal for the Cleveland community.\n\nMcCormack explained hi9s vision of a facility that would attract specialists in various medicals fields and one that would be well-equipped to handle more intensive procedures than local health care centers of the past.\n\nHe indicated that attracting specialists is necessary, should the Cleveland community expect to have a successful venture into health care.\n\nMcCormack, who has been a resident of Liberty County for the past 42 years, presented members of the EDC with statistics demonstrating what is needed for a medical entity to be a success.\n\n\u201cIt is my desire to see that we have the highest quality medical care we can get in this community,\u201d said McCormack. \u201cSo far, you haven\u2019t gotten enough business from the community to sustain the two hospitals that were here and we want to change that. When the hospitals fail, it is because the money is not being spent here.\u201d\n\nAccording to McCormack, his opinion indicates that much of the failure of past health care entities within the community is directly due to a lack of community support.\n\nMembers of the EDC, as well as some audience members, cited that lack of community support was not necessarily the issue, stating opinions alluding to a poor level of service at Cleveland-area medical centers in the past and pointing out that many residents lost faith in local medical care and are instead opting to seek care elsewhere.\n\nMayor Niki Coats took to the podium to inform audience members of a recent meeting in which he learned that there is a possibility that St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center could build a healthcare facility in Cleveland.\n\nThe new location, if built in Cleveland, would be under The Woodlands branch of the St. Luke\u2019s medical care unit. The company is considering moving forward with plans for a free-standing emergency health center.\n\nThe reopening of Doctors Diagnostic is not expected to impact the decision made by St. Luke\u2019s representatives, who are looking to schedule a group meeting with the hospital task force members.\n\n\u201cWillie and I both expressed our need for this meeting as soon as possible,\u201d said Coats. \u201cWe expressed our need to move quickly.\u201d\n\nOnce a decision is made by the organization, St. Luke\u2019s representatives could begin looking at real estate in the Cleveland area.\n\n\u201cIt is my understanding that they are very close to making a decision,\u201d said Carter. \u201cWe are in desperate need of medical facilities in this community, We are working as hard as we can to get some sort of free-standing medical facility in this community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourclevelandnews.com", "description": "On the heels of Cleveland Regional Medical Center and Doctors Diagnostic Hospital (DDH) closing their doors in Cleveland, a task force was assembled by the city to investigate the options the city could pursue to return a medical facility to the area.", "title": "Hospital task force looking to bring in Cleveland-area medical facility", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/cleveland/news/hospital-task-force-looking-to-bring-in-cleveland-area-medical/article_5e836c35-6a7f-5a94-95c4-e1d9ee915bed.html", "image": {"width": 1100, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/e3/6e38f506-2a43-517d-9e9b-e09b54933c52/54de35c4bc73f.image.jpg?resize=1100%2C571", "height": 571}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "description": "On the heels of Cleveland Regional Medical Center and Doctors Diagnostic Hospital (DDH) closing their doors in Cleveland, a task force was assembled by the city to investigate the options the city could pursue to return a medical facility to the area.", "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "The new location, if built in Cleveland, would be under The Woodlands branch of the St. Luke\u2019s medical care unit.\n\u201cWe are in desperate need of medical facilities in this community, We are working as hard as we can to get some sort of free-standing medical facility in this community.\u201d\nOn the heels of Cleveland Regional Medical Center and Doctors Diagnostic Hospital (DDH) closing their doors in Cleveland, a task force was assembled by the city to investigate the options the city could pursue to return a medical facility to the area.\n\u201cIt is my desire to see that we have the highest quality medical care we can get in this community,\u201d said McCormack.\n\u201cWe want to make sure we get quality medical care for our community,\u201d said Carter."}
