We have a very unique area in which we exist.\u201d\n\nThe new institute will help satisfy the research requirements of the college\u2019s accrediting institution, the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, Burrell said.\n\nThe private, for-profit Burrell College will fund the institute \u2014 set up as a 501(c)3 nonprofit \u2014 at about $500,000 annually for the first five years. The institute will also be eligible receive grant funding, he said.\n\n\u201cPart of what the institute will be doing is hosting a series of conferences that bring together thought leaders from around the nation, region and the world to talk about disease surveillance, the emergence of new diseases and addressing the complicated health needs of under served populations in a time of changing health care,\u201d said George Mychaskiw, founding dean and chief academic officer of the Burrell College.\n\nMychaskiw described the border region as a \u201cbellwether of coming challenges to health care\u201d due to the diversity of the population, the number of immigrants and poverty issues.\n\nMyrna Deckert is chief executive of an El Paso, Texas-based organization on a similar mission: the Paso del Norte Health Foundation, whose aim is to promote health and prevent disease in the border region through education, research and advocacy.\n\nShe expects Paso del Norte will have a \u201ccollaborative\u201d relationship with the Burrell institute.\n\n\u201cWe are very much in favor of what they are doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it hurts anybody to do more research than what is being done.\u201d\n\nDeckert said more data is needed regionwide, especially \u201cbroader population data, not just clinical data,\u201d and data from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the industrial city just over the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cI would like to see (the institute) make recommendations, review best-practice programs around the country and see what could be implemented around here,\u201d she said.\n\nThe $85 million Burrell College is being built on seven acres of land leased from New Mexico State University. A three-pronged agreement with the university also gives students access to NMSU housing, services and activities and includes an annual \u201cbrand-sharing\u201d payment that will rise over four years to $500,000 annually.\n\nMychaskiw said the college recently accepted 162 students into its first class, which begins in August.\n\nBurrell said the institute will serve as \u201ca resource and educational tool to provide valuable data around policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we could become an incredibly valuable resource when policy is being considered,\u201d he said, \u201cand weigh in in a fact-oriented, nonpartisan way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The planned Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine in Las Cruces will have a health policy institute with a special focus on the U.S.-Mexico border.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Lauren Villagran | Journal Staff Writer - Las Cruces Bureau", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/706140/new-med-school-to-offer-focus-on-border-health.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_11oct_burrell4.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "The planned Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine in Las Cruces will have a health policy institute with a special focus on the U.S.-Mexico border.", "title": "New med school to offer focus on border health"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d4c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt will be very focused on efficacy around health care delivery systems, transnational and border health.\n.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........LAS CRUCES \u2014 The new Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine will have an additional component when school starts this fall: a health policy institute with a special focus on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any health policy institute that is specifically focused on New Mexico, the cross-border region,\u201d Burrell said.\nMychaskiw described the border region as a \u201cbellwether of coming challenges to health care\u201d due to the diversity of the population, the number of immigrants and poverty issues.\nThe $85 million Burrell College is being built on seven acres of land leased from New Mexico State University."}
