Singh, a Sikh soldier who had been previously forced to shave his hair and beard, will be able to grow and publicly display both during the month-long trial period.\n\n\u201cIt is wonderful. I had been living a double life, wearing a turban only at home,\u201d Singh, 27, told the New York Times. \u201cMy two worlds have finally come back together.\u201d\n\nI had been living a double life, wearing a turban only at home. My two worlds have finally come back together.\n\nThe Army will decide at the end of the test period \u2014 January 8 \u2014 whether or not to make Singh\u2019s exception permanent. Until then, officials instructed him to keep his beard, turban, and uncut hair worn \u201cin a neat and tidy manner that presents a professional and well-groomed appearance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bulk of your hair, beard, or turban may not be such that it impairs your ability to wear the Kevlar helmet or other protective equipment or impedes your ability to operate your assigned weapon, military equipment, or machinery,\u201d the letter, signed by Assistant Secretary of the Army Debra Wada, read.\n\nThe news marks the first time in 10 years the military has allowed an active-duty solider to grow a beard. The Army has previously allowed Sikh doctors to grow beards and wear turbans, things that are seen as key expressions of faith by most Sikh men. But even those exceptions were evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with the understanding that a transfer to a combat unit or even another command would require another waiver of exception. An ROTC enlistee was also allowed to grow his beard and wear a turban earlier this year, but only after a federal court reversed the ROTC\u2019s decision to deny his request for a uniform exemption.\n\nBut while the ROTC enlistee was represented by Sikhs United and the left-leaning group American Civil Liberties Union, the new accommodation for Captain Singh blurs traditional tribal lines separating American progressivism and conservatism; his case was similarly spearheaded by the Sikh Coalition, but was also aided by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal group known primarily for aiding right-wing Christian causes. Their lawyers were the core legal force behind the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014, when the evangelical Christian owners of the craft store giant won a religious exemption to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. Despite praise from conservative Christians, the ruling arguably damaged historic definitions of religious liberty, and the Becket Fund has since filed cases designed to dismantle LGBT rights, promote public funding for religious schools, and defend prayer at government functions.\n\nNevertheless, that group\u2019s purported mission to \u201cprotect the free expression of all faiths\u201d appeared to be made manifest this week when the decision was made public.\n\n\u201cAnyone who observed our unshaven special forces in Afghanistan knows a beard won\u2019t stop an American soldier,\u201d Eric Baxter, Senior Counsel at the Becket Fund, said in a press release. \u201cNow the Pentagon just needs to make Captain Singh\u2019s exemption permanent. In fact, it should explain why it is using the beard ban to discriminate against any Sikh American.\u201d\n\nThe Sikh Coalition also celebrated the short-term victory, but insisted the Army make the change a lasting one.\n\n\u201cPermanent accommodation of Captain Singh will open the door for other Sikhs who are seeking an accommodation,\u201d Amandeep Sidhu, a partner with the Sikh Coalition-affiliated McDermott Will & Emery LLP, said in a statement. \u201cThe writing on the wall is clear \u2014 Captain Singh\u2019s accommodation should be made permanent and the time is now for a comprehensive policy change.\u201d\n\nThis post was updated to include the Sikh Coalition\u2019s involvement in the case.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"I had been living a double life, wearing a turban only at home.
