And, D.C. government officials have been quick to claim that its $0.05 tax on plastic bags has resulted in a 60 percent reduction in plastic bag use. The city even spent money to commission a survey to tell them that. But the survey had its faults, according to an examination of revenue by The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cOne issue with the city\u2019s recent survey is that it relied on poll respondents to estimate the number of bags they used or gave to customers before the tax went into effect, which could cause some to overestimate the actual change in their behavior and create an unreliable baseline for pre-tax bag use,\" the paper reported last week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe question is how wide of an overestimation it was. Well, the answer is, the whole thing. The Post found that the tax had no impact on consumer choices \u2013 except to redistribute money from consumers\u2019 pockets to government coffers.\n\n\u201cCity revenue figures, meanwhile, show no continuing decrease in the use of disposable bags. In fact, bag tax collections have proven remarkably stable since the nickel-per-bag fee debuted in January 2010,\" the report added.\n\nAt the time the tax was imposed, D.C. estimated that they would collect $1.05 million in revenues in 2013. The actual haul \u2013 more than $2 million. Year-over-year, revenues even increased\u2026 by the equivalent of 200,000 bags.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect the proponents of the tax to throw in the towel. Brian Van Wye, who works at the D.C. Environmental Department, still denies that the tax is meant to bloat the government\u2019s balance sheet, insisting that the \u201cobjective is to change behavior.\u201d\n\nUsing that logic, the next step may be for D.C. to double down. After all, if a $0.05 tax isn\u2019t working, perhaps they can increase the per bag fee to $0.10 or $0.25. Since tax-and-spend liberals don\u2019t think their logic is to blame, they have one recourse to this failing policy \u2013 more taxes.\n\nBut this case study is the perfect example that exposes the government\u2019s flawed logic and its broad, bold-faced lie. Taxes should not be used as a method of impacting consumer behavior; it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nYet the claim is widespread, from the plastic bag tax to taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline. The government claims that the taxes are for consumers\u2019 own good, but these taxes are just creative ways for the government to get more from our pockets. And these taxes disproportionately hurt the lower income sectors of society. In essence the government is trying to balance their budgets on the backs of the poor rather than cutting spending in smart ways.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve caught the government in a lie. But unfortunately it\u2019s too late \u2013 the plastic bag tax in D.C. is likely there to stay. That\u2019s because taxes have their own inertia. A tax on the books, typically stays on the books. Consumers become used to the tax and opponents dwindle. Then, the government gets used to the revenue and looks for other areas to tax. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nPerhaps, though, D.C.\u2019s experience can teach other states and municipalities to call politicians out on their lies before they push their taxes on the public.\n\nWilliams is president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Taxes should not be used as a method of impacting consumer behavior; it doesn\u2019t work.", "description": "Taxes should not be used as a method of impacting consumer behavior; it doesn\u2019t work.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Taxes should not be used as a method of impacting consumer behavior; it doesn\u2019t work.", "title": "DC's plastic bag tax exposed", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/195273-dcs-plastic-bag-tax-exposed-as-fraud", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:40-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/195273-dcs-plastic-bag-tax-exposed-as-fraud", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-13T16:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "David Williams", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-13T16:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/195273-dcs-plastic-bag-tax-exposed-as-fraud", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Taxes should not be used as a method of impacting consumer behavior; it doesn\u2019t work.", "card": "summary", "title": "DC's plastic bag tax exposed"}, "dcterms.title": "DC's plastic bag tax exposed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd48a0\"", "article_summary": "Yet the claim is widespread, from the plastic bag tax to taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline.\nBut unfortunately it\u2019s too late \u2013 the plastic bag tax in D.C. is likely there to stay.\nIn fact, bag tax collections have proven remarkably stable since the nickel-per-bag fee debuted in January 2010,\" the report added.\nFour years ago, Washington, D.C. imposed a $.05 plastic bag tax.\nAnd, D.C. government officials have been quick to claim that its $0.05 tax on plastic bags has resulted in a 60 percent reduction in plastic bag use."}
