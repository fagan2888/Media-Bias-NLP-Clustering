There were two outstanding warrants for Lopez\u2019s arrest, one was for felony menacing and the other for possession of a concealed weapon.\n\nOfficers arrived at the home and confirmed that Lopez was inside.\n\n\u201cThe man has a history of being armed and dangerous,\u201d said Chris Amsler, Aurora police spokesman. \u201cWe set up a perimeter and called SWAT.\u201d\n\nOnce police set up a perimeter around the home, they used a loud speaker to command everyone inside the house to come out. Everyone but Lopez followed the command.\n\nA \u201cless lethal foam projectile\u201d was shot through the window in the house, but Lopez did not come out, according to the news release.\n\nSWAT officers arrived at the home around 11 a.m. and negotiators were able to call Lopez on the phone. Lopez repeatedly told officers he was not inside the house and hung up on them.\n\nHe did not pick up the phone again.\n\nInvestigators obtained a search warrant around 4:30 p.m., before officers shot tear gas into the house. A few minutes later, Lopez \u2014 who had been hiding in the crawl space \u2014 walked out of the house.\n\nLopez was placed taken into custody and booked into the Aurora Detention Center.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Suspect surrenders in Aurora after day-long SWAT standoff", "title": "Suspect surrenders in Aurora after day-long SWAT standoff", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/08/suspect-surrenders-in-aurora-after-day-long-swat-standoff/", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141108__16722_825124884199089_4207838979040424919_np1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141108__16722_825124884199089_4207838979040424919_np1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-08T12:38:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:02:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A wanted fugitive known for carrying weapons barricaded himself inside an Aurora home for more than seven hours on Saturday.\nInvestigators obtained a search warrant around 4:30 p.m., before officers shot tear gas into the house.\nSWAT officers arrived at the home around 11 a.m. and negotiators were able to call Lopez on the phone.\nAround 9 a.m., Aurora police received a tip that Mario Thomas Lopez, 35, was staying at a home located at 1373 Florence Street.\nLopez repeatedly told officers he was not inside the house and hung up on them."}
