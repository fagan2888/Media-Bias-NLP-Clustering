First, the good parts: Walken made for a delightfully debonair Hook, Allison Williams hit the notes she wanted to hit at least 80 percent of the time, and no one fell out of their harnesses during \u201cI\u2019m Flying.\u201d Overall, if we compared live NBC musicals to Britney Spears albums, and last year\u2019s dismal Sound of Music Live! was a Britney Jean-level flop, than Peter Pan Live! was about on par with In the Zone.\n\nThat said, we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t point out thatPeter Pan Live! had some major issues. As a lifelong diehard musical theater fan who played Captain Hook in her fifth-grade school production (seriously, see photo), I feel uniquely qualified to point out all of them. Below, we list seven ways NBC could\u2019ve made Peter Pan Live!better\u2014and what the network can do next time to pull off a Britney-sized hit.\n\n1) Cast someone who can actually pull off the role of Peter Pan.\n\nI\u2019ve gone on record in this publication saying I\u2019m not a huge fan of Allison Williams, nor am I a fan of Marnie Michaels, the simpering millennial she plays on Girls.When NBC announced earlier this year that Williams would be playing Peter Pan, I was skeptical that she\u2019d be able to pull it off: Mary Martin\u2019s performance in the 1960 televised production are some big tights to fill, and while Williams has a nice mezzo-soprano voice, it\u2019s far too reedy and thin to match up to Martin\u2019s trademark belt.\n\nAs it turned out, I was (about 75 percent) right: While Williams certainly didn\u2019t hit her notes with the same aplomb that Martin did in the 1960 televised version, at least she could hit them, which you couldn\u2019t say for poor Christopher Walken. (Anyone else catch that squeaky fart thing his voice did at the end of his tarantella?) And she certainly looked great in her steampunk-meets-American Apparel Neverland costume.\n\nThe problem was that Williams simply doesn\u2019t have the charisma to pull off the Boy Who Never Grew Up. She looked nice, and sounded nice, but as the A.V. Club\u2019s Caroline Siede put it, \u201cWilliams feels like the girl who got every lead role in high school but couldn\u2019t quite compete with stronger performers in college. She\u2019s not bad, but she lacks the right impulsive, impish energy for Peter Pan.\u201d Someone with more firecracker energy, like an Anna Kendrick or an Ellen Page, would\u2019ve made for a much stronger Peter.\n\n2) Replace your costume designer.\n\nIf you started watching Peter Pan during the Native American musical numbers (more on that later), and you had the sound off, you probably would\u2019ve thought you were watching a Navajo-themed Ariana Grandemusic video. (I, for one, have never seen Native peoples pull off crop tops and sparkly hot pants.) Same goes for if you started tuning into a Lost Boys-centric number, in which case you likely would\u2019ve thought you were watching a gay softcore porn set in a British boarding school. At no point did the costumes reflect the actual setting of Peter Pan, which is supposed to be early 20th century Victorian England.\n\nWhile that\u2019s fine in itself, at least aim for some consistency so you don\u2019t distract me with the Lost Boys\u2019 prep-school boy shorts and give me the lady equivalent of a tent in my pants.\n\n3) Don\u2019t make everyone try a British accent.\n\nMost everyone in the cast at least attempted a British accent last night, and while no one came close to pulling a Van Dyke, it\u2019s fair to say that some of the linguistic efforts were noticeably better than others. Case in point: Williams pronouncing \u201cgirls\u201d as \u201cgulls,\u201d which I can only imagine was part of some bizarre cross-promotional deal between her own TV show on HBO and a seabird advocacy organization.\n\n4) Replace or cut out the \u201cUgg-A-Wugg/True Blood Brothers\u201d number.\n\nWhen NBC announced it would be staging Peter Panearlier this year, the first thing everyone wondered, apart from wondering whether or not Brian Williams would make an impromptu cameo as Smee, is what the network would do with the controversial \u201cUgg-A-Wugg\u201d number, featuring Tiger Lily and her band of \u201cIndians.\u201d If you\u2019ve never seen Peter Pan, and you don\u2019t know why \u201cUgg-A-Wugg\u201d is controversial, allow us to direct your attention to the 1960 version of the number, featuring the flaxen-haired, very, very WASP-y looking Sondra Lee as the Native American Tiger Lily:\n\n\u201cUgg-A-Wugg-A Meatball, indeed.\u201d\n\nFortunately, following the uproar over the equally Caucasian Rooney Mara being cast as Tiger Lily in the upcoming film Pan, NBC decided to get ahead of any accusations of cultural appropriation by making two very smart moves: 1) They cast a real Native American woman, 22-year-old Alanna Saunders, as Tiger Lily, and 2) They rewrote the lyrics to \u201cUgg-A-Wugg\u201d to make them sound less like a white person\u2019s attempt at Native American gibberish, replacing them with nursery rhymes and renaming the song \u201cTrue Blood Brothers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly two days later, we still can't quite believe what we just saw  VIDEO", "title": "The 7 worst things about NBC\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan Live!\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nearly two days later, we still can't quite believe what we just saw  VIDEO", "title": "The 7 worst things about NBC\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan Live!\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/06/the_7_worst_things_about_nbcs_peter_pan_live_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/peter_pan4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nearly two days later, we still can't quite believe what we just saw  VIDEO", "title": "The 7 worst things about NBC\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan Live!\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/peter_pan4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ej Dickson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, allison williams, Brian Williams, Brittney Spears, peter pan, the daily dot, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc502\"", "article_summary": "was a Britney Jean-level flop, than Peter Pan Live!\nThat said, we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t point out thatPeter Pan Live!\nShe\u2019s not bad, but she lacks the right impulsive, impish energy for Peter Pan.\u201d Someone with more firecracker energy, like an Anna Kendrick or an Ellen Page, would\u2019ve made for a much stronger Peter.\nAt no point did the costumes reflect the actual setting of Peter Pan, which is supposed to be early 20th century Victorian England.\n1) Cast someone who can actually pull off the role of Peter Pan."}
