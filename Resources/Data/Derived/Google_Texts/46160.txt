Marquee Suits Up with Ben Sherman Buy

The Neuberger Berman-backed firm also acquired footwear brand Bruno Magli recently

After stepping into footwear with the acquisition of Bruno Magli, private equity-backed Marquee Brands LLC is trying on menswear brand Ben Sherman for size.

Ben Sherman makes shirts, pants, shoes, suits and accessories for men.

Oxford Industries Inc. (NYSE: OXM) sold the line for $63.7 million to New York-based Marquee. Oxford, headquartered in Atlanta, hired Financo Ltd. to sell the unit in March. Oxford also owns Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Billy London and other brands.

Marquee is backed by Neuberger Berman Private Equity, a unit of Neuberger Berman, an employee-controlled investment manager. In February, the company bought luxury shoe and handbag business Bruno Magli out of insolvency. Neuberger formed Marquee in September 2014 specifically to acquire consumer brands.

Other private equity groups have picked up name-brand lines recently. In June, Palamon Capital Partners invested in luxury Italian leather brand Il Bisonte, and before that, in March, TowerBrook Capital Partners LP picked up women's clothing chain J.Jill.

Ropes & Gray LLP advised Marquee. Norton Rose Fulbright LLP was Oxford's legal counsel.
