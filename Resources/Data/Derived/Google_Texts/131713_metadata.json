Steve Russell (R-Okla.) said in a Facebook post.\n\nLast week, Russell sent a letter to Army Secretary John McHugh asking for documents on the women\u2019s test scores, injuries, evaluations and more, People magazine reported Tuesday.\n\nAn anonymous source told People the letter was in response to allegations Russell heard that the women received special treatment.\n\nRussell confirmed the reason for the letter in his Facebook post.\n\n\u201cThe records request on the recent Ranger classes that included females is to investigate serious allegations that are being made by members of the military,\u201d he wrote.\n\nArmy officials have repeatedly denied that standards were lowered to allow the women to graduate. Most recently, in response to Russell\u2019s letter, Army's Lt. Col. Garrett told People that the women \u201caccomplished the very same demanding standards of Ranger School as previous classes.\u201d\n\nLast month, Capt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver became the first women to graduate from Ranger School, considered the Army\u2019s toughest leadership training course. A third woman is still working her way through the course.\n\nAfter Griest and Haver\u2019s graduation, the Army officially opened Ranger School to all who qualified regardless of gender.\n\nIn his Facebook post, Russell said he requested the documents since he himself is a graduate of Ranger School.\n\n\u201cAs one of only two Ranger qualified members of the House, I asked for the records to determine the nature of the allegations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe investigation should show whether there was any wrong-doing or it will lay it to rest. We expect to examine the records by next week and will make a determination from there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cNo one wanted to touch this issue,\u201d Rep.
