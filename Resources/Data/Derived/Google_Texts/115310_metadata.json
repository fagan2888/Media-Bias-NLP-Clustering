Medicaid is a government health insurance program for the poor.\n\nThe Senate proposed a market-based plan for using federal money to underwrite private healthcare coverage. But the more conservative House balked at accepting anything derived from President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, a law Republicans strongly oppose.\n\nWithout a budget for the fiscal year starting July 1, lawmakers reconvened on June 1 and worked out compromises to fund a \"low-income pool\" of local, state and federal money to reimburse hospitals for care of the uninsured poor.\n\nThe Senate sought again to expand Medicaid eligibility, but the House held firm.\n\nLegislators gave Governor Rick Scott a $400 million package of tax cuts, which he signed this week. A breakthrough in prolonged budget negotiations came near midnight on Monday, with the sudden emergence of $300 million in a wide range of programs and building projects - dubbed \"turkeys\" in the legislative process - to smooth ruffled feathers.\n\nDemocrats objected not only to rejection of federal Medicaid money, but also to what they called a short-changing of environmental protection spending.\n\nFlorida voters overwhelmingly approved a state constitutional amendment last fall requiring one-third of state real estate development taxes to be spent on land acquisition and water protection, but Republican legislative leaders spread the money among a wide range of programs that they said met the conservation criteria.\n\nScott, a conservative Republican, can use his line-item veto to cull parts of the budget before signing it next week.\n\nWhen the Legislature adjourned three days early in late April, unable to pass a budget, Scott had ordered state agencies to draw up contingency lists of essential functions like prison operations and child protective services that would have to be maintained if a budget were not passed by July 1 and state agencies were forced to shutter.\n\n(Editing by David Adams and Will Dunham)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 1 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida: $787,500 Getty\n\n(Pictured: Patrick Geraghty, chief executive officer of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida) 2 Big Sugar: $550,000 Getty\n\nUnited States Sugar Corporation: $400,000\n\n\n\nFlorida Crystals: $150,000 3 Seminole Tribe Of Florida: $505,000 AP\n\n4 Florida Power & Light Company: $555,512 AP\n\n5 Wayne Huizenga: $380,500 Getty Images\n\n6 Sheldon Adelson: $250,000 AP\n\nAdelson is the owner of The Venetian in Las Vegas and the Israeli daily newspaper \"Israel HaYom.\"\n\n7 Shahid Khan: $250,000 Getty Images\n\nKhan is the owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars. 8 AT&T: $100,000 AP\n\n(Pictured: Randall Stephenson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of AT&T) 9 Fontainebleau Miami Beach: $85,000 Facebook.com/Fountainebleau\n\n10 Donald Trump: $60,000 Getty Images\n\n11 Stephen Ross: $50,000 AP\n\nRoss is the owner of the Miami Dolphins. 12 Seaworld: $30,000 AP\n\n13 Verizon: $30,000 AP\n\n14 Yahoo: $5,000 AP\n\n15 PepsiCo: $5,000 Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "(Adds close of special session, passage of budget)                 By Bill Cotterell                 TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 19 (Reut...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-06-20 20:29:00 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "(Adds close of special session, passage of budget)                 By Bill Cotterell                 TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 19 (Reut...", "title": "Florida Avoids Shutdown With Agreement On Budget", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/19/florida-budget-government-shutdown_n_7625752.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3096866/images/o-FLORIDA-RICK-SCOTT-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3096866/images/o-FLORIDA-RICK-SCOTT-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "(Adds close of special session, passage of budget)                 By Bill Cotterell                 TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 19 (Reut...", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Florida Avoids Shutdown With Agreement On Budget"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-19 20:29:00 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7625752", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "florida budget government shutdown,florida rick scott,florida medicaid,Florida budget,florida budget shutdown,florida economy,florida government shutdown,medicaid,florida obamacare,rick scott obamacare", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "florida budget government shutdown,florida rick scott,florida medicaid,Florida budget,florida budget shutdown,florida economy,florida government shutdown,medicaid,florida obamacare,rick scott obamacare", "published_time": "2015-06-19 20:29:00 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-06-19 21:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b27\"", "article_summary": "Democrats objected not only to rejection of federal Medicaid money, but also to what they called a short-changing of environmental protection spending.\nThe three-week special session ended after a 97-17 House vote on the budget.\nASSOCIATED PRESS(Adds close of special session, passage of budget)By Bill CotterellTALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 19 (Reuters) -
