The bill, which got its name because it combined an omnibus of 11 appropriations bills to fund the government through next September with a continuing resolution (CR) funding the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 27, passed on a final vote of 56-40.\n\nBoth of Alabama\u2019s senators voted against the bill, citing its funding of the president\u2019s executive action on immigration as the primary reason.\n\n\u201cWhile I support funding the government, as well as several conservative priorities and provisions important to Alabama in the omnibus, I opposed the overall bill,\u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). \u201cThe omnibus fails to properly address President Obama\u2019s action to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants through executive fiat. I remain firmly opposed to providing amnesty to those who have broken our laws and I stand ready to fight against the President\u2019s executive overreach when Republicans control both the House and the Senate next Congress.\u201d\n\nShelby was, however, one of the architects of the appropriations portion of the CRomnibus, and noted that while he did not support the full bill, he was pleased to see several items of particular importance to Alabama\u2019s economy included in the legislation.\n\nIn addition to the three Alabama-built Littoral Combat Ships that were previously included in President Obama\u2019s budget, the CRomnibus included an additional $80 million, which Shelby said will allow for \u201clong-lead procurement in order to maintain shipyard capacity and cost savings.\u201d The bill also contained $200 million over and above the President\u2019s Budget Request for an additional Alabama-built Joint High Speed Vessel. Both ships are made at the Port of Mobile by Austal USA.\n\n\u201cThis bill funds defense-related programs that play a vital role in providing our nation\u2019s military with the resources that they need to strengthen our national security,\u201d said Shelby. \u201cI am pleased that this bill includes funding to enhance Alabama\u2019s national defense capabilities and continue our state\u2019s commitment to serving our armed forces.\u201d\n\nSessions spent most of the day demanding a vote on language to block funds for the implementation of the President\u2019s \u201cillegal and unconstitutional amnesty.\u201d Although his efforts ultimately fell short on Saturday, his consistent and articulate arguments against the President\u2019s executive actions will continue to impact the debate going into the next sessions of Congress when Republicans will control both the House and Senate.\n\n\u201cWho is looking out for American workers?\u201d an exasperated Sessions rhetorically asked on the Senate floor. \u201cWho is looking out for their interests, fighting to help them get better jobs and pay, working to help their communities climb out of poverty? The immigration debate in our nation\u2019s capital is always centered on the needs of illegal immigrants, foreign workers, or large employers. Isn\u2019t it time, after decades of open immigration, to focus on how we can help Americans?\u201d\n\nLike this article?
