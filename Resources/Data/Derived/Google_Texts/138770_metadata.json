Interested parties can call 539-5305 for the Salida program and 293-0291 for the Buena Vista program.\n\nIRS-certified volunteers will help, free of charge, qualifying individuals prepare their tax returns. Qualifying individuals include disabled people, the elderly, people with limited English comprehension and people whose annual income is generally $53,000 or less, according to the IRS website.\n\nThe median household income in Chaffee County from 2009 to 2013 was $46,504, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nSeveral hundred people visited the Buena Vista site to receive free help with their tax returns in 2014, said Mary Ann Grindle with the Buena Vista VITA program. There is definitely a need for the program in the county, she said.\n\nThis is the first time in more than a year that the program is being offered in Salida, said Linda Bergstrom, Salida VITA volunteer. Bergstrom and her husband, Randy Bergstrom, moved to Salida in 2013 from Des Moines, Iowa, where they volunteered with the VITA program for more than 15 years.\n\nAlthough the program was not conducted in Salida in 2014, Bergstrom said she expects many people will take advantage of the assistance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do what we have to, to get as many people in as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nAnyone using the program will need to take their 2014 tax records, including W-2 and 1099 forms; a copy of their 2013 tax return, if possible; photo identification; Social Security card; and Social Security cards for all dependents.\n\nDue to changes brought by the Affordable Care Act, health insurance information is also required. If child-care expenses are going to be claimed, people are instructed to take the provider\u2019s tax identification or Social Security number. Those wishing to directly deposit their refund should take a check or deposit slip.\n\nBoth locations also are looking for volunteers to help with certified and non-certified positions.
