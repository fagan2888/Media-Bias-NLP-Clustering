Roughly two dozen of them set up shop across the country. Now, only half are still in business, and one of them is in Connecticut.\n\nKen Lalime started an insurance company from scratch. It wasn\u2019t exactly easy.\n\n\"Nobody\u2019s built a new insurance company in the state of Connecticut in 30 years,\" Lalime said. \"There\u2019s no book that you pull off the shelf and say, let\u2019s go do this.\"\n\nLalime runs Healthy CT, an insurance co-op started with doctors from the Connecticut State Medical Society. Unlike others across the country, Lalime and Healthy CT are still in business as the third round of open enrollment under Obamacare begins.\n\nBut when he started out, he didn\u2019t know who his customers would be; he didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d be sick or healthy; and he didn\u2019t know how much to charge. His rates ended up being eight percent higher than the competition.\n\n\"In that first year, the reason we had such low market share was that consumers -- new to the industry, new to insurance -- most of those individuals bought on price,\" Lalime said. That wasn\u2019t good for Healthy CT. It only got about three percent of all of the state\u2019s business under the ACA.\n\nBut Lalime said that slow ramp up actually helped. He didn\u2019t have a huge number of claims to pay right out of the gate. And the ones he did pay didn\u2019t break the collective bank.\n\n\"Hindsight, yes, that didn\u2019t hurt us, to be able to take it slowly,\" Lalime said.\n\nBy year two, Lalime said his company had more back-office experience, more time for consumer outreach and, it turns out, a more competitive price. As a result, his company went from three percent of the market share to 18 percent.\n\nNow it\u2019s year three, and Healthy CT is still in the game.\n\n\"There\u2019s some more healthy competition here, that\u2019s great,\" Lalime said. \"We think that\u2019s a fine thing that the ACA wanted to do this, and the benefit goes to who? The benefit goes to the consumer.\"\n\nAnd it\u2019s a benefit that consumers in states like Colorado, Iowa, and New York won\u2019t have. Their co-ops have failed.\n\nHealthy CT is a WNPR underwriter.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Health insurance co-ops are companies that were given federal incentives to compete for business under the Affordable Care Act.
