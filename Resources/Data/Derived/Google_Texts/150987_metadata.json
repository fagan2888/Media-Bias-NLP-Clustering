Under Obamacare, businesses with 100 or more full-time employees (a number that drops to 50 in 2016) must provide most of those employees with health insurance \u2014 or pay the Obamacare penalty.\n\n\u201cA majority of small businesses say the Affordable Care Act already has hurt their profits, forcing them to reduce or postpone investment, withhold raises or trim other types of benefits, according to a new survey by the top small-business trade group,\u201d reports USA Today.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Businesses with fewer than 100 employees also already have felt some impact from the health law, says a new survey by the National Federation of Independent Business [NFIB], a small-business trade group. Those that provide health insurance now must offer coverage for mental health and other services \u2014 unless they\u2019re grandfathered under existing plans \u2014 boosting premiums, says Kevin Kuhlman, NFIB director of federal policy.\u201d\n\nNFIB surveyed 900 small businesses and found that 42 percent had seen increases of at least 10 percent in their health plan costs in 2014. Accordingly, 26 percent said they were planning either to free or reduce their employees\u2019 pay.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "Most observers expected Obamacare to effect a profound shift in the way many businesses approached building a workforce.", "title": "Obamacare continues to reshape hiring practices", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/01/jobs123114.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-05T12:49:29+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/obamacare-continues-reshape-hiring-practices-earnings-small-businesses/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/01/jobs123114.jpg", "description": "Most observers expected Obamacare to effect a profound shift in the way many businesses approached building a workforce.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare continues to reshape hiring practices"}, "description": "Most observers expected Obamacare to effect a profound shift in the way many businesses approached building a workforce.", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "article": {"section": "Taxpayer Dimes", "published_time": "2015-01-01T10:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T12:49:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "National Federation of Independent Business, Affordable Care Act, Personal Liberty, Ben Bullard, Kevin Kuhlman, Hiring Practices, Small Business, Obamacare, NFIB"}, "article_summary": "Under Obamacare, businesses with 100 or more full-time employees (a number that drops to 50 in 2016) must provide most of those employees with health insurance \u2014 or pay the Obamacare penalty.\nA year into its operation, Obamacare is doing just that.\nAccordingly, 26 percent said they were planning either to free or reduce their employees\u2019 pay.\n\u201c\u2026 Businesses with fewer than 100 employees also already have felt some impact from the health law, says a new survey by the National Federation of Independent Business [NFIB], a small-business trade group.\nMost observers expected the Affordable Care Act to effect a profound shift in the way many businesses approached building a workforce, thanks to requirements that created new costs for employers who retain full-time, benefits-eligible staff."}
