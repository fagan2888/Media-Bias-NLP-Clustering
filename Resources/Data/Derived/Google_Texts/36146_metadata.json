Jackie Hydock is Director, Global Recruiting at App Annie . The organization taps social media tools to recruit, and she made the following suggestions regarding how job seekers can use social media effectively:Yes. We have created our own recruitment social media pages outside of our corporate social media sites. The corporate sites serve to share our mobile insights reports, corporate news and showcase how we are revolutionizing the mobile analytics space. Our recruitment social media sites focus on the App Annie culture to give followers an inside view of what it's like to be a part of the team and offer tips on how to become an \"App Annier.\" We also use our recruitment social sites to highlight open job positions.We love gaining new candidate followers and appreciate it when followers like, comment, retweet or favorite our #lifeatappannie and App Annie Instagram posts. A couple of candidates have tweeted that they sent in their application to App Annie and couldn't wait to hear from us! It's also exciting when followers retweet or favorite specific job openings. Engaging with us through our social media channels is a great way to stand out among the applicant pool. It shows us that candidates have taken the time to learn more about our company's cultures, values and beliefs, which is an integral part of our recruiting process. If a candidate is already a user of our App Annie products and broadcasts that on social media -- that's another major plus in our eyes.Any attention a candidate gives to our corporate or recruiting social sites makes us feel like they are eager to stay connected and that they want to engage with us. We appreciate the candidates who take time to follow us, whether they are interested in working with us today or just hoping to keep us in mind for the future. If a candidate goes the extra mile to share a job opening with their network, it is a great sign that they would be a positive addition to our growing team. It is our commitment to our followers to keep our feeds interesting and filled with fun and unique App Annie content.: We like to see responsible photos and content from people who take their personal brand image and work seriously. Our recruiting team uses LinkedIn heavily and we believe that it is the best place to judge candidates on who they are and what they've done in a public forum. We understand that Facebook and Instagram profiles are typically more personal profiles and we are less likely to take those posts and pictures under consideration.What we are looking for is good judgment. As we recruit, we keep in mind that every App Annie employee is also an App Annie brand ambassador, and we want to make sure our team is made up of those who will reflect our company in the most positive light everywhere - whether they're on the conference show floor or in the gym. We don't invest a lot of time in doing heavy social checks on the more personal social media channels, but rely on more formal background checks to assess a candidate's ultimate eligibility.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-3af9d6a02a9854da3646959922f4fe0c/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "description": "Shutterstock    In light of research released from Jobvite regarding how employers are using social media tools to source and hire candidates, I thought it would be helpful to provide ideas and in", "author": "AOL Staff", "og": {"site_name": "AOL.com", "description": "Shutterstock    In light of research released from Jobvite regarding how employers are using social media tools to source and hire candidates, I thought it would be helpful to provide ideas and in", "title": "How to Use Social Media to Impress Recruiters", "url": "http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/27/social-media-impress-recruiters/20978154/", "image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/5000x2878+0+76/resize/620x357!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/midas/54ad3e814bd4375db2b03c3325774cf/200986581/175661123.jpg", "app_id": 183146218394780, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.aol.com", "account_id": 66237835, "title": "How to Use Social Media to Impress Recruiters", "image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/5000x2878+0+76/resize/620x357!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/midas/54ad3e814bd4375db2b03c3325774cf/200986581/175661123.jpg", "creator": "@AOL", "site": "@AOL", "card": "summary", "description": "Shutterstock    In light of research released from Jobvite regarding how employers are using social media tools to source and hire candidates, I thought it would be helpful to provide ideas and in"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3399ff", "robots": "index,follow", "publish-date": "October 27, 2014", "p": {"domain_verify": "96bae1739d3231d21abe59a638021d5d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183146218394780}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-43dafc02cf4f3bf4849e499b04c0aa82/images/favicon/mstile-144x144.png?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/aol"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdd9\"", "article_summary": "We have created our own recruitment social media pages outside of our corporate social media sites.\nThe organization taps social media tools to recruit, and she made the following suggestions regarding how job seekers can use social media effectively:Yes.\nEngaging with us through our social media channels is a great way to stand out among the applicant pool.\nWe don't invest a lot of time in doing heavy social checks on the more personal social media channels, but rely on more formal background checks to assess a candidate's ultimate eligibility.\nIt is our commitment to our followers to keep our feeds interesting and filled with fun and unique App Annie content."}
