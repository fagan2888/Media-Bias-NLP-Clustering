U.S. investment in Iran will be prohibited across the board.\"Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, told Fox News the re-opening of the loophole is in line with the Obama administration's selective enforcing of federal laws.\"It's a problem that the president doesn't have the ability to wave a magic wand and make go away. Any U.S. company that follows through on this, that allows their foreign-owned subsidiaries to do business with Iran, will very likely face substantial civil liability, litigation and potentially even criminal prosecution,\" Cruz told Fox.\"The obligation to follow federal law doesn't go away simply because we have a lawless president who refuses to acknowledge or follow federal law.\"On Wednesday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei banned all further negotiations between Iran and the U.S., just months after the inking of the nuclear deal, which ends financial sanctions against Iran in exchange for its nuclear capabilities being curtailed.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "iran, nuclear deal, violates, federal law", "pubdate": "2015-10-09T11:01:02", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A concession in the Iran nuclear deal that allows \"tens of billions of dollars\" in commerce backed by the U.S. to flow into the Middle East nation cannot proceed without breaking federal statutes, Fox News reports.", "title": "US Officials: Concession in Iran Deal Violates Federal Law", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/iran-nuclear-deal-violates-federal-law/2015/10/09/id/695452/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=66625758-251c-4afe-bcb3-35f643323668&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/iran-nuclear-deal-violates-federal-law/2015/10/09/id/695452/", "title": "US Officials: Concession in Iran Deal Violates Federal Law", "description": "A concession in the Iran nuclear deal that allows \"tens of billions of dollars\" in commerce backed by the U.S. to flow into the Middle East nation cannot proceed without breaking federal statutes, Fox News reports.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1444388462, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "iran, nuclear deal, violates, federal law", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-10-09T11:01:02"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/iran-nuclear-deal-violates-federal-law/2015/10/09/id/695452/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A concession in the Iran nuclear deal that allows  tens of billions of dollars  in commerce backed by the U.S. to flow into the Middle East nation cannot proceed without breaking federal statutes, Fox News reports."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb80\"", "article_summary": "\"The obligation to follow federal law doesn't go away simply because we have a lawless president who refuses to acknowledge or follow federal law.\n\"On Wednesday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei banned all further negotiations between Iran and the U.S., just months after the inking of the nuclear deal, which ends financial sanctions against Iran in exchange for its nuclear capabilities being curtailed.\nTed Cruz of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, told Fox News the re-opening of the loophole is in line with the Obama administration's selective enforcing of federal laws.\n\"He added that existing U.S. sanctions on the regime \"will continue to be enforced ...
