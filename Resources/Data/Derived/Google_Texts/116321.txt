Jack Welch, Jack Welch Management Institute executive chairman, discusses the government shutdown and how the Republicans should have negotiated with the White House.

"Both sides went down the wrong path. The Republicans take on the president's signature [health-care] bill and they say, 'Defund it.' By definition, that's not sitting across the table," he added—saying the GOP are the worst marketers of their ideas. "I wouldn't let Republicans market an iPad when it came out," he said. "They can't market anything."

"Then the president says, 'I will not negotiate.' That's not a position I can accept either," Welch said.

In another example of how he finds the president too powerful, Welch said: "[The president] can arbitrarily legislate around Congress on clean air." He believes the overreach of the presidency "started early in the Bush administration [and] a bit in the Clinton administration."
