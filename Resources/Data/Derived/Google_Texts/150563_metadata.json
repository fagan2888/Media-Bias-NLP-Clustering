He noted that one of the changes he\u2019s seen since the Affordable Care Act was passed is a shift in responsibility for healthcare decisions.

Hospitals want to be able to write off these debts within two years. If patients and caregivers can negotiate a plan within 120 days before it gets kicked over to a bill collector, they stand a better chance of getting a better deal.\n\n\u201cThe system we are using has been around for decades,\u201d Dub\u00e9 said. \u201cMedical billing advocates have been around ever since medical bills. We are putting it into an online platform so it\u2019s user friendly.\u201d\n\nDub\u00e9 said the program is still in beta, although he and Holt expect to launch it by the end of March. So far, beta testers have fallen into two categories \u2014 relatives of the patients and patients themselves. Beta testers have received huge discounts on the program\u2019s cost but the launch price will be $97.\n\nAlthough it has been talking to credit unions as potential strategic partners, they haven\u2019t ruled out talking to hospitals, too. \u201cThey will come away with more money if individuals have a better understanding of what is covered and what isn\u2019t covered,\u201d Dub\u00e9 said. He added that it could help hospitals build a more sustainable relationship with their patient community.\n\nAnother interesting trend Holt and Dub\u00e9 are seeing is hospitals offering medical credits.
