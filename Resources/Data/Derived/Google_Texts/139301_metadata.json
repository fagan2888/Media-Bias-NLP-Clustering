Maybe it is a little later.\"\n\nEvans spoke in Washington at an investor conference held by JP Morgan on the sidelines of the semiannual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.\n\nSince its initial rate hike in December, the Fed has slowed its expected pace of subsequent increases in response to risks that a slowdown in the global economy could be more severe than expected. Some of those risks have receded, allowing the Fed to debate when to resume raising its target rate.\n\nBut Evans said the horizon was not fully clear, and that in particular the U.S. central bank needed to be sure inflation would rise to its two percent target.\n\nThe path of inflation will \"inform\" the Fed's decisions in coming months, Evans said, arguing that policymakers need to prove to investors and households that they are serious about reaching the inflation goal - even at the risk of overshooting.\n\n\"Inflation is the responsibility of the central bank. If we are at one percent and it is supposed to be two percent, that is us. If it is three percent, that is us,\" Evans said.\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\"Going into the next meeting I think there is a reasonably high hurdle for taking any", "title": "Fed's Evans says bar high for any rate action in April", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Feds-Evans-says-bar-high-any-rate-action-April", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-fed-evans_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Feds-Evans-says-bar-high-any-rate-action-April", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-fed-evans_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\"Going into the next meeting I think there is a reasonably high hurdle for taking any", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Some of those risks have receded, allowing the Fed to debate when to resume raising its target rate.\n\"Going into the next meeting I think there is a reasonably high hurdle for taking any action,\" Evans said, but added that he still sees two rate hikes as likely appropriate over the course of the year.\n\"Inflation is the responsibility of the central bank.\nBut Evans said the horizon was not fully clear, and that in particular the U.S. central bank needed to be sure inflation would rise to its two percent target.\n\"The fundamentals of the economy are still pretty good and consistent with a gradual normalization...Maybe it is June."}
