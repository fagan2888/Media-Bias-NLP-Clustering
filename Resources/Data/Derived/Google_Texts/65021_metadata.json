Illinois essentially piggybacked on Michigan\u2019s existing system, and the new, two-state software went live late this year.\n\nThe system was moved to the cloud \u2014 essentially Internet-based as opposed to hardware-based software \u2014 so the two states could share the technology\u2019s infrastructure. That means that, while the two states\u2019 data remains segregated, maintenance and future upgrades can be made to one program as opposed to two.\n\nOfficials with the Rockville, Md.-based tech firm that built the software, Client Network Services Inc., or CNSI, said the system could support additional states in the future.\n\nAdding Illinois and moving to the cloud cost about $9.5 million, of which Illinois paid Michigan more than $8 million, said Jennifer Eisner, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services. The majority of that expense was covered by the states\u2019 share of federal Medicaid dollars.\n\nMichigan approved a $51.5 million contract with CNSI to build its Medicaid software \u2014 called Community Health Administrative Management Payment System, or CHAMPS \u2014 in 2006. Various upgrades and add-ons over the years have grown the total value of that contract to more than $381 million.\n\nBut comparing the new system to the old \u201cis night and day,\u201d said Sashi Ravipati, CNSI\u2019s vice president of the Midwest region.\n\nFor one, it used to take a month or more to screen health care providers who signed up to receive Medicaid payments.\n\n\u201cNow, less than two seconds, a provider gets screened,\u201d said Sharif Hussein, CNSI\u2019s senior Midwest vice president. \u201cNot only that, it gets screened against all the databases in the entire U.S., not just the databases in Michigan.\u201d\n\nThe new system also includes an application that shows real-time data on Medicaid providers and beneficiaries, including the types of services they\u2019re using.\n\nThat data not only helps policymakers monitor activity in government\u2019s most expensive operation, but also is used to help beneficiaries manage their own care. The software supports smartphone applications and online programs that help patients do things like search for doctors and view medical records, and they can receive text and email reminders about things like immunizations.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, it was always, try to pay the providers; once you paid the providers, (governments) were happy, happy campers,\u201d Ravipati said. But \u201cwhen (patients) take care of their health in a meaningful way, then obviously it will bring down cost.\u201d\n\nCNSI officials also said the technology helps prevent fraud, because patients can more quickly see all claims filed in their name and can flag payments for services they didn\u2019t receive.\n\nAnd, while the botched rollout of insurance exchanges through the Affordable Care Act made \u201cglitch\u201d synonymous with \u201chealth care software\u201d in the minds of many, CNSI officials said the system is built with security and performance features that protect against failure.\n\nThe system continuously monitors the number of patients and providers online at any given moment, for example, \u201cso we can see if there\u2019s a spike,\u201d said Adnan Ahmed, CNSI president. \u201cIt has self-corrective mechanisms \u2026 this is monitored 24/7, 365.\u201d\n\nRavipati said the system processes about $13 billion in payments to tens of thousands of providers a year in Michigan, and the system has not failed. Illinois has about twice that volume, he said.\n\nThe arrangement was controversial: Illinois officials were accused in 2013 of hiring CNSI through a no-bid contract, since Illinois is getting the software through an agreement with Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s administration instead of a direct deal with the tech firm. Government watchdog groups in Illinois raised particular concern two years ago because CNSI had troubled pasts in Arkansas, Louisiana, Utah and Maine, the Chicago Tribune reported at the time.\n\nBut, the Tribune reported, Illinois was assured by federal regulators and Michigan had received satisfactory service from the contractor for nearly a decade. And the multi-state partnership offered a chance to get more for less.\n\nThe \u201csharing of government services is the right approach for taxpayers,\u201d David Behen, director of the Michigan Department of Technology, Management & Budget, said in a statement announcing the new software.\n\nContact Justin A.
