Labor groups have backed the protests, drawing attention to what they say are stagnating incomes and inequality.\n\nMcDonald's in April announced it would raise wages for 90,000 workers at company-owned restaurants by $1.\n\n\u201cWe voluntarily took leadership,\u201d new McDonald\u2019s CEO Steve Easterbrook said on Thursday of the decision, adding that he was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of the increase.\n\nSEIU President Mary Kay Henry, though, argued it was not enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for McDonald\u2019s to respect the workers on the frontlines as much as they have respected shareholders by putting $30 billion in their pockets over the last 10 years,\u201d she said.\n\nOnly 10 percent of McDonald stores are owned by the parent corporation, though, and the company says it can't control franchisees' labor decisions.\n\nThe debate over the minimum wage is also fast becoming an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nBernie Sanders Bernie SandersWhy superdelegates shouldn't support Sanders Young Turks host offers M for Trump, Sanders debate Puerto Rico debt relief faces serious challenges in Senate MORE (I-Vt.), running for the Democratic nomination, urged President Obama last week to raise the pay for the lowest-earning employees at firms working with the federal government.\n\nHe called on Obama to use executive action to force government agencies to give preferential treatment to contracts that pay workers a \u201cliving wage.\u201d\n\nGOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, meanwhile, called for a hike on the $7.25 federal minimum wage on May 8, the only Republican contender to do so yet.\n\n\u201cI think, probably, it should be higher than now,\u201d Carson told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood during an interview.\n\nAdvisers for former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), a possible 2016 contender, told The Hill in February that he was open to potentially raising the minimum wage.\n\nGov.
