He described the current Supreme Court justices as a mere group of lawyers \u201cterribly unrepresentative of our country.\u201d\n\nScalia labeled the recent cases in favor of Obamacare and gay marriage as the \u201cfurthest imaginable extension of the Supreme Court doing whatever it wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worry about a court that\u2019s headed in that direction,\u201d Scalia told to a crowd of hundreds of people, including many students who lined up as early as three hours before his scheduled remarks.\n\nThe justice criticized individuals who support keeping the Constitution a fluid document that can change as time evolves, explaining that said arguments are usually driven by the idea of adding freedoms to the document.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s always good unless you\u2019re an anarchist,\u201d Scalia said. \u201cI thought the trick was to balance freedom with order.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Justice Antonin Scalia argued against the recent majority opinions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage during a speech at Rhodes College on Tuesday evening.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Justice Antonin Scalia argued against the recent majority opinions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage during a speech at\u00a0Rhodes College on Tuesday evening, casting\u00a0his fellow justices as\u00a0\u201cterribl", "title": "Scalia Slams Fellow SCOTUS Judges: \u2018Don\u2019t Mess With the Constitution\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/scalia-slams-fellow-scotus-judges-dont-mess-with-the-constitution/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Antonin-Scalia-AP-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Justice Antonin Scalia argued against the recent majority opinions on Obamacare and same-sex marriag", "title": "Scalia Slams Fellow SCOTUS Judges: \u2018Don\u2019t Mess With the Constitution\u2019", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Antonin-Scalia-AP-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@mchalfant16", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDon\u2019t mess with the Constitution,\u201d Scalia said.\n\u201cThe people who wrote it were brilliant.\u201d\u201cDo you really want your judges to rewrite the Constitution?\u201d Scalia added.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s always good unless you\u2019re an anarchist,\u201d Scalia said.\nThe justice criticized individuals who support keeping the Constitution a fluid document that can change as time evolves, explaining that said arguments are usually driven by the idea of adding freedoms to the document.\n\u201cI thought the trick was to balance freedom with order.\u201d"}
