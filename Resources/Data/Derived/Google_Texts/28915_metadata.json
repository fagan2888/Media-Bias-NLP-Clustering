That means we face the great and we face the tough.\"\n\nFolt replaced former Chancellor Holden Thorp in July. Thorp, UNC-Chapel Hill's leader since 2008, decided to resign last year.\n\nUNC System President Tom Ross, who presided over Saturday's ceremony, said he sought a leader able to manage a complex organization operating with constrained resources yet still committed to keeping tuition low, in line with a requirement in the North Carolina constitution.\n\nRoss said he wanted a proven fundraiser and communicator, who made academics a priority but recognized that athletics had a key role in building school pride and alumni loyalty.\n\nSince 1957, UNC has installed chancellors on Oct. 12.\n\nRoss presided over Saturday's ceremony, and Sarah Parker, chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, administered the oath of Office.\n\nGov. Pat McCrory was also on hand for Saturday's event, saying that UNC was bringing a \"class act\" into the fold by choosing Folt to lead the school.\n\n\"Your chancellor is already connecting this wonderful institution with commerce,\" McCrory said. \"Our state has seen a comeback in commerce.\"\n\nFolt became Dartmouth's president in July 2012 after Jim Yong Kim left the job to become head of the World Bank. Folt had been the school's chief academic officer, the school's second-highest rank, for three years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2013-10-12 04:01:00", "description": "Celebrating its 220th birthday, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Saturday installed its first female leader.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2013-10-13 00:03:42", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=12988649|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Celebrating its 220th birthday, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Saturday installed its first female leader.", "title": "Folt installed as UNC-Chapel Hill's first female chancellor :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/folt-installed-as-unc-chapel-hill-s-first-female-chancellor/12988649/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/2013/10/12/12989316/12989316-1381669255-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-12T04:01:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Celebrating its 220th birthday, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Saturday installed its first female leader.", "title": "Folt installed as UNC-Chapel Hill's first female chancellor :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/folt-installed-as-unc-chapel-hill-s-first-female-chancellor/12988649/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/2013/10/12/12989316/1381605872-foltuday-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb649\"", "article_summary": "\"I believe in Carolina,\" Folt told WRAL News following the installation ceremony.\nRoss presided over Saturday's ceremony, and Sarah Parker, chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, administered the oath of Office.\nFolt became Dartmouth's president in July 2012 after Jim Yong Kim left the job to become head of the World Bank.\nFolt had been the school's chief academic officer, the school's second-highest rank, for three years.\nShe spoke about the university's past and future, saying UNC-Chapel Hill must \"lower barriers and de-silo campus to face some of its greatest challenges.\""}
