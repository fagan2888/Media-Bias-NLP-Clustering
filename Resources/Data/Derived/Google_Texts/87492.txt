In case you missed it yesterday, Hillary Clinton laid out her plan to make college "more affordable" and "free" for families by hiking taxes.

Today, I’m announcing my plan to put college within reach for everyone. We’re calling it the New College Compact. Here are the basics:



-Under the New College Compact, no student should have to borrow to pay tuition at a public college.

-Schools will have to control their costs and show more accountability to their students.

-States will have to meet their obligation to invest in higher education.

-The federal government will increase its investment in education, and won’t profit off student loans.

-And millions with student debt will be able to refinance it at lower rates.



That’s my plan. It’s ambitious?—?and we should be ambitious. But it’s also achievable. And it would make a big difference in people’s lives.

Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker took notice.

Walker is referencing Clinton's habit of charging public universities a $225,000 (at least) speaking fee after she left the State Department. Between 2014 and 2015 Bill and Hillary Clinton raked in more than $25 million in speaking fees from public universities, non-profits and businesses.
