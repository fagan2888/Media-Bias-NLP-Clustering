Muskett, J.D., Senior Legislative Counsel\n\nOn Wednesday of this week, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) introduced the Senate version of the Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act. S. 1848 is the Senate companion to the bill introduced in the House by Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ), H.R. 3279. The National Right to Life Committee strongly supports this legislation.\n\nThe Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act would require every health plan offered on an ObamaCare insurance exchange to disclose any coverage of abortion in the plan\u2019s marketing and advertising materials. It also requires insurers to disclose the cost of the \u201cabortion surcharge,\u201d which is the defined monthly charge for elective abortion coverage that every enrollee in an abortion-covering Exchange plan must pay. This abortion surcharge is not optional \u2013 every enrollee in the plan must pay it, including families that have moral objections to abortion and/or that contain no females of reproductive age.\n\nMany consumers are having great difficulty determining which plans cover abortion on the ObamaCare Exchanges. And even after they enroll, many likely won\u2019t even know they are paying for abortion coverage. That would not be the case if the ObamaCare statute was being enforced as written. That\u2019s because ObamaCare requires that Exchange plans that cover abortion must collect a separate payment from enrollees for the abortion coverage and deposit it into a separate account to be used to pay for elective abortions. The plan must also collect a second separate payment for all other services. Federal premium subsidies and cost-sharing would not be placed in the abortion account. This was a key part of the \u201cdeal\u201d on ObamaCare that former Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska negotiated when Senate Majority Leader Reid badly needed his vote for Senate passage of ObamaCare back in December 2009.\n\nBy paying a separate payment for the abortion services, enrollees would become aware of the plan\u2019s abortion coverage, as well as the abortion surcharge. But now the Obama Administration is flouting the two payments statutory requirement. By flouting this statutory requirement, but continuing to segregate premium money into a special fund designated for elective abortions, many enrollees likely won\u2019t even know they are paying for abortion coverage; the \u201cabortion surcharge\u201d becomes a hidden fee for which the enrollee is unawares; and the cost of the abortion surcharge remains hidden. For more information on this, see \u201cBait-and-Switch: The Obama Administration\u2019s Flouting of Key Part of Nelson \u2018Deal\u2019 on ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nCurrently, 18 senators have cosponsored S. 1848: John Barrasso (R-WY), John Boozman (R-AR), Richard Burr (R-NC), Dan Coats (R-IN), Thad Cochran (R-MS), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), James Inhofe (R-OK), Mike Johanns (R-NE), Mike Lee (R-UT), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), James Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), John Thune (R-SD), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).\n\nIn introducing the legislation, Sen. Roberts said, \u201cAmericans have a right to know if a plan they are purchasing covers abortion. Millions of pro-life Americans oppose the use of their money to cover abortion services . . . We need transparency. Consumers have a right to know what these fees are paying for so that they can choose an insurance plan that meets their needs and is in line with their beliefs and values.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Sen.-Pat-Roberts.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2ec\"", "article_summary": "By paying a separate payment for the abortion services, enrollees would become aware of the plan\u2019s abortion coverage, as well as the abortion surcharge.\nThe Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act would require every health plan offered on an ObamaCare insurance exchange to disclose any coverage of abortion in the plan\u2019s marketing and advertising materials.\nBy Susan T.
