(AP Photo/David Goldman)\n\n*Following a national uproar after the Trayvon Martin case, Fox News did some enterprise journalism to seek out white people who\u2019d been killed by black people.\n\n*Despite massive evidence to the contrary, Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly has repeatedly disavowed the idea of white privilege in the United States.\n\n*Anchor Megyn Kelly insisted that Santa Claus and Jesus were white, though she said later that she was joking.\n\n*In the immediate aftermath of the Charleston, S.C., church massacre, in which the alleged killer is said to have proclaimed that he had come to \u201cshoot black people,\u201d Fox News focused on the possibility of a hate crime against Christians.\n\nThough not a monolith, Fox News has amassed an archive of lamentable moments on race relations \u2014 some of the much-commented-upon clips come off as race-baiting, others as racially insensitive and yet others just racially unhelpful.\n\nYet, South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford didn\u2019t accuse Fox News of just being racially insensitive. In a discussion on Thursday with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper regarding Charleston, Rutherford suggested that Fox News \u2014 or at least its ilk \u2014 all but handed instructions to alleged killer Dylann Roof:\n\nSouth Carolina is one of five states that does not have a hate crimes law. South Carolina is the only state that I\u2019m aware of that still flies a Confederate flag in front of the statehouse dome. South Carolina represents and is emblematic of the problem, which is words come from these networks that broadcast what they call news, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really hate speech and coded language and leads people to believe they can walk into a church, because it\u2019s no longer a house of god, it\u2019s a killing ground. It\u2019s a place that they can feel free to desecrate and leave blood everywhere, and that\u2019s what this man did. And he did so on some ill-gotten belief, on some wrong belief that it\u2019s okay to do that. He hears that, because he watches the news and he watches things like Fox News, where they talk about things that they call news, but they\u2019re really not. They use that coded language, they use hate speech, they talk about the president as if he\u2019s not the president. They talk about churchgoers as if they\u2019re not really churchgoers. And that\u2019s what this young man acted on. That\u2019s why you can walk into a church and treat people like animals when they\u2019re really human beings.\n\nThe Internet took note of Rutherford\u2019s remarks, which started off well. Surely South Carolina needs to consider the symbolism that flanks its official buildings, and indeed it is. Taking a close look at how coded language in the news media affects the way that people react to their surroundings is a worthwhile pursuit, too.\n\nYet Rutherford went quite a distance beyond those parameters, wading into dicey cause-and-effect territory and naming a specific \u2014 and highly controversial \u2014 media outlet in the process. Fox News is never shy about repelling such attacks, which is why O\u2019Reilly himself cross-examined the lawmaker on Thursday night\u2019s edition of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.\u201d The host asked the South Carolina politician, \u201cNow, you say that this Roof kid watches Fox News.\u201d Rutherford went to the record: \u201cI didn\u2019t say that he watched Fox News,\u201d said Rutherford. \u201cI said\u2026things like Fox News.\u201d By the Erik Wemple Blog\u2019s transcription of Rutherford\u2019s CNN remarks, he most certainly did say that Roof watches \u201cthings like Fox News.\u201d But what are \u201cthings like Fox News\u201d? Are they actually Fox News? Fox Business News? FoxNews.com? Nation.FoxNews.com?\n\nPoliticians of various ideologies these days are verily trained to seed their rhetoric with attacks on the media. The result is often sloppy and bombastic media criticism, much of which is based on thin familiarity with the actual output of the media. Whether it\u2019s from Fox News or other \u201cnetworks,\u201d this blog hasn\u2019t come across any recent coverage indicating that it\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d to shoot up a church. If Rutherford is saying that any amount of racially coded news coverage is tantamount to an incitement to racial violence, he should step forward and attempt to make that case. Until such a time, this outburst stands as a cheap-shot against Fox News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Or, he took a swipe at 'things like Fox News.'", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Or, he took a swipe at 'things like Fox News.'", "title": "South Carolina legislator took a cheap-shot at Fox News on Charleston massacre", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/06/20/south-carolina-legislator-took-a-cheap-shot-at-fox-news-on-charleston-massacre/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/morning-mix/Images/Charleston_Shooting-0870a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/06/20/south-carolina-legislator-took-a-cheap-shot-at-fox-news-on-charleston-massacre/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Charleston, Fox News, CNN, Jake Tapper,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Charleston, Fox News, CNN, Jake Tapper,"}, "article_summary": "South Carolina is the only state that I\u2019m aware of that still flies a Confederate flag in front of the statehouse dome.\nSurely South Carolina needs to consider the symbolism that flanks its official buildings, and indeed it is.\nYet, South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford didn\u2019t accuse Fox News of just being racially insensitive.\nSouth Carolina represents and is emblematic of the problem, which is words come from these networks that broadcast what they call news, but it\u2019s not.\n\u201cI said\u2026things like Fox News.\u201d By the Erik Wemple Blog\u2019s transcription of Rutherford\u2019s CNN remarks, he most certainly did say that Roof watches \u201cthings like Fox News.\u201d But what are \u201cthings like Fox News\u201d?"}
