Each faced about five minutes of questioning with the opportunity for a closing statement.\n\nFor Rick Perry, the Texas governor, and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, the key issue was immigration.\n\n\u201cThe will to secure the border will reside in the Oval Office,\u201d Mr Perry said.\n\nMr Santorum took an even tougher line.\n\n\u201c35 million people have come into this country legally and illegally.\n\n\u201cI am the only candidate calling for securing the border and a 25 per cent reduction in unskilled labour coming in. I am the person standing up for the American worker.\u201d\n\nLindsey Graham\n\nFor Lindsey Graham, the hawkish South Carolina senator, the task was to get over his message that he will be tougher than his rivals on America\u2019s foes.\n\nIn a generally strong performance, he was arguably the most successful in mastering the concise soundbite and self deprecating joke.\n\n\u201cHere is my economic policy and foreign policy, A clenched fist and an open hand,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to be president to make us a great nation and put radical Islam in a box.\u201d\n\nStumbling on being asked to sum up his message in 30 seconds, Mr Graham smiled and said: \u201cThe next president needs to get his act together.\u201d\n\nFor Senator Ted Cruz of Texas the Iran deal was a catastrophe.\n\n\u201cIf this deal goes through, the Obama administration will become the world\u2019s leading financier of global terrorism.\u201d\n\nBen Carson\n\nBen Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, continued his attack on the Obama administration\u2019s flagship Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cObamacare flies in the face of what we are as a nation,\u201d he said.\n\nJeb Bush focused on national security in the wake of the lone wolf attacks in the US. \u201cI think we have lowered our guard a bit.\u201d\n\nIn a scarcely veiled dig at his libertarian rival Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, he called for measures to be \u201creinvigorated.\u201d\n\nMr Paul who has attacked the mass security surveillance remained unrepentant.\n\n\u201cWe should collect more information on terrorists and less on innocent American citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a constitutional conservative and believe the Government should leave the individual alone,\u201d he said.\n\nOtherwise the main candidates\u2019 pitch was how they they would slash government spending if they reach the White House.\n\nGovernor Scott Walker, whose draconian spending cuts in Wisconsin led to a bruising battle with the unions, tried to convince his audience he could do the same thing in Washington.\n\n\u201cI am all for a balanced budget. I know how to balance a budget. It can\u2019t be just through cuts and austerity it has to be through job creation.\n\n\u201cI am pro-worker and pro-taxpayer.\u201d\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nJohn Kasich, the Ohio governor from the moderate wing of the party, insisted the budget could be balanced without axing programmes.\n\nChris Christie, the New Jersey governor, in what seemed like a jibe at some of his federal government shrinking rivals, said, \u201cYou have to have\n\na concrete plan, you can\u2019t just speak in generalities.\u201d\n\nHe said he would raise the US retirement age by two years over the next two and a half decades.\n\nBobby Jindal\n\nBobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor, seemed unimpressed by the cost-cutting credentials of his rivals.\n\nAsked by the Telegraph what his unique selling point was, he replied: \u201cI have the backbone to get this done.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of good talkers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSAGenre": "republicans", "twitter": {"player": {"width": 560, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/player.swf?keepEmbedCode=true&autoplay=1&embedCode=BnazJvdjp9j-ptgHwW-UJyhvmn9sw1u6&adSetCode=b20883587d124da4a8f29205f8be38ea", "height": 315}, "image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03396/repub1_3396698k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "player", "creator": "@davidgmillward"}, "keywords": "republicans, forum, new hampshire, ted cruz, marco rubio, jeb bush, rand paul, lindsay graham, Republicans,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Home;News;World_News;Republicans;David_Millward", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/republicans", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Video", "news_keywords": "republicans, forum, new hampshire, ted cruz, marco rubio, jeb bush, rand paul, lindsay graham", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Republicans pledge balanced budget, end to Obamacare and immigration curbs", "section-id": 2335, "GSACategory": "worldnews", "tmgads.pagetype": "video", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-republicans", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/republicans", "GSAArticleType": "Video", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "Donald Trump notable absentee as 14 presidential candidates present their case \n  in key state of New Hampshire", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 11781743, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2015-08-04", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-republicans", "last-modified": "2015-08-04", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "video", "section": "World", "wordcount": 816, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "David Millward", "tag": "David Millward", "subsection": "Republicans", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 6, "imagecount": 6, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 11781743, "tmgads.articleid": 11781743, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Donald Trump notable absentee as 14 presidential candidates present their case   in key state of New Hampshire", "title": "Republicans pledge balanced budget, end to Obamacare and immigration curbs", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/republicans/11781743/Republicans-pledge-balanced-budget-end-to-Obamacare-and-immigration-curbs.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03396/repub1_3396698k.jpg", "type": "video.other"}, "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Republicans pledge balanced budget, end to Obamacare and immigration curbs \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/republicans/11781743/Republicans-pledge-balanced-budget-end-to-Obamacare-and-immigration-curbs.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03396/repub1_3396698k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"11781743\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-08-04T03:58:54Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"David Millward\"],\"tags\": [\"Video\",\"Home\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"Republicans\",\"David Millward\"]}", "tmgads.videosrc": "tmg", "DCSext.Genre": "republicans", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.republicans", "DCSext.author": "David Millward", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2015-08-04 04:08"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2bc\"", "article_summary": "For Rick Perry, the Texas governor, and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, the key issue was immigration.\nTed Cruz and familyAll on the stage -
