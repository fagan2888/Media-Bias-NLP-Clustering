Authorities arrested multiple people in Stillwater accused of printing more than $10,000 worth of counterfeit money this week. Investigators had been looking into at least 20 complaints of counterfeit $5, $10, $20, and $50 bills being used at local businesses, convenience stores and to buy items for sale on Craigslist.

Wednesday, detectives served a search warrant at 3912 Yorkshire and said they found six counterfeit $20 bills and synthetic marijuana, meth and drug paraphernalia.

Authorities said Thomas Jay Myers, 19, and Amber Dawn Berg, 26, were arrested at that residence. During an interview, police said, Myers told investigators he obtained the counterfeit cash from a man who went by ‘Uncle Curtis.'

Investigators said when another man, Ronnie Crandall returned to that residence, he was arrested for Forgery in the Second Degree.

Also arrested at the scene was another man living at that residence who police said they found a hydroponic marijuana grow in his bedroom.

Another search warrant was served on Thursday at 3202 W. 29th Court, where detectives said they recovered more than $10,500.00 in counterfeit money. Detectives said they also recovered meth, a printer, paper, and clippings and items investigators said were used to complete the counterfeiting process.

As for ‘Uncle Curtis,' police said he was identified as Curtis Gregory Robles, 38, and he is still at large. Authorities said Robles is a fugitive from justice and has an active US Marshall's arrest warrant for a probation violation.
