The good news: Denver is likely to get one in 2015-16, the sources said.\n\nIf Denver had hosted an outdoor game this winter, it would have been part of the NHL\u2019s Coors Light Stadium Series, as the 2015 Winter Classic will be played in Washington, most likely at Nationals Park.\n\nWhether Denver will host the Winter Classic or a Stadium Series game has yet to be determined.\n\nCoors Field is the most likely venue for an outdoor game, a natural sponsorship tie-in to the beer company that is one of the league\u2019s biggest advertisers.\n\nOutdoor games have become a huge ratings and financial success for the NHL since the first Winter Classic in 2008 in Buffalo, N.Y.
