From the Times:\n\nDavid McDonald was hired despite admitting to sheriff's investigators he had a relationship with a 14-year-old girl whom he kissed and groped. He was 28 at the time. \"I was in love,\" he said in an interview with The Times. \"I wasn't being a bad guy.\"\n\nIn another case, Linda Bonner was given a job after revealing that she used her department-issued weapon to shoot at her husband as he ran away from her during an argument. He wasn't hit; he was lucky he was running in a zigzag pattern, she told investigators, because if not the end result \"would have been a whole lot different.\"\n\nThe Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs (ALADS), the union that represents LASD deputies,tried in September 2013 to stop the records from being unveiled, going after the Times and the reporter who had acquired the records, Robert Faturechi, saying he unlawfully possessed background investigation files containing personal information of deputies.\n\n\"What part of 'stolen property' is such a mystery to the L.A. Times?\" ALADS President Floyd Hayhurst said in a statement on the ALADS website. \"If any harm comes to deputy sheriffs or their families because of the stolen files, we will hold the Los Angeles Times responsible for their complete lack of journalistic integrity,\" Hayhurst said.\n\nFrom the Times in September:\n\nThe Times' lawyers contended deputies\u2019 privacy rights or speculation about threats to their safety could not justify a violation of free-speech rights. The newspaper\u2019s attorneys also wrote that the union had no basis for seeking an emergency order, noting that The Times has published other stories based on information from employment records in the past. The Times reported in October on the department's hiring of employees who had personal ties to top officials or Sheriff Lee Baca himself despite histories of violence and brushes with the law. In August, the Sheriff\u2019s Department announced in a press release that it launched a criminal investigation into the leak of personal information to a Times reporter.\n\nFor more on the LASD and misconduct in the department, read and watch LA County Sheriff's Hassle Photographer, Trample Constitution, Get Lauded by Bosses:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/12/01/la-times-publishes-leaked-information-on", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "A Los Angeles Times investigation revealed December 2 that the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department (LASD) hired numerous problem officers in 2010, including", "title": "LA Times Publishes Info on Faulty Sheriff's Department Hiring; Officers' Union Tried to Stop Report"}, "twitter": {"description": "A\nLos Angeles Times investigation\nrevealed December 2 that the Los\nAngeles Sheriff\u2019s Department (LASD) hired\nnumerous problem officers in 2010, including individuals who had\nhistories of misconduct at other law enforcement agencies, had\nsolicited prostitutes, falsified police records and unlawfully\ndischarged firearms.\nThe leaked information reviewed by the Times included taped\ninterviews with applicants as well as hiring investigation files\nand provide an inside look at the hiring practices at the nation's\nlargest sheriff\u2019s depa", "title": "LA Times Publishes Info on Faulty Sheriff's Department Hiring; Officers' Union Tried to Stop Report", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PaulDetrick"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Reasontv", "published_time": "2013-12-02T00:45:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/paul-detrick"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3422\"", "article_summary": "In August, the Sheriff\u2019s Department announced in a press release that it launched a criminal investigation into the leak of personal information to a Times reporter.\nThe leaked information reviewed by the Times included taped interviews with applicants as well as hiring investigation files and provide an inside look at the hiring practices at the nation's largest sheriff\u2019s department.\nA Los Angeles Times investigation revealed December 2 that the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department (LASD) hired numerous problem officers in 2010, including individuals who had histories of misconduct at other law enforcement agencies, had solicited prostitutes, falsified police records and unlawfully discharged firearms.\n\"If any harm comes to deputy sheriffs or their families because of the stolen files, we will hold the Los Angeles Times responsible for their complete lack of journalistic integrity,\" Hayhurst said.\nFor more on the LASD and misconduct in the department, read and watch LA County Sheriff's Hassle Photographer, Trample Constitution, Get Lauded by Bosses:"}
