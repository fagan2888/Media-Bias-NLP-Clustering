On Monday, Volcker called for a complete overhaul of the financial regulatory system.\n\nRelated: The Spectacular Too Big Failure of Dodd-Frank\n\nVolcker made his mark as Fed chairman in the early 1980s by pushing interest rates sky high in a successful bid to combat runaway inflation. More recently he advised President Obama on the financial crisis and had a hand in designing a controversial provision of Dodd-Frank.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank law, named for former Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) and former Representative Barney Frank (D-MA), provided the most sweeping revision of the consumer and finance rules since the Great Depression.\n\nHowever, it left unaddressed the system of regulation in which a vast array of agencies with acronyms like SEC, CFTC and FDIC were charged with overseeing different types of banks and financial institutions.\n\nVolcker insists there is considerable unfinished business that must be addressed to avoid another financial crisis down the road. In remarks delivered in Washington he described the current financial regulatory system as highly fractured and piecemeal in design.\n\nRelated: The 5 Best and 5 Worst Regulations in Dodd-Frank\n\nVolcker proposed a complete makeover of the U.S. financial regulatory structure \u2013 including both a streamlining and consolidation of myriad federal regulatory agencies.\n\n\u201cThe system for regulating financial institutions in the United States is highly fragmented, outdated and ineffective,\u201d Volcker said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Volcker Alliance, a public policy group led by Volcker, issued today\u2019s report on the regulation of banks and Wall Street. It found that the government agencies responsible for overseeing the financial system has changed little since the Depression-era 1930s and can\u2019t keep up with a fast-moving industry.\n\n\u201cA multitude of federal agencies, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) and state authorities share oversight of the financial system under a framework riddled with regulatory gaps, loopholes and inefficiencies,\u201d Volcker said.\n\nRelated: Volcker: Wall St. Kills Regs by Running Out the Clock\n\n\u201cWhat is clear today that may not have been evident years ago is that despite the continuing good faith efforts of our professional and skilled regulatory agencies, failure to reorganize the regulatory structure will contribute to the buildup of systemic risk and make us more vulnerable to the next financial crisis,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Volcker Alliance recommends:\n\nThe Federal Reserve would maintain primary responsibility for financial stability and the money supply but would relinquish regulatory responsibilities.\n\nA new, independent Prudential Supervisory Authority would assume the oversight functions now exercised by the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for banks, and by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for brokerage firms, money market funds and futures dealers.\n\nThe SEC, the primary regulator of the securities markets, and the CFTC, which oversees futures and options markets and exchanges, would be merged.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With Wall Street, the banking community and conservative lawmakers still bitterly comp", "title": "How Volcker Would Overhaul Wall Street Watchdogs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/20/How-Volcker-Would-Overhaul-Wall-Street-Watchdogs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03042013_paul_volcker_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/20/How-Volcker-Would-Overhaul-Wall-Street-Watchdogs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03042013_paul_volcker_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With Wall Street, the banking community and conservative lawmakers still bitterly comp", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6e8\"", "article_summary": "The Volcker Alliance, a public policy group led by Volcker, issued today\u2019s report on the regulation of banks and Wall Street.\nOn Monday, Volcker called for a complete overhaul of the financial regulatory system.\nIn remarks delivered in Washington he described the current financial regulatory system as highly fractured and piecemeal in design.\nRelated: Volcker: Wall St.\nMore recently he advised President Obama on the financial crisis and had a hand in designing a controversial provision of Dodd-Frank."}
