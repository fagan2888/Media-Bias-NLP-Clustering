She is the director of the criminal and juvenile justice program.\n\nSo, I want to start by playing you a clip \u2014 an excerpt from what President Obama said earlier this week, describing impoverished communities across the country that he said he had been stripped of opportunity.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Where children are born into abject poverty; they\u2019ve got parents \u2014 often because of substance-abuse problems or incarceration or lack of education themselves \u2014 can\u2019t do right by their kids.\n\nCommunities where there are no fathers who can provide guidance to young men.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Is that a fair picture of what life is like in Sandtown-Winchester, that area?\n\nTARA HUFFMAN, OPEN SOCIETY INSTITUTE-BALTIMORE: Yes, I would say that\u2019s a very fair picture of what life is like in Sandtown-Winchester.\n\nIf you look at the history of housing policy in Baltimore City, you\u2019ll see that in the 1910s and \u201820s and \u201830s, there were a series of city ordinances and restrictive covenants and mortgage red lining that locked African-American families out of resource-rich neighborhoods and into resource-poor neighborhoods.\n\nThen, through the \u201850s, and the \u201860s, and the \u201870s, those same neighborhoods were displaced.\n\nUp to 20,000 families displaced so that the city could build new highways and new schools and new housing projects.\n\nAnd then came the loss of jobs in the 1980s, good-paying jobs that didn\u2019t require a lot of education but that went away with the manufacturing sector.\n\nAnd then, here comes the 1990s and the 2000s and the drug war that over-policed, over-criminalized and over-incarcerated scores of African-Americans, including those in Sandtown-Winchester.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: You know, you bring up incarceration.\n\nThe rates in these areas are incredibly high, almost seven times the national average. How does that play into and affect the notion of what we consider a family or family life?\n\nTARA HUFFMAN: I like to think of it sort of as a Jenga puzzle. If you\u2019re playing the game of Jenga, you take out one block, the tower still stands.\n\nYou take out another block, the tower still stands, but eventually, you remove too many blocks and the whole thing comes crumbling down.\n\nWhen you pull out too many people from that community, particularly too many African American men from that community and expect that the community is going to be better, your approach is flawed.\n\nYou cannot continue to incarcerate that many people from a community and not expect the community to suffer.\n\nAnd then after some period of time, release those same people back into that community, but now they have a criminal history that\u2019s going to prevent them from getting employment, finding decent housing, and beating kind of men and fathers and brothers and sons that they want to be and that everyone expects them to be.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK. I want to read you some comments here, also, from Rand Paul, who\u2019s a senator and also presidential candidate, made during the protest in Baltimore this week.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere\u2019s so many things we can talk about. You know, the breakdown of the family structure, the lack of fathers, the lack of sort of a moral code in our society.\u201d\n\nYour reaction to that?\n\nTARA HUFFMAN: We cannot talk about breakdown of families and breakdown of the moral code without also talking about government\u2019s role in either investing in these families and these communities or not investing in these families and these communities.\n\nSo, if you want to improve a Sandtown-Winchester, if you want to prevent another Freddie Gray, then what it\u2019s going to take is not just investment \u2014 because investments have happened in Sandtown-Winchester, but they\u2019ve been piecemeal and they\u2019ve been pilot projects, not part of a comprehensive investment strategy.\n\nAnd it pales in comparison to the kinds of investment we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the city, particularly downtown and those surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re going to invest, then they have to be targeted investments that deliberately dismantle years of structural racism and inequality in those communities.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right.
