LOWELL, Mass. (AP) - Law enforcement is investigating after one of two patients involved in a shoving match at a Lowell rehabilitation center died when he fell and struck his head on the floor.

A spokeswoman for the Middlesex district attorney’s office tells The Sun (http://bit.ly/1LpUqAt ) that police were called to the Lowell Health Care Center on Sunday after a patient identified as 56-year-old Anthony Mazzurco was injured.

Mazzurco was taken to Lowell General Hospital/Saints Campus, and then transferred to Tufts Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead Sunday night.

The name of the other patient involved has not been made public because no charges have been filed.

According to its website the health care center is a 160-bed facility that provides treatment to people with brain injuries, Huntington’s disease, and other neurological disorders.
