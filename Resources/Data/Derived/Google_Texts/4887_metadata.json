When he brings it back, it would take two thirds of the Senate to vote it down because of the way they set up the parliamentary system,\u201d Pratt told WND.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, debate is made even more bizarre by the intense secrecy surrounding the proposed treaty. A Politico article described the hoops lawmakers must jump through just to see the bill.\n\n\u201cIf you want to hear the details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the Obama administration is hoping to pass, you\u2019ve got to be a member of Congress, and you\u2019ve got to go to classified briefings and leave your staff and cellphone at the door,\u201d stated the article by Edward-Isaac Dovere.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a member who wants to read the text, you\u2019ve got to go to a room in the basement of the Capitol Visitor Center and be handed it one section at a time, watched over as you read, and forced to hand over any notes you make before leaving,\u201d Dovere continued. \u201cAnd no matter what, you can\u2019t discuss the details of what you\u2019ve read.\u201d\n\nPratt is appalled that the public is getting no chance to weigh in on TPP.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible. This is the administration that advertised itself as the most transparent that there ever would be. Give me a break. This is really going to the other extreme. Where is the objection just on procedure, let alone any of the details,\u201d said Pratt.\n\nIf the terms of TPP are under lock and key, how does Pratt know that Obama is poised to restrict ammunition imports?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s there. I\u2019m just assuming that a guy that\u2019s done everything he can heretofore with his pen, as he said he would do, will do it again when he\u2019s given a blank check,\u201d said Pratt, who says Second Amendment defenders aren\u2019t the only ones who should be worried.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just guns. We could be talking about any number of other subjects where the president could just go hog wild,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who say, \u2018Just because you haven\u2019t seen the treaty, why are you objecting?\u2019 Wait a minute, the only time anybody will be able to see the treaty is when it\u2019s too late to do anything.\u201d\n\nFor Pratt, this comes down to Congress placing faith in a president who has proven he\u2019s unworthy of it.\n\n\u201cFirearms Guide: 5th Edition\u201d is the world\u2019s most extensive firearms, ammunition and air guns reference guide and gun schematics library on DVD for Windows PC. Get yours today at the WND Superstore.\n\n\u201cThis is a president who can\u2019t be trusted to do anything. We know that. He\u2019s not a truthful man. The idea that they would give him a blank check that he could write all kinds of firearms import and export restrictions into a treaty with Pacific nations, what are they thinking?\u201d asked Pratt.\n\nPratt says he\u2019s generally supportive of free trade. He says there is a simple solution to this problem but lawmakers don\u2019t seem interested in it.\n\n\u201cAmend it now, while it\u2019s in a regular bill fashion and send him his authority minus gun-grabbing opportunity. So far all we get back is crickets,\u201d said Pratt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little upsetting to me that we have such a compliant, supine Congress that the president, apparently rightly, figures he can just wrap around his finger and do what he wants,\u201d he said.\n\nThe gun lobby has been very effective at beating back previous Obama administration attempts at gun control.\n\nA Democratically-controlled Senate failed to approve expanded background checks in 2013. A few months ago, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, sought to ban certain types of ammunition, particularly those commonly used in AR-15s. An avalanche of public opposition forced the ATF to back off.\n\nBut Pratt isn\u2019t so sure about the outcome of this battle. Do gun rights supporters have the votes to stop or change TPP?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we do in the Senate and I\u2019m not sure about the House,\u201d he said, urging Americans to get involved in lobbying their members of Congress.\n\n\u201cThis horse is standing right by the door, ready to bolt. Hopefully people are going to be stepping up their contacts with members of Congress. I\u2019m fairly confident predicting that if we give the president an opportunity to stick it to the Second Amendment, he will do it,\u201d said Pratt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Congress is being urged to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade plan even though most have not read it, and a leading gun-rights activist says the plan could give President Obama the power to limit the importation of ammunition and implement his political agenda in many different ways. \u201cFast track authority in the context of this [\u2026]", "title": "Congress giving Obama \u2018blank check\u2019 for gun control", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/05/congress-giving-obama-blank-check-for-gun-control/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/02/obamaexecorder1.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The gun lobby has been very effective at beating back previous Obama administration attempts at gun control.\n\u201cFast track authority in the context of this treaty means a blank check,\u201d said Gun Owners of America Executive Director Larry Pratt.\n\u201cBy a majority vote, the Congress is preparing to give the president authorization to negotiate a treaty.\nIf the terms of TPP are under lock and key, how does Pratt know that Obama is poised to restrict ammunition imports?\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, debate is made even more bizarre by the intense secrecy surrounding the proposed treaty."}
