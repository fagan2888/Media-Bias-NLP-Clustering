Scott Walker\u2019s labor reforms, is now a member of Association of American Educators, a non-union professional organization.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I had a choice to leave the union, I did,\u201d Rosno said. \u201cNEA and AFT are losing members, and the loss in membership is a direct result of their involvement in political agendas that do not relate to education.\u201d\n\nMaryland teacher Vann Prime, another AAE member, agreed with Rosno that Eskelsen and Weingarten do a disservice to teachers by supporting The Progressive Agenda and similar political campaigns.\n\n\u201cActions like signing on to The Progressive Agenda are exactly why I refuse to belong to the AFT and the NEA,\u201d Prime said in an email to Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cRegardless of their politics, most American teachers simply aren\u2019t interested in being political pawns,\u201d Prime added, bemoaning AFT and NEA\u2019s \u201ccartel-like power over school districts.\u201d\n\nIn most of the states without right-to-work laws, NEA and AFT can take mandatory \u201cfair share\u201d fees from nonmembers. Fair share fees helped AFT pay Weingarten $557,875 last year, and helped NEA pay Eskelsen $345,728.\n\nTeachers who agree with Weingarten\u2019s justifications for backing The Progressive Agenda would likely be shocked by her annual compensation.\n\n\"We're all in this together and we will rise and fall together. Those who create America's prosperity should share in it.\" #p2Agenda \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) May 12, 2015\n\nLike my students used to say, \"It's time to walk the walk and not just talk the talk\" to achieve The #ProgressiveAgenda. #p2Agenda \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) May 12, 2015\n\nThe Progressive Agenda may not be widely supported by the teachers Eskelsen and Weingarten are paid to represent, but it\u2019s incredibly popular among union bosses.\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees president Lee Saunders and Service Employees International Union president Mary Kay Henry both spoke at The Progressive Agenda\u2019s kick-off event last month.\n\nNEA, SEIU, AFT and AFSCME account for nearly half the nation\u2019s union membership. Most of the workers who choose to join \u2014 or are forced to pay fair share fees \u2014 are public employees.\n\nThe Progressive Agenda, Communist Party USA reported, is a coordinated effort to pull Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton further left.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why The Progressive Agenda so strongly resembles the presidential platform of socialist Bernie Sanders, a long-shot challenger to Clinton in the Democratic primary.\n\nThe Progressive Agenda borrows heavily from \u201cThe Progressive Promise,\u201d as well. The Progressive Promise was drafted in the 1990s by Sanders and his Congressional Progressive Caucus, and promoted by Sanders supporters at Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nDSA, the Sanders campaign and Campaign for One New York all failed to respond to requests for comment on the similarities between their various agendas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Teachers union bosses keep fighting for bigger government and redistribution of wealth whether teachers like it or not.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Teachers union bosses keep fighting for bigger government and redistribution of wealth whether teachers like it or not.", "title": "Teacher unions push progressive agenda, but many members aren't on board - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/cspan-eskelsen-garcia-progressive-agenda-2015-05-12.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-12T17:40:15+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/218482/unions-socialist-agenda/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Teachers union bosses keep fighting for bigger government and redistribution of wealth whether teachers like it or not.", "title": "Teacher unions push progressive agenda, but many members aren't on board - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/cspan-eskelsen-garcia-progressive-agenda-2015-05-12.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-06-15T04:00:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-12T17:40:15+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "teachers unions, national education association, nea, american federation of teachers, aft, randi weingarten, lily eskelsen garcia, bernie sanders, progressive agenda"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI see no reason for either union president to endorse the Progressive Agenda,\u201d Wisconsin teacher Amy Rosno said in an email to Watchdog.org.\nThe Progressive Agenda borrows heavily from \u201cThe Progressive Promise,\u201d as well.\nThe Progressive Agenda, Communist Party USA reported, is a coordinated effort to pull Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton further left.\nMaybe that\u2019s why The Progressive Agenda so strongly resembles the presidential platform of socialist Bernie Sanders, a long-shot challenger to Clinton in the Democratic primary.\nTeachers who agree with Weingarten\u2019s justifications for backing The Progressive Agenda would likely be shocked by her annual compensation."}
