That construction project, once completed, will contain up to 50,000 Lego bricks and weigh up to 250 pounds.\n\nTest your memory span\n\nOK, that\u2019s a heavy enough load of bragging about things you probably already knew about our colossal marvel of engineering over the Cooper River.\n\nNow for some bridge-oriented stuff you might not know in a pop quiz, with answers at column\u2019s end. (Hint: All but two of the answers contain the word \u201cbridge\u201d):\n\n1) Name the World War II movie, with a cast including William Holden, Alec Guinness, Sessue Hayakawa and James Donald, about a POW camp in Burma where the Japanese abuse their Anglo-American captives.\n\n2) Name the World War II movie, with a cast including George Segal, Robert Vaughn, Ben Gazzara and Greenville native Bo Hopkins, about a way over the Rhine.\n\n3) Name the World War II movie, with a vast cast including Sean Connery, Maximilian Schell, James Caan, Hardy Kruger, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Robert Redford, Liv Ullman, Dirk Bogarde, Anthony Hopkins and Laurence Olivier, about Operation Market Garden, a failed Allied mission into Holland.\n\n4) Name the movie starring Meryl Streep as a farm wife having an affair with a visiting photographer played by Clint Eastwood.\n\n5) Name the 1970 song that became the best-selling single by a duo that produced eight Top 10 Billboard singles.\n\n6) Name another hit song by that duo that begins with the lyric, \u201cSlow down, you move too fast ...\u201d\n\n7) Name the slogan of President Bill Clinton\u2019s re-election campaign in 1996, the same year he prematurely proclaimed in his State of the Union speech, \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d\n\n8) Name the small stone structure between the 1st and 18th fairways at the Old Course in St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland, where the 144th British Open will continue today and conclude Sunday.\n\n9) Name the 1970 James Brown hit in which \u201cMr. Dynamite\u201d asks, \u201cBobby! Should I take \u2019em to the bridge?\u201d\n\n10) Name the action movie that features not just Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and Jeremy Irons but the old 1929 John P. Grace Memorial Bridge, which is now gone (not to be confused with the new old 1966 Silas N. Pearman Bridge, which is also now gone), over the Cooper River.\n\nA too-often-fatal flaw\n\nThe Ravenel Bridge is spectacular.\n\nBut it should be harder to jump off of that bridge \u2014 the barrier on the water-side edge of the southbound side is less than three feet high.\n\nYes, the pedestrian/bike lane has a railing more than six feet high on the northbound side.\n\nHowever, those who have sunk into deep enough despair to consider ending it all can easily cross all eight motor-vehicle lanes to get to that low southbound barrier.\n\nLowering that risk by raising the difficulty of jumping would make our wonderful bridge even better.\n\nAnswers\n\n1) \u201cThe Bridge on the River Kwai\u201d\n\n2) \u201cThe Bridge at Remagen\u201d\n\n3) \u201cA Bridge Too Far\u201d\n\n4) \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d\n\n5) \u201cBridge over Troubled Water\u201d\n\n6) \u201cThe 59th Street Bridge Song (Feeling Groovy)\u201d\n\n7) \u201cBuilding a Bridge to the 21st Century\u201d\n\n8) The Swilcan Burn Bridge\n\n9) \u201cGet Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\u201d\n\n10) \u201cDie Hard with a Vengeance\u201d\n\nFrank Wooten is assistant editor of The Post and Courier.
