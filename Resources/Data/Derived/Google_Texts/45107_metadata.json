This uniquely American system encourages so-called job lock, in which workers are fearful of migrating to potentially better-paying jobs out of fear of losing access to employer-subsidized access to medicine and doctor\u2019s visits.\n\nIn a study released in March by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Georgetown University labor economists Ammar Farooq and Adriana Kugler found that expanding Medicaid (the U.S. public health insurance program for low-income Americans) to cover more workers would encourage them to take the risks that could lead to better-paying jobs and higher qualities of life.\n\nPhoto: Dimas Ardian/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhen Medicaid generosity rises, workers not only move to riskier occupations and industries but towards better jobs,\u201d Farooq and Kugler said in the report. \u201cWe find that an increase in the Medicaid income threshold increases movement towards occupations and industries with higher median wages.\u201d\n\nThe conclusions suggest that the uniquely American system of employer-provided health insurance discourages low-income Americans from switching jobs, leaving them with health insurance but little opportunity to get raises or promotions.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010 and upheld by a landmark Supreme Court ruling two years later, expanded coverage, but still keeps employers largely the gatekeepers of most workers\u2019 access to life-extending healthcare. Millions of Americans still remain either uninsured because their wages are too low to afford premiums, or they have insurance but can\u2019t afford the out-of-pocket expenses of the plans they can afford.\n\nThe economists examined different Medicaid thresholds (the maximum amount of money a workers can make before he or she is no longer eligible for state health insurance) and found a correlation between higher Medicaid eligibility and the number of low-income workers who switched jobs that had greater wage spreads.\n\nIn other words, if more low-income workers had health coverage that wasn\u2019t beholden to their employers, the more likely they would be to take jobs that either pay more or offer more opportunity for raises and promotions.\n\nThe research offers evidence the country\u2019s system of employer-provided health insurance is hampering not only the ability for low-income hourly wage workers to move up the wage ladder, but could also be hampering productivity of these workers locked into jobs that don\u2019t adequately exploit their experience and skills.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "medicaid expansion, employer provided health care", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Many low-income Americans would likely get better-paying jobs if health insurance wasn\u2019t tethered to place of employment, researchers say.", "title": "Expanding Medicaid Eligibility Would Help Low-Income Workers Find Better Jobs: Study", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/expanding-medicaid-eligibility-would-help-low-income-workers-find-better-jobs-study-2349605", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/06/amed5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many low-income Americans would likely get better-paying jobs if health insurance wasn\u2019t tethered to place of employment, researchers say.", "title": "Expanding Medicaid Eligibility Would Help Low-Income Workers Find Better Jobs: Study", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/expanding-medicaid-eligibility-would-help-low-income-workers-find-better-jobs-study-2349605", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/06/amed5.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/04/06/amed5.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2016-04-06T22:33:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-09T16:57:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Many low-income Americans would likely get better-paying jobs if health insurance wasn\u2019t tethered to place of employment, researchers say."}, "article_summary": "But a recent study suggests more Americans would be emboldened to switch jobs if their access to health insurance wasn\u2019t tethered to their employers.\nPhoto: Dimas Ardian/Bloomberg via Getty Images\u201cWhen Medicaid generosity rises, workers not only move to riskier occupations and industries but towards better jobs,\u201d Farooq and Kugler said in the report.\nIn other words, if more low-income workers had health coverage that wasn\u2019t beholden to their employers, the more likely they would be to take jobs that either pay more or offer more opportunity for raises and promotions.\nThe economists examined different Medicaid thresholds (the maximum amount of money a workers can make before he or she is no longer eligible for state health insurance) and found a correlation between higher Medicaid eligibility and the number of low-income workers who switched jobs that had greater wage spreads.\nContinue Reading BelowThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010 and upheld by a landmark Supreme Court ruling two years later, expanded coverage, but still keeps employers largely the gatekeepers of most workers\u2019 access to life-extending healthcare."}
