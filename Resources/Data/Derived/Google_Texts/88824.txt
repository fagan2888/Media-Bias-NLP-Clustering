Obama: Voters want ‘new car smell’ in 2016, Hillary would be ‘great president’

President Obama still has two years left in office, but with the GOP overhaul in the midterms and his waning popularity, most people are already looking to 2016. Including, it seems, Obama himself.

He said the best part of running for president after a two-term president is that “you can stake out your own positions” apart from your Democratic successor and have a “fresh start.”

“I think the American people, you know, they’re gonna want– you know, that new car smell. (LAUGHTER) You know, their own– they– they wanna drive somethin’ off the lot that– that doesn’t have as– as much mileage as me,” Obama told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday morning.

But his claims of Americans wanting a fresh face seemed to directly contract his almost-endorsement of former Secretary of State and likely 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton.

Stephanopoulos noted Clinton’s support for Obama’s immigration executive order and asked if the two would be coordinating on her strategy for running for president.

“Well, she hasn’t announced so I don’t wanna jump the gun,” Obama said. “I can tell you a couple things. Number one, she was an outstanding secretary of State. Number two, she’s a friend.”

He said the two still talk regularly.

“Number three– I think– she– and– and a number of other– possible Democratic candidates, would be terrific presidents,” Obama continued.

“A number of other?” Stephanopoulos questioned. Clinton’s name is really the only one being batted around as a serious contender in the media.

Obama said that he just wants to make sure a Democrat is in office after him, but then gave Clinton a glowing recommendation.

“If she decides to run, I think she will be a formidable candidate and I think she’d be a great president,” he said.
