America elected a president who advocated retreat, who cheered America\u2019s Islamic enemies, who pandered to them and did everything possible to enable Islamic terrorism.\n\nOn the eve of the 14th anniversary of 9/11, Barack Obama and the Party of Treason made it possible for the United States to fund the world\u2019s premiere sponsor of international terrorism, Iran.\n\nNow Europe, which stood with America after 9/11, and America are opening the door to not only the next 9/11 but multiple 9/11 attacks. Europe is opening its borders to any so-called refugee that reaches its shores. Amazingly enough, 75 percent of the so-called \u201crefugees\u201d that are coming through are young men.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry whined that America was not taking enough refugees so now the United States is going to welcome in 10,000 Syrian refugees. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nEvery one of these so-called \u201crefugees\u201d is going to be Muslim. Syrian Christians have long complained that the United States will not accept them.\n\nIn Europe, the Muslim refugees are rampaging. In Hungary, as police and military members gave the refugees water and food, the refugees scream screw you,\u201d and \u201cAllah akbar\u201d while they threw away the food and water. How many jihadist candidates are among that bunch? Barack Obama wants to welcome the same people into America. How many Mohammad Atta\u2019s or Dzhokhar Tzarnaev\u2019s does he want to bring into America?\n\nLiberals demand we bring in refugees because of America\u2019s history of charity. America has been a charitable nation. But charity is not a suicide pact. Charity does not mean we have to bring refugees here to America.\n\nIf the left wants to talk about charity, let\u2019s start at home. All of those refugees brought into America will almost immediately be eligible for work permits. They will be competing with Americans for jobs. According to the most recent government statistics, 94 million Americans are out of the work force. Labor force participation rates are at a new low and the size of the labor force is now the same size it was in 1977.\n\nEven worse, 75 percent of the households on welfare in America are immigrant households. America is broke. The nation is borrowing money as fast as it can and where is this money going? It is going to pay for welfare for those who came to America just to get welfare!\n\nWhen is a political party and a serious presidential candidate going to come out with a Put Americans First strategy? Welcoming in a large number of potential terrorists does not put Americans first. Welcoming in a large number of refugees, who will now compete in the job market with Americans for jobs, does not put Americans first. Welcoming in a large number of refugees, many of whom will use welfare and other benefits, does not put Americans first.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the Gulf States are not taking any of these refugees. Saudi Arabia has offered to build them mosques in Germany though. Here is a better idea. American wealth and American blood as been spent to keep them safe. It is time they start paying it back. Instead of sending us the so-called \u201crefugees,\u201d instead America and Europe should tell the Saudis and the Gulf States, they are taking them. Not only that, but that they are paying for them as well.\n\nIt is time we put America and Americans first. Bringing thousands of jihadists to America doesn\u2019t do that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fourteen years after Sept. 11, 2001, the scars have not faded but the reality of 9/11 has faded.
