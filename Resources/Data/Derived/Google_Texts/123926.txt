Q.: How do I switch industries?

Figure out what your value-add is in the thing you’re doing and go pitch that to the next industry. So if you’ve been really good at sales in telecom and now you want to go do media, pitch the fact that you can open doors that others can’t, or whatever they happen to be looking for — that is always a good way to switch.

The other way to switch is to figure out a problem that one industry is having and come at it another way. Then say [to companies in that sector] ‘I know how to solve that problem.’

The third way is just network. Most jobs come from your network of friends and letting people know that you’re interested in switching and being willing to take something that may be slightly below what you were doing [before.] If you really want to do it, get yourself in, because a strong performer will move up really quickly.

I’ve switched more than most. I’ve been in consumer, financial services, tax. I started as a copier salesman at IBM. That was my first job in college. I wanted to work on Wall Street. I just called a couple CEOs and said, ‘I’m really good at sales and I don’t want to keep taking the paper out of the copier anymore.’ I kept working my network and I went from selling copiers to working on Wall Street selling stocks.
