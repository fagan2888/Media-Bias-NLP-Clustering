Sanders drew cheers with his populist message, including criticizing income inequality.\n\nElizabeth Gaffney, a high school teacher from Baxter, has already heard Bernie Sanders, once in Ames, and again on the soapbox at the State Fair.\n\nShe is new to Democratic politics.\n\n\u201cI used to be a Republican,\u201d Gaffney says. \u201cBernie\u2019s made me a convert.\u201d\n\nGaffney has big student loans so she likes Sanders's plan to refinance student debt. And she loves the fact that Sanders is running his campaign on small contributions. Sanders got some of the loudest cheers of the night on that score.\n\n\u201cMy campaign is the only non-billionaire campaign that doesn\u2019t have a Super PAC,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cI won\u2019t name names.\u201d\n\nSomeone shouted back, \u201cYou\u2019re not for sale.\u201d\n\nSanders ran through his goals to aid the struggling and not, in his words, the powerful and greedy, including a higher minimum wage, family leave, fairer incarceration, and more affordable education and health care.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s income inequality.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a huge distribution of wealth in this country for the last 30 years,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cTrouble is it\u2019s been in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nSanders adds that one-tenth of one percent of the population holds most of the nation\u2019s wealth.\n\nOutside the auditorium Tizzy Hyatt of Colfax did a brisk business in Sanders paraphernalia.\n\n\u201cWould you like a button or a bumper sticker or a lovely yard sign?\u201d Hyatt asks. \u201cOr the t-shirts are 20 dollars.\u201d\n\nSamantha Myers wore a Bernie Sanders shirt. She moved to Des Moines from Great Britain 12 years ago, but this is the first time she\u2019s gotten politically involved in America. Sanders\u2019s views on income inequality resonate with her. And she says Sanders has given the same straight answers for his entire political career.\n\nMyers is all-in, even canvassing door to door.\n\n\u201cPeople in Iowa are so nice,\u201d Myers says. \u201cNo one\u2019s been nasty to me yet. The worst I\u2019ve heard is that people are undecided.\u201d\n\nMeghan Davis, a Presbyterian minister in Newton, is one of those undecideds. She was a fan of both Bill and Hillary Clinton back when she was in high school.\n\n\u201cI was excited when Hillary ran 8 years ago and I was excited to vote for her this year,\u201d Davis says. \u201cBut I\u2019m impressed with Bernie. I\u2019m very conflicted at this point.\u201d\n\nDavis says she\u2019d love to see the first woman president but she\u2019d also like to see the first socialist president.\n\nSanders says he\u2019ll be up with some television advertising soon enough.\n\n\u201cWe will be outspent but we will have the money and you will see our 30 second ads on TV like everybody else,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cMaybe not quite as many.\u201d\n\nSanders praised the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act, but said it doesn\u2019t go far enough. He favors government-sponsored single-payer health care.\n\nEarlier in the day Sanders addressed immigration reform at the Latino Heritage festival in Des Moines. Democratic presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley was scheduled to address the festival on Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"category": "2016 Elections", "description": "About 300 people turned out in Newton Saturday night to hear Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who is on a two-day weekend campaign swing", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://iowapublicradio.org/post/bernie-sanders-powerful-and-greedy", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/ipr/files/styles/medium/public/201509/sanders_photo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "About 300 people turned out in Newton Saturday night to hear Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who is on a two-day weekend campaign swing", "title": "Bernie Sanders on the \"Powerful and the Greedy\""}, "story_id": 443884228, "twitter": {"site": "@IowaPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@IowaPublicRadio"}, "author": "Joyce Russell", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Bernie Sanders on the &quot;Powerful and the Greedy&quot;"}, "nid": 64172, "datePublished": "2015-09-27", "keywords": ", ,", "wordCount": 733, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOr the t-shirts are 20 dollars.\u201dSamantha Myers wore a Bernie Sanders shirt.\nElizabeth Gaffney, a high school teacher from Baxter, has already heard Bernie Sanders, once in Ames, and again on the soapbox at the State Fair.\nAbout 300 people turned out in Newton Saturday night to hear Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who is on a two-day weekend campaign swing through the state.\n\u201cMy campaign is the only non-billionaire campaign that doesn\u2019t have a Super PAC,\u201d Sanders says.\nAnd she loves the fact that Sanders is running his campaign on small contributions."}
