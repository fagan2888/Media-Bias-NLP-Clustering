The teen pregnancy rate across the Nation and Wyoming is declining... But in Fremont County, the rates are on the rise.

The teen pregnancy rate in Fremont County has risen almost 15% from 2005 to 2012. The current rate is about 70 teen births per 1000.

“It's kind of hard to understand why statistically we're having more teen pregnancies when in fact, because of potential coverage out there, prevention, we should be having less,” says Patricia DeClue, Lander Medical Clinic

DeClue says it's frustrating as a medical provider to see the rising rates because through the Affordable Care Act... Birth control is easier to get.

“There's been comments like, I just want to have someone that loves me and having a baby is a way to have someone that loves me. So you know, there's those things that our society's actually letting it become more acceptable,” says DeClue

According to a study from the Wyoming Department of Health, only 50% of teen mothers receive a high school diploma by the age of 22 and less than 2% earn a bachelor's degree by age 30. Babies born to teens are more likely to have a low birth rate, more likely to repeat a grade, and more likely to become a teen mother.

“We're seeing higher pregnancy rates among Hispanics as well as Native Americans, being much higher than the white pregnancy rates, so and that could also be a question of access,” says Jamie Cardine, Fremont County Family Planning

Cardine says through Fremont County Family Planning, nurses are trying to raise awareness for different forms of birth control.

“For teenagers they're really starting to push the long acting removable methods that last anywhere from 3 to 10 years. So that could get a teenager through high school and possibly even college,” says Cardine.

In 2012, the national rate of teen pregnancy was about 30 births per 1000 girls and in Wyoming it was a little under 35 births per 1000 girls.
