A post at Ace of Spades HQ today caught the attention of Fox News’ Brit Hume, who called a loaded Pew poll question “as bad as it gets.”

As Ace reports, the Pew poll determined that most Americans, even those opposed to Obamacare, want their congressmen to “Do what they can to make the law work as well as possible.” The problem is that the only other possible answer was to “Do what they can to make the law fail.”

Ace writes:

Pew gave them a binary choice between “doing what they can to make the law work” and actively working to subvert and sabotage the law, and they present it as a meaningful bit of data that 30% supported the former choice, and only 19% the latter. … Most people would still choose a less aggressive, underhanded-sounding response, like “Let it collapse under its own weight.” But Pew refuses respondents that choice, insisting that people either declare their desire to “make Obamacare work the best we can, by Golly!” or declare themselves hostage-taking terrorists of the sort often decried by one Harry Reid.

@Heminator That's like the Bloomberg question that had two positive and one negative option. Random selection would result in 2/3 favor. — Joseph Ryan (@jmotivator) March 25, 2014
