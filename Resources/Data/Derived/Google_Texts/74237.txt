The state legislature is offering some relief to people whose health insurance comes with a large family deductible.

Assembly Bill 1305 won final approval in the legislature Thursday. It would require all family health plans to include a per-individual deductible and a per-individual out-of-pocket limit.

As of now, some family policies require individual family members to reach separate deductibles, while others make individuals reach a much larger family deductible.

Covered California already requires this for plans sold on the state insurance exchange.

Assembly member Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) wrote the bill, and Gov. Jerry Brown has until Oct. 11 to sign or veto it.
