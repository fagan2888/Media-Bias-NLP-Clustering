But why does it matter to us \u2014 and why are we called to celebrate its octocentenary?\n\nThe Heritage Foundation explains:\n\nMagna Carta \u2013 the Great Charter \u2013 is one of the foundational documents in Anglo-American legal history. Ironically, it began, not as a statement of principle, like our Declaration of Independence, but as a peace treaty. Signed on June 15, 1215, in a field at Runnymede, England, Magna Carta sought to end the barons\u2019 rebellion against King John by forcing the crown to adhere to the laws and customs of the realm. Magna Carta was initially thought to be a failure because King John repudiated the treaty almost before the ink was dry. But time has been good to the Great Charter. In fact, it is difficult to overstate the importance of Magna Carta in the development of Anglo-American law. English law treats it as \u201cthe Bible of the English Constitution.\u201d The American Framers used the phrases \u201cthe law of the land\u201d or \u201cdue process of law\u201d in numerous important contemporary legal documents, including statutes passed by colonial assemblies, resolutions enacted by the Continental Congress, the Declaration of Independence, and state constitutions. Magna Carta has come to stand as proof that a written document can make important revisions to the law, fend off tyrannical government officials, restrain even the sovereign\u2019s power, and grant rights to the entire community, not merely to certain favored individuals \u2013 an enduring legacy that helped to establish \u201cthe rule of law.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, property rights.\n\nDaniel Hannan, who is a bestselling author and long-serving member of the European Parliament, spoke about the importance of the charter last Wednesday at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nAmong other things, he explained why the Magna Carta was such a revolutionary invention, becoming, in some ways, indispensable to the American Founders at the Constitutional Convention in 1787.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on that reedy stretch of river, in my constituency 800 years ago, was the most important bargain struck in the history of mankind,\u201d he intoned. \u201cThis was the first time that [the law was seen] as something bigger than the will of the king.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible now to imagine what a revolutionary ideal that was,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat above the king was something you couldn\u2019t see or hear or touch or taste, but that bound the sovereign as surely as it bound [his subjects]. And in that [document] lies the seeds of all the freedoms that we now regard as modern and rational: Regular elections, jury trials, uncensored newspapers, equality between men and women, habeas corpus.\u201d\n\nAnd so, perhaps not surprisingly, he likened the great English charter to a famous foundational text, one that provides both moral clarity and legal instruction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought of Magna Carta as, if you like, the Torah of the English-speaking peoples,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the text that sets us apart, while at the same time [offers] universal truths for the rest of mankind; something that happened to take place among the English-speaking peoples, but is applicable anywhere if people adopt the same precepts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an extraordinary secular miracle,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one that has a special place for all of us, wherever our ancestors came from, who now speak this language and live in common law societies.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Hannan lamented the fact that the great and imperishable charter had been neglected \u2013 and underappreciated \u2013 for centuries by the English.\n\n\"What an extraordinary oversight that there was never a monument there [in the United Kingdom] until 1957 when a pillar was finally erected...by the American Bar Association,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt last, I am glad to say we have rectified that omission,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cI was very proud to have been involved with the raising of the first British memorial at the place where freedom was born.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"What happened on that reedy stretch of river, in my constituency 800 years ago, was the most important bargain struck in the history of mankind.\".05/27/2016 7:59:20AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"What happened on that reedy stretch of river, in my constituency 800 years ago, was the most important bargain struck in the history of mankind.\"", "title": "Daniel Doherty - UK Conservative: The Magna Carta is the 'Most Important Bargain Struck' in Human History", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/08/02/magna-carta-post-n2032577", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/33/0ce81005-9321-4d33-a207-9975baa075b1.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"What happened on that reedy stretch of river, in my constituency 800 years ago, was the most important bargain struck in the history of mankind.\"", "title": "Daniel Doherty - UK Conservative: The Magna Carta is the 'Most Important Bargain Struck' in Human History", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/08/02/magna-carta-post-n2032577", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/33/0ce81005-9321-4d33-a207-9975baa075b1.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "UK Conservative: The Magna Carta is the 'Most Important Bargain Struck' in Human History, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve always thought of Magna Carta as, if you like, the Torah of the English-speaking peoples,\u201d he said.\nThe Heritage Foundation explains:Magna Carta \u2013 the Great Charter \u2013 is one of the foundational documents in Anglo-American legal history.\nMagna Carta was initially thought to be a failure because King John repudiated the treaty almost before the ink was dry.\nIn fact, it is difficult to overstate the importance of Magna Carta in the development of Anglo-American law.\nEight hundred years ago the Magna Carta was signed and miraculously preserved for all mankind."}
