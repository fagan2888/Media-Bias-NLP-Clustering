She's now preparing to make her first album since the award-winning 2008 relase Running For the Drum. Speaking from her current home in Hawaii, Sainte-Marie gave ICTMN the lowdown on the directon she'll be heading with her new music. This is the second of a three-part series; for the first, which focused on her thoughts about the environment, see Buffy Sainte-Marie on Tar Sands: \"You've Got to Take This Seriously\".\n\nDo you know when your new album is due to come out? Is there a title?\n\nWe haven't decided. I just spent three weeks out on the road in Nashville, Toronto and L.A. auditioning producers, so I have not yet made my choices. I don't know if I'll work with several producers or just one. But I'm sure excited about the music. We're choosing from about 30 different songs. It's going to be fun. It'll be done when it's done!\n\nVideo of Buffy Sainte Marie - No No Keshagesh\n\nYour last album, of course, got a Juno as well as an Aboriginal People's Choice Award (and around that time you were inducted into the Canadian Country Music Association Hall of Fame) -- in many ways, it was a departure from your other work in the immediacy of it.\n\nYou think so? The songs, as always, were very diverse. I wasn't worried about trying to make them all the same. Some of those songs I had in the can for a long time, and some were things I'd written over the years. I'd take something I'd written in my notebook in 1970 and I'll add a second verse in 1980 and I'll finish it last week. That's always how it is for me \u2013 I have a kind of helicopter vision of life itself. I don't think about calendars, deadlines or styles. I just play and sing whatever I dream up. Writing for me is just really, really natural. It's the same as it was when I was a little kid. I hope I'm getting better though!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Buffy Sainte-Marie, of 'Universal Soldier' and 'Up Where We Bleong' fame, discusses the new album she's currently working on.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "jrobertson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/08/where-she-belongs-buffy-sainte-marie-making-first-album-6-years-154362", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/buffy-sainte-marie-band-57-credit-christie-goodwin.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Up Where She Belongs: Buffy Sainte-Marie Making First Album in 6 Years"}, "abstract": "Buffy Sainte-Marie, of 'Universal Soldier' and 'Up Where We Bleong' fame, discusses the new album she's currently working on.", "dc": {"title": "Up Where She Belongs: Buffy Sainte-Marie Making First Album in 6 Years"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/08/where-she-belongs-buffy-sainte-marie-making-first-album-6-years-154362", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Buffy Sainte-Marie, Up Where We Belong, Joe Cocker, An Officer and a Gentleman, Universal Soldier, First Nations Musicians, Native American Musicians", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-04-08T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Up Where She Belongs: Buffy Sainte-Marie Making First Album in 6 Years"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6cc\"", "article_summary": "Canadian-born Cree singer-songwriter Buffy Sainte-Marie is a living legend, famous for such Indigenous anthems as \"Universal Soldier\" and \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.\"\nThis is the second of a three-part series; for the first, which focused on her thoughts about the environment, see Buffy Sainte-Marie on Tar Sands: \"You've Got to Take This Seriously\".\nI'd take something I'd written in my notebook in 1970 and I'll add a second verse in 1980 and I'll finish it last week.\nSome of those songs I had in the can for a long time, and some were things I'd written over the years.\nI don't know if I'll work with several producers or just one."}
