National Women's Health Week Action Plan

National Women’s Health Week is the right time to schedule your yearly visit to your healthcare provider for a well-woman exam. Many women have one or more risk factors for heart disease, which is the top killer of women in the United States today, according to the American Heart Association. If you're at risk, you can take the preventive-care steps to meet your health goals. And early detection of conditions like heart disease and breast cancer can make a difference for successful treatment.

Well-Woman Exam Tips

Because of the Affordable Care Act, most health plans provide for free preventive care visits so you shouldn’t have to worry about the cost. You can see your primary care provider or your ob/gyn, who can advise you about your reproductive health and family planning, too. Your well-woman exam is also an opportunity to catch up on recommended vaccines to protect you from infectious diseases.

Prepare for a Preventive Care Visit

Prepare for your visit by knowing your family history and putting together a list of any medications you're taking. Bring a checklist of any health questions you may have.

Your doctor may recommend tests for heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure and high cholesterol, as well as cancer screenings like mammogram or colonoscopy, depending on your age and risks. You can also get your blood sugar levels and BMI tested as part of preventive care.

Check with your primary care doctor or your ob/gyn to find out which well-woman exam tests are right for you, based on your age and your health history.
