The police investigation led to evidence by accessing cell phones that warranted the teacher being put on involuntary administrative leave.\n\nSince this a personnel matter that involves students the district will not be providing any additional details beyond those released by the police or district attorney. We take this position to preserve the integrity of the ongoing investigation and to protect the privacy rights of MPS students and their families. However, I want to ensure our students and parents that the safety of our students is of the utmost importance. As such, we are continuing to fully cooperate with law enforcement as they move forward with this issue.\n\nI find this incident to be shocking and upsetting. Every day, the Muskogee community and our MPS parents and families entrust us with the care and education of their children. And, every day, 700+ MPS team members come to our schools and campuses to do the right thing for Muskogee\u2019s children.\n\nMPS maintains strong processes to conduct thorough background checks and teacher evaluations. And\u2014as in this case\u2014we will investigate all allegations and take appropriate action to ensure our classrooms and school communities are safe. We also ask families to speak with children about what to do if they feel uncomfortable about any behavior\u2014and to encourage and empower them to report such behavior to responsible adults.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Muskogee Police released additional information about a junior high track coach who was arrested for allegedly making lewd proposals to a 14-year-old girl on his team.", "author": "NewsOn6.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31464712/muskogee-police-say-track-coach-bought-student-underwear-asked-for-photos", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10095742_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Muskogee Police released additional information about a junior high track coach who was arrested for allegedly making lewd proposals to a 14-year-old girl on his team.", "title": "Muskogee Police Say Track Coach Bought Student Underwear, Asked For Photos"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10095742_G.jpg", "description": "Muskogee Police released additional information about a junior high track coach who was arrested for allegedly making lewd proposals to a 14-year-old girl on his team.", "card": "summary", "title": "Muskogee Police Say Track Coach Bought Student Underwear, Asked For Photos"}, "wnreadableurl": "muskogee-police-say-track-coach-bought-student-underwear-asked-for-photos", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/03/14", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "I haven't been told of anything else that's occurred with any other students to date,\" said Muskogee officer, Lincoln Anderson.\nWe take this position to preserve the integrity of the ongoing investigation and to protect the privacy rights of MPS students and their families.\nMuskogee Police released additional information about a junior high track coach who was arrested allegedly making lewd proposals to a 14-year-old girl on his team.\nPolice say Brent Duncan said he bought four pairs of underwear for the student from Victoria's Secret and gave them to her while at school.\nEvery day, the Muskogee community and our MPS parents and families entrust us with the care and education of their children."}
