Credit: Mike De Sisti\n\nBy of the\n\nFor the second consecutive year, an organization of independent physicians in the Milwaukee area led the state in providing care to people covered by Medicare at the lowest cost while meeting targets for quality.\n\nThe physicians \u2014 part of an accountable care organization, or ACO, set up by Independent Physicians Network \u2014 are participating in a Medicare program designed to reward physicians and hospitals when they provide quality care at a lower cost.\n\nThe organization saved Medicare $11.7 million last year, and the physicians will receive $4.4 million of those savings.\n\nThe organization \u2014 Accountable Care Coalition of Southeast Wisconsin LLC \u2014 previously generated $17.7 million in savings from April 2012 through December 2013 and received $8.7 million as its share of the savings. It had been the only accountable care organization in southeastern Wisconsin to receive payments from the program.\n\nThis year, ProHealth Solutions \u2014 an accountable care organization set up by ProHealth Care and independent practices \u2014 saved Medicare $6.4 million and earned $2.8 million as its share of the savings.\n\nIn an accountable care organization, health systems or doctors, or a combination of both, accept responsibility for the cost and quality of care provided to a specific group of patients. The organizations, an outgrowth of the Affordable Care Act, are one of several experiments to test new ways of paying doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.\n\nThe accountable care organization set up by Independent Physicians Network now has outperformed much larger health systems two years in a row. At first glance, it was an unlikely candidate to have the best performance in the state.\n\nIts 350 physicians, who were gauged on the care provided to 11,400 people, have limited influence on the care provided by specialists or hospitals. And unlike health systems, its physicians don't work on one system for electronic health records.\n\nBruce Herman, an internist and geriatrician who practices in Thiensville, attributed the accountable care organization's success to focusing on the basics.\n\n\"That's the only thing that does it,\" said Herman, one of the organization's assistant medical directors.\n\nThe accountable care organization has worked to ensure that the sickest patients \u2014 those with chronic diseases such as diabetes and congestive heart failure \u2014 become engaged with their doctors.\n\n\"That's where we've seen the biggest impact on both quality and cost,\" said Michael Repka, executive director and CEO of Independent Physicians Network.\n\nCase managers will contact patients who are overdue to see their doctors and will follow up with patients after they have seen their doctors.\n\nThe result has been fewer emergency room visits, hospitalizations and readmissions.\n\n\"When you look at the Medicare population, the biggest savings are with hospitalizations,\" Repka said. \"That's where the dollars are.\"\n\nMedicare spending is concentrated among a small number of beneficiaries \u2014 5% of the people covered by traditional Medicare accounted for 39% of annual spending in 2010, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises Congress on the program.\n\nThe physicians also are much more engaged, Repka said. The accountable care organization has learned more about its patients.\n\nAccountable care organizations are given information, for instance, that enables them to identify patients with the highest costs.\n\nAccountable Care Coalition of Southeast Wisconsin was set up by a partnership of the Independent Physicians Network and Collaborative Health Systems, a unit of Universal American Corp., a health insurance company based in White Plains, N.Y.\n\nThe accountable care organization is installing a system to gather clinical data from the different systems.\n\n\"It will give us much better data,\" Repka said. \"It will give us much quicker access to data.\"\n\nThe system, which will take at least 24 months to set up, has analytic tools that can help physicians determine which patients are the most likely to deteriorate and require hospitalization.\n\n\"That will take us to the next step,\" Repka said. \"That will enable us to continue to improve.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "Independent physicians group leads state in effective and affordable care", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/independent-physicians-group-leads-state-in-effective-and-affordable-care-b99570043z1-324543851.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99570043z.1_20150904195526_000_gibcf3us.1-0.jpg", "height": 1337}, "type": "article", "description": "Physicians are participating in a Medicare program designed to reward physicians and hospitals when they provide quality care at a lower cost.", "title": "Independent physicians group leads state in affordable care"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99570043z.1_20150904195526_000_gibcf3us.1-0.jpg", "description": "Physicians are participating in a Medicare program designed to reward physicians and hospitals when they provide quality care at a lower cost.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Independent physicians group leads state in effective and affordable care"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1295\"", "article_summary": "It had been the only accountable care organization in southeastern Wisconsin to receive payments from the program.\nThe accountable care organization set up by Independent Physicians Network now has outperformed much larger health systems two years in a row.\nThe organizations, an outgrowth of the Affordable Care Act, are one of several experiments to test new ways of paying doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.\nThe accountable care organization is installing a system to gather clinical data from the different systems.\nBruce Herman, an internist and geriatrician who practices in Thiensville, attributed an accountable care organization\u2019s success to its focus on the basics."}
