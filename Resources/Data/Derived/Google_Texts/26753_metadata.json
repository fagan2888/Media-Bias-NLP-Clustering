Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t buy that.\n\n\u201cWe will raise taxes,\u201d the Vermont Senator told a crowd at the CNN Democratic town hall this week. \u201cYes, we will.\u201d\n\nSanders, who is neck-and-neck with Hillary Clinton in Iowa and leading New Hampshire, has proposed an array of ambitious new government programs, from free college tuition and paid family leave to universal health care, and recently dropped a new tax plan explaining how he\u2019d pay for it all.\n\nThe upshot?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very, very big tax increase for everyone except those at the bottom,\u201d Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told TIME.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nIn an analysis released today, the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy research organization, found that Sanders\u2019 plan would lead to 10.56% lower after-tax income for all taxpayers, and a 17.91% lower after-tax income for the wealthiest Americans. When accounting for reduced GDP, taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes fall by 12.84% on average, the report said.\n\nWilliams was more cautionary. \u201cThere are also a lot of moving pieces,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a big tax increase, but there are all these goodies on the other end. So there will be winners and losers.\u201d\n\nTake, for example, Sanders\u2019 plan to provide universal, single-payer healthcare. Sanders says he\u2019d pay for that with a new 2.2% income-based \u201chealth care premium\u201d tax, as well as a 6.2% payroll tax paid for by employers. That adds up to a big increase\u2014but it also means that, in exchange, Americans would save the thousands of dollars they spend every year on premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket health care costs.\n\nThe typical American family of four covered by an employer-sponsored health care plan paid $24,671 last year on health care costs alone, according to the non-partisan Milliman Medical Index.\n\n\u201cThe savings that Americans would gain by the elimination of private insurance premiums and deductibles are much greater than the public insurance premiums they would pay under Bernie\u2019s plan,\u201d Warren Gunnels, Sanders\u2019 policy director told TIME.\n\n\u201cThe typical family of four making $50,000 a year would pay less than $46 a month under Bernie\u2019s plan for three months of paid family and medical leave and universal health care,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a tax hike,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a major cost savings.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the health care premium and payroll tax, Sanders also proposes a raft of other income-based tax hikes that he says will pay for other programs, such as expanding Social Security and providing paid family leave: a 0.4% payroll tax, a shift to tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, an elimination of the existing Social Security payroll tax exemption for earnings above $250,000, etc. The list goes on\u2014and it starts to add up.\n\nIn a detailed analysis, Dylan Matthews at Vox estimates that Sanders\u2019 proposed income-based tax hikes alone\u2014ignoring Sanders\u2019 other proposed taxes, such as those on carbon and financial transactions\u2014would pencil out to an 8.8 percentage point increase for those with income below $250,000.\n\nHoward Gleckman of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the marginal tax rate for the richest Americans on the last dollars of income under Sanders\u2019 plan would be 58%.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that those at the very top of the income ladder would definitely feel the Bern the most.\n\nAccording to Sanders\u2019 team\u2019s calculations, which do not take into account the health care premiums, those who make more than $1 million a year would see their effective tax rates\u2014in other words, the amount they pay after deductions and credits\u2014on income alone increase from about 30% to 36%. Those who make more than $5 millionwould see it increase from 29% to 47%.\n\nAdd those tax increases to Sanders\u2019 proposed new taxes on investment income and the effective tax rate starts to climb.\n\nMatthews estimates the rate for the richest bracket would be closer to 77%\u2014a number we haven\u2019t seen since 1964, back before income inequality was a thing. (Unlike Gunnels, Matthews includes in his calculations Sanders\u2019 2.2% health care premium, plus the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 3.8% surtax on investment income, which Sanders\u2019 plan would keep in place, plus the 6.2% employer-paid health care premium, which he assumes will be passed onto employees, as it usually is.)\n\nSanders\u2019 plan would also hit the wealthy in other ways. It would expand the estate tax, cap the value of deductions at 28% for those making $250,000 or more, and levy a tax on all financial transactions, such as trades as stocks, bonds, derivatives and other securities.\n\nThe financial transactions tax is a tiny surcharge\u2014usually a few hundredths of one percent\u2014levied on each trade. It would have an almost imperceptible effect on most Americans, who buy and sell in the stock market only occasionally, but it could skim as much as $185 billion over ten years from high-frequency traders and the rest of the hedge fund sets.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan would also hike the capital gains tax on the upper income brackets. Those with taxable incomes above $250,000 would pay a 50% capital gains tax, and the very rich\u2014those with taxable incomes above $2,000,00o\u2014would pay more than 60% on that income.\n\nAll of these calculations, of course, suppose that Sanders\u2019 tax plan has a snowball\u2019s chance in Congress of actually passing. Which it does not. Even with a Democratic Congress. And even with a President Sanders in 2017.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story misstated the effect a Tax Foundation analysis said Bernie Sanders\u2019 tax plan would have on Americans\u2019 incomes. The analysis said after-tax incomes would fall by 12.84% or more on average. The story also misstated which tax rate would top 58% for the richest Americans. It would be the marginal tax rate, according to the analysis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders has proposed a barrage of new taxes.
