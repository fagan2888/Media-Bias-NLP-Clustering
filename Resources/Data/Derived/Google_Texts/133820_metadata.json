Born three months premature, \u201cthe doctor told my mom not to look at me or bond with me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe was just trying to be kind to her, to spare her the sorrow of losing me.\u201d\n\nCerebral palsy is an umbrella term referring to a group of neurological disorders that permanently affect body movement, muscle coordination, and balance. It\u2019s not always detected immediately, but most children are born with it, and early signs generally appear before a child reaches 3 years old. Such was the case with Comstock; because she wasn\u2019t developing as her older brother had, her mother suspected something might be wrong. However, confiding her fears, the pediatrician\u2019s first response was a disheartening, \u201cno, she\u2019s just lazy.\u201d Soon enough, though, Comstock received a formal diagnosis of cerebral palsy.\n\nThe most common physical symptoms of the disease include a lack of coordination when performing voluntary movements (ataxia); stiff or tight muscles, and exaggerated reflexes (spasticity); walking with one foot dragging, on the toes, with a crouched or scissored gait; and muscle tone that\u2019s either too stiff or too floppy. Common neurological symptoms include seizures, hearing loss, impaired vision, bladder and bowel control issues, pain, and abnormal sensations.\n\nCerebral palsy is not hereditary or progressive, meaning it doesn't get worse over time. It generally occurs when there\u2019s damage to the developing brain, specifically in the part that controls muscle movement, during pregnancy, birth, or shortly after birth. For the small number of children who develop the disease within their first years, the cause is usually neurological damage from brain infections, such as bacterial meningitis or viral encephalitis. Head injuries, falls, and child abuse may also contribute.\n\n\u201cThe doctors told my parents I would never be able to walk,\u201d Comstock wrote. But in fact, symptoms of the disorder vary from person to person. Some children require no special assistance, while others with severe forms of the disorder, who might not be able to walk, will need extensive, lifelong care. This doesn't mean they\u2019ll need special schooling, however; many children with cerebral palsy have average to above-average intelligence.\n\nHearing she might not be able to walk, Comstock\u2019s parents \u201cjumped into action, seeking out every organization they could find to get help for me,\u201d she said. Soon after her diagnosis, her family discovered United Cerebral Palsy, and Comstock began intensive physical, occupational, and speech therapy. She wore braces that \u201cwent up to my waist and weighed more than I did,\u201d and then went to school where she faced \u201cteasing and bullying from classmates who just didn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nFor eight years Comstock wore her braces, struggling to dress herself each day. Despite the bullying, she persisted, and today, she is a married, working mother with children of her own. Describing herself as one of the \u201clucky ones,\u201d she is one of the many reasons why today we observe National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day.\n\nNo family needs to go it alone and United Cerebral Palsy can help. Supportive treatments, medications, and surgery have helped many people with the disorder improve their motor skills and communication abilities. Certainly, as Comstock\u2019s story proves, early therapy can sometimes transform a disabled child into an enabled one.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cerebral palsy, neurological disorder, motor disability, brain, seizures, ataxia, spasticity, childhood", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Cerebral palsy, an umbrella term for a group of neurological disorders, is the most common childhood motor disability.", "title": "National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day: Can You Spot The Symptoms?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cerebral-palsy-neurological-disorder-379417", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/25/braces.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cerebral palsy, an umbrella term for a group of neurological disorders, is the most common childhood motor disability.", "title": "National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day: Can You Spot The Symptoms?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cerebral-palsy-neurological-disorder-379417", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/25/braces.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/25/braces.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-03-25T11:20:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-25T11:20:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Cerebral palsy, an umbrella term for a group of neurological disorders, is the most common childhood motor disability."}, "article_summary": "Describing herself as one of the \u201clucky ones,\u201d she is one of the many reasons why today we observe National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day.\n\u201cWhen I tell people my story, they are often shocked,\u201d DonnaMarie Comstock wrote in a letter to United Cerebral Palsy.\nNo family needs to go it alone and United Cerebral Palsy can help.\nSoon after her diagnosis, her family discovered United Cerebral Palsy, and Comstock began intensive physical, occupational, and speech therapy.\nCerebral palsy is not hereditary or progressive, meaning it doesn't get worse over time."}
