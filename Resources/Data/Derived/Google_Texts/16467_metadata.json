Others want more government spending on \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d\n\nMissing from the conversation, at least until now, has been the name of a publicly traded, for-profit private company that might help show the way to a solution to the Amtrak problem.\n\nThe company is Genesee & Wyoming, Inc., which owns or leases freight railroads that operate in 41 states, four Canadian provinces, Australia, and Europe. At Genesee, safety starts not with technology or spending but with culture. The company\u2019s core purpose is \u201cto be the safest and most respected rail service provider in the world.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s website home page showcases its \u201csafety first\u201d approach front and center, and safety awards earned by Genesee & Wyoming employees are recorded in the company history as events just as significant as corporate acquisitions of other railroads.\n\nG & W\u2019s injury rate, one measure of safety, is four or five times better than that of other railroads of its type, and better than that of much larger railroads, including Amtrak.\n\n\u201cSafety is never \u2018fixed,\u2019 and we are committed to continuous improvement. Our goal is for every one of our operating regions to be injury-free, every day,\u201d the company says on its website. In a video, one of the safety award winners, Mark Sheffield, explains some of the tactics involved\u2014signs, audits, checklists.\n\nThe emphasis on safety hasn\u2019t been bad for business; $10,000 invested in GWR stock ten years ago would now be worth $55,975.90, an increase of about 460 percent. In a free, competitive market, businesses that emphasize safety can decrease costs for insurance and litigation and increase the satisfaction of customers and employees.\n\nIn other words, safety doesn\u2019t have to be a mandate that comes from government. It can be a differentiator, a unique selling proposition in the competitive market that is capitalism.\n\nThis is true in transportation industries other than railroads, too. Remember the Volvo commercials showing that car\u2019s protective steel cage? Or consider how other automobile companies are introducing safety features, from back-up cameras to lane-drift alerts, to attract safety-conscious buyers.\n\nAfter the government deregulated airlines during the Carter administration, airline safety actually improved, while flying became more affordable. That\u2019s part of the reason that inter-city passenger rail service is a money-loser, despite government efforts to make airplanes less attractive than trains by imposing intrusive Transportation Security Administration searches on airline passengers but not on Amtrak passengers.\n\nHow bad is Amtrak? The airlines have figured out in-flight wi-fi internet in the sky, while Amtrak\u2019s internet service on the ground is still painfully slow. The railroad even manages to lose money on its caf\u00e9 cars, which have a captive audience.\n\nOne reasonable solution to the Amtrak problem would be to put the railroad\u2019s routes up for bid to be bought by private operators. Routes that make economic sense, like the Northeast corridor, might attract private bidders\u2014perhaps airlines like Delta or Jet Blue, perhaps freight train companies like Genesee & Wyoming or Warren Buffett\u2019s BNSF. Others might have to be shut down, displeasing politicians.\n\nBut railroads shouldn\u2019t be run for the purpose of pleasing subsidy-providing politicians. They should be run to serve customers and make profits for owners.\n\nVice President Biden issued a statement after the crash asserting, \u201cAmtrak is like a second family to me.\u201d\n\nThe rest of us would probably settle for having a railroad that gets us and our actual, real families where we\u2019re going safely and reliably.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The federal government should not be in the railroad business.", "title": "Make Amtrak Safer and Privatize It", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/05/18/to-make-amtrak-safer-privatize-it", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14319780931356.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14319780931356.jpg", "description": "The federal government should not be in the railroad business.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Make Amtrak Safer and Privatize It"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-18T20:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ira-stoll"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe39ca\"", "article_summary": "At Genesee, safety starts not with technology or spending but with culture.\nThe fatal Amtrak crash earlier this month is generating renewed discussion about the right way to run a railroad.\nThe company is Genesee & Wyoming, Inc., which owns or leases freight railroads that operate in 41 states, four Canadian provinces, Australia, and Europe.\nOne reasonable solution to the Amtrak problem would be to put the railroad\u2019s routes up for bid to be bought by private operators.\nOthers want more government spending on \u201cinfrastructure.\u201dMissing from the conversation, at least until now, has been the name of a publicly traded, for-profit private company that might help show the way to a solution to the Amtrak problem."}
