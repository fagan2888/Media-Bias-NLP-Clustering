Sure. You know what a real call for violence is. "We should have IDs to prevent Voter Fraud" or "ObamaCare is Socialist".

On Tuesday night, Cornell Brooks, president of the NAACP, appeared on CNN’s Erin Burnett OutFront to discuss the shooting death of Michael Brown and dismissed calls for violence by a member of Michael Brown’s immediate family as inciting violence. Burnett played video of Brown’s stepfather, Louis Head, telling a crowd of protestors to “burn this bi*** down” after the grand jury decided not to indict Officer Darren Wilson and asked Brooks if “that served as a call for violence?” Rather than condemn Brown’s stepfather’s highly charged rhetoric, the president of the NAACP proclaimed “I don't think that was a call for violence or it caused violence.”

The NAACP wouldn't recognize an actual call for violence if it burned down twenty-two buildings, wounded numerous police officers and even torched a church... as long as it was coming from a role model/violent gang banger.

If it's not a call for violence then "burn this b___h down" must be a call for peace and reconciliation.
