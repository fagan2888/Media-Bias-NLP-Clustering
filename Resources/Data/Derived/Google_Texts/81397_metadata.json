He was 51.\n\nThe cause was colon cancer, according to the Constitutional Accountability Center, a Washington research organization and public-advocacy law firm, which he founded in 2008.\n\nMr. Kendall argued publicly, in judicial nomination hearings and before the courts, on behalf of affordable health care, voting rights, fair housing, marriage equality and other causes, insisting all the time that the framers were not \u201ca group of gun-toting, property-loving and tax-hating defenders of big corporations and proponents of small government,\u201d as he and James E. Ryan, then a University of Virginia law professor and now dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote in 2011 in the journal Democracy.\n\nMr. Kendall saw the center as a counterweight to the conservative ascendancy on the Supreme Court, where justices like Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. have sought to interpret the Constitution on the basis of the framers\u2019 original intent.\n\nDrawing on the scholarship of Yale Law School professors like Akhil Reed Amar and Jack M. Balkin, Mr. Kendall sought to use the conservatives\u2019 own judicial strategy on behalf of liberal aims.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cProgressives are losing the fight over the courts and the Constitution because conservatives have maneuvered us into running from, rather than embracing, the text and history of the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Kendall and Professor Ryan wrote in Democracy.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution, we\u2019ll often find,\u201d they concluded, \u201cis on our side.\u201d\n\nWhen California was sued over environmental regulations that were stricter than protections imposed by federal law, Mr. Kendall, in asserting the rules\u2019 constitutionality, borrowed from conservative arguments defending federalism and states\u2019 rights.\n\nIn another case, he strategically joined conservatives in a brief opposing a gun control law in Chicago, invoking the 14th Amendment\u2019s \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d clause, which protects citizens\u2019 rights against local government infringement.\n\nThen he turned around to argue that the same amendment protecting a citizen\u2019s right to bear arms in a particular locality, as granted under the Second Amendment, can also be the legal underpinning of civil rights laws that the federal government imposes on localities.\n\n\u201cEven where I disagree with their conclusions, the briefs and arguments submitted by the Constitutional Accountability Center make a vital contribution to the adversary process by which claims of original meaning should be vetted,\u201d Prof. Randy E. Barnett of Georgetown University Law Center, a frequent conservative adversary who joined Mr. Kendall in the gun control brief, wrote Sunday on a legal blog on The Washington Post\u2019s website.\n\nEschewing \u201cliving constitutionalism\u201d and \u201coriginal intent,\u201d Mr. Kendall favored another theory, \u201cnew textualism.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew textualists believe that while the meaning of the Constitution does not change, application of those principles can lead to different outcomes as circumstances change,\u201d he wrote in 2011 on the center\u2019s blog.\n\nHis advocacy bore results when the Supreme Court twice upheld the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature legislative success.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDoug played a critical role in the defense of the Affordable Care Act by marshaling the best arguments in his own briefs and skillfully working to coordinate the efforts of others,\u201d said Walter E. Dellinger III, a former assistant attorney general and adviser to the Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\nDouglas Townsend Kendall was born in Huntington, N.Y., on Long Island, on July 3, 1964. His father, George, was a salesman for a laser manufacturer. His mother, the former Judith Townsend, was a teacher.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Virginia, where he also earned his law degree.\n\nMr. Kendall practiced at Crowell & Moring in Washington and at the National Environmental Trust before founding his public advocacy firm.\n\nThe Constitutional Accountability Center evolved from Community Rights Counsel, an environmental law firm, which Mr. Kendall founded in 1997 and which exposed potential conflicts of interest posed by judges\u2019 stock holdings in energy corporations and junkets subsidized by industry groups.\n\nHis survivors include his wife, Juliet McKenna, an associate judge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia; their daughter, Miracle; and two siblings, George Kendall and Carolyn Kendall Stoller.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150929224007, "twitter": {"description": "Mr. Kendall founded the Constitutional Accountability Center, where he sought to use conservatives\u2019 own judicial strategy to advance liberal causes.", "title": "Doug Kendall, Liberal Who Challenged Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives, Dies at 51", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/us/politics/doug-kendall-liberal-who-challenged-supreme-courts-conservatives-dies-at-51.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003942836"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "samrob12", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/30/us/30kendall-obit-web/30kendall-obit-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/us/politics/doug-kendall-liberal-who-challenged-supreme-courts-conservatives-dies-at-51.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003942836", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/us/politics/doug-kendall-liberal-who-challenged-supreme-courts-conservatives-dies-at-51.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Doug Kendall, 51, Dies;
