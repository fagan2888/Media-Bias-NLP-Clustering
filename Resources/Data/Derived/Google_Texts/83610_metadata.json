The video quickly bounced around the Internet \u2014 and then briefly got pulled by NBC before being restored, minus three of the promos. NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander tweeted that a spokesperson said some of the promos were not meant to air.\n\n.@NBC spox: NBC accidentally posted wrong @YouTube link w 8 @nbcsnl promos - 3 of them not for air, inc Trump calling Carson a \"real loser.\" \u2014 Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) November 4, 2015\n\nIn one cut promo, Strong explains the time limits resulting from FCC rules that stipulate equal time for presidential candidates. \"So let me just say this,\" Trump chimes in. \"Ben Carson is a complete and total loser!\"\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Is Now Losing to a Guy Who Isn\u2019t Even Trying\n\nIn another spot, Strong says that Trump vowed he wouldn't brag or say \"he's the best of anything\" during the broadcast.\n\n\u201cThat's right, Cecily, and I'm going to do the best job that anyone's ever done not saying it,\u201d Trump adds.\n\nDespite his seeming ability to poke fun at himself, Trump\u2019s upcoming appearance is already rife with controversy. Several major Hispanic groups have called on NBC and \u201cSNL\u201d producer Loren Michaels to \u201cDump Trump\u201d because of his views on immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s off-the-cuff speaking style also opens the show to awkward, potentially harmful comments. Now that a handful of national polls show him trailing Carson, and losing ground to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Trump might be tempted to use the show\u2019s staple opening monologue to tear into his rivals.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump Is Still Ahead, Despite Carson\u2019s Surge\n\nDemocratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton appeared in a skit on the show last month, part of a weeks-long push to reboot her image following a summer that saw her tumble in the polls. However, the guest-spot, where the former secretary of state played a bartender, was only a few minutes long. As host, Trump will no doubt see considerably more airtime.\n\nWatch Trump's SNL promos:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal rules for election campaigns apparently limit the time Donald Trump can appear", "title": "Trump Blasts Carson as a \u2018Total Loser\u2019 in Pulled \u2018SNL\u2019 Promo", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/04/Trump-Blasts-Carson-Total-Loser-Pulled-SNL-Promo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-book_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/04/Trump-Blasts-Carson-Total-Loser-Pulled-SNL-Promo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-book_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Federal rules for election campaigns apparently limit the time Donald Trump can appear", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Watch Trump's SNL promos:\nNBC on Wednesday released promos featuring Trump and \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Cecily Strong strung together in a two-minute video clip.\nDespite his seeming ability to poke fun at himself, Trump\u2019s upcoming appearance is already rife with controversy.\n@NBC spox: NBC accidentally posted wrong @YouTube link w 8 @nbcsnl promos - 3 of them not for air, inc Trump calling Carson a \"real loser.\"\nSeveral major Hispanic groups have called on NBC and \u201cSNL\u201d producer Loren Michaels to \u201cDump Trump\u201d because of his views on immigration."}
