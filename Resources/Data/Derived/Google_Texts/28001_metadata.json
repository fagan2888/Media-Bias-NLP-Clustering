I should do something about it.\n\nOne reason I haven\u2019t is the average price for hearing aids: roughly $2,500, often more \u2014 and most of us need two. That helps explain why only 20 percent of those with hearing loss use hearing aids.\n\nMedicare declines to cover a number of products and services that older beneficiaries need. Dental care ranks high on my personal list of exclusions that make the least sense, but the fact that the 1965 Medicare law specifically prohibits the national insurance program from paying for hearing aids is also a strong contender.\n\nSo it\u2019s heartening to notice some recent developments that might lead to more rational policies and more affordable and accessible devices.\n\nAn October report by the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recommended federal actions to \u201csimultaneously decrease the cost of hearing aids, spur technology innovation and increase consumer choice options.\u201d\n\nThe council suggested, for example, that the Food and Drug Administration permit a \u201cbasic\u201d hearing aid, for mild to moderate age-related hearing loss, to be sold over the counter \u2014 something every state now prohibits.\n\nThe report also urged the Federal Trade Commission, whose rulings enabled consumers to comparison shop for eyeglasses and contact lenses, to treat hearing devices more like visual ones.\n\n\u201cIt should be like a prescription for eyeglasses,\u201d said Dr. Christine Cassel, co-chairwoman of the council\u2019s hearing technologies working group. \u201cIn every other aspect of our lives, advances in electronic technology have made things cost much, much less. That hasn\u2019t happened with hearing aids.\u201d Almost annually, she noted, \u201csome congressperson gets energized about this and tries to pass legislation\u201d to remove Medicare\u2019s hearing aid restriction. Last year, it was Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., with six Democratic co-sponsors. The bill stalled in committee, but \u201cwe are not giving up the fight,\u201d Dingell said in an email.\n\nDriving down the cost of the devices could make them more widely available in several ways.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s $200 instead of $2,000, more people could pay out of pocket,\u201d Cassel said. \u201cAnd that also means Medicare might cover it\u201d \u2014 unlikely at current prices.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly possible to provide good devices for far less than we now pay. The Department of Veterans Affairs, which negotiates with manufacturers for lower prices, provided comprehensive hearing care to more than 900,000 veterans in 2014 and dispensed almost 800,000 hearing aids without copays. The average cost per device: $400.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/02/digital-hearing-aids-2.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "That helps explain why only 20 percent of those with hearing loss use hearing aids.\nThat hasn\u2019t happened with hearing aids.\u201d Almost annually, she noted, \u201csome congressperson gets energized about this and tries to pass legislation\u201d to remove Medicare\u2019s hearing aid restriction.\nAlmost two-thirds of Americans over age 70 have meaningful hearing loss, experts say, and I probably will be among them.\nOne reason I haven\u2019t is the average price for hearing aids: roughly $2,500, often more \u2014 and most of us need two.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs, which negotiates with manufacturers for lower prices, provided comprehensive hearing care to more than 900,000 veterans in 2014 and dispensed almost 800,000 hearing aids without copays."}
