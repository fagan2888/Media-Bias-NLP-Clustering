President Barack Obama will be visiting the La Crosse

area this week.

A White House official says the president will be

in the area for an event on the economy this Thursday.

It will be the first time since 2008, President Obama

has been to La Crosse.

Last time, he spoke to an estimated 15-thousand outside

of the La Crosse Center.

Representative Ron Kind held a press conference this

afternoon at U-W La Crosse.

saying that while we've made progress economically.

the president would agree that there is plenty of

room to improve.

While clearly we've turned the corner and we're seeing

some good economic growth, I think President Obama

will be the first to admit that there's more work

that needs to be done in order to grow the economy

with good paying jobs, to strengthen and grow the

middle class, and help wages start increasing too.

The chair of the La Crosse County Democratic Party

says it's always exciting when the sitting president

comes to visit our area.

It's fantastic, you know, everybody's been talking

about the week, the week, you know, marriage, and

affordable care act, and now this.

I mean, it's really something.

Few details are known about the event, but News 8
