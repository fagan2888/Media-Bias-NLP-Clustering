It's been a busy week for the show after Joy Behar's appearance where she bashes Bill Cosby after the slew of allegations from women who claim to have been raped by Cosby. Behar also spoke about her fight with Rush Limbaugh over him attacking her friends. Behar took to creating a list of reasons "why Limbaugh couldn't get laid" in response. For More on Behar's interview see the video below.
