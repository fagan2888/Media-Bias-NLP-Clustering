Of the $10,473 in total healthcare costs paid by this typical family in 2015, $6,408 was paid through payroll deductions while $4,065 in out-of-pocket expenses incurred at point of care.\n\nOf this year\u2019s total $1,456 increase, $467 is due to prescription drugs, a 13.6 percent increase after a five-year period in which prescription drug costs averaged annual increases of 6.8 percent, Milliman said.\n\nThis year\u2019s 6.3 percent cost increase follows last year\u2019s all-time low of 5.4 percent. The MMI of 6.3 percent for this year is what it was in 2012, which is below the 7.3 percent reported in 2010 and the 6.9 percent in 2011.\n\nDrug Costs\n\nMost of the components of care analyzed by the MMI (physician, outpatient, inpatient, other) experienced trends in line with recent years, but the sharp increase in prescription drug costs heightened the overall rate of increase.\n\n\u201cThe rate at which prescription drug costs increased this year doubled over the average increase of the prior five years,\u201d said Scott Weltz, co-author of the MMI. \u201cThis was driven by a combination of factors, including the introduction of new specialty drugs, a continued increase in compound drugs, and price increases for both brand name and generic drugs.\u201d\n\nThe study assesses the direct and indirect effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, on costs. Until now, the ACA has been seen as having only indirect effects on the employer-sponsored health insurance market since this market was not the focus of reforms as much as the individual and small group markets.\n\nBut the employer- sponsored market may start feeling more effects due to the so-called excise (Cadillac) tax on high-cost coverage that is to start in 2018, according to the actuaries at Milliman.\n\nThe report notes that some employers with high-cost plans have already begun to scale back their offerings in anticipation of the Cadillac.\n\n\u201cThose employer plans affected might initially be limited to outliers with extremely rich benefit plans,\u201d the report says. However, the report says \u201cit is simply a matter of time before other plans like the one tracked by the MMI are caught by the excise tax.\u201d\n\nOnce the threshold is exceeded, the amount of tax will grow every year because healthcare expense trends will likely exceed the CPI index used to adjust the threshold to years beyond 2018, according to the authors.\n\nChris Girod, co-author of the MMI, said there is the prospect that the plan purchased by the typical family of four \u2014which in terms of actuarial value is in a \u201cgold\u201d plan\u2014may trigger the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d that goes into effect on high-cost health plans in 2018. Whether this typical family of four will actually be affected by the Cadillac tax will depend on if future trends exceed recent levels, he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "The cost of healthcare for a typical American family of four will rise about 6.3 percent this year, or $1,456, driven in great measure by higher prescripti", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "The cost of healthcare for a typical American family of four will rise about 6.3 percent this year, or $1,456, driven in great measure by higher prescripti", "title": "Here's What's Happening to Healthcare Costs for Typical Family", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "updated_time": "2015-06-04T10:47:12-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/05/20/368816.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The cost of healthcare for a typical American family of four will rise about 6.3 percent this year, or $1,456, driven in great measure by higher prescripti", "creator": "@ijournal", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "title": "Here's What's Happening to Healthcare Costs for Typical Family", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2015-05-20", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "Research and Trends", "published_time": "2015-05-20T11:18:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T10:47:12-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2215\"", "article_summary": "Whether this typical family of four will actually be affected by the Cadillac tax will depend on if future trends exceed recent levels, he said.\nOf the $10,473 in total healthcare costs paid by this typical family in 2015, $6,408 was paid through payroll deductions while $4,065 in out-of-pocket expenses incurred at point of care.\n\u201cThose employer plans affected might initially be limited to outliers with extremely rich benefit plans,\u201d the report says.\nThe Milliman Medical Index (MMI) is based on a typical American family of four receiving coverage from an employer-sponsored preferred provider plan (PPO).\nThis year\u2019s 6.3 percent cost increase follows last year\u2019s all-time low of 5.4 percent."}
