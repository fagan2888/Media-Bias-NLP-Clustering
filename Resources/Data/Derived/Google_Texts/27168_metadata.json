After Donald Trump and John Kasich noted they would not be attending the scheduled Fox News debate on Monday, the network canceled the event. Meanwhile, Trump and Cruz want Kasich out of the way so they can focus on their head-to-head battle. In the race for delegates, some pundits are arguing why California may be the deciding factor. Despite gaining the endorsement of his predecessor John Boehner, House Speaker Paul Ryan made it loud and clear he has no plans to enter the race.\n\nRepublican Primary\n\nDonald Trump: Thursday offers a slew of unfriendly headlines for the GOP frontman. In a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, half of U.S. women noted they have a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d view of the businessman. Expect that poll to surface in negative ads. Liberal Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid criticized his Republican colleagues as \u201ccowardly\u201d for not denouncing the controversial candidate and Sen. Elizabeth Warren warns that Trump is a threat to the country. As for whether former First Lady Laura Bush will be voting for the GOP frontrunner, she respectfully requests you \u201cdon\u2019t ask.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz: Cruz may be Republicans\u2019 last hope of stopping Trump, but the party leadership is not soon to forget how Cruz slammed Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor last year. Cruz called McConnell a \u201cvery effective Democratic leader,\u201d among other unflattering remarks, after the Senate leader signed the Bipartisan Budget Act. Republican senators are reportedly asking him to apologize for those remarks before they consider unifying behind him. Cruz did find some friends today though. He picked up the endorsement of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and heard Rubio called him \u201cthe only true conservative left in the race.\u201d He spent most of Thursday campaigning with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.\n\nJohn Kasich: RedState predicts that should Kasich team up with Trump, it would be the end of Cruz.\n\nDemocratic Primary\n\nHillary Clinton has had a gaffe-tastic week. She made controversial comments about coal, suggested we didn\u2019t lose a single person in Libya and admitted she\u2019s not a \u201cnatural politician.\u201d It\u2019s a wonder how she won four state primaries on Tuesday night. If nothing else, the former secretary of state proved she\u2019s not infallible.\n\nDelegate Count\n\nRepublicans (1,237 needed to win):\n\nTrump - 673\n\nCruz - 411\n\nKasich - 143\n\nDems (2,383 needed to win):\n\nClinton \u2013 1,606\n\nSanders \u2013 851\n\nPrimary/Debate schedule:\n\nTuesday, March 22 - American Samoa (R convention), Arizona, Idaho Caucus (D), Utah", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will they make amends?.05/27/2016 7:07:20AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Will they make amends?", "title": "2016 RACE ROUNDUP: Cruz v.
