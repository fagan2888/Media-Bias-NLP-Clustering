John Mica\u2019s seat, knew he needed something \u2014 anything \u2014 to stand out against the incumbent congressman and two other GOP hopefuls when voters head to the polls for Tuesday's primary. He, his wife and his campaign manager got to thinking and voila \u2014 they had an idea. \u201cWe need a pigs in a trough ad,\u201d Oehlrich says. \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d The pigs he\u2019s referring to are the ones Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst talked about castrating in her viral campaign ad \u201cSqueal,\" which debuted in March. (\u201cI grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington I\u2019ll know how to cut pork,\u201d Ernst said in the spot, which was viewed nearly 600,000 times on YouTube and is credited for paving her way through her primary.)\n\n\u200bOehlrich went for an even bolder visual for his ad: fake human poop. \u201cIt was black beans, corn starch, coffee and coffee grounds and water, of course,\u201d Oehlrich explains to Whispers.\u200b He stood before the camera and made his anti-incumbent pitch. \u201cPoliticians are a lot like dirty diapers \u2014 when they\u2019re fresh they serve a purpose, but when you allow them to sit around too long, they\u2019re a mess and you can\u2019t get anyone to change them,\u201d he said. Oehlrich then plopped the brown goo into the diaper and pitched it into the trash.\n\nOehlrich\u2019s advertisement joins a rich tradition of weird, wacky and sometimes shocking campaign spots, the modern era of which began back in 1964.\n\n\u201cEverybody still operates off of Tony Schwartz\u2019s daisy ad,\u201d longtime Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf tells Whispers.\u200b That ad, depicting a young girl picking petals off a daisy before a nuclear bomb goes off, helped keep President Lyndon B. Johnson in the White House. And it was so eyebrow-raising that it only had to be aired once, Sheinkopf recalls. \u201cThe argument is so good and the population so prepared that you don\u2019t have to air it much and it can cut right through,\u201d Sheinkopf says\u200b.\n\nBut not every attempt to shock and awe is a winning one. Allan Louden, a professor of communication and political advertising expert at Wake Forest University, points to an ad made for Roland Sledge, a candidate for Texas Railroad Commission in 2012. In it, Sledge butchers a quote from American cowboy Will Rogers. \u201cThere are three kinds of men \u2014 the one that learns by reading, the few that learn by observation and the rest have to pee on an electric fence,\u201d Sledge said in the ad. An actor playing a politician (who looked a bit like convicted felon and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich) then gets electrocuted by doing exactly that. Sledge only captured about 10 percent of the primary vote. \u201cThey do get the name recognition part and introduce you, but with that comes baggage,\u201d Louden warns. \u200b\u201cThere are a number of ads that backlashed.\u201d\n\nAnother modern failure, according to Lara Brown, the program director of the Political Management Program at George Washington University\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management, \u200bwas former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina\u2019s 2010 \u201cDemon Sheep\u201d advertisement.\n\nThe \u201cDemon Sheep\u201d ad was aimed at Fiorina's primary opponent Tom Campbell; it called him a FCINO \u2014 a fiscal conservative in name only \u2014 and a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. \u201cIt was creepy and it was eerie and I never really understood the message,\u201d Brown says.\u200b Fiorina did best Campbell in the primary, but the damage to her brand was already done, and she was unable to unseat Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. \u201cSo I think she was seen as a very serious and credible candidate and I think the problem with that ad was that it undermined [that],\u201d Brown says.\u200b \u201cBecause it seems like, you know, some strange nightmare of an ad.\u201d\n\nWhat works, though? Apparently, talking animals. \"Because talking animals can say things you can't,\u201d Louden says.\u200b That's what helped Montana Republican Sen. John Melcher get re-elected after he was targeted as being too liberal by the National Conservative Political Action Committee. The advertisement criticized the use of outside money in the race, using talking cows. \u201cMontana isn\u2019t buying it, especially those who know bull when they hear it,\u201d a voiceover said before the cows began to speak. The spot got Melcher six more years in the U.S. Senate.\n\nA more recent example was Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, cast as the \u201cDonkey Whisperer\u201d in a 2012 spot that earned Williams, Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s ex-Secretary of State, a freshman year in the House of Representatives. In it, Williams talked to a herd of donkeys \u200babout the Constitution, handouts, taxes, healthcare and more. \u201cThese donkeys don\u2019t live in the United States of France, they live in the United States of America \u2014 they\u2019re going to have to get with it,\u201d Williams said in the ad.\n\nThe donkey ad works, in part, because it\u2019s funny. \u201cHumor let\u2019s you do all kinds of things that other things don\u2019t,\u201d explains Louden. He also pointed to the successful long-shot campaign of the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., in 1990, whose ad had him zipping from frame to frame\u200b because the incumbent had so much more money. \u201cUnlike my opponent I don\u2019t have $6 million so I\u2019m going to have to talk fast,\u201d Wellstone said in the spot.\n\n\u201cHumor requires a little bit of truth for it to be humorous,\u201d Louden says. And weird ads have to have a little legitimacy to work, the experts agreed. In Ernst\u2019s hog castration case, the candidate is actually a farmer in Iowa. \u201cHere she was trying to talk about being tough and understanding rural life, so as perhaps surprising and inappropriate as it was, it worked for her because it reinforced all the things that she was already trying to do,\u201d says\u200b Brown of George Washington University.\n\nErnst\u2019s race is also different from Oehlrich\u2019s in that the dirty diaper candidate is trying to unseat an incumbent, while Ernst is vying to replace the retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. \u201cYou can only get rid of an incumbent if you\u2019re going to attack the incumbent directly,\u201d Democratic consultant Sheinkopf explains,\u200b adding that the diaper charge might be too vague. \u201cAds are valuable, but they\u2019re only as valuable as local conditions permit them to be.\u201d\n\nThen again, an interesting spot gets Oehlrich\u2019s name out there. \u201cThis may have been a smart move in the sense that it will certainly gain him some recognition in the district were John Mica to eventually retire down the road,\u201d Brown says.\n\nThough, thus far, the diaper ad on YouTube has only received about 2,300 views. (One commenter\u2019s reaction: \u201cThis is as dumb as a sack of Sarah Palins.\u201d)\u200b", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Wacky Political Ads Don't Always Work", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/08/20/wacky-political-ads-dont-always-work", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "In trying to make their campaigns stand out, some politicians leave viewers cold.", "title": "Wacky Political Ads Don't Always Work"}, "twitter": {"title": "Wacky Political Ads Don't Always Work", "description": "In trying to make their campaigns stand out, some politicians leave viewers cold.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Aug. 20, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nikki Schwab,Pulse,campaigns,advertising,elections,Washington Whispers [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "In trying to make their campaigns stand out, some politicians leave viewers cold."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf255\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHumor let\u2019s you do all kinds of things that other things don\u2019t,\u201d explains Louden.\nAnd weird ads have to have a little legitimacy to work, the experts agreed.\n\u201cAds are valuable, but they\u2019re only as valuable as local conditions permit them to be.\u201dThen again, an interesting spot gets Oehlrich\u2019s name out there.\n\u201cUnlike my opponent I don\u2019t have $6 million so I\u2019m going to have to talk fast,\u201d Wellstone said in the spot.\nOehlrich\u2019s advertisement joins a rich tradition of weird, wacky and sometimes shocking campaign spots, the modern era of which began back in 1964."}
