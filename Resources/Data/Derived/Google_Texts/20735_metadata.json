When Mr. Obama ran for president in 2008, Republicans tried to wound him by accusing him of waging \u201cclass warfare\u201d to achieve wealth redistribution. That fall, the Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, derided Mr. Obama as the \u201credistributor in chief\u201d as he seized on Mr. Obama\u2019s comments to an Ohio man later known as \u201cJoe the Plumber\u201d that he wanted to \u201cspread the wealth around.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama survived that episode and other instances when Republicans deployed old recordings of him using the word \u201credistribution\u201d as evidence that he was a closet socialist. But Mr. Obama had learned a lesson.\n\nAfter he took office, he cast his goal of rolling back President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts for higher earners not as economic redistribution, but as the restoration of top-end rates from the Clinton years.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was a similar semantic sidestep. The law targeted high earners, too, by raising their Medicare taxes enough to reduce their after-tax incomes by nearly 2 percent, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That revenue helped finance coverage for those currently without insurance, who tend to have lower incomes and who in many cases will receive government subsidies to make their premiums cheaper.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd yet for those nervous about potential changes, the president promised stability. \u201cIf you like your current insurance, you will keep your current insurance,\u201d Mr. Obama said the day he signed the legislation in March 2010, a promise he made repeatedly as the Oct. 1 opening day of the online health insurance marketplaces approached.\n\nHiding in plain sight behind that pledge \u2014 visible to health policy experts but not the general public \u2014 was the redistribution required to extend health coverage to those who had been either locked out or priced out of the market.\n\nNow some of that redistribution has come clearly into view.\n\nThe law, for example, banned rate discrimination against women, which insurance companies called \u201cgender rating\u201d to account for their higher health costs. But that raised the relative burden borne by men. The law also limited how much more insurers can charge older Americans, who use more health care over all. But that raised the relative burden on younger people.\n\nAnd the law required insurers to offer coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions, which eased costs for less healthy people but raised prices for others who had been charged lower rates because of their good health.\n\n\u201cThe A.C.A. is very much about redistribution, whether or not its advocates acknowledge that this is the case,\u201d wrote Reihan Salam on the website of the conservative National Review.\n\nHaving obscured much of that vulnerability before, Mr. Obama has responded to recent political heat by apologizing \u2014 and expanding the scope of his discredited \u201cyou can keep it\u201d promise.\n\nMr. Gruber of M.I.T. called redistribution a convenient tool for Republican opponents who would fight the law anyway.\n\nIn the end, America\u2019s political culture may have made it unrealistic to expect a smooth public reception for the law, no matter how cleverly the White House modulated Mr. Obama\u2019s language or shaped his policy to minimize the number of losers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe reality is, any big thing you take on, any big change, is hard to accomplish,\u201d said David Axelrod, the president\u2019s longtime strategist. In America, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve created a sense that everyone can expect to win \u2014 nobody has to sacrifice.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Axelrod argued that widening income inequality has, to some Americans at least, changed the meaning of redistribution. \u201cThe whole redistribution argument has shifted in the country because there\u2019s a sense that a lot of redistribution has been to the top and not the bottom,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said.\n\nStill, the word is hardly a favorite of the president these days. The last time Mr. Obama used it in public, according to Federal News Service transcripts, was 18 months ago during his re-election campaign in Elyria, Ohio.\n\n\u201cUnderstand this is not a redistribution argument,\u201d the president told his audience then. \u201cThis is not about taking from rich people to give to poor people. This is about us together making investments in our country so everybody\u2019s got a fair shot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131123185344, "twitter": {"description": "Redistribution is a toxic term at the White House, where it has become a target for Republicans, who have long accused Democrats of seeking \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d", "title": "Don\u2019t Dare Call the Health Law \u2018Redistribution\u2019", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/us/dont-dare-call-the-health-law-redistribution.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002568620"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "JohnJHarwood", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/us/dont-dare-call-the-health-law-redistribution.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002568620", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/us/dont-dare-call-the-health-law-redistribution.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Don\u2019t Dare Call The Health Law \u2018Redistribution\u2019", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 23, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Income,Republican Party,Taxation,Blank  Rebecca M,Obama  Barack,Income Inequality", "news_keywords": "Income,Tax", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "John Harwood", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By JOHN HARWOOD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Redistribution is a toxic term at the White House, where it has become a target for Republicans, who have long accused Democrats of seeking \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Redistribution is a toxic term at the White House, where it has become a target for Republicans, who have long accused Democrats of seeking \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 23, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/john_harwood/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-07-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Income Inequality", "published": "2013-11-23", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "24redistribute", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140717150243, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/us/dont-dare-call-the-health-law-redistribution.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Redistribution is a toxic term at the White House, where it has become a target for Republicans, who have long accused Democrats of seeking \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d", "title": "Don\u2019t Dare Call the Health Law \u2018Redistribution\u2019"}, "pdate": 20131123, "des": "Income Inequality", "articleid": 100000002568620, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Don\u2019t Dare Call the Health Law \u2018Redistribution\u2019", "col": "White House Memo", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92d1\"", "article_summary": "When Mr. Obama ran for president in 2008, Republicans tried to wound him by accusing him of waging \u201cclass warfare\u201d to achieve wealth redistribution.\nThe last time Mr. Obama used it in public, according to Federal News Service transcripts, was 18 months ago during his re-election campaign in Elyria, Ohio.\nBut Mr. Obama had learned a lesson.\nThe law also limited how much more insurers can charge older Americans, who use more health care over all.\nThe law, for example, banned rate discrimination against women, which insurance companies called \u201cgender rating\u201d to account for their higher health costs."}
