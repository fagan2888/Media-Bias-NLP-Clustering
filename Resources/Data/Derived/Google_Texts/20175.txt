MILWAUKEE (AP) — That black speck walking precariously out on the Milwaukee Art Museum’s giant white wings? That’s a painter.

Matt Radmacher, owner of Wisconsin Industrial Painters, and two other painters are touching up 40 rust spots on the museum’s Burke Brise Soleil — affectionately called wings — and repainting 72 rusted plates at the base.

This is only the second time the museum’s addition, designed by internationally known Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, has needed touching up since it opened in 2001. At the time, it was Calatrava’s first completed American project.

The painters started Sept. 29 and are expected to finish by the end of this week.

Calatrava designed a secret passageway with ladders and tunnels to allow maintenance workers access to the base of the moveable wings. Once there, workers can climb a set of steep stairs along the spire to get to the top of the 11-story structure.
