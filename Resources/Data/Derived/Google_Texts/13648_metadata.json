Virtually no one had actually read the law, and still fewer understood the full implications of a government takeover of health insurance markets. Now, five years later, we are experiencing these effects firsthand.\n\nObamacare was sold to the American people \u2014 unsuccessfully, since most people opposed it at the time of its passage \u2014 as a social safety net to help poor people, to stop them from having to live at the mercy of ruthless insurance companies, and to ensure that every American, regardless of income, could get the health care they needed. For many, it was a compelling story, but like all things that sound too good to be true, it turned out to be nothing but smoke and mirrors.\n\nObamacare doesn\u2019t help the poor; in fact, it hurts them. It doesn\u2019t provide them with opportunities to lift themselves out of poverty, it doesn\u2019t help them find jobs, and it doesn\u2019t increase their access to medical services.\n\nThe following are five specific ways Obamacare is making life worse for America\u2019s poor.\n\nFirst, Obamacare forces the poor to buy insurance they can\u2019t afford.\n\nThe least popular feature of Obamacare is undoubtedly the individual mandate, the requirement that everyone buy health insurance whether they want it or not. The trouble is, not everybody can afford this product. Depending on your age, health and the state you live in, the lowest premium plan acceptable under Obamacare can run into hundreds of dollars a month. And if you can\u2019t afford that? No problem, you can just pay the penalty. In 2015, that comes to $325. If that sounds bad, it\u2019s nothing compared to 2016, when the penalty will spike to $695. While some people will qualify for subsidies to help offset the cost, these are far from universal, and many are now having to pay back subsidies they thought they qualified for.\n\nSecond, even if you have insurance, it\u2019s too expensive to use.\n\nAn insurance deductible is the amount you have to pay out of pocket each year before your plan takes over and starts picking up the tab. Under Obamacare, the plans with the lowest premiums have the astonishingly high average deductible of $5,181. How many people have five grand lying around to drop on a medical treatment? Certainly not the people who lack employer-provided care and are forced into the Obamacare exchanges. What good is insurance if you have to go bankrupt to use it?\n\nThird, Obamacare redistributes wealth from the young to the old.\n\nOlder people tend to spend the most on health care. They also tend to have the most money, having had an entire lifetime to accumulate wages and investments. Yet under Obamacare, insurance companies are forbidden from charging older people more than three times as much as younger ones. This means that young people, who typically earn the least in wages and spend the least on health care, are being forced to subsidize older generations.\n\nFourth, Obamacare is driving people off private plans onto Medicaid.\n\nDo you remember \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan\u201d? Too bad it turned out to be a whopping lie. While the Obama administration claims that the number of new enrollees in Medicaid proves that Obamacare is increasing access to care, a Boston University-Harvard Medical School study found that 80 percent of new enrollees were shifted off their private insurance plans. Obamacare is forcing poor people off the insurance they had and liked and into a poorly run government program that many doctors now refuse to accept.\n\nFifth, Obamacare is causing doctors to call it quits.\n\nThe best insurance policy in the world is no good if you can\u2019t find a doctor. Medical school admissions are down 6 percent, and the Association of American Medical Colleges is predicting a doctor shortage of 160,000 by 2025. A survey by the Doctor Patient Medical Association Foundation found that 83 percent of doctors have thought about quitting because of Obamacare.\n\nIn short, Obamacare is raising costs, not lowering them; decreasing access, not expanding it; and making things far worse for the very people its supporters claim to care about. It\u2019s been five miserable years. Let\u2019s not let this train wreck of a law have another five. FreedomWorks\u2019 \u201cTen Principles for Replacing Obamacare\u201d presents ideas on how we can bring patient-centered reform to America\u2019s health care system, and scrap Obamacare for good.\n\n\u2022 Logan Albright is a research analyst for FreedomWorks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On March 23, 2010, exactly five years ago today, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law.
