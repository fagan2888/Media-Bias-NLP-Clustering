White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard will leave after the state dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on April 28. Bernard, who is openly gay, broke barriers as the first man to serve as social secretary.

“For the last four years, Jeremy has worked tirelessly to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible and to make each and every event in the White House one to remember, not only for Barack and me, but for the tens of thousands of guests who pass through our doors each year,” the first lady said in a statement.

M.C. González, the first lady’s communications director, will also leave the East Wing on May 1. Her deputy, Caroline Adler, will replace her.

Michelle Obama praised González, who joined the White House two years ago, for promoting educational initiatives, such as Reach Higher.

“M.C. has been a valued advisor to me and an esteemed mentor and friend to her colleagues,” she said in a statement. “We will all miss M.C. dearly, and I wish her well on the journey ahead.”

The departure of Bernard and González comes on the heels of the exit of White House florist Laura Dowling last month.

Dowling’s departure was kept quiet, as she left the executive mansion under mysterious circumstances.
