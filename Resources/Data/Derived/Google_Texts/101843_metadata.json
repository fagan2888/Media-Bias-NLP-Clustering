Disability Insurance benefits are for those who are physically unable to work.\n\nAccording to Vitter\u2019s office, at least 117,000 people received both disability and unemployment insurance in 2010. Citing the Government Accountability Office report, his office said the overlapping cash benefits paid totaled over $281 million from disability insurance and more than $575 million from unemployment insurance.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "David Vitter wants to block people from receiving both disability and unemployment benefits.", "description": "David Vitter wants to block people from receiving both disability and unemployment benefits.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "David Vitter wants to block people from receiving both disability and unemployment benefits.", "title": "GOP senator targets 'double dipping' in federal benefits", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/250931-bill-aims-to-end-double-dipping-in-federal-benefits", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/vitterdavid_-071514gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-12T11:51:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-12T11:51-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/250931-bill-aims-to-end-double-dipping-in-federal-benefits", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-12T11:19-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Economics, Social programs, Welfare economics, Social Security, Labor economics, Unemployment, Disability, David Vitter, Labor, Social Issues,David Vitter,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-12T11:19:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T11:51:01-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/250931-bill-aims-to-end-double-dipping-in-federal-benefits", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "David Vitter wants to block people from receiving both disability and unemployment benefits.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP senator targets 'double dipping' in federal benefits"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP senator targets 'double dipping' in federal benefits"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19fe\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
