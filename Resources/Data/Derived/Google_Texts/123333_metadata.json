This, the resolution states, means that students were not informed of the change in \u201can appropriate and timely manner.\u201d\n\nAdelson said that he will present the resolution and a petition to support the resolution to the SUNY Assembly conference in Rochester. Adelson will be attending the conference from Oct. 17 to Oct. 19 with fellow delegates Justice Vincent Justiniano, College of Arts and Sciences senator Taylor Bouraad and President Garry Lachhar.\n\nThe senate also confirmed Sarah Twarog to the position of chief justice of the USG Judiciary by a vote of 17-0-1. Twarog, who was chief justice last year, said she wants to help move the judiciary forward.\n\n\u201cI have already written two legal briefs,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a lot of good ideas for the semester for the judicial bylaws, which most of you know do not exist.\u201d\n\nThe decision to confirm Twarog was pulled out of the vetting committee because the judiciary could not start running without a chief justice, College of Arts and Sciences senator Angelo Lambroschino said.\n\nThe senate also passed an act to officially establish the Technology Issues Ad Hoc Committee by a vote of 15-0-3. The committee was created at the senate meeting on Sept. 11 to address technology-related complaints listed in a student survey conducted by USG officials, and senator Lloyd Ippolito of the Residence Hall Association was elected the chair of the committee.\n\nThe senate voted unanimously to support a resolution by the Sports Clubs Council stating that the council is in favor of the construction of an outdoor field facility and the installation of lights on Field C at the Campus Recreation South P Field Complex.\n\nBridget Foley, the vice president of the council, said the facility would have space for all sport clubs to store equipment, restrooms for students and spectators attending sport club games, a changing area and locker rooms for student athletes, and an athletic training room for all sports club members.\n\n\u201cA lot of clubs can\u2019t practice at South P because they need equipment at their practices because they can\u2019t carry everything from Campus Rec to the South P fields,\u201d Foley said, \u201cand also having the athletic training rooms will allow students to be more healthy and more safe.\u201d\n\nThe budget allocation for the facility is already pending approval by university administration, Foley said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) senate passed a resolution condemning State University of New York (SUNY) student assistant employment restrictions at its meeting", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Arielle Martinez", "og": {"site_name": "The Statesman", "description": "The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) senate passed a resolution condemning State University of New York (SUNY) student assistant employment restrictions at its meeting", "title": "Campus briefing: USG senate condemns SUNY student assistant policy", "url": "https://www.sbstatesman.com/2014/10/14/campus-briefing-usg-senate-condemns-suny-student-assistant-policy/", "image": "https://www.sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/141002_USG-Senate-Meeting_Manju.Shivacharan_8120-1024x767.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/141002_USG-Senate-Meeting_Manju.Shivacharan_8120-1024x767.jpg", "description": "The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) senate passed a resolution condemning State University of New York (SUNY) student assistant employment restrictions at its meeting", "site": "@sbstatesman", "card": "summary", "title": "Campus briefing: USG senate condemns SUNY student assistant policy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 240206602837517}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-statesman-logo_Artboard-3-1-270x270.jpg", "application-name": "The Statesman", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sbstatesman", "author": "https://www.sbstatesman.com/author/amartinez/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f55\"", "article_summary": "The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) senate passed a resolution condemning State University of New York (SUNY) student assistant employment restrictions by a vote of 16-0-2 at its meeting Thursday evening.\nThe senate resolution states that, because full-time Stony Brook University students are required to have health insurance, full-time students therefore cannot hold a student assistant position without already having health insurance.\nThe senate also confirmed Sarah Twarog to the position of chief justice of the USG Judiciary by a vote of 17-0-1.\nAdelson said that SUNY changed its policy because the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, requires businesses to provide health insurance benefits to employees who work an average of at least 30 hours per week.\nThe senate also passed an act to officially establish the Technology Issues Ad Hoc Committee by a vote of 15-0-3."}
