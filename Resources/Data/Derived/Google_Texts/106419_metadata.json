Guy has detailed the wide range of absurd comments Trump\u2019s made and things he\u2019s done on the campaign trail, from giving out Sen. Graham\u2019s cell phone number on live television to the latest: likening Carson\u2019s pathology to that of a child molester\u2014really. So, it\u2019s no surprise that there\u2019s \u201canxiety bordering on panic among Republican elites\u201d with regard to Trump\u2014and Carson\u2019s\u2014longevity in this race.\n\nWaPo reports:\n\nParty leaders and donors fear that nominating either man would have negative ramifications for the GOP ticket up and down the ballot, virtually ensuring a Hillary Rodham Clinton presidency and increasing the odds that the Senate falls into Democratic hands. The party establishment is paralyzed. Big money is still on the sidelines. No consensus alternative to the outsiders has emerged from the pack of governors and senators running, and there is disagreement about how to prosecute the case against them. Recent focus groups of Trump supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire commissioned by rival campaigns revealed no silver bullet. In normal times, the way forward would be obvious. The wannabes would launch concerted campaigns, including television attack ads, against the \u00adfront-runners. But even if the other candidates had a sense of what might work this year, it is unclear whether it would ultimately accrue to their benefit. Trump\u2019s counterpunches have been withering, while Carson\u2019s appeal to the base is spiritual, not merely political. If someone was able to do significant damage to them, there\u2019s no telling to whom their supporters would turn, if anyone.\n\nExcept perhaps Mitt Romney, to the particularly desperate GOP establishment.\n\nAccording to other Republicans, some in the party establishment are so desperate to change the dynamic that they are talking anew about drafting Romney \u2014 despite his insistence that he will not run again. Friends have mapped out a strategy for a late entry to pick up delegates and vie for the nomination in a convention fight, according to the Republicans who were briefed on the talks, though Romney has shown no indication of reviving his interest.\n\nThis seems unlikely, but then again, if you told anyone a year ago that Trump would be the Republican frontrunner they\u2019d probably say you\u2019re crazy.\n\nLife is stranger than fiction. Looks like we\u2019ll have to wait and see.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Romney to the rescue?
