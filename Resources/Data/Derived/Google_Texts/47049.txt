In what almost has to be an episode of Portlandia, a very nice couple out in full cold-weather jogging gear told a KOIN 6 reporter that Portland’s unusual amount of snowfall Saturday night was “perfect” for jogging—only for one of them to slip and fall directly following the interview.

“It’s the perfect texture for running,” one of the two joggers the local reporter. “It’s low impact, and it’s dry snow, so your feet don’t get wet.”

“It’s too nice to not be out here,” the other said, outfitted in bright yellow Nike gear (it’s a company town), before noting that cyclists have it really tough. “I don’t know how they do it with the bikes. Braking? At least we can slide through a stop sign.” Sometimes involuntarily.
