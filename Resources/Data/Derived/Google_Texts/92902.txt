BRONX â€” Primaries for the state's 77th and 79th Assembly districts are Tuesday, Sept. 9, featuring contests for two seats, both of which have been vacant for months.

The 77th Assembly District seat, which has been empty since New York City Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson joined the City Council in December 2013, serves the southwest Bronx, including the neighborhoods of Highbridge and Mount Eden.

The 79th Assembly District has been vacant since January, when former Assemblyman Eric Stevenson was found guilty on federal corruption charges. It serves Morrisania and Melrose.

Here is a look at the candidates for both seats:

District 77

Rev. Verdell Mack: Mack has lived in The Bronx for 42 years and is married to the Rev. Henry Mack Jr., pastor of the Gospel Hill Baptist Church in Morrisania.

Among the "The 10 Commitments" for her candidacy are helping to bring more small businesses to the district, increasing access to quality health care and improving traffic on the Cross Bronx Expressway.

"I am running for state Assembly because I have a vision for the future of positive change in lives of the people of the 77th Assembly District and The Bronx at large," she said in an email.

"As the Assembly person of the district, I will work hard to make this vision a reality that will engender academic empowerment, economical development, environmental protection, energy security and social pride/equality."

Mack has also worked as a bank officer at JP Morgan Chase and as a manager and residential coordinator for groups such as Abbott House and the Cerebral Palsy Association of New York State.

Sherrise Palomino: Palomino arrived in The Bronx about five years ago to focus on helping at-risk youths avoid HIV and teen pregnancy.

She worked on President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and has also worked with the AIDS Center of Queens County and HERO, a pilot project from the United Nations Association-USA meant to help children who live in Sub-Saharan African communities affected by HIV/AIDS.

Palomino supports increasing investments in small businesses, improving state services for veterans and expanding adult and youth education opportunities in The Bronx.
