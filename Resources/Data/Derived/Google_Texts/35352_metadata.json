The Catholic Church remains adamantly opposed to abortion.\n\nThen in 2012, all 181 U.S. Bishops condemned the Affordable Care Act over the requirement that health insurers should provide contraception free of charge. The Catholic Church is also against contraception.\n\nBut last year the bishops backed Obama's gun control proposals.\n\nPresident George W. Bush\n\nDuring a 2004 meeting at the Vatican with Pope John Paul II, Bush was forced to sit and listen as the pontiff read a statement condemning the Iraq War and the abuse of prisoners by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison.\n\nBush, however, was awestruck not chastened.\n\nSaid Bush: \"For those of you who have ever met him, you know, I'm telling you the truth when I tell you, being in his presence is an awesome experience.\"\n\nPresident Bill Clinton\n\nThe Polish pontiff dropped a bomb on Clinton as well. After a face-to-face meeting in 1993, John Paul made it clear he opposed Clinton's stance on abortion.\n\n\"The inalienable dignity of every human being and the rights which flow from that dignity -- including the right to life and the defense of life -- as well as the well-being and full human development of individuals and peoples, are at the heart of the church's message and action in the world,\" he said while Clinton looked on.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo of New York\n\nIn 2011, a consultant to the Vatican's highest court publicly called for Cuomo to be denied holy communion because he lives with his girlfriend Sandra Lee. Cuomo's marriage to Kerry Kennedy ended in a bitter divorce in 2003.\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nThe twice-divorced former New York mayor, a Republican who married his third wife in a civil ceremony, got grief from other Catholics \u2014 but not from The Church itself \u2014 when he took holy communion in 2008 during Pope Benedict's mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nJohn Kerry\n\nWhen the now Secretary of State was a Massachusetts senator running for president in 2004, several bishops \u2014 including Boston's Sean O'Malley \u2014 urged that he be denied communion for supporting abortion rights.\n\nSen. John McCain\n\nWhile running for president in 2007, the Arizona Republican was taken to the woodshed by Jewish and Muslim leaders for saying that he would prefer a Christian president and that the Constitution established America as a \"Christian nation.\"\n\n\"It is a very dangerous and mistaken thing to say,\" said Rabbi Perry Berkowitz of the American Jewish Heritage Organization. \"America is not a Christian nation. It is a multiethnic, multifaith, and multicultural nation, and that is its glory.\"\n\n\"That kind of attitude goes against the American tradition of religious pluralism and inclusion,\" chimed-in Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He's not the first and he probably won't be the last, Donald Trump is just the latest U.S. politician to be publicly spanked by a religious leader.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "He's not the first and he probably won't be the last, Donald Trump is just the latest U.S. politician to be publicly spanked by a religious leader.", "title": "Trump Just Latest Pol to Tangle With Religious Leaders", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/pope-francis/trump-joins-list-politicians-who-have-tangled-religious-leaders-n520851", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_07/1423151/160218-trump_pope-1247_56a445443829e9fa54e5b253fbc3729d.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "He's not the first and he probably won't be the last, Donald Trump is just the latest U.S. politician to be publicly spanked by a religious leader.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_07/1423151/160218-trump_pope-1247_56a445443829e9fa54e5b253fbc3729d.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Trump Joins List of Politicians Who Have Tangled With Religious Leaders - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-18", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/pope-francis/trump-joins-list-politicians-who-have-tangled-religious-leaders-n520851", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Pope Francis, Bishops, President Obama,News,Pope Francis,Pope Francis,Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump is just the latest U.S. politician to be publicly spanked by a religious leader.\n\"That kind of attitude goes against the American tradition of religious pluralism and inclusion,\" chimed-in Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\"It is a very dangerous and mistaken thing to say,\" said Rabbi Perry Berkowitz of the American Jewish Heritage Organization.\nThen in 2012, all 181 U.S. Bishops condemned the Affordable Care Act over the requirement that health insurers should provide contraception free of charge.\nAnd when Pope Francis declared Trump's controversial proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border \"not Christian,\" he was following in the footsteps of some other outspoken pontiffs."}
