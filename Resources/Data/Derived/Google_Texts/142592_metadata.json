That it\u2019s an exception to your eating, but if this is what you\u2019re eating all of the time we have to be a little more aware of the calorie content or the nutrition content.\u201d\n\nThe new regulations will affect restaurants, convenience stores, coffee shops, amusement parks and even movie theaters, but even dieticians are betting it\u2019s not going to affect which snack you\u2019re taking into the cinema.\n\n\u201cIf you really want something that\u2019s your favorite food and a special treat, maybe you don\u2019t even look at the nutrition facts label and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Metos said. \u201cIt\u2019s a special treat--you already know it\u2019s not the most healthy. That\u2019s fine, but I think this is most helpful for your day-to-day eating.\u201d\n\nMetos said the displayed calorie count will probably only affect about 25 to 30 percent of the food choices people make, with the reason being that nutrition isn\u2019t the first thing most Americans consider when picking their food.\n\n\u201cNutrition is number three or four on the list, it\u2019s on the list but taste is first, cost is second for most people, and then nutrition is third,\u201d Metos said.\n\nBusinesses have until December 2015 to comply with the regulation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY -- This year, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll notice some changes to a few of the food stops you frequent, as the Food and Drug Administration is implementing a new policy for all chain food vendors.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "a9bc8fabb9f6cda780dcd354edb426e8"}, "og": {"site_name": "fox13now.com", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 This year, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll notice some changes to a few of the food stops you frequent, as the Food and Drug Administration is implementing a new policy for all chain food\u2026", "title": "FDA\u2019s new regulations will require more food vendors to display calorie count", "url": "http://fox13now.com/2014/12/11/fdas-new-regulations-will-require-more-food-vendors-to-display-calorie-count/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/promo242613970.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/promo242613970.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox13now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox13now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News for Salt Lake City, Ogden, Provo and beyond", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324152525", "fb": {"pages": 75831650585}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox13now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/98a0a4875aa0281a51f538da86df31aa?s=16", "application-name": "fox13now.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/", "published_time": "2014-12-12T02:12:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-12T02:12:27+00:00", "author": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/"}, "keywords": "news, affordable care act, fda, nutrition", "google-site-verification": "avVLxvtHokA_r9gaDC1cvuQNhoxzcJHtFAJItW79fPI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Food and Drug Administration's new policy requires all chain food vendors to display calorie content on display cases.\nThe FDA will begin requiring all food vendors with 20 or more locations to display menus with the calorie content of all standard food items cooked in-house.\nThe new regulations are pretty specific, and now everything from fountain drinks, to cheese sticks to salads will have their calorie count on display, a costly change for each company.\nThe new regulations are a part of the Affordable Care Act, and it\u2019s all in an effort to combat the nation\u2019s obesity epidemic.\n\u201cIf you really want something that\u2019s your favorite food and a special treat, maybe you don\u2019t even look at the nutrition facts label and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Metos said."}
