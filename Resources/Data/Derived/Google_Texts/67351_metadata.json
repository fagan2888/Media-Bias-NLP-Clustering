In January, he announced more pro-business policies, gradual deficit reduction, and tweaks to France\u2019s generous social system \u2014 but not the overhaul sought by some. Recent polls show his approval rating in the high teens, among the lowest levels in decades for a French president.\n\nUnlike neighboring Spain and Italy, France has made no major structural reforms. But Hollande ordered 50 billion euros ($66 billion) in cost savings over three years across the government, sparing only schools and the judicial system, including courts and police.\n\nThe latest tilt toward the political center suggests Hollande is committing to reforms and cuts, as opposed to increased public spending, to revive the economy, but without eroding the social safety net. It also indicates he is willing to try to bring France\u2019s deficits back within European Union limits.\n\n\u201cThis is a confirmation of the desire of the executive to maintain its direction,\u201d said Antoine Bozio, an economist and director of the public policy institute IPP in Paris.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Cabinet shuffle marked the exit of Arnaud Montebourg, a firebrand economy minister who recently publicly criticized Hollande\u2019s budgetary rigor as a crimp to growth. Many believed Hollande had kept on Montebourg, a frequent critic, to assuage the solidly-left segment of the Socialist Party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "French leader banks on free market to save economy", "title": "French leader banks on free market to save economy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "French leader banks on free market to save economy", "title": "French leader banks on free market to save economy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/28/french_leader_banks_on_free_market_to_save_economy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/aptopix-france-cabinet-reshuffle.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "French leader banks on free market to save economy", "title": "French leader banks on free market to save economy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/aptopix-france-cabinet-reshuffle.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jamey Keaten and Sylvie Corbet", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In January, he announced more pro-business policies, gradual deficit reduction, and tweaks to France\u2019s generous social system \u2014 but not the overhaul sought by some.\nHollande has not made good on his pledges to revive the economy and reduce unemployment since taking office in 2012.\nRecent polls show his approval rating in the high teens, among the lowest levels in decades for a French president.\nMany believed Hollande had kept on Montebourg, a frequent critic, to assuage the solidly-left segment of the Socialist Party.\nTuesday\u2019s Cabinet shuffle marked the exit of Arnaud Montebourg, a firebrand economy minister who recently publicly criticized Hollande\u2019s budgetary rigor as a crimp to growth."}
