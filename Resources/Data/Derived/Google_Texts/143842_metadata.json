Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) had sharp words for the GOP-led special committee tapped to investigate the terrorist attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a hunting mission for a lynch mob.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee chair noted that several congressional committees, including her own, have already investigated the deadly attacks. Republicans, however, believe the White House misled the public on the Sept. 11, 2012, events and argue there are still many unanswered questions.\n\nFeinstein, though, believes reports showed no wrongdoing on the part of the White House.\n\n\u201cThere have been four major reports. We spent a year and a half on a report,'\u201d Feinstein told host Candy Crowley. \u201cWe held hearings. Thousands of pages were reviewed. The staff spent hours and weeks on it.\u201d\n\nCrowley asked the senator if she believed reports answered the necessary questions pertaining to the attacks, to which Feinstein said she believes they have.\n\n\u201cOur report was bipartisan,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were certainly answered to the satisfaction of the Intelligence Committee.\u201d\n\nIndependent reports, Feinstein mentioned, did find that the terrorist attacks could have been prevented, including one from the Accountability Review Board which found there were \u201csystemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies\u201d before the attacks. Her own committee\u2019s report concluded the Benghazi attacks were \u201clikely preventable\u201d because of prior safety and security warnings that went ignored.\n\nStill, Feinstein pointed to the 1983 terror attacks in Beirut that left 241 Americans dead as evidence of the GOP\u2019s hypocrisy in calling for further investigation into Benghazi.\n\n\u201cIf you compare [Benghazi] to Ronald Reagan, the big Republican hero, and what happened in Beirut \u2026 and Reagan admitted we weren\u2019t ready for it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted to form a select committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) tapped Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to lead the panel, which is supposed to include seven Republicans and five Democrats.\n\nWhile Boehner has named the Republicans to sit on the committee, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has yet to tap Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Sen.
