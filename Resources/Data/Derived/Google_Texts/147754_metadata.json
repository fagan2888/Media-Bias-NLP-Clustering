The episode featured a panel of comedians poised to joke about the lack of diversity in the Republican party at the expense of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s grandson, Kieran, who is adopted. The panelists and Harris-Perry\u2019s comments sparked a media firestorm, one that prompted an apology from the MSNBC host.\n\n\u201cWhatever the intent was, the reality is that the segment proceeded in a way that was offensive. And showing the photo in that context, that segment, was poor judgment. So without reservation or qualification, I apologize to the Romney family,\u201d Harris-Perry said. \u201cAdults who enter into public life, implicitly consent to having less privacy. But their families, especially their children, should not be treated callously or thoughtlessly. My intention was not malicious, but I broke the ground-rule that families are off-limits. For that I am sorry.\u201d\n\nShe then proceeded to speak on the topic of trans-racial adoption, a topic which left Harris-Perry emotional as she began to choke up.\n\n\u201cAlso, Allow me to apologize to other families formed through trans-racial adoption, because I am deeply sorry that we suggested that interracial families are in any way funny or deserving of ridicule,\u201d she said.\n\nHarris-Perry first apologized for the panel\u2019s comments via Twitter on Tuesday using the #MHPapology. Gov. Romney is expected to address the MSNBC host\u2019s comments during an appearance on Fox News Sunday tomorrow.\n\nWatch Harris-Perry\u2019s apology below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Nerdland got a little somber Saturday morning as MSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry addressed the controversial remarks she made last week regarding 2012 Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney's family in a tearful and heartfelt apology.", "title": "[WATCH] Melissa Harris-Perry addresses Romney remarks in tearful...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/01/Melissa-Harris-Perry-600x332.jpg", "height": 332}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/01/04/watch-melissa-harris-perry-addresses-romney-remarks-in-tearful-apology/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "trans-racial-adoption", "published_time": "2014-01-04T12:55:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-07T18:44:42+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Nerdland got a little somber Saturday morning as MSNBC\u2019s Melissa Harris-Perry addressed the controversial remarks she made last week regarding 2012 Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s family in a tearful and heartfelt apology.\nSo without reservation or qualification, I apologize to the Romney family,\u201d Harris-Perry said.\nRomney is expected to address the MSNBC host\u2019s comments during an appearance on Fox News Sunday tomorrow.\nFor that I am sorry.\u201dShe then proceeded to speak on the topic of trans-racial adoption, a topic which left Harris-Perry emotional as she began to choke up.\nThe panelists and Harris-Perry\u2019s comments sparked a media firestorm, one that prompted an apology from the MSNBC host."}
