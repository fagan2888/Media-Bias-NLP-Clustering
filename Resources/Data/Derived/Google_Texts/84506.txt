JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Hundreds enjoyed a Christmas breakfast this morning, thanks to the Sulzbacher Center.

Board members and volunteers served almost 600 people starting at 6 a.m. Christmas Day.

Santa also paid them a visit to the breakfast event, handing out presents to homeless children.

Saint Nick didn't just surprise the kids, he also surprised three families with a gift that could change their lives, all thanks to an anonymous donor.

"These families are going to be given a certificate for all the utility and rent deposits,” said Cindy Funkhouser, chief executive officer and president, Sulzbacher Center. “Two months’ worth of rent and all the furniture for a new apartment. So after the first of the year we'll be able to move these families out and into their own housing."

These families were chosen because they were already close to moving out of the Sulzbacher center.

Funkhouser says, “They just needed a jump-start to get back on their feet.”
