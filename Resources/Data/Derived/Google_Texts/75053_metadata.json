Its current focus is building and expanding mental health resources for children and teens at Denver Health Medical Center.\n\nJohnston was honored Aug. 25 when the Carson J Spencer Foundation had its ninth Shining Lights of Hope Gala at the Grand Hyatt Denver. She was nominated by her friend, Carson J Spencer Foundation board member Christy Belz, who also chaired the gala with her husband, Ferd.\n\n\u201cThe award is given to a person who has experienced a suicide or mental health crisis and has turned that loss or struggle into positive energy to help promote mental health and prevent suicide,\u201d Christy Belz noted. \u201cGG Johnston is a true inspiration.\u201d\n\nOther awards went to engineer Chas Klisis, Volunteer of the Year; Gourmet Fine Catering (Corporate Shooting Star); and The Denver Post, Media All-Star Award. In addition, Columbine and Monarch high schools were recognized for their contributions to the foundation\u2019s FIRE Within program.\n\nJoanne Davidson: 303-809-1314, jdavidson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/getitwrite", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Davidson: Carson J Spencer Foundation honors those who\u2019ve helped prevent suicide", "title": "Davidson: Carson J Spencer Foundation honors those who\u2019ve helped prevent suicide", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/02/davidson-carson-j-spencer-foundation-honors-those-whove-helped-prevent-suicide/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130902__20130904_C2_FE04FDRSVPp1.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130902__20130904_C2_FE04FDRSVPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-02T15:11:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:48:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5d4\"", "article_summary": "Its current focus is building and expanding mental health resources for children and teens at Denver Health Medical Center.\nShe was nominated by her friend, Carson J Spencer Foundation board member Christy Belz, who also chaired the gala with her husband, Ferd.\n\u201cThe award is given to a person who has experienced a suicide or mental health crisis and has turned that loss or struggle into positive energy to help promote mental health and prevent suicide,\u201d Christy Belz noted.\nJohnston was honored Aug. 25 when the Carson J Spencer Foundation had its ninth Shining Lights of Hope Gala at the Grand Hyatt Denver.\nToday, she\u2019s an in-demand executive coach and respected community leader whose volunteer work includes chairing Denver Health Foundation\u2019s Level One Society."}
