They are concerned citizens, and they are patriots,\u201d Ellison said of his suspicious neighbors. \u201cObama has really painted a portrait in the minds of many conservatives that he is capable of this sort of thing.\u201d\n\nAcross town at the Bastrop County Courthouse, such talk elicits a weary sigh from County Judge Paul Pape, the chief official in this county of 78,000 people. Pape said he has tried to explain to folks that the exercise, known as Jade Helm 15, is a routine training mission that poses no threat to anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Why Operation Jade Helm 15 is freaking out the Internet \u2014 and why it shouldn\u2019t be]\n\nPape chaired a public meeting this spring and invited a U.S. Army Special Operations Command spokesman to answer questions about Jade Helm. The meeting drew more than 150 people carrying signs that read \u201cNo Gestapo in Bastropo,\u201d \u201cKeep America Free\u201d and \u201cDissent is Not a Conspiracy Theory.\u201d Some asked whether the Army was bringing in Islamic State fighters, if the United Nations would be involved, and whether the military was planning to relieve local gun owners of their firearms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sensitive to the fact that some of our Bastrop residents are concerned, and I\u2019m confident that they are very sincere about their concerns,\u201d Pape said. \u201cBut how did we get to this point in our country?\u201d\n\nRace and economic anxiety\n\nHere in the soft, green farmlands east of Austin, some say the answer is simple: \u201cThe truth is, this stems a fair amount from the fact that we have a black president,\u201d said Terry Orr, who was Bastrop\u2019s mayor from 2008 to 2014.\n\nOrr said he strongly disagrees with those views, and he supports Jade Helm. But he said a significant number of people in town distrust Obama because they think he is primarily concerned with the welfare of blacks and \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople think the government is just not on the side of the white guy,\u201d Orr said.\n\nBastrop\u2019s current mayor, Kenneth Kesselus, who also supports Jade Helm, agrees. Kesselus said the distrust is due in part to a sense that \u201cthings aren\u2019t as good as they used to be,\u201d especially economically. \u201cThe middle class is getting squeezed and they\u2019ve got to take it out on somebody, and Obama is a great target.\u201d\n\nThe Army says the size and scope of Jade Helm 15, a Special Operations exercise that begins in July, set it apart from other training exercises. Also setting it apart: The widespread conspiracy theories that the U.S. is preparing to hatch martial law. The Post's Dan Lamothe explains. (Tom LeGro/The Washington Post)\n\nDock Jackson, 62, an African American who has been on the Bastrop City Council for 24 years, grew up when the town was still segregated, literally by railroad tracks. Today, Bastrop is 34 percent Hispanic and 8 percent black, and a wonderful place to live, he said, a place where the races generally get along.\n\nBut the Jade Helm backlash has been a \u201cred flag\u201d that our county \u201cstill has a lot of things they need to come to terms with,\u201d Jackson said, including the anger and disrespect being directed at the president.\n\nAt a recent family reunion at a Bastrop community center, Mark Peterson, who is black, said he has been \u201cshocked\u201d by what he views as racist undertones in much of the objection to Jade Helm.\n\n\u201cWhat I hate to hear most is, \u2018We want to take our country back.\u2019 This is still your country. Where did it go?\u201d said Peterson, 42, a technology manager for a financial firm in Austin. \u201cIf it were any other president but Obama, it would not be an issue.\u201d\n\n[It isn\u2019t just Jade Helm 15: The varying and misunderstood roles of state-sponsored militias]\n\nJade Helm\u2019s troubles started with a map, released by the military, which depicted the area of operations. It showed seven southwestern states colored red for \u201chostile\u201d (including Texas) and blue for \u201cpermissive\u201d (including California). The map sent the conspiracy-minded into overdrive.\n\nAt the public hearing this spring, military spokesman Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria explained that those designations are part of a fictional scenario: Jade Helm is intended to simulate U.S. Special Forces helping resistance fighters restore democracy in an imaginary country. The operation\u2019s logo, which features a Dutch wooden shoe, is meant to represent anti-Nazi resistance in World War II Europe.\n\nLastoria patiently answered questions for nearly three hours, explaining that while Jade Helm would involve 1,200 troops across seven states, no more than 60 would be training in Bastrop County. Moreover, the The Texas operation would be confined to military bases \u2014 including Camp Swift, a large Army National Guard base in Bastrop \u2014 as well as private property where the military had secured the landowners\u2019 permission.\n\n\u201cAll service members take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, and we put our lives on the line every day to uphold that oath,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for people to come up with irrational ideas and try to associate them with the United States military, it does our troops a disservice.\u201d\n\nThe hearing failed to tamp down the paranoia, however. Ellison, the GOP chairman, said \u201cthe fear factor is justified.\u201d\n\nObama \u201cdoesn\u2019t take national threats seriously enough,\u201d Ellison said, ticking off Obama\u2019s policies toward Russia, Iran, Cuba and the Islamic State, as well as illegal immigration across the U.S. southern border and the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\u201cWhat he views as alarming instead is conservatism,\u201d Ellison said, alleging that the Obama administration has used the Internal Revenue Service to attack the tea party and other conservative groups, been hostile to gun owners, issued what conservatives consider an illegal executive order to avoid deporting illegal immigrants, and \u201cbeen complicit in stirring riots\u201d in racially charged situations in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration has a history of attacking Texas\u201d on issues from education standards to environmental regulations to Obamacare, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that much of a leap to believe that he would try to employ the military like he does the IRS.\u201d\n\nOthers suspect Obama wants to establish martial law to cancel the 2016 presidential elections and extend his term in office. Terry Wareham, head of the Bastrop County Tea Party, said she fears that the Obama administration might deliberately instigate violence between soldiers and Texans as a pretext for establishing martial law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not against the military. This community is very supportive of the military,\u201d Wareham said. \u201cBut who\u2019s the commander in chief of the military?\u201d\n\nA \u2018toxic\u2019 politics\n\nSome in Bastrop dismiss the talk of martial law as the delusional rantings of saucer-eyed loons. But others see it as the logical outcome of the Texas political climate, where they say the state\u2019s Republican leaders have eagerly stoked distrust of the federal government, and especially of Obama.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to convince people the federal government is coming after them,\u201d said state Sen. Kirk Watson, a Democrat who represents Bastrop County.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R) has ordered the Texas State Guard to \u201cmonitor\u201d Jade Helm 15. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican presidential hopeful, has said he understands \u201cthe reason for concern and uncertainty, because . . . the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say the government is coming after you,\u201d Watson said, \u201cso why would you be surprised if the government shows up with guns?\u201d\n\nCarol Schumacher, a Bastrop artist whose property backs up onto Camp Swift, laughed when asked about the Jade Helm conspiracy theorists.\n\n\u201cI think those people are crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about them taking over.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bastrop residents fear that a military exercise will be used spy on them, confiscate their guns and establish martial law.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kevinsullivanpost", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Bastrop residents fear that a military exercise will be used spy on them, confiscate their guns and establish martial law.", "title": "The Americans are coming!
