In the months since, the term and the community it represents have catapulted into the cultural zeitgeist, becoming more widely used\u2014and better understood by Americans.\n\nFor many LGBT advocates, Obama\u2019s simple acknowledgement was a powerful recognition, bestowing legitimacy upon a population that had been largely ignored by the U.S. government. It also marked the beginning of a landmark year in which trans people came to prominence in the culture, from Caitlyn Jenner's documentary series to Jeffrey Tambor winning an Emmy award for his role as a transgender parent on the Amazon series Transparent. Not only that, but Washington made unprecedented steps toward advancing transgender awareness and promoting transgender rights from health care to the military.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that transgender rights have a long way to go in 2016: Advocates are still campaigning for the government to count transgender individuals in the U.S. Census; lawmakers have yet to outlaw so-called conversion therapy, despite a plea from Obama; and Congress has yet to pass the Equality Act, which would guarantee explicit protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nAs the year draws to a close, here are the transgender policies, laws, and small victories from Washington that trans people and advocates around the country can celebrate.\n\nHealth Care Coverage\n\nTransition-related health care comes with a hefty price tag, but few insurance carriers are willing to shoulder the cost, leaving transgender patients no choice but to pay out of pocket for treatments the American Medical Association says can be medically necessary, including hormone therapy. Federal employees seeking to access transition-related health care will no longer be burdened with such expenses, thanks to a government order that goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2016, and requires federal employees\u2019 insurance carriers to pick up the bill. In September, the Obama administration moved to crack down on industry-wide discrimination against transgender people by proposing a rule that would add sex discrimination to a list of civil protections offered in the Affordable Care Act. The proposal closed for public comments in November.\n\nInclusion in the Military\n\nResearchers at UCLA estimate that nearly 150,000 transgender people\u2014or almost a quarter of the transgender population in the U.S.\u2014are either military veterans, have retired from the Guard or Reserve service, or are on active duty. That\u2019s a military participation rate much higher than the general population\u2019s. Yet no service member has been openly transgender during tenure in the armed forces, owing to a long-standing ban on people whom the Pentagon considers to have \u201cpsychosexual disorders.\u201d That ban is expected to be overturned, however, in 2016. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter signaled the reversal last summer when he said in a statement that the military\u2019s ban on transgender service members was \u201coutdated\u201d and distracts commanders from their core missions.\n\nAcceptance in the White House\n\nOn April 8, Obama signed an executive order banning discrimination of federal employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. That same day, the White House opened its first gender-neutral bathroom. But for many advocates, one of the most visible achievements at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue came four months later, when the White House hired its first openly transgender staff member. Raffi Freedman-Gurspan was appointed as an outreach and recruitment director in the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. She had previously served as a policy adviser for the racial and economic justice initiatives at the National Center for Transgender Equality. The move was praised by LGBT leaders including NCTE executive director Mara Keisling. \u201cA transgender person was inevitably going to work in the White House,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThat the first transgender appointee is a transgender woman of color is itself significant.\u201d\n\nProtection From Congress\n\nWhile transgender visibility skyrocketed in mainstream media in 2015, the year also marked the deadliest on record since advocates began tallying reported transgender homicides in 2006. At least 21 transgender Americans, a majority of whom were women of color, were murdered this year, according to a report published by Human Rights Campaign. To address what it called an \u201cepidemic of violence against the transgender community,\u201d Congress took action, forming its first-ever Transgender Task Force in November. \u201cIt is our responsibility as leaders and public officials to ensure that all people are free from the fear of persecution, prejudice, or violence just for being who they are,\u201d Rep. Mike Honda, D-Calif., who formed the task force along with members of the House LGBT Equality Caucus, said in a statement. \u201cWe work to highlight the issues that transgender individuals face.\u201d Honda also introduced a bill to designate November as Transgender Acceptance Month.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jennifer Swann", "description": "From health care coverage to inclusion in the military, we recount the victories the White House made happen this year.", "rights": "TakePart is the Social Action Network\u2122 of Participant Media. \u00a9 2008-2016 TakePart, LLC", "og": {"site_name": "TakePart", "description": "From health care coverage to inclusion in the military, we recount the victories the White House made happen this year.", "title": "How Washington Let the Trans Community in on That Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness Thing", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/12/26/4-ways-transgender-rights-got-boost-dc-year", "image": {"width": 775, "identifier": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/Transgender-Year-MAIN.jpg", "height": 518}, "type": "article"}, "abstract": "From health care coverage to inclusion in the military, we recount the victories the White House made happen this year.", "sailthru.date": "2015-12-26 09:02:14", "MobileOptimized": 320, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "culture,health,social-justice,transgender-equality,transgender-rights,openpublish_article", "fb": {"admins": 1327833247, "pages": 9287842439, "app_id": 247137505296280}, "keywords": "Culture, Health, Social Justice", "tab-keywords": "Culture, Health, Social Justice, Transgender Equality, Transgender Rights", "twitter": {"description": "From health care coverage to inclusion in the military, we recount the victories the White House made happen this year.", "title": "How Washington Let the Trans Community in on That Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness Thing", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/12/26/4-ways-transgender-rights-got-boost-dc-year", "image": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/Transgender-Year-MAIN.jpg", "creator": "@TakePart", "site": "@TakePart", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Not only that, but Washington made unprecedented steps toward advancing transgender awareness and promoting transgender rights from health care to the military.\nRaffi Freedman-Gurspan was appointed as an outreach and recruitment director in the White House Office of Presidential Personnel.\nThat same day, the White House opened its first gender-neutral bathroom.\n\u201cA transgender person was inevitably going to work in the White House,\u201d she said in a statement.\nTo address what it called an \u201cepidemic of violence against the transgender community,\u201d Congress took action, forming its first-ever Transgender Task Force in November."}
