Industry revenue is forecast to decrease at an annualized rate of 1.5% to $165.0 billion, with revenue declining 2.0% in 2013. \u201cHistorically, sales have been bolstered by favorable demographic trends and the use of medication as a significant component of healthcare in the United States,\u201d according to IBISWorld Industry Analyst Sarah Turk. However, the industry is facing mounting competition from generic pharmaceuticals. Since the patent cliff in 2011 and 2012, many major products, such as Lipitor, have lost patent protection. Because generics are sold at a significant discount as compared to brand-name drugs, companies came under pricing pressure from downstream customers, causing operating profit to decrease.\n\nPlayers in the industry have tried to adapt to expiring patents by investing more in biological drugs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 allowed the US Food and Drug Administration to approve generic biologics, but also initiated a 12-year patent period on these types of drugs. \u201cWhile this legislation increases the threat from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in this segment of the industry, it also provides a clearer path for operators to manufacture generic biologic drugs,\u201d says Turk. Consequently, biologics will continue to play an important role in shaping this industry's future.\n\nHealthcare reform is also expected to boost sales as more individuals gain prescription drug coverage in 2014. To maintain profitability, industry operators are anticipated to continue consolidating and reducing costs, mainly through reductions in employment and research and development expenditure.\n\nFor more information, visit IBISWorld\u2019s Brand Name Pharmaceutical Manufacturing in the US industry report page.\n\nFollow IBISWorld on Twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/IBISWorld\n\nFriend IBISWorld on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/IBISWorld/121347533189\n\nIBISWorld industry Report Key Topics\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturers develop prescription and over-the-counter products that are used to prevent or treat illnesses in humans or animals.
