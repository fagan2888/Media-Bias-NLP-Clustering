Some of those messages reveal concerns about the law\u2019s unpopularity, its price tag, and its inability to control health care costs that the administration publicly dismissed or downplayed.\n\nIn June 2009, Clinton emailed Neera Tanden, a former Clinton campaign operative, then a top aide to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and now the president of the Center for American Progress.\n\nClinton wanted Tanden to arrange a meeting between three doctors and Nancy Ann DeParle, the White House official leading its health care reform efforts.\n\n\u201cI can arrange it, no worries,\u201d Tanden assured her. \u201cI know Dean Ornish from the Obama campaign,\u201d Tanden said, referring to one of the trio.\n\nOrnish is a high-dollar Democratic donor. According to federal campaign finance records, he\u2019s given more than $700,000 to Democratic campaigns, party organs, and outside groups since the 1990s.\n\nHis organization, the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, previously received $3.5 million in earmarks courtesy of then-House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), one of the recipients of his political contributions.\n\nOrnish has donated to both of Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns, and co-hosted a fundraiser for the campaign in 2007. He is also a high-dollar donor to the Clinton Foundation, having given between $100,000 and $250,000, according to the Foundation\u2019s website.\n\nTanden apparently arranged the meeting between Ornish and DeParle. \u201cThanks for following thru,\u201d Clinton wrote five days later.\n\nThat exchange was one of many between Clinton and Tanden during the legislative battles over Obamacare, according to emails to Clinton\u2019s personal email address released by the State Department in response to a series of Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nThe emails show Tanden providing frequent updates from the White House\u2019s perspective on those fights, often sharing details that contradicted administration talking points about the promised benefits of their health care reform efforts.\n\nOne selling point for the law was that it would reduce health care costs. But as early as October 2009, six months before Obamacare became law, Tanden cast doubt on its cost-control measures in private exchanges with Clinton.\n\n\u201cIn terms of cost controls, the dirty little secret is that we don\u2019t have a lot of good evidence on what works\u2014in a way that that Congress has any appetite to do,\u201d Tanden wrote in one email.\n\n\u201cI mean, cost controls, as we all know, is attacked as rationing. So everyone likes to discuss this, including the Administration, but then on the other hand, says they won\u2019t touch benefits,\u201d she complained.\n\nRepublicans frequently attacked provisions of the bill as efforts to \u201cration\u201d health care, such as its creation of Medicare\u2019s Independent Payment Advisory Board, which makes recommendations about medical care that should or should not be covered by the entitlement program.\n\nThough the administration publicly denied that IPAB would limit care, Tanden conceded in an email to Clinton that its purpose was \u201cto streamline cutting Medicare.\u201d Other cost control mechanisms would also target the program, Tanden said. \u201cWe\u2019d use mostly Medicare Advantage cuts\u201d to pay for another portion of the bill, she wrote.\n\nDespite those efforts, Tanden admitted that she was not convinced the law could actually \u201cbend the cost curve,\u201d as the administration claimed.\n\n\u201cBy emphasizing costs so much at the beginning of this process, we may have oversold what these bills will (or even can) do,\u201d she admitted to Clinton.\n\nTanden also conceded that the American people did not look fondly on Obamacare in its legislative stages. \u201cThere is a lot of anger at the White House [at Democrats in congress] for making them spend a year on this bill that is so clearly unpopular,\u201d she told Clinton.\n\n\u201cEveryone is freaked out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPolling is horrible out there.\u201d\n\nDespite those concerns, Tanden was determined to make sure that Clinton got credit for the law.\n\nThe day Obamacare passed, Tanden emailed Clinton with the subject line \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cI know \u2013 maybe more than most \u2013 how much the President\u2019s actions over the last year were influenced by the primary fight on health care,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTwo months later, after Tanden had joined CAP, she was pitching reporters on stories that would ensure Clinton earned credit for the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m meeting with Robert Pear on Friday to pitch him on how so many of your ideas are in the health care bill and it is closest to your proposal,\u201d she told Clinton in May 2010. \u201cI\u2019ve held out for him, but if he doesn\u2019t I can go to the Post or elsewhere.\u201d\n\nAfter the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate in 2012, Tanden touted CAP\u2019s efforts to preserve the measure. \u201cI\u2019ve been working to defend the mandate for 4 years in honor of 2007/2008,\u201d she wrote.\n\nNeither the Clinton campaign nor Tanden returned a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton worked to get a high-dollar donor to the Clinton Foundation access to a health care official during the legislative fight over Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Hillary Clinton worked to get a high-dollar donor to the Clinton Foundation access to a top White House health care official during the legislative fight over Obamacare, according to emails that revea", "title": "Clinton Arranged WH Access for Donor During Obamacare Fight", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/clinton-arranged-wh-access-for-donor-during-obamacare-fight/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ornish1-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton worked to get a high-dollar donor to the Clinton Foundation access to a top White Ho", "creator": "@lachlan", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ornish1-150x150.jpg", "title": "Clinton Arranged WH Access for Donor During Obamacare Fight", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88da\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI know Dean Ornish from the Obama campaign,\u201d Tanden said, referring to one of the trio.\nBY: Follow @lachlanHillary Clinton worked to get a high-dollar donor to the Clinton Foundation access to a top White House health care official during the legislative fight over Obamacare, according to emails that reveal new details about the administration\u2019s role in that fight.\nNeither the Clinton campaign nor Tanden returned a request for comment.\nClinton wanted Tanden to arrange a meeting between three doctors and Nancy Ann DeParle, the White House official leading its health care reform efforts.\nOne selling point for the law was that it would reduce health care costs."}
