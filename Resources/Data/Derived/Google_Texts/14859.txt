You may have heard about the recent no-shampoo craze, often referred to as the “no-poo” method. Followers of this fad believe that shampoo does more damage than good for your hair, and boast that their locks actually fare better without it. In a YouTube video, the team at Reactions investigated the no-poo method, and found major flaws associated with the growing trend.

A quick Google search says shampoo is to blame for everything from stripping hair of oils to causing scalp irritation. But how accurate are these accounts?

Proponents of the “no-poo” fad claim the hair is self-cleaning, and after a few weeks of greasy, smelly hair, your scalp will cease to produce sebum — the oil that coats your hair and skin. Reactions reported this was a myth and that, in reality, the scalp continues to produce sebum no matter what the hair’s condition is.

It’s not only sebum that continues to get trapped in your locks; hair also picks up pollen, dirt, pollution, and other random stuff from the air. What’s more, washing with just water also comes with its own set of consequences. According to Reactions, water helps to stretch the cuticles of the hair, and may cause them to dry out and feel rough. This can leave locks dull and fragile.

Instead of going completely sans shampoo, Reactions suggests using just conditioner — which has many of the same ingredients as shampoo only in lower quantities — or dry starches or clays. Whatever you do, make sure not to try an obscure product on your hair, such as vinegar, which, due to its acidity, is actually far more damaging than shampoo could ever be.
