That might not be the case in this country anymore, but recent years have seen a resurgence in the popularity of carefully crafted beards and mustaches. Some harken back to the whiskers on these historical South Bend-area men.\n\nClick through the photos to the left of this story. Do you have a favorite among the five styles?\n\n\u2022 G.L. Bunker, one-time South Bend police chief, sports a handlebar mustache. Though it called for extra tending, the style was popular from the late 1800s until the 1920s. It required products such as a curling iron and wax to maintain the trademark curl.\n\n\u2022 In this 1877 photograph, U.S. Rep. William H. Calkins wears a chevron mustache and a chin puff goatee. He also served as a state\u2019s attorney and as an associate justice for the Washington territory in the months leading up to its becoming a state.\n\n\u2022 Charles H. Applegate moved to South Bend in 1855 and worked in a dry goods store before studying medicine. In this late 1800s photograph, he bears the style that became especially popular in the United States after the 1860s, when Abraham Lincoln became the first president to have a beard. Four other presidents would have beards, but none as long as Applegate\u2019s.\n\n\u2022 The facial fur favored by Elijah A. Morse is called Friendly Muttonchops, a mustache connected to muttonchops with no chin beard. Morse was born in South Bend but moved to Massachusetts when he was a child. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War and as a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts.\n\n\u2022 This walrus-style mustache, which resembles an ungroomed handlebar mustache, adorns John Klingel, a German immigrant. He operated John Klingel & Bro., a boot and shoe store, and he was a member of the first city council when the city of South Bend was incorporated.\n\nThis occasional anniversary feature, compiled by The History Museum, includes images from the Museum\u2019s photographic collection.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "#loc,charles h applegate,john klingel,gl bunker,sb150", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "Men\u2019s facial hair was once a symbol of wealth and status in South Bend", "title": "What's your favorite?
