At the time, Kailua was a broken down little town which offered its residents no real place to shop, forcing them to go over the mountain to the \u201cother side,\u201d to procure anything but groceries.\n\nAlthough the Kailua Neighborhood Board thinks of Kailua as an independent entity, the town is actually a throwback to plantation days, with most of the commercial space owned by a single landlord since time began. That landlord, the Castle Family and its avatar Kaneohe Ranch, has developed the town into a successful, bustling place since the First Tourist\u2019s accidental arrival at the intersection of Kailua Road and Kailua Road.\n\n\u201cAfter years of resident complaints about the pathetic retail and restaurant offerings in Kailua,\u201d said a Castle family spokesperson, \u201d We got sick of it and decided to show them what their whining would mean.\u201d\n\nAs part of its effort to drive Kailua from the collective visitor memory, the Kailua Neighborhood Board will demand that small businesses which serve the visitor trade close their doors. This will allow Kailua to revert to the bleak little burg discovered by the First Tourist. Additionally, the Kailua Neighborhood Board will ask The President and his family not to take their usual Christmas vacation in Kailua. Talk is afoot about taking advantage of the disappearing shoreline to eliminate Kailu\u2019s popular beach altogether. \u201dAfter all,\u201d said one Board member, \u201cResidents don\u2019t go there because there are too many visitors.\u201d The Neighborhood Board, it turns out, is responsible for the bumper stickers which say \u201cI Liked Kailua Before You Came.\u201d\n\nOther solutions to this most egregious situation are being explored by the Kailua Neighborhood Board, which is actually powerless to do anything: its members were baffled that the Hawaii Tourism Authority agreed to their request to stop promoting Kailua.\n\nThis move by the Kailua Neighborhood Board and the Hawai`i Tourism Authority is receiving broad press coverage here in Hawai`i, across the nation and throughout the world. Word has it that Foder\u2019s will feature Kailua as Hawai`i\u2019s best kept secret in its 2014 Guide to Hawai`i.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gloria Garvey BY GLORIA GARVEY - The Hawaii Tourism Authority has announced that it will take steps to permanently erase all references to Kailua in its", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Gloria Garvey", "og": {"site_name": "Hawaii Reporter", "description": "BY GLORIA GARVEY \u2013 The Hawaii Tourism Authority has announced that it will take steps to permanently erase all references to Kailua in its visitor information, including all print, broadcast \u2026", "title": "Forget About Kailua", "url": "http://www.hawaiireporter.com/forget-about-kailua/123", "image": "http://www.hawaiireporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-09-at-4.04.59-PM.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 480534165468268}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-10T23:15:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-11T19:06:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Additionally, the Kailua Neighborhood Board will ask The President and his family not to take their usual Christmas vacation in Kailua.\nThe HTA\u2019s effort is in response to the Kailua Neighborhood Board\u2019s resolution requesting that the State\u2019s leading promotional organization abandon its efforts to tell people about Kailua.\nAlthough the Kailua Neighborhood Board thinks of Kailua as an independent entity, the town is actually a throwback to plantation days, with most of the commercial space owned by a single landlord since time began.\nThis move by the Kailua Neighborhood Board and the Hawai`i Tourism Authority is receiving broad press coverage here in Hawai`i, across the nation and throughout the world.\nThe Kailua Neighborhood Board has been working towards this goal ever since the First Tourist showed up by accident in the small town on the windward side of O`ahu."}
