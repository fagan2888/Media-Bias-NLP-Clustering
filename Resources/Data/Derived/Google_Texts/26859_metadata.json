That\u2019s about 8 percent more than the total number of Michiganders who enrolled in 2014.\n\n\"We know that 81 percent of folks in Michigan who obtained coverage last year have come back on site and got coverage for $100 or less\" per month after any applicable tax credits are applied, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said during a call with reporters on Tuesday. \"That's affordability for the individual.\"\n\nOf those who have signed up in Michigan, 33 percent did so for the first time, Burwell said. The remaining 67 percent were reenrolled. Of all the enrollees, 88 percent have received financial assistance.\n\nOpen enrollment in the marketplace ends Feb. 15. This will be the first time that many people will see tax penalties if they do not sign up for insurance. Federal and Detroit health care officials urged uninsured Michigan residents to sign up for health care through the Affordable Care Act before the deadline.\n\nPeople can get more information on health care plans offered under the ACA online at healthcare.gov or over the phone at 1-800-318-2596. There are also locations where people can go in person to find out more information. Those locations are listed at localhelp.healthcare.gov.\n\nIn Detroit, 272,539 plans were chosen in the past enrollment period, said Vernice Anthony, director of the Detroit Department of Health and Wellness Promotion.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act and the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, Anthony said the uninsured rate in Detroit has dropped by 50 percent. However, there are still 100,000 uninsured people in Detroit.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act of 2009 established health care \u201cexchanges,\u201d or online repositories where consumers could browse for coverage, compare plans and ultimately purchase health insurance.\n\nMichigan elected, against the wishes of Gov. Rick Snyder, to participate in the federal exchange instead of establishing its own. The federal exchange was plagued by technical issues when it launched in 2013 for people to procure 2014 coverage. During that first open enrollment season, 272,539 Michiganders enrolled in health plans through the exchange.\n\nSearch recent enrollment numbers by zip code:\n\nCorrection January 27, 2015: A previous version of this story had the incorrect start date for the 2014-2015 enrollment.\n\nFritz Klug is a news buzz reporter for MLive.
