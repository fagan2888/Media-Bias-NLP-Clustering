But just let courts interfere, and they\u2019re immediately illegitimate.\n\nLegal commentator Jeffery Toobin\u2019s recent piece in The New Yorker, \u201cThe Threat to Obama from the Courts,\u201d deserves nomination for Best Hack Performance in a Presidential Supporting Role. Toobin makes clear his take on the final years of this presidency: Obama\u2019s aims are laudable and good for the nation, while conservatives\u2019 aims are suspect and center mainly on tarnishing Obama\u2019s legacy and denying Mount Rushmore a chisel-ready project for January 2017.\n\nIn making his case, Toobin all but declares checks and balances on government power are not a crowning feature of America\u2019s constitutional formula, but cumbersome relics handed down by Founders who surely would have done better if they had foreseen a leader like Obama.\n\nBefore discussing the legacy-threatening courts, Toobin raises and dismisses Congress as a potential check on the president. He explains that fractious Republicans won\u2019t be able to pull together or overcome Democrat filibusters to pass significant legislation. Even if they could, Obama would veto anything he doesn\u2019t like. Therefore, Congress doesn\u2019t play large in this picture.\n\nAll Politics, No Substance Toobin\u2019s prediction may prove accurate, but it\u2019s beside his point. Congress\u2019s inability to enact a conservative agenda is different from its ability\u2014or lack of ability\u2014to block Obama\u2019s liberal agenda. Toobin spends no time considering the tools Congress could, if so inclined, deploy to challenge the president: investigations, oversight hearings, budget restrictions on controversial initiatives, rejecting extreme nominees, and so forth. Dispirited conservatives might argue that Congress won\u2019t effectively check the president because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner seem not to have the stomach for a fight.\n\nCongress\u2019s inability to enact a conservative agenda is different from its ability\u2014or lack of ability\u2014to block Obama\u2019s liberal agenda. With Congress discounted, Toobin quickly takes aim at his real target: a constitutionally independent and engaged judiciary. \u201cBut Obama can\u2019t veto court decisions, and his political adversaries have, understandably, turned their attentions to the judiciary.\u201d Got that? Toobin announces that his guided tour of important national litigation is not really about serious legal and policy challenges raised by serious entities like state governments, major industries, or aggrieved citizens. It\u2019s more a campaign to thwart Obama\u2019s legacy, opportunistically waged in the courts by \u201cpolitical adversaries.\u201d\n\nToobin\u2019s tour makes port at Obamacare, immigration, net neutrality, and climate change. Throughout, he scrupulously avoide any fair or balanced description of the issues.\n\nThose Darned Courts and Their Concern for Legality Toobin describes the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in King v. Burwell, an Obamacare case, as asserting that \u201cfour words in the text of the statute\u201d mean that people in 34 states are ineligible for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal subsidies. He discernibly shouts, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! What could be more trifling than four little words?\u201d Presumably, Toobin would argue for executive flexibility in interpreting the difference between \u201cthe Secretary shall\u201d and \u201cthe Secretary shall not\u201d because after all, the difference is but a single word.\n\nPresumably, Toobin would argue for executive flexibility in interpreting the difference between \u2018the Secretary shall\u2018 and \u2018the Secretary shall not\u2018 because after all, the difference is but a single word. He renders the controversy over Obama\u2019s immigration orders thusly: \u201cEarly this year, President Obama used his executive authority to expand his program to allow certain undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to remain here without the threat of deportation.\u201d Well. It\u2019s unfortunate 26 states are making a mountain of such a molehill. The president just \u201cused his authority\u201d to spare certain children deportation.\n\nSomewhere in his editing and revising, Toobin must have removed an accurate description of major legal changes Obama\u2019s immigration actions have caused, changes that encompass 5 million immigrants: granting them work status, Social Security numbers, and welfare benefits. He also deleted mention of the 22 recorded statements where Obama admitted he doesn\u2019t have the authority to do what he just did. Toobin did see fit, however, to retain his description of the judge hearing the case, and the entire Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, as \u201chostile\u201d to Obama.\n\nIn the Toobin tour, net neutrality is a big win for consumers. Utility-style regulations will prevent big companies from jerking around viewers and content providers alike. It\u2019s not an audacious power grab, unauthorized by Congress, to control the Internet, which doesn\u2019t seem broken. There\u2019s apparently no good reason to oppose it. Still, Toobin sadly notes, a wave of legal challenges is surfacing even before the new regulations go into effect. What could be more mean-spirited?\n\nApparently Voters Don\u2019t Matter, Either Climate change is a fitting climax for Toobin\u2019s tour of the battle against Obama\u2019s legacy. \u201cIndustry representatives have brought multiple cases challenging virtually everything the Environmental Protection Agency has done to enforce the Clean Air Act.\u201d That\u2019s all our poor president is doing\u2014enforcing the Clean Air Act!\n\nThe most perverse thing about Toobin\u2019s piece is the constitutional elephant in the room. Obama\u2019s unilateral agenda is enormously controversial. Toobin assumes his audience is too dim know carbon is not a conventional pollutant. It doesn\u2019t make anyone cough or wheeze or get asthma. It is a plant nutrient that gives us a greener earth. It matters only if the alarmist version of global warming dogma is correct. The EPA\u2019s carbon rules will shut down domestic coal power, choke affordable energy, and harm millions of economically marginal Americans with much higher energy costs. Those aren\u2019t issues to consider, though. Only the spite of \u201cindustry representatives\u201d for clean air merits notice.\n\nThe most perverse thing about Toobin\u2019s piece is the constitutional elephant in the room. Obama\u2019s unilateral agenda is enormously controversial. Public opinion tilts against most of it. Congress has not enacted it. Obama was just repudiated in historic midterm elections that gave Republicans their largest majorities in nearly a century. But to activist scribes like Toobin, it\u2019s as natural as the genetically unmodified seeds of heirloom tomatoes that a liberal president should steer the country wherever he wants.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 10 Apr 2015 08:22:27 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Liberals love America\u2019s checks and balances when the system works for them.
