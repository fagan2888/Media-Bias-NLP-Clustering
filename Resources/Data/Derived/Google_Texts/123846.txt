LOS ANGELES (AP) — David Oyelowo says it’s not just the Academy Awards that need diversifying.

“Every facet of life, whether institutions or the nation in general, should reflect what society is composed of, not just racially, but in terms of sex, women, young, old,” the star of “Selma” said on the Oscar red carpet.

Although “Selma” was nominated for best movie, Oyelowo, who played Martin Luther King Jr in the film., was passed over, something many considered a snub.
