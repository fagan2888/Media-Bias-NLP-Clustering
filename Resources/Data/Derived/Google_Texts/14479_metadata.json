But they are expected this week to propose higher reimbursement rates to the insurers for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 that will reflect updated data on medical and drug costs.\n\nDeborah C. Enos, Neighborhood Health Plan president, whose organization accounted for more than half of the losses incurred by the Medicaid plans, said insurers believe the state understands the severity of the financial burden. \u201cThere is a recognition that something has happened that was different than anticipated,\u201d she said.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication the problems affecting insurers have compromised the health of patients. While thousands have been assigned new insurance coverage, most have kept their doctors, said Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of the Massachusetts nonprofit Health Care for All, which assists low-income residents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe marketplace feels very volatile, but the experience of patients and consumers and their access to care have been pretty seamless,\u201d Whitcomb Slemmer said.\n\nMassHealth provides Medicaid insurance, partly funded by the federal government, to more than 1 million low-income Massachusetts residents. The state agency insures some of those people directly, but about three-quarters are served by a half-dozen private Medicaid insurers. Insurance companies expected the hepatitis C drug Sovaldi \u2014 with a cure rate exceeding 90 percent \u2014 would go on the market this year. They also knew doctors would prescribe it for the disproportionate number of Medicaid patients with the liver-ravaging virus. But insurers say they were blindsided by the $1,000-a-pill price set by drug maker Gilead Sciences, which adds up to about $84,000 per patient for a full course of treatment.\n\nSimilarly, the health plans anticipated an influx of new members this year because of an expansion of Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act. The law increased reimbursements to the state, making more residents eligible for government insurance. It also required Massachusetts to discontinue some subsidized health insurance, start new programs, and reassign tens of thousand of people to different coverage. Much of the reshuffling was supposed to have been done through the updated Massachusetts Health Connector website. But when the site did not work, MassHealth officials had to assign members without the planned electronic interface to new federal eligibility guidelines. According to insurers, that has resulted in more patients with costly medical problems going to private companies while a higher number of healthier patients have been assigned to a temporary fee-for-service Medicaid program run by the state.\n\n\u201cBecause the website was broken, the rest of the system got turned on its head,\u201d said Christopher \u201cKit\u201d Gorton, president of Network Health, a Medford-based Medicaid insurer owned by Tufts Health Plan that lost $16 million in the first half of the year.\n\nBy far, the biggest six-month operating loss \u2014 $99 million \u2014 was reported by Neighborhood Health Plan, a Boston-based Medicaid insurer acquired in 2012 by Partners HealthCare System, the state\u2019s largest hospital and physicians network. Neighborhood Health officials said they were swamped with 60,600 new members between January and June \u2014 far more than they counted on \u2014 with many filing medical claims far beyond reimbursement rates they received from the state.\n\nNeighborhood Health said the new members increased its medical costs by about $28 million in the most recent quarter. The insurer set up a reserve to cover another $26 million in projected losses in the current quarter. Neighborhood Health attributed $10 million in costs to Sovaldi claims, and another $4 million to the state website problems in the three months ending June 30. The added expenses caused parent Partners, which operates Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women\u2019s hospitals, to show an operating deficit for the April-to-June period.\n\nState officials said they are not convinced Partners\u2019 analysis of the costs is accurate.\n\n\u2018The state is under a lot of pressure from a lot of people.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe have been engaged with Partners\u2019 Neighborhood Health Plan in a review of the issues raised by their organization and, thus far, have not been able to corroborate what they have identified as the cause of the questions they are facing,\u201d said Alec Loftus, a spokesman for the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services. \u201cWe remain committed to continuing the conversation on this issue and will work with [Neighborhood Health] and the other managed care organizations to find solutions, where necessary.\u201d\n\nLosses are mounting at other Medicaid insurers as well. Health Net, a statewide Medicaid insurer owned by Boston Medical Center, posted $27 million in losses for the first six months of 2014. The much smaller Health New England in Springfield, owned by Baystate Health, registered a loss of $500,000. All blame underfunding from MassHealth.\n\n\u201cThe state changed the Medicaid rating categories and expanded the eligibility,\u201d said Thomas Ebert, chief medical officer of Health New England. \u201cTheir actuaries did as well as they could to try to determine what the eligibility was going to be, but they were off the mark.\u201d\n\nEach of the Medicaid insurers tells a different story about what accounted for its financial loss. While the largest part of the Neighborhood Health deficit was blamed on a surge in high-cost members, Network Health cited Sovaldi. Both were factors for Health Net and Health New England, with Health Net officials saying about half of its additional costs came from Sovaldi and half from new members.\n\nAnd though Neighborhood Health and Network Health both say they received far more new members than expected, Health Net reported fewer new members. All of the Medicaid plans say their new members have had more medical needs than anticipated. They include many older patients, people with behavioral health issues, and pregnant women, they said.\n\nInsurance executives were hesitant to predict how their appeals for more state money will be resolved, but they say underfunding by MassHealth threatens their long-term finances.\n\n\u201cThe state is under a lot of pressure from a lot of people,\u201d Ebert said. \u201cBut they have to understand the impact of these issues on the plans. And we have to hope for the best.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.647154588", "eomportal-id": 913185, "description": "Buckling from more than $140 million in losses racked up since the start of the year, the companies that contract with the state to insure Medicaid patients are pressing the Patrick administration to boost health payments for low-income residents.
