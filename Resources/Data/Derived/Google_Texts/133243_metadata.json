Everyone in the audience rose to their feet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking forward to coming here. I feel very humbled and very honored,\u201d he said.\n\nStowe said he likes strawberries, but never had heard of Plant City \u2013 the nation\u2019s winter strawberry capital \u2013 until he was approached about taking the pulpit here.
