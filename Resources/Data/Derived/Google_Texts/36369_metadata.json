They are long gone in the British rider\u2019s rear-view mirror. But against skeptics created by the cheating of Lance Armstrong and other dopers, and against the legions of fans they betrayed.\n\nFor many of those cycling fans, Froome\u2019s performances are so good that they must be too good to be true. The leader of Team Sky said one spectator even hurled a cup of urine at him this weekend, shouting \u201cDoper!\u201d\n\nIn short, Froome finds himself in the impossible position of being damned by his own success. No matter how many times he insists that he is clean, the words fall on deaf ears. As they would: After all, Armstrong used to say that, too.\n\nFroome understands that. He knows that the yellow jersey he wears has been so soiled by the deceit of those who wore it before him that some of that dirt, deservedly or not, is going to rub off on him, too.\n\nBeing doubted, being hauled over of the coals of suspicion day-in, day-out, is the bill that must be paid now for winning a post-Armstrong Tour, especially when you\u2019re crushing rivals with apparent ease like the American did on the seven Tour victories that were later stripped from him.\n\nTwo weeks in, the skepticism is getting under Froome\u2019s very thick skin. It\u2019s hard to find a more mild-mannered chap in the peloton than the gangly, sometimes awkward, Kenya-born Briton. But as he prepares for the Alps, the ultimate test at this Tour, a hardening in his attitude and tone is unmistakable.\n\nHe blames \u201cvery irresponsible\u201d media for turning public opinion against him. He started on that theme Saturday after the urine incident and developed it Sunday after safely negotiating Stage 15 that ended with a bunch sprint won by Andre Greipel. It was the German\u2019s third victory at this Tour, and it left Froome\u2019s large lead intact.\n\n\u201cIf people are led to believe that these performances are not legitimate, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to push them to start booing, and to start punching and spitting and throwing urine on riders,\u201d Froome said.\n\nAnd for those who will still listen, he again repeated that \u201ctimes have changed\u201d from the Armstrong era.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the wild west that it was 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, there are still going to be riders who take risks in this day and age, but they are the minority.\n\n\u201cIt was the other way around 10 or 15 years ago. There is no reason in this day and age for that level of suspicion to continue. There\u2019s absolutely no reason.\u201d\n\nStill, French police took no chances. Following the urine assault, they posted half a dozen officers around Team Sky\u2019s bus at the start of Sunday\u2019s 183-kilometer (114-mile) stage from Mende to Valence.\n\nBecause of its flat finish, Stage 15 represented the last opportunity for heavy, muscular sprinters to shine before light but strong climbers like Froome take back the spotlight in the Alps in the last week, after a rest day on Tuesday.\n\nIt meant that sprinters\u2019 teams wouldn\u2019t let a breakaway group of riders steal the stage victory from under their noses.\n\nThe pack rode so furiously that Mark Cavendish, the only rider to beat Greipel in a massed bunch sprint at this Tour, wasn\u2019t able to compete for the win in Valence because he was dropped early in the hilly stage that flattened out at the end. Cavendish said stomach problems kept him up the previous night, leaving him feeling empty.\n\nTelling himself \u201cyou have to hang on here,\u201d Greipel managed to stay with the pace. He credited his Lotto-Soudal teammates for positioning him \u201cin the right spot\u201d for the final sprint. From there, he did the rest, choosing just the right time to accelerate away in the last 300 meters (yards).\n\n\u201cI had the power in my legs to finish it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the legs. Mother Nature gave me this.\u201d\n\nJohn Degenkolb of the Giant-Alpecin team was second, Katusha\u2019s Alexander Kristoff third. Greipel also won stages 2 and 5.\n\nMonday\u2019s Stage 16 takes the Tour into the Alps\u2019 foothills to Gap. With two moderate climbs followed by a downhill finish, it should suit punchy riders lower down in the overall standings who are looking for a win before the podium challengers do battle in the really big mountains.\n\nOut on the road at least, everything is going to plan for Froome. He finished safely in the main pack with the other podium favorites, and there were no changes in their overall placings.\n\nFroome still leads second-placed Nairo Quintana by 3 minutes and 10 seconds. Tejay van Garderen of the BMC team remains 3:32 back in third.\n\nJamey Keaten in Valence contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chris Froome on defensive at Tour de France despite big lead", "title": "Chris Froome on defensive at Tour de France despite big lead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/19/chris-froome-on-defensive-at-tour-de-france-despite-big-lead/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150719_121112_andre-greipel.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150719_121112_andre-greipel.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-19T11:58:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:19:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "VALENCE, France \u2014 Despite his comfortable lead in the Tour de France, Chris Froome heads into the Alps \u2014 the last big hurdle between him and victory in Paris \u2014 on the defensive.\nIt meant that sprinters\u2019 teams wouldn\u2019t let a breakaway group of riders steal the stage victory from under their noses.\nBut as he prepares for the Alps, the ultimate test at this Tour, a hardening in his attitude and tone is unmistakable.\nIt was the German\u2019s third victory at this Tour, and it left Froome\u2019s large lead intact.\nFor many of those cycling fans, Froome\u2019s performances are so good that they must be too good to be true."}
