She was working the morning Teresa was killed.\n\n\"I called Mark, and I said, 'Mark, I know you told me not to go to your house... but I don't know what's going on.' And his words were, 'do not tell anyone the doctor is dead.'\"\n\nIt was a chilling exchange just moments after finding out her friend had been killed.\n\nHoskins showed ABC7 text messages sent between her and Mark that very same morning.\n\n\"I said, 'Mark, do you want me to go to your house?' And I got one word, 'no.'\"\n\nReporter: \"Did that seem strange to you?\"\n\nHoskins: \"Yes, yes, because anybody else, the normal reactive behavior would be, 'yes, absolutely, Sandra, please lock up the office right now, I don't care about the patients, I care about my wife.'\"\n\nHoskins grew close to the family during her seven years working at the medical office. The family even went to her wedding.\n\nBut it all changed last summer while attending the doctor's funeral. Hoskins said Mark began acting cold.\n\n\"His demeanor, and his body language, and his character didn't fall into place with a man who was mourning.\"\n\nHoskins left the office a short time later, saying she no longer felt comfortable there due to what she describes as Mark's antagonistic behavior.\n\n\"What he portrayed as the Mark Sievers, was not the Mark that I witnessed.\"\n\nShe said that same behavior was on display Friday as Mark walked out of his home in handcuffs.\n\n\"I don't think that he has what everyone else possesses, and that's emotions. I've never seen somebody stand there so empty-souled in my life.\"\n\nHoskins still thinks about Teresa every day, even keeping the doctor's old stethoscope.\n\n\"I have to; I have to talk to her every day. She was my mentor.\"\n\nA mentor Hoskins said she's glad will get justice.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "ABC7 has an exclusive interview with Sandra Hoskins, a longtime friend, co-worker and confidant of Dr. Teresa Sievers.\u00a0She tells us the moment she first grew suspicious of Teresa's husband, Mark.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/31334249/abc7-exclusive-interview-with-friend-of-teresa-sievers", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "ABC7 has an exclusive interview with Sandra Hoskins, a longtime friend, co-worker and confidant of Dr. Teresa Sievers.\u00a0She tells us the moment she first grew suspicious of Teresa's husband, Mark.", "title": "ABC7 Exclusive: Interview with friend of Teresa Sievers"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/9984647_G.jpg", "description": "ABC7 has an exclusive interview with Sandra Hoskins, a longtime friend, co-worker and confidant of Dr. Teresa Sievers.\u00a0She tells us the moment she first grew suspicious of Teresa's husband, Mark.", "card": "summary", "title": "ABC7 Exclusive: Interview with friend of Teresa Sievers"}, "wnreadableurl": "abc7-exclusive-interview-with-friend-of-teresa-sievers", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/02/27", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "owner": "WZVN", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS08"}, "article_summary": "ABC7 has an exclusive interview with Sandra Hoskins, a longtime friend, co-worker and confidant of Dr. Teresa Sievers.\nHoskins: \"Yes, yes, because anybody else, the normal reactive behavior would be, 'yes, absolutely, Sandra, please lock up the office right now, I don't care about the patients, I care about my wife.'\"\nHoskins grew close to the family during her seven years working at the medical office.\n\"I called Mark, and I said, 'Mark, I know you told me not to go to your house... but I don't know what's going on.'\nHoskins worked for seven years in the now-shuttered medical office."}
