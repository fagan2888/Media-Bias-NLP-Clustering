Be a Part of the End of HIV/AIDS on September 28!

Join us at the 2013 Seattle AIDS Walk at Volunteer Park

Seattle – September 17, 2013 – The Seattle AIDS Walk will return for its 27th year on September 28, 2013. This family-friendly event at Volunteer Park honors lives touched by HIV/AIDS and builds momentum towards an AIDS-free future. Proceeds from the AIDS Walk benefit HIV/AIDS prevention and care.

“It is such an exciting time in the HIV/AIDS community. Increased access to healthcare as a result of the Affordable Care Act as well as recent medical advancements are game changers in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” says Randall Russell, Lifelong’s Chief Executive Officer. “But we’re not there yet. Poverty, healthcare costs, and stigma are all barriers to accessing treatment. Help us connect people to care and prevent future HIV infections. Thank you in advance for your support. We hope to see you on September 28!”
