He said that Obama only acted after it became clear that House Speaker John Boehner was not going to be able to corral the votes to pass an immigration reform bill, and after midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve waited a considerable amount of time,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nObama announced last month that the administration would offer three-year work permits to people who have been in the country at least five years, and who are parents of citizens or other legal residents. That provision could shelter an estimated 4 million people, but does not offer a path to citizenship or legal status. The action also would open the door for more people who came as children to apply for a reprieve from deportation.\n\nMcCaul said that the program, by giving the impression that the U.S. isn\u2019t interested in removing unauthorized people, \u201cwould become a powerful magnet that encourages more illegal immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t think that message is making its way back to Mexico and Central America, we are simply fooling ourselves,\u201d McCaul said.\n\nBut Johnson said the program will allow the department to focus more resources on border enforcement and on finding and removing criminals.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that, given our limited resources, these people are not, and have not been for years, priorities for removal,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we acknowledge that and encourage them to be held accountable. That is simple common sense.\u201d\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said those border security assurances ring hollow, in light of a border crossing by four Kurdish migrants who entered the U.S. illegally through Texas in September. Although Johnson said in a speech in October that they would be deported, he said during the hearing Tuesday that two of the four actually were released by an immigration judge and made it across the border to Canada, where they are seeking asylum.\n\nJohnson said the judge\u2019s decision was \u201cnot my preference.\u201d The other two are still in detention, he said.\n\nChaffetz said in an interview that he has learned that the two were released by a judge in San Antonio on Nov. 12. They then flew from Phoenix to Seattle and crossed the border near Blaine, Wash., and were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\n\u201cThey claim they have legal authority to just release everybody and grant them this amnesty,\u201d Chaffetz said of the Obama administration, but not the authority to deport the four migrants with ties to a terrorist-designated group: \u201cThat\u2019s outrageous. That\u2019s double-speak at its worst.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have discussed ways to thwart the president\u2019s action, including a lawsuit or an attempt to cut off funding. But aside from the bitter outcry against the president\u2019s action, the party remains divided on how to proceed and on whether people here illegally should get a path to become citizens.\n\nMcCaul accused Obama of \u201chypocrisy\u201d for asserting earlier in the year that he couldn\u2019t act on immigration without Congress. \u201cWho should we believe, the president before the election, who said he didn\u2019t have legal authority to take this action, or the president after the election who says that he does have the authority to take this executive action?\u201d McCaul said.\n\nBut the Obama administration has said that the president has drawn a distinction between conferring legal status, which they say can only be done through legislation, and exercising discretion on how to enforce immigration laws.\n\n\u201cThe current situation amounts to amnesty,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe want people to be accountable, to come out of the shadows.\n\n\"We have lots of undocumented [people] in this country working off the books, and if that\u2019s not apparent, then I suggest you spend some time in a restaurant here in the Washington, D.C., area \u2013 see it for yourself,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nRep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) noted that the people who receive work permits under the new program won\u2019t be eligible to participate in the Affordable Care Act. Employers, he said, might choose to \u201cget rid of the American worker\u201d so they don\u2019t have to provide health insurance under the law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it that way,\u201d Johnson replied.\n\nJohnson called on Congress to approve his request for more border security funds, and said he remains willing to work with Congress on immigration legislation. Obama has repeatedly said that if he signs such a bill, it would supersede his own actions on immigration.\n\n\u201cIf we could just strip away the emotion and the politics on this issue, and you brought me the right group of members of the House of Representatives, I could negotiate a bill with you,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt should not be that difficult.\u201d\n\nAt another hearing Tuesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), excoriated Obama for \u201cone of the biggest constitutional power grabs ever by a president.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy acting lawlessly and assuming legislative power, the Obama administration is driving full speed ahead to a constitutional crisis, tilting the scales of our three-branch government in his favor and threatening to unravel our system of checks and balances,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat and a former immigration lawyer, said Obama acted within his authority, and only \u201cin the face of congressional inaction.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @jtanfani", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Republicans attack Obama's action on immigration as unconstitutional", "date": "2014-12-02", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "President Obama\u2019s action on immigration represented a breach of the Constitution that will encourage more people to cross the border illegally, the chairman of a House committee said Tuesday in the latest wave of criticism of the action that Republicans call an overreach by the president.", "title": "Republicans attack Obama's action on immigration as unconstitutional", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-na-congress-immigration-hearing-20141202-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-547e20cf/turbine/la-na-congress-immigration-hearing-20141202", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obama, immigration, Michael McCaul", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82156524", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Obama, immigration, Michael McCaul", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "President Obama\u2019s action on immigration represented a breach of the Constitution that will encourage more people to cross the border illegally, the chairman of a House committee said Tuesday in the latest wave of criticism of the action that Republicans call an overreach by the president.   \u201cOur..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde908\"", "article_summary": "Johnson called on Congress to approve his request for more border security funds, and said he remains willing to work with Congress on immigration legislation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it that way,\u201d Johnson replied.\nObama has repeatedly said that if he signs such a bill, it would supersede his own actions on immigration.\nPresident Obama\u2019s action on immigration represented a breach of the Constitution that will encourage more people to cross the border illegally, the chairman of a House committee said Tuesday in the latest wave of criticism of the action that Republicans call an overreach by the president.\nThe action also would open the door for more people who came as children to apply for a reprieve from deportation."}
