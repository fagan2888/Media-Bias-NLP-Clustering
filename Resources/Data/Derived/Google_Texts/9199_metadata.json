Zan Kosir of Slovenia took the bronze.\n\nWild\u2019s triumph came just minutes after his wife raced to bronze in the women\u2019s event.\n\nPatrizia Kummer gave Switzerland its sixth gold medal in Sochi when Japan\u2019s Tomoka Takeuchi lost an edge halfway through the second run of the women\u2019s final.\n\nZavarzina had little trouble in the consolation round, beating Ina Meschik of Austria by nearly a second for bronze.\n\nZavarzina sprinted to embrace her husband after he captured gold while a large, heavily pro-Russian crowd waved flags and roared its appreciation. After the flower ceremony, Wild and his wife stood side by side holding a massive Russian flag and drinking in the moment.\n\nIt capped a career revival for Wild, who grew up in White Salmon, Wash., but applied for Russian citizenship after marrying Zavarzina in 2011. He joined the Russian snowboarding team and praised his new country for its investment in the sport that is snowboarding\u2019s answer to Alpine skiing.\n\nWild has repaid his new home in full. The 27-year-old placed third at last year\u2019s world championships and was easily the best on a challenging day at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park.\n\nAfter weeks of warm sunshine, a front that moved through Tuesday dumped a fresh batch of snow. Officials tried to protect the course, but it was a bit of a hard mess in which racers struggled with their lines as they rolled from gate to gate.\n\nWild had his moments, too. He nearly washed out twice during the first finals run, barely holding on after it appeared his board was ready to tip over. Moving from the blue course to the seemingly faster red course for the second run, he overcame the 0.54-second deficit he faced with relative ease.\n\nHe thrust his arms skyward in victory, leading to the unusual sight of an American born near the end of the Cold War being showered with adoration from a highly partisan home crowd of Russian fans.\n\nKummer narrowly edged Zavarzina in the semifinals of the women\u2019s event and was in the clear when Takeuchi lost control in the finals.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "U.S. expat Wild wins men\u2019s parallel giant slalom", "title": "U.S. expat Wild wins men\u2019s parallel giant slalom", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/18/u-s-expat-wild-wins-mens-parallel-giant-slalom/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140219__04087913p1.jpg", "height": 500}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140219__04087913p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-19T05:30:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:32:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8381\"", "article_summary": "Wild rolled to victory in men\u2019s snowboarding parallel giant slalom on Wednesday, ripping past Nevin Galmarini in the second run of the finals to win gold for his adopted country of Russia.\nHe nearly washed out twice during the first finals run, barely holding on after it appeared his board was ready to tip over.\nKRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia \u2014Vic Wild and wife Alena Zavarzina have some new jewelry to go with their wedding rings: Olympic medals.\nMoving from the blue course to the seemingly faster red course for the second run, he overcame the 0.54-second deficit he faced with relative ease.\nPatrizia Kummer gave Switzerland its sixth gold medal in Sochi when Japan\u2019s Tomoka Takeuchi lost an edge halfway through the second run of the women\u2019s final."}
