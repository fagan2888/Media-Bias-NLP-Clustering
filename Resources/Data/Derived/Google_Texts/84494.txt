Announcement: Health insurance application deadline extended to April 17 The International Examiner

Community members who missed the deadline to sign up for low-cost health insurance through the Affordable Care Act can still do apply through April 17.

People who wish to take advantage of the enrollment extension may request a special enrollment by calling the Washington Healthplanfinder Customer Support Center at 1-855-923-4633. In-person assisters are also able to assist at any of the four ICHS clinics. Call (206) 788-3700 for more information.

“There’s still time for community members to sign up for low-cost health insurance through the Affordable Care Act even if they missed the deadline last February 15,” ICHS Health Advocacy manager Abbie Zahler said. “This enrollment extension especially targets people who experienced barriers to enrollment or were not aware of the tax penalty for not having health insurance.”

Washington Apple Health/Medicaid enrollment is open year round, so community members may apply any time.

Qualified health plans cover essential health benefits, including many important preventive screenings.
