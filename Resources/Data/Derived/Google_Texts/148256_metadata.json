She noted that her coworkers openly wore Obama campaign attire to work at election time as well.\n\nThe longtime employee currently works for the child support enforcement division, which doesn\u2019t involve the promotion or implementation of the controversial heath insurance legislation.\n\nPacific Justice Institute president Brad Dacus noted the obvious, numerous concerns with the way Mooney was treated.\n\n\u201cJust when we thought the disastrous ObamaCare rollout couldn\u2019t get much worse, the county of Santa Clara is compounding those problems by claiming that criticism is off-limits,\u201d Dacus said. \u201cLiberals and conservatives alike should be able to agree that this type of censorship is chilling and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nMooney\u2019s attorneys have sent a letter to Santa Clara County officials demanding answers and seeking an affirmation of public employees\u2019 rights to comment on matters of public concern. Several weeks have passed with no response.\n\nThey are now contemplating legal action.\n\nThe Pacific Justice Institute is a conservative legal defense organization.\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter and on Facebook, and send education-related story tips to [email protected].", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Owens", "description": "Santa Clara County has banned veteran employee from criticizing Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because coworker who overheard criticism was offended", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A California county has banned a veteran employee from criticizing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because a coworker who overheard the criticism was offended.
