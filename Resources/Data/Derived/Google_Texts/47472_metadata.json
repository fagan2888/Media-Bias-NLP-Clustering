As it turns out, cysts \u2014 sacs of fluid on the ovaries \u2014 are just one manifestation of a complex hormonal condition.\n\nFirst described in 1935, PCOS was initially called Stein-Leventhal syndrome, for the two American gynecologists who identified it, Dr. Irving F. Stein Sr. and Dr. Michael L. Leventhal. They recognized that ovarian cysts can interrupt ovulation and cause infertility in significant numbers of women.\n\nIrregular menstrual cycles and difficulty conceiving are among the most common symptoms, the result of ovarian follicles that fail to mature fully and to release eggs. Affected women often have enlarged ovaries and, when menses does occur, prolonged bleeding.\n\nOver time more cysts \u2014 swollen follicles, really \u2014 may form. On an ultrasound exam, they resemble a string of pearls stretched over the surface of the ovary. Yet some experts believe cysts are a result, rather than the cause, of the syndrome.\n\n\u201cWhether the condition starts in the ovaries is not certain,\u201d said Dr. R. Scott Lucidi, an expert on PCOS at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nIndeed, women with few or no ovarian cysts may be diagnosed with PCOS. According to the so-called Rotterdam criteria, a woman with any two of the following may have the condition:\n\n\u25a0 Symptoms of elevated levels of androgens, or male sex hormones, which can include acne, excessive hairiness and sometimes male-pattern hair loss.\n\n\u25a0 Irregular menses, with prolonged periods between cycles.\n\n\u25a0 Twelve or more follicular cysts on the ovaries, as seen on an ultrasound.\n\nLucidi and others have suggested that insulin resistance could be the underlying factor responsible for the disparate symptoms of PCOS.\n\nIn people resistant to insulin, the hormone does not effectively transfer glucose from blood to body cells to be used for energy. As blood levels of glucose build, more insulin is produced to try to lower it.\n\nExcess insulin promotes fat storage and can result in weight gain and obesity. About half of American women with PCOS are obese. Insulin also can stimulate the ovaries to produce androgens.\n\nBut just as some young women with a lot of ovarian cysts do not have PCOS, some women with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are thin.\n\nPCOS tends to cluster in families, with predisposing genes passed from either parent to both daughters and sons. In affected males, early balding or excessive hairiness can be a sign that the genes have been inherited. In women, symptoms can vary from being very mild to extensive.\n\nSome experts believe that the fundamental defect may not be insulin resistance, but hormonal dysregulation by or of the hypothalamus. This small region at the base of the brain produces hormones that stimulate the pituitary gland, which in turn affects organs throughout the body.\n\nIn most women with PCOS, the pituitary gland produces excessive amounts of luteinizing hormone, which, like insulin, can stimulate the ovaries to secrete androgens, according to a practice guideline written by Dr. Robert L. Barbieri, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nWhen ovarian follicles are enlarging, women with PCOS also produce high levels of estradiol but low levels of progesterone, resulting in a thick uterine lining and over time an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\n\nThere is no cure for PCOS, and the best approach to treatment is individualized, depending on the goals of each patient, Lucidi said.\n\nFor women with prolonged intervals between menses or excessive hairiness, or both, contraceptives containing estrogen and progestin are used to regulate the menstrual cycle and suppress the production of androgens.\n\nOften, the blood pressure drug spironolactone is also given to counteract androgen- caused acne or hirsutism in adult women.\n\nFor a woman trying to become pregnant, a different regimen is needed. Two drugs, clomiphene and letrozole, are commonly prescribed to stimulate ovulation. Both these drugs prompt the pituitary to secrete follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which enhances the growth of small follicles and thus can trigger ovulation.\n\nBarbieri noted that \u201cmost women with PCOS who undergo ovulation induction go on to conceive and bear children.\u201d Perhaps the most challenging therapy involves weight reduction. Losing 10 percent of body weight can result in more regular menstrual cycles and reduced levels of testosterone, Barbieri wrote.\n\nFor women with PCOS, the most effective diet for achieving and maintaining weight loss is low in carbohydrates, rather than low in fat.\n\nWithout being extreme, women with PCOS should reduce their carbohydrate intake overall and in particular avoid sugars and refined carbohydrates (white bread, white rice and anything stripped of its natural fiber or made with refined white flour).\n\nThey should instead select foods high in fiber made from whole grains, as unprocessed as possible. They are also advised to avoid eating isolated servings of carbohydrate-rich foods, and to space them out during the day to keep insulin levels from spiking.\n\nConsuming four or more small meals instead of a few large ones each day is also helpful.\n\nRegular moderate or vigorous exercise done five or more times a week is an important part of the regimen.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/12/hfbrody02.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1795\"", "article_summary": "They recognized that ovarian cysts can interrupt ovulation and cause infertility in significant numbers of women.\nThey are also advised to avoid eating isolated servings of carbohydrate-rich foods, and to space them out during the day to keep insulin levels from spiking.\nIndeed, women with few or no ovarian cysts may be diagnosed with PCOS.\nIn women, symptoms can vary from being very mild to extensive.\nLucidi and others have suggested that insulin resistance could be the underlying factor responsible for the disparate symptoms of PCOS."}
