(Photo: Steve Perez / The Detroit News)Buy Photo\n\nThe UAW and Detroit\u2019s Big Three will finish contract talks this month as the automotive industry is more robust than it has been in some time. All three companies have posted record-breaking profits as of this year\u2019s second quarter, following record sales last year.\n\nTwo central issues of the negotiations are compensation and health care coverage, bargaining over which must also be viewed through the lens of company investors.\n\nAutomakers and the UAW must work together, but with the understanding profits won\u2019t always be so grand, and that the the auto industry is changing \u2014 in terms of its products, its workforce, and in how it measures success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shift in focus for the automakers from what it used to be \u2014 getting the breakeven point down and improving profitability,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an auto analyst with AutoTrader.com.\n\nFor the companies, the global marketplace is fiercely competitive, and their performance is under still-increased scrutiny following bailouts. While Ford has more of a cushion than GM and FCA US, all three must keep costs in check and continue to increase their profitability to have enough capital to invest in future products \u2013 and also to guard against later downturns.\n\nBut the car of the future is technologically-advanced, and subject to increasing fuel economy and safety regulations.\n\n\u201cThose things are going to require immense amounts of capital and new ways of coming up with solutions,\u201d said Krebs.\n\nStill, companies need to keep overall costs down while making new, high-quality cars consumers will buy.\n\nWith sales increasing over the past five years, the UAW is well-positioned to request higher second-tier wages. President Dennis Williams came into his role last year stating, \u201cit\u2019s time to bridge the gap,\u201d and he\u2019s signaled he won\u2019t walk away from the table without them.\n\nBridging the gap stands to benefit the companies, which need a stable and educated workforce.\n\nBut pushing the second tier might also force jobs south to non-union plants, or to Mexico, where Ford has already announced it will move production of a few models.\n\nExpect growth in the second-tier wage over the next three to five years from about $19 up to $25 or $26 per hour, says Sean McAlinden at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\n\u201cI think [the companies] can afford it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really all about increasing wages and benefits only to the level where companies won\u2019t become non-profitable.\u201d\n\nIncreasing employees\u2019 access to profit-sharing is a reasonable way to boost wages as well, but the UAW doesn\u2019t like how this yields different amounts to members at each company because of variability in the Big Three\u2019s profits.\n\nThe other outstanding issue on wages and benefits is employee health care.\n\nThe so-called Cadillac Tax, an element of Obamacare that taxes premium health care plans beginning in 2018, threatens the luxury healthcare agreements many union members have become accustomed to, as well as health care plans for automakers\u2019 executives.\n\nWilliams has suggested combining all employees into a private pool to help negotiate lower costs.\n\nBut it\u2019s not entirely clear how it might work, or how it would play politically, given the UAW was a big supporter of Obamacare.\n\nOther options for avoiding Obamacare\u2019s excessive taxes are a carve-out or some other Congressional intervention, an unlikely scenario.\n\nProfitability is key for the companies, while increased wages and maintained health care are key for the UAW in these much-anticipated talks. Finding a way to do both will be the challenge.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1EJ0lyq", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "In negotiating health care and pay, automakers and union must keep competitive in a global market", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "In negotiating health care and pay, automakers and union must keep competitive in a global market", "title": "Editorial: UAW talks enter new era for auto industry", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/09/03/edit-uaw-talks-auto-industry/71651842/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In negotiating health care and pay, automakers and union must keep competitive in a global market", "title": "Editorial: UAW talks enter new era for auto industry", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7f708985f77c50e3f101b4202cee963e7af0b3a/c=712-0-3544-2832&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/03/DetroitNews/B99301724Z.1_20150903151948_000_GTBJ2HO3.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Dennis Williams, UAW, automakers, auto industry, AutoTrader.com, Michelle Krebs, Big Three, two-tier wages, Center for Automotive Research, Cadillac Tax, Obamacare, collective bargaining"}, "article_summary": "Profitability is key for the companies, while increased wages and maintained health care are key for the UAW in these much-anticipated talks.\nTwo central issues of the negotiations are compensation and health care coverage, bargaining over which must also be viewed through the lens of company investors.\nIn negotiating health care and pay, automakers and union must keep competitive in a global marketBuy Photo UAW president Dennis Williams takes the job at an important time.\n(Photo: Steve Perez / The Detroit News)Buy PhotoThe UAW and Detroit\u2019s Big Three will finish contract talks this month as the automotive industry is more robust than it has been in some time.\nThe other outstanding issue on wages and benefits is employee health care."}
