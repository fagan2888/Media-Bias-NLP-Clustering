She was also unable to feel hunger, so she didn\u2019t know when she was supposed to eat. As a result, the woman began losing weight, grew weak and wasn\u2019t getting the nutrients she needed.\n\nEnter Meals on Wheels, a national home-delivered meals program established by the 1965 Older Americans Act. The woman (who asked that her name not be used) began receiving meals at her home five days a week. This, she says, helped her remember to eat regularly. Her weight improved, and so did her general health.\n\nMalnutrition like hers is surprisingly common. Six percent of the elderly who live at home in the United States and in other developed countries are malnourished, according to a 2010 study in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society. The rate of elder malnutrition doubles among those in nursing homes, where it is 14 percent, according to the same study.\n\nAnd rates skyrocket among elderly populations in rehabilitation facilities and hospitals: Various measures show an astonishing one third to one half of seniors are malnourished upon being admitted to the hospital.\n\n\u201cMalnutrition is a serious and under-recognized problem among older adults,\u201d says Nancy Wellman, a nutritionist and instructor at Tuft University\u2019s Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new problem. But growth in the elderly population, and concerns about healthcare costs, have helped renew efforts by nutritionists and other advocates to establish screenings for malnutrition in medical settings, and to improve interventions that can prevent or reverse the issue.\n\nNutrition Complexities\n\nMost basically, malnutrition means not getting enough nutrients for optimal health. In older adults, the causes are complex, experts say. Illness, disability, social isolation, poverty \u2014 often a combination of these \u2014 can all contribute to malnutrition. An older person may become malnourished because she has trouble chewing or swallowing. The medications she takes may suppress appetite. She may be unable to get to a grocery store. She may live alone, be depressed, or simply be uninterested in eating.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know, says Connie Bales, a dietician and faculty member at Duke University Medical Center, that obese and overweight seniors can be malnourished, too. Eating too many calories doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re getting the right nutrients for maintaining muscle and bone. \u201cOne can be quite malnourished, yet not be skinny,\u201d Bales says.\n\nHigh Costs\n\nWhatever the cause, malnutrition leads to further trouble. It increases older adults\u2019 risk of illness, frailty and infection. Malnourished people visit the doctor and are admitted to the hospital more often, have longer hospital stays and recover from surgery more slowly.\n\nThe association between malnutrition and hospitalization goes both ways, say Wellman and other experts: The sick are more likely to become malnourished, and the malnourished are more likely to get sick.\n\nThus, says elder advocate Robert Blancato, speaking at a recent panel on the topic, improving nutrition among older people is important not just to their well-being and quality of life, but to containing health care costs. The malnourished generate bills $2,000 to $10,000 higher per hospital stay than others do, according to a study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition found a threefold increase in medical costs among the malnourished. (Hospital stays can also cause or worsen elder malnourishment: Older patients often don\u2019t eat well in the hospital, and doctors may prohibit them from eating or drinking in preparation for medical procedures.)\n\nFood Insecurity\n\nNot surprisingly, financial hardship is a central cause of elder malnutrition. According to a 2014 report from the AARP Foundation, nearly 9 million older people in the U.S. can\u2019t afford nutritious food. About one quarter of low-income adults 65 and older say they\u2019ve reduced the size of their meals or have skipped meals because they didn\u2019t have enough money.\n\nJeffrey Bubar might have been among them \u2014 his fixed income places him barely above the federal poverty line. Yet he\u2019s well fed.\n\nEarlier this week, Bubar, 76, dug happily into a plateful of sloppy Joe, baked potato and vegetables. He chatted with four other elderly men, also regulars at a Congregate meals program in Northampton, Massachusetts \u2014 one of hundreds of such programs across the country. (Another provision of the Older Americans Act.)\n\nBubar \u2014 who has no family, lives alone and has no car \u2014 walks to the program every weekday. The meals provide him with both companionship and nourishment \u2014 sources of health and well-being that would otherwise likely elude him. \u201cI like being with people,\u201d he says.\n\nHis fixed income places him barely above the federal poverty line. Without the meals, food would make a much bigger \u201cdent\u201d in his budget, he says; and the program\u2019s nourishment \u201chelps keep my health up.\u201d It\u2019s a nutritional and social anchor in his otherwise isolated life.\n\nBut many eligible seniors don\u2019t receive such benefits. The AARP report, for example, found that of those elders eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), only 13 percent receive the benefit. It\u2019s an important gap to address, says Lura Barber, director of Hunger Initiatives for the National Council on Aging, and there are many reasons for it. One is that \u201cthere\u2019s a huge stigma attached to [food benefits],\u201d she says. Older people worry, for example, that by receiving help they\u2019ll take benefits away from children who need it. But \u201cseniors are also less likely than other age groups to know about the program, about how to apply, and [to know] that they might be eligible.\u201d\n\nFollowing hospital stays, these programs could also help patients recover from illness or surgery. And yet very few hospital patients receive information about nutrition benefits. A recent survey by the Gerontological Society of America found that only 6 percent of hospitalized elderly received information about SNAP. Only 3 percent of hospitalized older people received information about group meals programs such as the one Bubar benefits from. And only 3 percent learned about the availability of delivered meals to home-bound seniors.\n\nGood Nutrition, Better Outcomes\n\nSuch lack of information is another problem worth addressing, Barber says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge gap in how we\u2019re providing vulnerable older adults with help as they move from a healthcare setting\u201d back to their homes. Even those simply \u201cgoing to a doctor for a regular visit are not learning about [nutrition] programs.\u201d\n\nRose Ann DiMaria-Ghalili, a nurse and researcher with Drexel University\u2019s College of Nursing, says better nutrition can improve hospital outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions. \u201cWe know,\u201d she says, \u201cthat weight loss increases the risk of 30-day readmission,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that failure to thrive and weight loss are frequent reasons for readmission in surgical patients.\u201d\n\nNancy Wellman says, \u201cIf you can\u2019t eat well, you\u2019re going to end up in a nursing home, or you\u2019re going to end up back in the hospital.\u201d\n\nGiven mounting evidence that better nutrition in both older patients and seniors living at home is a cost-effective way to improve health outcomes\u2014not to mention quality of life\u2014Wellman and others call for several manageable fixes:\n\nRethinking Hunger\n\n\u201cWe should be thinking about nutrition as one of the key aspects of healthy aging, of maintaining our independence, maintaining our quality of life, staying out of nursing homes, and staying out of hospitals,\u201d Wellman says. She and other advocates urge individuals, community programs, medical professionals, and policymakers to learn about and prioritize nutrition as an important and relatively inexpensive way of improving health.\n\nNutrition Screenings And Interventions\n\nIncluding nutritional status and nutrition interventions in patients\u2019 plan of care would promote better outcomes, says DiMaria-Ghalili. And Wellman says, \u201cWe need to establish systematic screenings and intervention models\u201d for patients entering and leaving the hospital. Connie Bales of Duke Medical Center argues that doctors and nurses could usefully view patients\u2019 nutritional status as a vital sign, as they do blood pressure or temperature: \u201cWe know what [a patient\u2019s] pulse rate is, what their respiration rate is,\u201d Bales says. \u201cWhat about their nutritional status?\u201d\n\nAccess To Benefits\n\nBarber would like to see nurses routinely asking elderly patients whether they\u2019re receiving nutrition benefits, and referring them to meals programs and SNAP where appropriate. Nurses or other staff, she says, could also help older patients fill out applications for benefits before patients leave the hospital.\n\nEat Well\n\nFinally, Wellman offers basic advice to older adults: \u201cBring home more fruits, more vegetables, some low-fat dairy\u2026or full-fat milk if you\u2019re underweight. Bring home prepared or prepackaged food, because it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll eat it.\u201d If foods aren\u2019t appealing, try adding more spices to enhance taste. If you\u2019re overweight but ill, she says, it\u2019s often better to prioritize eating well over losing weight. And if possible, seek out company: \u201cPeople eat better when they\u2019re with other people,\u201d Wellman says.\n\nOn Monday, Bubar was looking forward to joining his friends at the Congregate program for the Thanksgiving meal. He\u2019d already checked out the menu: \u201cIt\u2019ll be turkey and whipped potatoes and butternut squash,\u201d he said. He expected that the program\u2019s cook would make the pies right there in the kitchen, so Bubar was eagerly anticipating house-made pumpkin pie with whipped cream.\n\nNell Lake is the author of \u201cThe Caregivers: A Support Group\u2019s Stories of Slow Loss, Courage, and Love.\u201d This article was written with support from the Journalists in Aging Fellowships, a program of New America Media and the Gerontological Society of America, sponsored by the Silver Century Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Various measures show an astonishing one third to one half of seniors are malnourished upon being admitted to the hospital.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Various measures show an astonishing one third to one half of seniors are malnourished upon being admitted to the hospital.", "title": "Elder Hunger: New Efforts To Combat Surprisingly Common Malnutrition Among Seniors", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/11/elder-malnutrition", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/11/mealsonwheels-620x440.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/11/elder-malnutrition", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/11/mealsonwheels-620x440.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Elder Hunger: New Efforts To Combat Surprisingly Common Malnutrition Among Seniors"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-26", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 05:39:55 -0500"}, "article_summary": "Elder Hunger: New Efforts To Combat Surprisingly Common Malnutrition Among SeniorsBy Nell LakeAfter her stroke, a 95-year-old woman in New York State found that she could no longer taste her food.\nEnter Meals on Wheels, a national home-delivered meals program established by the 1965 Older Americans Act.\nNurses or other staff, she says, could also help older patients fill out applications for benefits before patients leave the hospital.\nOnly 3 percent of hospitalized older people received information about group meals programs such as the one Bubar benefits from.\nThe rate of elder malnutrition doubles among those in nursing homes, where it is 14 percent, according to the same study."}
