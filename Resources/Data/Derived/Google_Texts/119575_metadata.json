His mission includes: launching three new schools in nursing, pharmacy and public health; hiring a hospital CEO; and training the newest generation of doctors during a time of change and predicted shortage of physicians.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the issue of what does it mean post-Affordable Care Act to be a provider,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to understand how to train to a new reality, which will be constrained economically but will offer more opportunity for doing more for patients than was ever possible.\u201d\n\nFederoff, a neurologist, first visited UCI more than a decade ago for his work in Alzheimer\u2019s research. UCI was among six schools that collaborated with Georgetown for the blood test study.\n\n\u201cIn order to have a potential impact on the natural history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, you have to identify individuals at the very earliest stage,\u201d Federoff said. \u201cUntil recently, the very earliest you could identify was when they already had a cognitive problem. We reasoned we could identify them before.\u201d\n\nThe test is based on 10 lipid biomarkers in the blood. Federoff said he is working to raise funds to launch a clinical trial that would follow seniors at high-risk of developing the disease based on the blood test. The study would test whether a lipid-lowering drug can prevent or slow the progression of disease.\n\n\u201cWe know that it\u2019s safe and well tolerated,\u201d he said of the medication.\n\nOne of Federoff\u2018s first moves will be to hire a new hospital CEO. He said he hopes to make an announcement next month on a replacement for Terry Belmont, who retired over the summer.\n\nUCI\u2019s medical school admits 104 students each year from more than 6,000 applicants. Federoff said the nation\u2019s medical schools don\u2019t have the capacity to educate enough doctors, especially with millions more Americans newly insured through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve started a conversation with some of the other deans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might be able to agree this is in the interest of the UC system, where all of the medical schools could conceivably grow larger. As really great institutions I think we almost have an obligation, but we have to make that work economically.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: cperkes@ocregister.com 714-796-3686", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "undef", "description": "Life: New dean of UCI medical school led milestone Alzheimer's study | federoff, new, medical, uci, test, blood, schools, alzheimer, disease, identify", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "COURTNEY PERKES", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Dr. Howard Federoff made international news last year after he led a team of researchers in designing a blood test that predicted the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease with 90 percent accuracy.", "title": "New dean of UCI medical school led milestone Alzheimer's study", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/federoff-681498-new-medical.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nudana-b88497740z.120150908094539000g9ubqd59.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nudana-b88497740z.120150908094539000g9ubqd59.10.jpg"}, "description": "Dr. Howard Federoff made international news last year after he led a team of researchers in designing a blood test that predicted the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease with 90 percent accuracy.", "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New dean of UCI medical school led milestone Alzheimer's study"}, "content_author": "COURTNEY PERKES", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/nudana-b88497740z.120150908094539000g9ubqd59.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "federoff, new, medical, uci, test, blood, schools, alzheimer, disease, identify", "publication_date": "2015-09-08", "access-type": "paid", "section": "undef", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "New dean of UCI medical school led milestone Alzheimer's study"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2293\"", "article_summary": "Last week, Federoff discussed his new role and research from his office at UCI Medical Center in Orange.\n\u201cWe might be able to agree this is in the interest of the UC system, where all of the medical schools could conceivably grow larger.\nUCI was among six schools that collaborated with Georgetown for the blood test study.\nFederoff said the nation\u2019s medical schools don\u2019t have the capacity to educate enough doctors, especially with millions more Americans newly insured through the Affordable Care Act.\nDr. Howard Federoff made international news last year after he led a team of researchers in designing a blood test that predicted the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease with 90 percent accuracy."}
