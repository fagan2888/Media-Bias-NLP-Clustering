(AP) - A graduate student is refusing to eat in an effort to oust University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe for failing to respond to a range of student concerns, such as the use of racial slurs on campus.\n\nGraduate student and campus activist Jonathan Butler began the hunger strike Monday, The Columbia Daily Tribune reported. Butler wrote in a letter to the Board of Curators that he won\u2019t eat \u201cuntil either Tim Wolfe is removed from office or my internal organs fail and my life is lost.\u201d\n\nWolfe in a statement said it\u2019s \u201cvery concerning to me when any of our students\u2019 wellbeing is in jeopardy,\u201d and said he\u2019s especially concerned about Butler\u2019s health.\n\nOther university students pledged to camp at Traditions Plaza, in the heart of the Columbia campus across from Jesse Hall, in support of Butler and until Wolfe is removed from his position.\n\n\u201cAs long as Tim Wolfe is UM System president, we will be here,\u201d said DeShaunya Ware, one of the students who camped out Monday night.\n\nThe Columbia Missourian reported Butler in his letter to curators cited the abrupt removal of graduate student health care subsidies, the end to university contracts with a Columbia Planned Parenthood clinic, anti-Semitic graffiti and the use of racial slurs on campus.\n\nConcerned Student 1950, the group camping out in protest, similarly cited frustrations with how Wolfe has handled race issues, the Daily Tribune reported. That group in a separate protest last month blocked a car Wolfe was riding in during the university Homecoming parade and were removed by police.\n\nWolfe said in a statement that he has spoken with both Butler and Concerned Student 1950 and will continue to have conversations with others interested in affecting change.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can begin to address the systemic and pervasive issue of racism in society and the effects it has on our campuses is to engage in dialogue, to build deeper relationships and have frank conversations,\u201d Wolfe said.\n\nAlso this week, members of the Department of English sent a letter to Wolfe expressing frustration with another university leader: Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin.\n\nThe newspaper reported 26 members voted that they have no confidence in Loftin\u2019s leadership. No one voted that they have confidence in him, and two abstained.\n\nIn a letter to Wolfe and the Board of Curators, associate professor Samuel Cohen cited concerns with the treatment of graduate students, disrespect of shared governance and \u201cfailure to defend the University\u2019s educational mission against outside political pressure.\u201d\n\nUniversity spokeswoman Mary Jo Banken said Loftin had not received a copy of the letter and was unaware of department criticism. She says Loftin is working to listen to concerns and continues to \u201cwork toward solutions for some of the issues we are currently challenged with.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A graduate student is refusing to eat in an effort to oust University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe for failing to respond to a range of student concerns, such as the use of racial slurs on campus.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/4/missouri-grad-student-on-hunger-strike-against-wol/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A graduate student is refusing to eat in an effort to oust University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe for failing to respond to a range of student concerns, such as the use of racial slurs on campus.", "title": "Student on hunger strike against Missouri system president"}, "twitter": {"title": "Student on hunger strike against Missouri system president", "description": "A graduate student is refusing to eat in an effort to oust University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe for failing to respond to a range of student concerns, such as the use of racial slurs on c", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Graduate student and campus activist Jonathan Butler began the hunger strike Monday, The Columbia Daily Tribune reported.\n(AP) - A graduate student is refusing to eat in an effort to oust University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe for failing to respond to a range of student concerns, such as the use of racial slurs on campus.\n\u201cAs long as Tim Wolfe is UM System president, we will be here,\u201d said DeShaunya Ware, one of the students who camped out Monday night.\nConcerned Student 1950, the group camping out in protest, similarly cited frustrations with how Wolfe has handled race issues, the Daily Tribune reported.\nAlso this week, members of the Department of English sent a letter to Wolfe expressing frustration with another university leader: Chancellor R.
