Here are 5 of the diva\u2019s most demanding moments:\n\n1. University speaking fees\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking contracts have been under harsh scrutiny recently\u2026 and for good reason. One reason in particular is the amount Miss Hillary charges to speak at a University- averaging anywhere between $250,000-300,000, because, you know, she\u2019s \u201cdead broke.\u201d\n\nA UCLA representative asked Clinton\u2019s people if they could receive a discounted rate since for a speech, since they\u2019re a taxpayer-funded public educational institution and were told \u201cthis is the special rate\u201d at $300,000.\n\nShe must also have final approval over the venue\u2019s \u201csets, backdrops, banners, scenery, logos, settings, etc\u201d, and the topic and length of her address are at her \u201csole discretion\u201d says a contact from a speaking event at Buffalo University.\n\nThere\u2019s more.\n\nAdditionally, she required that the university provide her with \u201cpresidential glass panel teleprompter and a qualified operator,\u201d and her hosts must pay an additional $1,000 to have a trained stenographer on hand to transcribe the speech as she delivers it so that she could have the speech verbatim scribed for her personal records, but the university isn\u2019t allowed a copy. And the press could attend the speech, but not the reception before it.\n\nShe\u2019s so down-to-earth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She demands as much service as her husband demands from former... well...
