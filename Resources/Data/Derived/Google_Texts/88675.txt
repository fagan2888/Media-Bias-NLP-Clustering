The putting stroke is the one skill that can take on a totally different look from one player to the next. That has never been more evident then when watching the putting style of LPGA Tour player Michelle Wie.

Two years ago I witnessed Wie putting at the Navistar Classic. I was very surprised at how “bent over” she was in her setup. So was every other golf instructor and golf critic in the country! In an interview that week, I heard her say she was the one who decided on that putting style, not David Leadbetter, her teacher of many years.

This past weekend I watched Wie play the first LPGA major of the season, where she went head to head with Lexi Thompson in the final group. Thompson ended up winning, but I was still impressed that Wie has stuck to her guns and is still putting the way I saw her putt two years ago.

Here are some great things I observe about Wie’s putting stroke that you can possibly use in your own putting game. I am certain that when you use these set-up and stroke keys, you will make more putts as well.

• Get your eyes over the ball more at setup. You will see that even as much as Wie is bent forward, her eyes are definitely over the ball.

• Keep your elbows close to the sides of your body (along the ribcage) throughout the stroke.

• Use your shoulders rather than the hands to make the putting stroke.

• You absolutely need to get fitted for the proper length and style of putter for your game.

I recommend that you go to your local LPGA or PGA professional and allow them to help you to find the best putting style for you.
