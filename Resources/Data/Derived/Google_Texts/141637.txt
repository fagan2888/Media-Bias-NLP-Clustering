ADAPT » Group’s Sunday protest of state’s ‘inadequate’ services the first of several events.

Activists from across the country will kick off several days of rallies and actions Sunday afternoon at the Capitol, protesting what they say is Utah's lack of services for disabled people.

A group organized by Americans Disabled for Attendant Programs Today (ADAPT) will march from their base at the downtown Red Lion Hotel to the Capitol for the rally, which begins at 1:30 p.m. Sunday.

ADAPT, which expects about 200 participants, plans to stage other events around the city through Thursday, including possible acts of civil disobedience, according to the group's Facebook page.

"The crux of our meeting in Salt Lake City is to protest the lack of home and community-based services for people with disabilities," ADAPT spokeswoman Fran Fulton said. "Without these services, individuals are forced to move into nursing homes and other institutions. … Utah has failed to make it possible for people to remain in their own homes, in their own neighborhoods, near their families and friends."
