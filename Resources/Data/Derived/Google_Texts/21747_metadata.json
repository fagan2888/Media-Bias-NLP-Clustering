You can find thousands of these every hour on Facebook and the media,\" he told the AP in a phone interview from a jail in Orange. \"I don't know why would they think I am a threat to the national security of the United States just because of a stupid post.\"\n\nIf allowed, Elsayed told the AP he hopes to remain in the U.S. and continue studying to become a pilot. Otherwise he planned to seek a refund for the $65,000 he has spent on his education.\n\nMore news:\n\nManhattan just quietly decriminalized drinking in public\n\nWoman accidentally buys an urn full of ashes from the Salvation Army\n\nOwner sparks controversy after posting sign in front of restaurant", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-3af9d6a02a9854da3646959922f4fe0c/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "description": "An Egyptian student faces a deportation hearing after allegedly writing a Facebook post saying he'd be willing to serve a life sentence for killing Trump.", "author": "AOL Staff", "og": {"site_name": "AOL.com", "description": "An Egyptian student faces a deportation hearing after allegedly writing a Facebook post saying he'd be willing to serve a life sentence for killing Trump.", "title": "Student faces deportation over alleged Facebook post threatening Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.aol.com/article/2016/03/05/student-faces-deportation-over-alleged-facebook-post-threatenin/21323286/", "image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/387x254+10+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Ff6a4e97f02c07bcbd0cd9fade38da070%2F203504630%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2016-03-03%2Bat%2B3.18.16%2BPM.png", "app_id": 183146218394780, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.aol.com", "account_id": 66237835, "title": "Student faces deportation over alleged Facebook post threatening Donald Trump", "image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/387x254+10+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Ff6a4e97f02c07bcbd0cd9fade38da070%2F203504630%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2016-03-03%2Bat%2B3.18.16%2BPM.png", "creator": "@AOL", "site": "@AOL", "card": "summary", "description": "An Egyptian student faces a deportation hearing after allegedly writing a Facebook post saying he'd be willing to serve a life sentence for killing Trump."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3399ff", "robots": "index,follow", "publish-date": "March 5, 2016", "p": {"domain_verify": "96bae1739d3231d21abe59a638021d5d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183146218394780}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-43dafc02cf4f3bf4849e499b04c0aa82/images/favicon/mstile-144x144.png?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/aol"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If allowed, Elsayed told the AP he hopes to remain in the U.S. and continue studying to become a pilot.\nBefore you go, we thought you'd like these...(KTLA) -- A former Los Angeles-area flight school student from Egypt faces a deportation hearing this Friday after allegedly writing a Facebook post saying he was willing to serve a life sentence for killing Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, according to his attorney.\nElsayed's student visa was revoked after the flight school withdrew its support of his visa, leading to the loss of his immigration status, the attorney told the Times.\nThe Egyptian student was terminated from the flight school at the government's request, and the owner has since expressed his willingness to re-enroll him, Bushra said.\nSEE ALSO: Leaked Donald Trump voicemails reveal MSNBC hosts and Tom Brady among friendsThe comments came after Trump called for the banning of all Muslims from entering the country."}
