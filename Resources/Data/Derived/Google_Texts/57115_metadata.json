In addition, the lowest cost silver plans in 46 percent of all counties in the U.S. were HMO products in 2015 compared to 57 percent of counties in 2016.\n\nPrice differentials for the same types of health plans are narrowing, according to the report. In 2014, more than 29 percent of counties had the lowest cost silver plans priced more than 10 percent less than the next lowest competitor\u2019s option. In 2015, that number dropped to less than five percent, and in 2016, only one percent of counties had this large of a price differential between the two most affordable silver plans.\n\n\u201cWith the ACA now in its third open enrollment period, insurance carriers are applying more data \u2013 including the actual health care costs of newly-enrolled members \u2013 to design offerings that more accurately meet the needs of consumers in this new market,\u201d said Maureen Sullivan, chief strategy officer and senior vice president of strategic services for BCBSA.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) companies serve millions of members through marketplaces in 46 states and the District of Columbia. BCBS companies offer products in 89 percent of counties across the nation, providing urban and rural populations with access to affordable health insurance. In addition to offering products on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, all BCBS companies sell individual and group health insurance products throughout the country.\n\nBCBSA used public information to get a national picture of the marketplaces for 2015 and 2016 to see what it looks like for consumers across the nation. This study of consumer choice in the marketplaces is the fourth report by Blue Cross Blue Shield, The Health of America Report.
