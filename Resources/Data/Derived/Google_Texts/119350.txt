Employees at the Chinese hotel hosting the first family are reportedly “fed up” with the Obama’s high-maintenance antics, and say they can’t wait for them to leave.

Staff workers at the Westin Beijing Chaoyang hotel told the Daily Mail that First lady Michelle Obama, her mother and two daughters have apparently outstayed their welcome. They have been staying in the $8,350-pre-night presidential suite in Beijing since Thursday.

According to one concierge staff member, the Obama women have inconvenienced “pretty much everyone” and the first lady’s mother, Marian Robinson, has been “barking at the staff” since she arrived.

“We can’t wait for this to be over, to tell you the truth,” the staffer told the Daily Mail. “We entertain many important people here, but this has been, I think very different.”

The Daily Mail reported that, since Thursday, government security forces from both China and the U.S. have been screening everyone who entered the building, including paying guests. They have also been setting up check points.

The Westin had to vacate rooms on the highest floor, booting guests with previous reservations, to accommodate the Secret Service in executive-level rooms.

Secret Service agents are also monopolizing hotel elevators long before the Obamas need them, the Daily Mail reported.

The Obamas are staying in a 3,400-sqaure-foot suite described on the Westin’s website as an “oasis of comfort.” The suite includes a “private steam room, corner sofas with silk pillows” and in-room dining for six. They also reportedy have a 24-hour butler.
