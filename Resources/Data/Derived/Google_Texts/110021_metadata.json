There\u2019s no shortage of things to worry about these days, from the rising costs of weather-related disasters to cyber crime and a sluggish economy.\n\nBut one risk has business leaders particularly concerned, more so than any of the things above:\n\nTravelers\n\nOf all the executives surveyed, 60% said medical cost inflation was the risk that had most increased in the past decade, and 38% said it was the risk their company was least prepared to manage. No other risk rated as high on either measure.\n\nAnd as you can see in the chart above, some of the most commonly cited risks are closely related: Companies worry that rising medical costs mean that the health insurance they buy will keep getting more expensive, thus raising total employee benefit costs. And as the Affordable Care Act rolls out, they\u2019re also worrying about interpreting the many facets of the law correctly and avoiding penalties for getting things wrong, hence concerns about legal liability and complying with laws.\n\nYou can see the full report from Travelers here.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "From increasingly expensive weather events to cyber hacking and macroeconomic uncertainly, there's plenty of risks to keep companies up at night.
