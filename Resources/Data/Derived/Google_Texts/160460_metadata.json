Once a bunch of commercially viable elements are bunched together for one property, so to speak, decisions of dramatic emphasis must be made. Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man, for instance, while serving as the fifth of Universal Studios\u2019 1930s- and 1940s-era Frankenstein films as well as a direct sequel to The Wolf Man, is really the Wolf Man\u2019s movie.\n\nThis decision should come as no surprise. The Wolf Man, or Larry Talbot, as he\u2019s known in his human form, is played by Lon Chaney Jr., a recognizably poignant face of the Universal Monster canon, and his Wolf Man hadn\u2019t been diluted by nearly half a dozen sequels. Frankenstein, or Frankenstein\u2019s Monster, if we can be technical, had already been played by a variety of actors within his series, most famously by Boris Karloff and even by Chaney himself\u2014devolving from an iconic creature, under Karloff\u2019s care, into a more anonymously shambling brute with occasional shades of pathos. Bela Lugosi\u2014once Universal\u2019s Dracula, and more recently Ygor in the prior Frankenstein installment\u2014assumes the Frankenstein Monster mantel in Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man and he\u2019s, well, forgettable.\n\nFrankenstein Meets The Wolf Man is the first of Universal\u2019s crossover monster movies, and it isn\u2019t nearly as confident in scope or pace as the subsequent House Of Dracula or House Of Frankenstein, which sent a variety of monsters and a collection of spurned avengers and creators scuttling on a series of overlapping adventures. This film follows a cautious, uncertain narrative, evenly bifurcating its plot so that it\u2019s theoretically half a Wolf Man movie and half a Frankenstein movie. In the first half of the story, Talbot is released from his tomb by grave robbers and captured by doctors. In the second half, he tracks down the ruins of the Frankenstein castle, yearning to discover a secret to life and death that can enable him to commit suicide and end his werewolf curse.\n\nWhen one hears the title, childish anticipation is stoked for the collision of the creatures\u2014an imaginative leap that the film\u2019s poster wasn\u2019t shy to encourage. But one should read the title closely: It isn\u2019t Frankenstein Versus The Wolf Man. We\u2019re talking about a meeting here. And yes, the two monsters meet. But they don\u2019t fight until roughly 90 seconds before the words \u201cThe End\u201d appear on the screen. And this delay hurts the pace, as one can practically feel the actors and filmmakers twiddling their thumbs until they\u2019re ready to spring the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d\n\nYet the true Universal monster fan understands that the exposition, particularly in the various convoluted offspring of the franchises\u2019 actual masterpieces, is where the \u201cgood stuff\u201d truly lurks. Because the Universal monster movies, even at their least inspired, can be counted on for a heightened, fantastical atmosphere that still reverberates\u2014all graveyards, with their slanted tombs and twisted trees; laboratories, with sound effects that suggest rusted New Year\u2019s Eve party favors; and the breathlessly florid incantations uttered by supporting players. There are also icy catacombs and ruins and castles that are destroyed via gloriously obvious miniatures, all of which are tied together by a watered-down German expressionism that favors deep black shadows and the occasional canted angle. Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man abounds in all these things, and it\u2019s notable for testing the ground for all subsequent monster mashes.\n\nAvailability: Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man has been released numerous times on DVD; some version is available from Amazon or possibly your local video store/library. The film can also be rented or purchased through the major digital services.", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/stay-end-when-wolf-man-finally-fights-frankenstein-233178", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5732/40/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Every day, Watch This offers staff recommendations inspired by the week\u2019s new releases or premieres.
