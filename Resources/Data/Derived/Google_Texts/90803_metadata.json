There was one episode like four years ago in which I was wearing some loose jeans mainly because I was out on the pitcher\u2019s mound and I didn\u2019t want to feel confined while I was pitching and I think I\u2019ve paid my penance for that. I got whacked pretty good. Since that time, my jeans fit very well.\u201d\n\nObama also discussed his Gap shopping trip in New York City this past week.\n\n\u201cThey thought for a dad, I displayed reasonably good taste,\u201d Obama said about the sweaters he bought for his daughters. \u201cThe bar is fairly low. But I didn\u2019t get too adventurous. It was your basic sweaters and solid colors, didn\u2019t get too wild.\u201d\n\nThe president did show his serious side to Seacrest, describing to listeners why they should enroll in Obamacare before the March 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cIf you get into an accident, or heaven forbid, have an illness or someone in your family does and you do not have health insurance, it can bankrupt you or you may not get the treatment you need,\u201d Obama adds. \u201cAnd for a relatively modest cost there are millions of people who have already signed up and have been able to get health insurance \u2013 we have 4.2 million who have signed up as of the beginning of the month and that means there are a whole lot of people out there who could still use it.\u201d\n\nObama was in New York on Tuesday to raise money for the Democratic National Committee at a high-dollar fundraiser at the home of Alan Patricof, the founder of a New York venture capital fund. Patricof is a longtime Clinton friend and fundraiser for her Senate and presidential campaigns, and the event aligns the Obama and Hillary Clinton orbits as the former first lady considers a White House bid in 2016.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
