No, really\u2026..\n\nA Sri Lankan national daily, Mawbima, is believed to have saved thousands of lives when it published a special edition recently that featured citronella in its ink. As you may know, citronella wards off insects, but in this case it kept mosquitoes away from residents of the region that spread the potentially fatal dengue fever.\n\nBritain\u2019s The Independent recounts how Mawbima infused the citronella into the ink, thus making every word of the edition \u2014 published on World Health Day in April \u2014 a mosquito repellent. The newspaper determined that most of its readers peruse the publication in the early morning and evening, right around the time most bites occur.\n\nMawbima previously experimented with posters that were printed with the special ink and posted them at bus stops, where they proved effective, and handed out citronella-laced patches to schoolchildren to wear. Then it published the mosquito-repelling newspaper.\n\nThe results: Mawbima sold all its copies by 10 a.m., which represent a sales increase of 30%. Readership increased by an estimated 300,000.\n\nIt could be the first time it was noble to be a so-called \u201cink-stained rat.\u201d\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nA potentially fatal threat to Obamacare\n\nAckman proposes new slate of Allergan directors\n\nThe growing concern of nanotechnology", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-07-07T15:25:15-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "A Sri Lankan daily newspaper may have saved thousands of lives by printing copies with mosquito-repelling ink to ward off dengue.", "title": "Newspaper uses mosquito-repelling ink and sales soar", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/07/newspaper-uses-mosquito-repelling-ink-and-sales-soar/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CL581_caduce_MG_20140707150312.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "health care,mosquito-repelling ink,newspaper,Sri Lanka", "article.headline": "Newspaper uses mosquito-repelling ink and sales soar", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "A Sri Lankan daily newspaper may have saved thousands of lives by printing copies with mosquito-repelling ink to ward off dengue.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "health care,mosquito-repelling ink,newspaper,Sri Lanka", "article.published": "2014-07-07T15:25:15-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/07/newspaper-uses-mosquito-repelling-ink-and-sales-soar/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "A Sri Lankan daily newspaper may have saved thousands of lives by printing copies with mosquito-repelling ink to ward off dengue.", "title": "Newspaper uses mosquito-repelling ink and sales soar", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/07/newspaper-uses-mosquito-repelling-ink-and-sales-soar/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CL581_caduce_MG_20140707150312.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2782", "article.updated": "2014-07-07T15:25:15-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3996\"", "article_summary": "No, really\u2026..A Sri Lankan national daily, Mawbima, is believed to have saved thousands of lives when it published a special edition recently that featured citronella in its ink.\nAs you may know, citronella wards off insects, but in this case it kept mosquitoes away from residents of the region that spread the potentially fatal dengue fever.\nMawbima previously experimented with posters that were printed with the special ink and posted them at bus stops, where they proved effective, and handed out citronella-laced patches to schoolchildren to wear.\nThen it published the mosquito-repelling newspaper.\nThe results: Mawbima sold all its copies by 10 a.m., which represent a sales increase of 30%."}
