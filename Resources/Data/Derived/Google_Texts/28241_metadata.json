However, The Post cites several studies and doctors\u2019 records saying the procedure actually takes about 30 minutes on average. The time dedicated to a colonoscopy, however, is not just for the procedure. It includes a pre- and post-exam and a lot of paperwork.\n\nFor example, patients must receive instructions on how to prepare for the exam, and they must sign a copy of the post procedure instructions and medication reconciliation form. They pre-procedure prescription must be written by the doctor or a qualified nurse\u2014whoever delivers the information to the patient is costing the doctor money.\n\nNext, you\u2019re being prepped for anesthesia. The surgeon is dictating all the procedural notes during this time of the patient\u2019s condition, including the patient\u2019s mental status, airway examination, CV examination, etc. The patient\u2019s vitals are monitored and recorded during and after the procedure. Finally, a lengthy description of the procedure is written and delivered to the patient along with photographs of the colon. If polyps are to be removed, even more time is spent during the procedure.\n\nThe post-op procedure is short, but requires a nurse or other administrator\u2014someone on the doctor\u2019s staff who must be compensated. Finally, there is the report and billing. Does all this take one hour and 15 minutes?\n\nRelated: How the New Medicare Proposal Could Affect You\n\nSince 1991, the federal government has relied on recommendations of the American Medical Association\u2019s Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee, or RUC, to figure out how to set its reimbursement rates.\n\nMedicare determines rates based on the \u201crelative value\u201d of each provider service, and RUC recommends what that value might be. It\u2019s decided by both the time and intensity of the procedure, and cost of malpractice insurance. Then it\u2019s calculated against a cost of living scale by zip code. If a procedure takes longer and requires more specialized skills, it will cost more.\n\nThe GAO said the panel operates somewhat secretively. Although the meetings are technically public, all attendees must sign a confidentiality agreement not to disclose what is discussed.\n\nRelated: Doctors Banned by Medicare Still Billing Medicare\n\nThe auditors also suggest that doctor groups are extremely eager to have influence over the panel. According to the report, provider groups donate about $8 million a year to the committee and \u201chundreds of physicians\u201d volunteer to be on the panel.\n\nIf there are conflicts of interest that skew the panels\u2019 reimbursement rates recommendations, it could have huge implications for the health care system, as well as the federal government, which makes about $70 billion annual in Medicare payments.\n\nThe GAO recommended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services be more transparent about how they set rates by better documenting the process.\n\nSeparately, groups like the American Academy of Family Physicians say that CMS should take recommendations from other medical professionals including more primary care physicians, heath economists and consumer advocates, according to California Healthline.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A small but powerful panel of physicians has long played a major role in determining h", "title": "A Conflict of Interest in the Way Medicare Pays Docs?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/02/Conflict-Interest-Way-Medicare-Pays-Docs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09112012_Health_Cash_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/02/Conflict-Interest-Way-Medicare-Pays-Docs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09112012_Health_Cash_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A small but powerful panel of physicians has long played a major role in determining h", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb548\"", "article_summary": "A small but powerful panel of physicians has long played a major role in determining how much the federal government pays its Medicare doctors.\nMedicare determines rates based on the \u201crelative value\u201d of each provider service, and RUC recommends what that value might be.\nHowever, The Post cites several studies and doctors\u2019 records saying the procedure actually takes about 30 minutes on average.\nRelated: Doctors Banned by Medicare Still Billing MedicareThe auditors also suggest that doctor groups are extremely eager to have influence over the panel.\nThe GAO recommended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services be more transparent about how they set rates by better documenting the process."}
