His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nPresident Barack Obama is going rogue. By every metric the Obama economy is melting down. We are seeing the beginning stages of another recession at best, or a total economic meltdown at worst.\n\nAt the moment there are no decent paying jobs in America. Obama has opened the border and given amnesty to at least 5 million illegal aliens already in the country, thereby putting them in competition with working class and middle class Americans.\n\nThink I\u2019m wrong? Did you know the government is giving businesses a $3,000 incentive to hire illegal\u2019s over native-born Americans?\n\nIf Obama doesn\u2019t like your business, he will \u201cchoke off\u201d your ability to stay in business. Share:\n\nDid you know cities are hiring non-citizens (and even illegal aliens given amnesty by Obama) as policemen? All you need is a work permit. Someone in America illegally can wear a badge and enforce the law against you. Don\u2019t believe me? Ask USA Today.\n\nDid you think the border crisis was over? Obama\u2019s amnesty has encouraged a new wave of poverty-stricken illegals at the border.\n\nAnd, in a bankrupt nation with over $18 trillion in debt, Obama has used amnesty to give illegals access to food stamps, free healthcare, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and earned income tax credits. And by issuing drivers licenses and Social Security cards they will be able to vote immediately (because states don\u2019t have the technology to tell the difference between a legal citizen or a noncitizen, legal or not).\n\nThe Obamacare fiasco gets worse by the day. The middle class is being bankrupted by skyrocketing increases in their health insurance premiums; hospitals are being bankrupted by the flood of illegal aliens accessing services;and the economy will drown in the new debt caused by Obamacare.\n\nObama\u2019s claim that Islamic State is on the run is a proven fraud, ripped bare by America\u2019s embarrassing military withdrawl from Yemen.\n\nObama is going nuclear in his hatred for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel, force-feeding the world a weak nuclear agreement with Iran that is so bad, even France is fighting for stringer sanctions. Meanwhile Obama threatens to become the first president in history to abandon Israel at the United Nations.\n\nBut, I haven\u2019t gotten to the bad part yet.\n\nIs it possible the terrible news about the economy, the border, Islamic State and Israel is all just a distraction? Because the really important news is that Obama has created a modern-day version of \u201cthe Gestapo.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration is using an initiative called \u201cOperation Chokepoint\u201d to force legal businesses it doesn\u2019t like out of business, by threatening and intimidating banks and credit card processors.\n\nAt the same time, the Obama government is urging banks to call the police to report citizens who withdraw $5,000 or more from their own bank accounts. Yes, I said banks are urged to call the police, when you withdraw your own money.\n\nThis comes at the same time that Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it will no longer provide FEMA disaster relief funds to states whose governors deny \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Obama used an Federal Communications Commission party-line vote to take over the Internet and institute sweeping new changes to a system that is working perfectly as the form of communication for most Americans.\n\nObama\u2019s first goal is clearly massive new taxes on Internet usage, just another way to destroy the middle class and redistribute income. But is his real goal controlling communications on the Internet \u2013 specifically the anti-Obama criticism and anti-government message so prevalent on the Internet.\n\nBut let\u2019s circle back to the most Gestapo-like Obama initiative ever. It\u2019s called \u201cOperation Chokepoint.\u201d This is your government\u2019s attempt to put morality controls (just like those in Iran) on the American public by shutting down gun stores, precious metals companies, casinos, tobacco distributors, telemarketers, and short-term money lenders.\n\nHow can they close legal businesses you ask?\n\nBy threatening and intimidating banks and credit card processors to close accounts for businesses the government doesn\u2019t like. Just like an Iranian Ayatollah, if Obama doesn\u2019t like your business, he will \u201cchoke off\u201d your ability to stay in business. Hence the name, \u201cOperation Chokepoint.\u201d\n\nNever forget Obama has been on a six-year long relentless crusade to raise our taxes and take away our tax deduction for charitable donations, choking off contributions to churches. Yes, Obama is trying to \u201cchoke off\u201d the funding that keeps churches in business too.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nFirst, because Obama despises capitalism. He needs to put prosperous businesses out of business. By murdering the middle class\u2019s ability to prosper, he creates his utopia of equality (\u201cshared misery\u201d), making everyone dependent on government in a classless, socialist society. Think Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nSecond, there is an obvious reason Obama hates these particular industries. The subtitle of my 2009 book, \u201cThe Conscience of a Libertarian\u201d says it all. The subtitle was \u201cEmpowering the Citizen Revolution with God, Guns, Gold, Gambling & Tax Cuts.\u201d Is it a coincidence that virtually every item I mentioned is under attack?\n\nThe businesses on the list of \u201cOperation Chokepoint\u201d are all dominated by people that Obama would describe as capitalists, patriots, conservatives, Tea Partiers and supporters of the Constitution. Not coincidently, those are the same groups targeted by Obama in the IRS scandal.\n\nAnd then of course, if Obama can\u2019t close your business, or \u201cchoke off\u201d your ability to prosper, he can force banks to call the police if you dare to withdraw money from your own account.\n\nFolks this is eerily reminiscent of The Gestapo, or the Soviet KGB, or the East German Stasi.\n\nIs this the America you want?\n\nThe NSA spying on your every move; the federal government in charge of your healthcare and now your free speech on the Internet; the IRS auditing enemies and critics of the government; government forcing legal businesses they deem \u201cunacceptable\u201d out of business; and banks spying on their own customers and being forced to call the police when customers withdraw too much of their own money.\n\nYes, under Barack Hussein Obama the Gestapo is alive and well in the former \u201cLand of the Free.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
