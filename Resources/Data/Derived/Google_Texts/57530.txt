Mike Busha spends his days doing concrete work to pay the bills — a job that has become increasingly busy recently.

Busha, 51, of Port Huron, said more concrete work, like building work, means an improving economy. New projects mean people have extra money to invest.

“However, it’s still hard to feel the improvements,” he said. “It personally hasn’t improved for me. We still need more, better paying jobs. People don’t want to work for near $8 an hour. You can’t live off of that.”

St. Clair County’s economy continued to show a slow, but steady growth in 2014 with a decrease in both the poverty and unemployment rates, according to U.S. Census data released Thursday.

The county is not alone in their growth with Michigan and the U.S. seeing broad improvements as well.

Mike Belleman, St. Clair County Community College economics professor, attributed the improvements in the county to the local businesses growth in 2014 — from expanding automotive suppliers to new restaurants opening.

Sai Tatineni, SMR Automotive managing director in Marysville, said he has hired nearly 100 new employees in the past year and expects to hire even more.

“We have been expanding and hiring more people as part of our growth plan,” Tatineni said. “We are growing and the market has steadily been increasing in the U.S. The more cars that are sold, the more suppliers, like us, sell.”

He said when the economy is bad people don’t use their extra funds for luxury purchases like cars. He said car sales, relating to a higher demand for automotive parts from suppliers like SMR, means positive growth for the economy.

St. Clair County’s poverty rate dropped from 15.9 percent in 2013 to 13.6 percent in 2014. In Michigan that percentage dropped from 17 percent in 2013 to 16.3 percent in 2014.

Belleman said the increase in the state’s minimum wage could be a growth factor as well.

While the county was ahead of the state in terms of poverty rates, St. Clair County is still trailing slightly behind with its unemployment rate. The county unemployment rate decreased from 11 percent in 2013 to 8.7 percent in 2014, while in Michigan the rate decreased from 9.8 percent in 2013 to 8.3 percent in 2014.

“While the poverty rate going down is an indicator that people are going back to work, the unemployment rate is based off of how many people were currently collecting unemployment,” Belleman said. “So that number depends on if people simply just exhausted their unemployment benefits, how many people responded to the census survey and how many actually did find employment.”

Regardless, Belleman said the pendulum is moving in the right direction.

The median household income in St. Clair County dipped slightly from $50,816 in 2013 down to $50,319 in 2014. In Michigan, that number improved from $49,013 in 2013 to $49,847 in 2014.

Belleman said overall the movement of median household income numbers were insignificant.

“Incomes are still stagnant and will be for a while,” he said. “You won’t see any large increases soon, but things are picking back up.”

The population in the county also remained stagnant with 128,891 of people 16 years of age and older living in St. Clair County in 2014, up from 128,723 in 2013.

And with the Affordable Care Act phasing in in 2014, the number of people without healthcare in St. Clair County decreased from near 14 percent in 2013 down to 11.3 percent in 2014.

“It will continue to get better but we still need more and bigger industry to show up in St. Clair County to generate an increase in the level of employment,” Belleman said.
