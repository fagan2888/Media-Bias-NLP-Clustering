A Utah man has died while attempting to carry out a New Year's Eve skydiving jump in Arizona.

Police were called around 7:25 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 31 to Skydive Arizona in Eloy, between Tucson and Phoenix.

Eloy police say they found 37-year-old Ronald Mazzola Jr., of Salt Lake City, on the ground.

According to a witness, Mazzola's parachute collapsed about 100 feet above the ground as he was descending.

Bystanders and emergency responders performed life-saving efforts but Mazzola was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officials say Mazzola had nine years of skydiving experience and participated in more than 800 jumps.

Police are investigating the incident.

Mazzola's parachute has been given to the Federal Aviation Administration for further inspection.
