Ted Cruz (R-TX) is coming off his performance in the first debate strong, barnstorming through the American southeast to sold out crowds filled with overwhelmingly enthusiastic supporters riding a grassroots wave of energy through the month of August.\n\nSince the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland, Cruz has embarked on a bus tour through the South\u2014what his campaign calls \u201cCruz Country\u201d\u2014with stops in Mount Pleasant, S.C., Savannah, Atlanta, Newman, and Columbus, Georgia, Pelham and Huntsville, Alabama, Chattanooga, Murfreesboro, Franklin, Memphis and Jackson, Tennessee, Tupelo and Olive Branch, Mississippi, and Little Rock, Van Buren and Russelville, Arkansas. On Thursday, he\u2019s wrapping the swing with three stops in Oklahoma\u2014in Oklahoma City, Bartlesville and Tulsa.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nEvery single event has seen sold out or over capacity crowds, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cAfter the debate\u2014we feel like we got a really big bump out of the debate,\u201d Tyler said, citing the recent NBC News poll that had Cruz in second place. \u201cWithin a hundred hours after the debate we raised over a million dollars.\u201d\n\nCruz has been raising enormous amounts of cash from both high-dollar donors and\u2014especially\u2014from the grassroots. In fact, his campaign has raised more hard money than any other Republican running for president. Combine that with outside Super PACs backing the Texan and political outsider, and he\u2019s second in the GOP money race to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\u201cWe went to Charleston [South Carolina], an early state\u2014and that\u2019s where we started the bus tour,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThe bus tour has been 20 stops, 2,000 miles, basically all through what is commonly known as the \u2018SEC Primary.\u2019 No stop has had less than 500 people. At three stops, we had to move the venue outside because we couldn\u2019t fit all the people inside. At one stop, a fire marshall stopped anyone else from coming in and we had 200 people waiting outside. Our biggest event was almost 2,000 people and our smallest event was over 500. The support has been just overwhelming. What\u2019s really striking is the number of young people that have come out. Ted always asks people under 30 to raise their hands and it\u2019s unbelievable how many under 30 are in the crowds\u2014and then how many people have brought their entire families out on a weekday in the middle of the day, brought their entire families out with their kids, to come see Ted Cruz speak. We\u2019ve just been overwhelmed by the response from the grassroots.\u201d\n\nThis is starting to be a \"thing\"\u2026 over 400 in Columbus\u2026 #CruzCountry #CruzCrew pic.twitter.com/97wxqXahx2 \u2014 Jeff Roe (@jeffroe) August 8, 2015\n\nI think it's now safe to call it a trend\u2026 1,000+ in Huntsville #CruzCountry pic.twitter.com/K0TXE1mhVx \u2014 Jeff Roe (@jeffroe) August 10, 2015\n\nFire Marshall won't let hundreds of people in to @TedCruz event in Tulsa, OK pic.twitter.com/41hT1N3xUI \u2014 Rick Tyler (@rickwtyler) August 14, 2015\n\nTyler said he can\u2019t \u201cdescribe the crowds as anything other than raucous.\u201d When asked if it\u2019s like a rock concert, Tyler said \u201cit really is.\u201d\n\nOverwhelming crowds force @TedCruz outside again here in OKC. pic.twitter.com/Nx82NImK65 \u2014 Rick Tyler (@rickwtyler) August 13, 2015\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a rock concert, and we show up and Ted just knocks it out of the park,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThey just can\u2019t contain themselves\u2014they\u2019re chanting \u2018Ted Cruz for president!\u2019 and all kinds of wonderful things. The South is really great. It treated us well all along the way just making things easy for us. Lots of people tell us they\u2019re praying for us and they\u2019re putting their hope into Ted Cruz for president because he says what he means and he means what he says.\u201d\n\nTyler explained to Breitbart News that there\u2019s a politically strategic reason Cruz has picked these various southern states to build out a massive grassroots operation in.\n\n\u201cStrategically, the reason this is important is because not only can we compete in the early states\u2014we\u2019re going to Nevada on Friday and we\u2019re going back to Iowa on the 21st of August, for a religious liberty rally, that\u2019s going to be a big event\u2014but we\u2019ve got the money, the message, the candidate and the grassroots support to actually organize the SEC states, most of them are March 1 and some of them are March 8, and we\u2019ve announced over 186 leadership positions across the South,\u201d Tyler said in the interview on the campaign bus, which was riding through Oklahoma. \u201cRight now, Congressman Bridenstine is riding with us from Oklahoma City to Tulsa. He introduced Ted in Oklahoma City, he\u2019ll introduce him again in Tulsa. We\u2019re just very encouraged by the support we\u2019ve received, and we believe that because of the compressed time frame between the early states and the SEC primary, you have to organize and spend the time and the resources now if you\u2019re hoping to get the support here in the South. We\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve put in the resources. We\u2019ve put in the time. And they are really turning out in their support.\u201d\n\nSince Iowa caucuses aren\u2019t until the first week of February this cycle, everything is going to happen much faster than previous cycles especially in the southern states. Since the South is so conservative, with all those primaries right around the corner from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and Florida, in early March, it could be the boost that a Cruz candidacy\u2014or any other conservative\u2014needs to win the nomination.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t win an early state and then get in the car and be arguing with your staff about which state you\u2019re going to go to next,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be doing the ground game, you\u2019ve got to be doing the organization, you\u2019ve really got to be organized. So this campaign, because we\u2019re organized and we have a candidate who has the right message, we\u2019re built for the long haul. We\u2019re not built for the short run where we hope we win an early state and cash in and hope we\u2019ll go a little further. By the way, that\u2019s never worked\u2014if you look at all the conservatives who have won early states, none of them have gone on to win the nomination. They\u2019ve all gone on to get beaten by the establishment. But here we have Ted Cruz who not only has the grassroots support and organization, but the money to actually compete and go the distance. We haven\u2019t actually had a conservative who can unite the party\u2014unite national security conservatives, social conservatives and fiscal conservatives all together\u2014and we\u2019re also getting a lot of liberty movement people on board. The only way we\u2019re ever going to beat the establishment is if we unite behind one candidate who can put all those people together and have enough money to compete against whoever the establishment decides is going to be their candidate.\u201d\n\nTyler said he expects the energy from all the non-politicians\u2014Donald Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, and more\u2014to eventually channel behind Cruz, another non-politician. And Cruz looks at the field seeing all this excitement from ordinary Americans nationwide and thinks of it as the year America strikes back against Washington, and whichever vessel by which they eventually choose to strike Washington with\u2014Cruz certainly hopes it will be him\u2014Americans\u2019 intense level of energy is packing a serious punch.\n\n\u201cOne thing people often forget about Cruz is he\u2019s only held elected office for two and a half years\u2014he never held elected office before that,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cDuring that two and a half years, what has he done? He\u2019s fought the establishment at every turn. He\u2019s fought to not raise the debt ceiling, to repeal Obamacare, it goes on and on and on. What the grassroots is telling all the politicians is we\u2019re tired of you being \u2018campaign conservatives.\u2019 We actually want consistent conservatives. They\u2019ve just registered their protests will pollsters to say \u2018we want anybody but a politician.\u2019 Ted Cruz is the one who stood up to the establishment, stood up to Washington, he\u2019s not a career politician, he\u2019s only been elected two and a half years, and he\u2019s the one who articulates a message that can get people out to rally against Washington to change things. Politicians don\u2019t form parades, they jump in front of them. But Ted Cruz is leading the parade.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
