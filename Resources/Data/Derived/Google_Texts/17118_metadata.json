Tom Petri Tom PetriDem bill would make student loan payments contingent on income Black box to combat medical malpractice Two lawmakers faulted, two cleared in House Ethics probes MORE (R Wis.), concerns various members\u2019 interference with government contracts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nU.S. government contracts are awarded according to a competitive process and statutory procedures implemented in relevant executive branch agencies including the Department of Defense (DOD). The president is the Commander and Chief of the armed forces, and DOD contracting is carried out under the supervision of officials appointed by him and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nOnce a government contract is awarded, it should stand. Congressional ethics rules should not allow members to intervene to change the result. This problem is particularly acute in DOD contracts where national defense is at stake.\n\nCongressional ethics rules \u2013 perhaps not surprisingly -- aren\u2019t written that way. Thus, after a contract was awarded by DOD to the Oshkosh Corporation, a Wisconsin company, headquartered in Petri\u2019s district, competitor companies in Texas that lost the contract protested the award to Oshkosh. Then, as the OCE said in its report \u201cShortly after the protests were filed, members of the Texas congressional delegation took several actions \u2013 including sending a letter to the Secretary of Defense \u2013 on behalf of one of the losing bidders, a company based in Sealy, Texas, to raise concerns with the [contract] award to Oshkosh.\u201d\n\nThe OCE or the House Ethics Committee apparently sees nothing wrong with this. Helping companies in their district is what members do, even if this means trying to influence DOD contracts. Concerns about members\u2019 lack of relevant expertise and the trillion dollar defense budget are secondary. Politics comes first, and House ethics rules won\u2019t prohibit politics as usual.\n\nAs the OCE observed, Oshkosh then sought assistance from the Wisconsin congressional delegation, including Petri, to counter the efforts of the Texas congressional delegation. Sensible ethics rules would have prohibited Petri\u2019s involvement in the defense contract just as sensible ethics rules would have prohibited the Texas delegation from interfering with the contract to begin with. Taxpayers would save money if members of Congress were to stand down and let the Defense Department do its job.\n\nBut if one side can play, both sides can play. At least Petri \u2013 unlike his Texas colleagues \u2013 was seeking to support a decision that DOD had already made on the merits. And his involvement, along with the entire Wisconsin delegation, in fending off the Texas delegation\u2019s efforts may have saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars on a major DOD contract.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee\u2019s concern about Petri, however, is that he also owned stock in Oshkosh. In other words, he actually believed enough in a company in his own district to invest in it.\n\nThat does not mean that he lost the right to advocate for Oshkosh. Such a rule would make little sense \u2013 among other things it would force family business owners to sell their businesses and farmers to sell their farms before going to Congress to advocate for businesses and farms in their districts.\n\nAnd the rules don\u2019t provide that a member has to stand down from advocating for a company because he owns stock in the company. The House Ethics Manual simply provides that \u201cA Member who considers advocating on a matter that may affect his \u201cpersonal financial interest . . . should first contact the Standards Committee for guidance.\u201d In other words the member has to ask for \u201cguidance\u201d - some would say \u201cpermission\u201d \u2013 from other members on the committee before proceeding. Those members then make an \u201cethical\u201d (political?) decision about whether he can proceed.\n\nSuch an open-ended rule is of course open to various interpretations, but that is exactly what Petri did. He went to the House Ethics Committee for guidance on what to do, and at no point was he told to stop advocating for Oshkosh.\n\nAnd now the Ethics Committee, instead of dismissing the findings of the OCE that ignored Petri\u2019s following the advice he received from the Ethics Committee itself, issued a statement saying it wants to continue the investigation of Petri, a retiring member who has served his district for thirty five years. Neither the Committee\u2019s statement or the OCE report cites any rule prohibiting Petri from advocating for Oshkosh because there is no such rule, only the vague rule requiring consultation with the Committee and the Committee\u2019s concerns with the quality of the consultation. This, along with similarly vague allegations about Petri\u2019s advocacy for other [Wisconsin] companies in which he owned stock, comprise the entirety of its investigation of Petri.\n\nWhile the Committee continues this hapless investigation, the House fails to address the real problem, which is its members meddling in government contracts, a political game that costs taxpayers billions of dollars and in the case of DOD contracts potentially jeopardizes the safety of men and women in our armed forces who use the equipment that DOD contracts to buy. Whether the reason be stock ownership, or more likely campaign contributions (a sacred cow that the House Ethics Committee almost never touches) or any other reason, Congress should not interfere. At least Petri defended DOD\u2019s contracting decisions against colleagues (some of his own Party) who tried to interfere. The House and the Senate both need to tell their Members to stop playing politics with government contracts and allow our troops and the civilian DOD personnel who are charged with protecting them to do their jobs.\n\nPainter is S.
