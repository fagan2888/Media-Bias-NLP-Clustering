Sean Maloney (D-NY) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz) have voted with Republicans 10 times. Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) has done so six times.\n\nThe votes have included amendments seeking to defund or delay President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, a measure that most, if not all, LGBT organizations support.\n\nThe Republican efforts have failed thus far because most of the bills involved required two-thirds majority to pass the House. The votes have seldom reached that threshold, plus they have no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nBut some activists are taking notice of Democrats crossing the aisle and they\u2019re not happy about it.\n\nIn a blog for Huffington Post, gay political commentator Michelangelo Signorile singled out two of the three for frequently voting with Republicans and conservatives.\n\n\u201cSince taking office, Sinema has voted with the GOP against economic justice issues that progressives, including LGBT activists, view as crucial,\u201d wrote Signorile. \u201cBoth she and U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, an openly gay former Clinton aide\u2026have voted with big banks and Wall Street time and again.\u201d Sinema and Maloney, he said, \u201cvoted to jeopardize Obamacare or shut down the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about this: On what is arguably the most important debate in Congress, two of nine Democrats who voted with the tea party-led blackmailers are openly gay or bisexual,\u201d wrote Signorile. \u201cTwo of only five openly gay or bisexual members of the House voted with the extreme far right to undermine the president.\n\nAt a gay media forum in New York City October 2, Ann Northrup, a commentator on GayUSATV.org, said it was \u201chorrible\u201d that gay and bisexual Democrats in Congress were voting with the GOP, calling them \u201cRepublicans in sheep\u2019s clothing or Democrats in name only.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat that does,\u201d she said, \u201c\u2026 is give the Republicans cover to say [their bills are] bipartisan\u2026. They\u2019re basically saying everybody should be compromising \u2013that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nSinema and Maloney were two of 17 Democrats to vote September 29 for a continuing resolution (CR) bill that included amendments to repeal a funding mechanism and delay implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Obama\u2019s health care reform law. Sinema and Maloney were two of nine Democrats to vote October 1 for a CR that included an amendment to delay the ACA\u2019s individual mandate.\n\nSinema and Maloney have taken particular heat for being among 22 Democrats to vote with the GOP in July to delay a key provision of the ACA \u2013the individual mandate.\n\nSinema told the Arizona Republic she supported a one-year delay because some states have not yet created online \u201cmarketplaces\u201d where citizens can sign up for specific insurance plans.\n\n\u201cA one-year delay of the individual mandate,\u201d Sinema told the Republic, \u201cwill ensure that Arizonans get that certainty.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Polis said, \u201cJared is committed to working with Democrats and Republicans to re-open the federal government. He believes that we have the opportunity to do that if Speaker Boehner will allow for a vote on a clean CR. In particular, Jared is proud to have supported a bi-partisan bill that would reopen our National Parks so that the many jobs that revolve around tourism and Rocky Mountain National Park in areas like Estes Park in Colorado, are safe.\n\nAnd a spokesperson for Maloney said the New York representative voted for a continuing resolution to fund the government because he has \u201cthousands of federal employees\u201d in his Congressional district. And while he voted for a CR that would have delayed penalties for individuals who did not sign up for health insurance by the deadline, she noted that President Obama secured a similar delay for businesses, and Maloney believes families should have the same \u201cflexibility.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is critical of the partisan jumps.\n\nRichard Socarides, a political commentator for New Yorker magazine and former White House aide, said he thinks \u201cone could legitimately disagree with some of positions they have taken on the merits, depending on your point of view.\u201d But he added that \u201cit\u2019s not right or smart to say that because they are LGBT Democrats they should always support the president and never work with Republicans.\u201d\n\nPolitical blogger Mike Rogers said it\u2019s important to look at the individual votes. For instance, Polis voted with Republicans October 4 to support a continuing resolution that would have restored funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\n\u201cJared\u2019s district \u2026 just went through a devastating flood,\u201d noted Rogers. \u201cIf he voted against [the FEMA funding], he\u2019d be followed by a mob.\u201d\n\nHe gets why Sinema would have voted with Republicans to support a continuing resolution for the National Park Service.\n\n\u201cArizona\u2019s economy is in real trouble. The parks there are their lifeblood in many areas,\u201d said Rogers.\n\nBut he says Sinema was wrong to vote to delay the ACA.\n\n\u201cA one year delay will kill Obamacare. Period. It will be over and never pass in another 70 years,\u201d said Rogers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I would rather see a GOPer than Sinema, Maloney or the rest,\u201d said Rogers, \u201cbut we still need to pressure these people to be Democrats.\u201d\n\nAn October 11 article in MotherJones notes that a few Democrats, including Sinema and Maloney, \u201cserve in districts carried by Mitt Romney in 2012,\u201d and are considered vulnerable in 2014. But Polis, the article notes, is in a safe Democratic district. A spokesman told MotherJones that Polis wants a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution but that he was proud to support one that included funding just for the National Park Service \u201cso that the many jobs that revolve around tourism and Rocky Mountain National Park\u2026are safe.\u201d\n\nNotably, all six LGBT House members signed onto an October 5 letter to House Speaker John Boehner, demanding a vote on a continuing resolution that is free of controversial amendments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Story Filed Under", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jared Polis, Kyrsten Sinema, Sean Patrick Maloney, U.S. House of Representatives", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LGBTQ Nation", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As Congress continues to wrestle with a bitter partisan divide that has crippled its ability to set a budget, keep the federal government open, and enable the nation to pay its b\u2026", "title": "Three LGBT Democrats in U.S. House have voted with GOP in budget fight", "url": "http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2013/10/three-lgbt-democrats-in-u-s-house-have-voted-with-gop-in-budget-fight/", "image": {"width": 665, "identifier": "http://static.lgbtqnation.com/assets/2013/10/Maloney-Sinema-Polis.jpg", "height": 420}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static.lgbtqnation.com/assets/2013/10/Maloney-Sinema-Polis.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 162245191716, "app_id": 139331137822}, "bitly-verification": "d05cd30d47d0", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-15T19:00:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-15T07:55:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=940"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc38\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTwo of only five openly gay or bisexual members of the House voted with the extreme far right to undermine the president.\n\u201cSince taking office, Sinema has voted with the GOP against economic justice issues that progressives, including LGBT activists, view as crucial,\u201d wrote Signorile.\nOut of 33 contentious roll call votes in the House in October, Rep.
