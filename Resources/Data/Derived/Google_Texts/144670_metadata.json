IlliniCare provides the back office and operational infrastructure to CountyCare, the Medicaid managed care plan of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, the two-hospital safety net for the poor and uninsured.\n\nIlliniCare was chosen in part because of its track record overseeing similar health plans for the state. The company, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Centene, also has its own Medicaid managed care plan in Illinois.\n\nThe health system saw the direct competition from IlliniCare as a potential conflict of interest and decided to seek a new administrator. The health system has begun a search to replace IlliniCare.\n\nJoy said in a statement that \"there are a number of ways to adjust IlliniCare's management role while maintaining continuity of care for CountyCare members and addressing issues related to competition.\"\n\nSome Cook County commissioners raised questions about the IlliniCare contract at Wednesday's board meeting. One said she was disturbed about the change.\n\nDr. John Jay Shannon, CEO of Cook County Health, said at the meeting that IlliniCare hasn't done anything to violate the contract but reiterated that the competition from IlliniCare for Medicaid beneficiaries represents a potential conflict.\n\n\"Things are changing very rapidly in this space,\" Shannon said. \"If you are going to do Medicaid in Illinois, Cook County is where the money is. It's where the members are.\"\n\nIlliniCare released Joy's statement after the meeting ended. Joy said IlliniCare has brought financial and operational transparency to CountyCare and supported enrollment growth of 68 percent through its 370 local employees.\n\nHe said implementing a new management system for a complex health plan \"involves significant risk.\" Some commissioners also asked Shannon about potential disruption and he responded that the health system is preparing for the transition and will try to make it as seamless as possible.\n\nasachdev@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @ameetsachdev", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "IlliniCare fires back over Cook County contract termination", "date": "2015-09-09", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The company running Cook County's Medicaid insurance plan that was fired last month warned that changing administrators \"threatens a major disruption\" to the plan's 171,000 members.", "title": "IlliniCare fires back over Cook County contract termination", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-illinicare-cook-county-0910-biz-20150909-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55f0c1c9/turbine/ct-illinicare-cook-county-0910-biz-20150909", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/84392843", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "IlliniCare Health, Cook County Health & Hospitals System, CountyCare, Medicaid, public health system", "news_keywords": "IlliniCare Health, Cook County Health & Hospitals System, CountyCare, Medicaid, public health system", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "IlliniCare makes first public comments after being fired last month as the operator of Cook County's Medicaid managed care plan."}, "article_summary": "Jeff Joy, president and CEO of IlliniCare Health Plan, made his first public comments Wednesday about the termination of a $1.8 billion, five-year contract awarded last year.\nSome Cook County commissioners raised questions about the IlliniCare contract at Wednesday's board meeting.\n\"If you are going to do Medicaid in Illinois, Cook County is where the money is.\nDr. John Jay Shannon, CEO of Cook County Health, said at the meeting that IlliniCare hasn't done anything to violate the contract but reiterated that the competition from IlliniCare for Medicaid beneficiaries represents a potential conflict.\nIlliniCare provides the back office and operational infrastructure to CountyCare, the Medicaid managed care plan of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, the two-hospital safety net for the poor and uninsured."}
