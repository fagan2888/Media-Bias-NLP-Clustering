During its time in the national spotlight, Ferguson, MO, received scrutiny here at Reason and elsewhere for its use of fees and fines to generate revenue for the city government, a strategy that some critics viewed as ratcheting up tension between law enforcement and the community.

"When you have towns like those in St. Louis county that get in some cases, 40 percent of their municipal revenue in fines and fees, they have chosen a very expensive way of taxing their population, one that creates maximum hassle and maximum hostility," says Walter Olson, senior fellow at the Cato Institute and publisher of the blog Overlawyered.

But now, Bloomberg News reports, the city actually is planning to increase fines to address a serious revenue shortfall:

“There are a number of things going on in 2014 and one is a revenue shortfall that we anticipate making up in 2015,” Jeffrey Blume, Ferguson’s finance director, said. “There’s about a million-dollar increase in public-safety fines to make up the difference.”

Revenue from violations, which already represents the city’s second-largest source of cash after sales taxes, will rise to 15.7 percent of receipts in fiscal 2015, from a projected 11.8 percent this year, he said. In 2013, fines brought in $2.2 million, or 11.8 percent of the city’s $18.62 million in annual revenue, according to budget documents.

Last month, Reason TV highlighted three of the country's most "fee-ridden" cities and pegged Ferguson at number two, but maybe it's time to move it on up to the top spot. Watch the video above and decide for yourself.
