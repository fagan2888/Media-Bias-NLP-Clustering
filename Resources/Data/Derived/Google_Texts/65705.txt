“For me it just makes me proud to see a city that has so much promise actually coming to life.”

Florence county council approved Wednesday morning the incentive to what was once called project cowgirl and is now known as Med-Enroll.

Its a company that will help other companies navigate the Affordable Care Act and in so doing, will bring economic benefits to the people of Florence.

Med-Enroll isn’t just bringing new life to downtown Florence, it’s creating 153 jobs which is a huge opportunity for Francis Marion Students.

Average salaries for these jobs will be close to 60 grand a year with an estimated impact of 75-million dollars.

“Not only can we place our nurses in great hospitals in florence, but we can actually place business students and place engineers and place management students straight into a very well-paying job, straight out of college” Gray said.

And of those new jobs, 30 positions are expected to have salaries at six figures.

Doctor Susan Peters the Director at the Center of Entrepreneurship at Francis Marion thinks this investment is one worthwhile.

“For Francis Marion Students, I think this is a good development that will keep students here in the Pee Dee. We train them here, we raise them here and now they have jobs, they don’t have to go elsewhere.”

Florence Mayor Stephen Wukela said earlier this week that this is just one of many upgrades that will be coming to this area.

“When they are putting so much money into one spot, in florence, it says to me that this is going to be a place that is happening for years to come,” Gray said.

The new jobs are expected to be in tact by December of 2015.
