This is a concerted, radical, dangerous attack that seeks to undermine the very basis of free civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot win a war against radical Islamic terrorism with an administration afraid to utter the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,'\u201d added the Texas lawmaker.\n\nCruz particularly criticized former secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2014 his potential Democratic presidential foe \u2014 for suggesting late last year that the United States should \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cempathize with\u201d its enemies.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need empathy for radical Islamic terrorists,\u201d declared Cruz. \u201cWe need the resolve to stop them.\u201d\n\nCruz also mentioned the threat of a nuclear Iran as one that plagues the U.S. and that Congress and the Obama administration must thwart head-on.\n\nOn the domestic front, the Texas senator and potential GOP presidential candidate emphasized the need for Republicans to pass legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline, repeal Obamacare and get rid of Common Core in 2015.\n\nHe urged Republicans to work \u2014 really work \u2014 to \u201cget things done\u201d in Washington and serve the throngs voters who came out in support of GOP candidates in the November midterm election.\n\n\u201cFor all the Republicans saying \u2018let\u2019s get things done,\u2019 if we simply settle into business as usual in this town \u2026 we will demoralize the millions of men and women who came out in November,\u201d said Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Ted Cruz said Monday that the Charlie Hebdo terror attack and the CENTCOM social media hack should serve as a reminder to the Republican-controlled Congress that it needs to secure the United States border and \"stop the president's unconstitutional amnesty.\"", "title": "Ted Cruz: 'Sad and unfortunate' U.S. didn't send official to Paris...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/01/GOP-2016-Challengers_Chal-600x386.jpg", "height": 386}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/01/12/ted-cruz-sad-unfortunate-u-s-didnt-send-official-paris-march/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "ted-cruz-terrorism", "published_time": "2015-01-12T18:00:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T18:00:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a2e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe don\u2019t need empathy for radical Islamic terrorists,\u201d declared Cruz.\n\u201cPerhaps we should move the White House down to the Rio Grande Valley,\u201d Cruz joked.\nCruz lamented the apparent Islamic terrorist attack, which killed 12 individuals.\nHe also expressed his disappointment at the \u201csad and unfortunate\u201d fact that the U.S. did not send a high ranking official to attend the Paris unity march Sunday, a mistake that the White House \u2014 in a rare moment \u2014 copped to Monday.\nThis is a concerted, radical, dangerous attack that seeks to undermine the very basis of free civilization.\u201d\u201cYou cannot win a war against radical Islamic terrorism with an administration afraid to utter the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,'\u201d added the Texas lawmaker."}
