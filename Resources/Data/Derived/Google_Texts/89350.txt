People who buy insurance through the new state Health Insurance Marketplaces can get various levels of financial help depending on where their household income falls in relation to the current federal poverty level.

• In states that are expanding Medicaid, all households will be enrolled if their income is less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level (in a few states that threshold is a bit higher). In states that are not, households below 100 percent of poverty may be left with no affordable source of health insurance. (But they won’t be fined in that case.)

• In states that are expanding Medicaid, households with incomes between 133 percent and 250 percent of poverty will receive tax credits to lower the cost of premiums, and will also be eligible for plans that have lower out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and copays. In states that aren't expanding Medicaid, households with incomes between 100 percent and 250 percent of poverty will get these types of help.

• In all states, households with incomes between 250 percent and 400 percent of poverty will get the premium tax credits, but not the lowered out-of-pocket costs.
