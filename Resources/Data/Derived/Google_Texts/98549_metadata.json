They aren't afraid to measure their outcomes against other top hospitals and use the Institute of Medicine's guidelines to build quality strategies.\n\nEstablished culture: The best hospitals strive for patient-centered, quality care both during and after a patient's stay. They encourage all staff to listen to patients, prioritize teamwork and empower one another.\n\nContinuous improvement: To improve quality, top hospitals use a variety of models to achieve goals. They report transparency and consistency, identify vulnerabilities within the system and test improvement strategies to close gaps.\n\nFurthermore, from 2010 to 2012, the top 100 hospitals saw a 24.53 percent lower risk-adjusted mortality rate across 19 procedures, compared to other hospitals, according to the announcement. If all U.S. hospitals performed at this level, Healthgrades estimates they potentially could have saved more than 160,000 lives.\n\nLast year, Healthgrades found that patients are far more at risk for complications or death at hospitals receiving low ratings, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the report\n\n- read the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthgrades: increased risk of death or complications at low-rated hospitals\n\nHealthgrades names top clinical hospitals", "article_metadata": {"description": "Top U.S. hospitals have three common reasons for their success, according to\u00a0Healthgrades' latest\u00a0report, which names America's best 50 and 100 hospitals.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Top U.S. hospitals have three common reasons for their success, according to\u00a0Healthgrades' latest\u00a0report, which names America's best 50 and 100 hospitals.", "title": "Heathgrades' best hospitals identify 3 keys to success", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/heathgrades-best-hospitals-identify-3-keys-success/2014-02-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "best hospitals,Care Delivery,HealthGrades,hospital culture,hospital executives,HR & Workforce Management,improvement strategies,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8e5\"", "article_summary": "Top U.S. hospitals have three common reasons for their success, according to Healthgrades' latest report, which names America's best 50 and 100 hospitals.\nFurthermore, from 2010 to 2012, the top 100 hospitals saw a 24.53 percent lower risk-adjusted mortality rate across 19 procedures, compared to other hospitals, according to the announcement.\nEstablished culture: The best hospitals strive for patient-centered, quality care both during and after a patient's stay.\nThey aren't afraid to measure their outcomes against other top hospitals and use the Institute of Medicine's guidelines to build quality strategies.\nLast year, Healthgrades found that patients are far more at risk for complications or death at hospitals receiving low ratings, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
