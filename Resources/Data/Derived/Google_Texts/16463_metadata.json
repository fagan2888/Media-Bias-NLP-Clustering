Not long after that, he was actually using one.\n\nHe got started young with another sort of stick too.\n\n\u201cI played hockey since I was old enough to walk,\u201d Berg said Tuesday at the University of Denver\u2019s Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium.\n\nIn British Columbia, Berg was raised in the Vancouver suburb of Coquitlam, where the lacrosse-hockey double is common, with \u201cbox\u201d lacrosse, the indoor game played on a hockey rink, as the natural middle ground.\n\n\u201cI skated and played hockey my entire life until lacrosse took over,\u201d Berg said. \u201cWhen I played junior (lacrosse) my first year, we went to the national championship and won, and that goes into August. I was 16 or 17, and that\u2019s when you have to decide if you\u2019re going to play junior hockey. I kind of lost interest in competitive hockey then.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d played my first year of midget (hockey), and then I broke my collarbone one year and missed half the season. I just played on a friend\u2019s team and played high school hockey, which is more like a beer league sort of thing. After that, I\u2019d committed to going here for lacrosse, and I haven\u2019t played hockey since. That\u2019s kind of sad, but I might get some more time to play in the future.\u201d\n\nBerg and the Pioneers \u2014 the lacrosse Pioneers, not the hockey Pioneers \u2014 face Notre Dame on Saturday in a Final Four semifinal at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.\n\nIf they win, the Pioneers will play the Johns Hopkins-Maryland winner in the NCAA championship game Monday, and Berg will have a chance to celebrate a national title two weeks before he graduates from DU with a degree in construction management. He probably will join the Denver Outlaws of Major League Lacrosse for the rest of the 2015 season.\n\nBerg will leave DU as the school\u2019s career leader in goals, with 180 in 71 games going into the weekend, and points (247). Last year, he was a member of Canada\u2019s gold medal team in the world championship.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t too many days left of it,\u201d Berg said, \u201cand the last couple of years, it\u2019s been sad watching the seniors go, guys you\u2019ve played with and lived with the last little while. That\u2019s always a sad part of it, but if you win the national championship, that definitely takes the focus off leaving and leaves the excitement of winning.\u201d\n\nBerg came to DU as one of the first recruits to commit after Bill Tierney took over as coach in 2009. He said Tierney \u201cwas kind of in the transition period of coming to Denver when I started to talk to them. \u2026 When I visited here, it was (Tierney\u2019s) first year, and it was another aspect of coming here. You hear a lot about him and what he had done for Princeton, and that was another thing that made me want to come out here.\u201d\n\nBerg\u2019s role initially changed this season after Connor Cannizzaro, who played for Maryland last season as a freshman, transferred to DU and was immediately eligible. The 6-foot-1, 190-pound Berg stepped back from attack to midfield for the first part of the season, but he has been listed at attack \u2014 with Cannizzaro \u2014 since. They have combined for 105 goals, with Cannizzaro getting 55 and Berg 50. And it\u2019s perilous to get too hung up with position labels, because the Pioneers do a lot of interchanging among the six offensive positions.\n\n\u201cI think we have great chemistry,\u201d Berg said. \u201cHe\u2019s a nightmare to cover behind the net, and there\u2019s no defender in the league that can really match feet with him. With him doing that, he can either go to the net or if they slide to him early, I\u2019m good at slipping into the middle and kind of tapping in empty netters or finding a soft spot from outside. He\u2019s got great vision and finds me.\u201d\n\nBerg also played midfield earlier in his DU career.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice at midfield. A lot of times you have a short stick on you, and it\u2019s just a different aspect,\u201d he said of the four-stick limitation on \u201clong poles\u201d in NCAA lacrosse. \u201cYou\u2019re dodging downhill, and as attack you\u2019re slipping and delaying, dodging from behind the net. I\u2019ve always liked playing both, changing it up and keeping it exciting.\u201d\n\nWhen Connor Cannizzaro signaled his hope to leave Maryland and join his older brother, Sean, in the DU program, Tierney ran it by Berg.\n\n\u201cI went to Wesley first,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cHe\u2019s our leader. When he said to me, \u2018Coach, Connor\u2019s a great player, a great kid. I just want to win, it\u2019ll all work out,\u2019 that to me validated all the other things we do.\n\n\u201cLook, young men are young men. You have your highest scorer, your All-American, your Tewaaraton (lacrosse\u2019s Heisman-type award) candidate, your Canadian World Games team member, he could have easily said to me, \u2018You know what, Coach, we have it good the way we have it, let\u2019s pass on this one.\u2019 And I would have. Thank God he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nBerg file\n\nA look at the career of University of Denver lacrosse player Wesley Berg:\n\nYear Goals Assists Points 2012 26 11 37 2013 56 16 72 2014 48 20 68 2015 50 20 70 Totals 180 67 247 Source: DU\n\nFinal four semifinals\n\nDenver vs. Notre Dame\n\nLincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, 11 a.m. MDT on Saturday; ESPN2\n\nDENVER\n\nNational seed: No. 4 Record: 15-2, 4-0 Big East\n\nQuarterfinal result: Denver 15, Ohio State 13, at Sports Authority Field at Mile High\n\nNOTRE DAME\n\nNational seed: No. 1 Record: 12-2, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference\n\nQuarterfinal result: Notre Dame 14, Albany (N.Y.) 10, at Sports Authority Field at Mile High\n\nPrevious meeting: Denver 11, Notre Dame 10, overtime, March 7 at DU\u2019s Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium\n\nUSILA coaches poll (May 4): Notre Dame ranked second, Denver third.
