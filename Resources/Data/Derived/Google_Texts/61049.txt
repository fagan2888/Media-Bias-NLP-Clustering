Ted Nugent, who has earned a reputation as a racist after calling President Obama a “chimpanzee” and mocking “unclean dipshit Native Americans” for cancelling his shows, is now a dues paying member of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA).

In a Facebook message to his followers yesterday, the self-professed “Motor City Madman” wrote:

The CONSTITUTIONAL SHERIFF’S and POLICEMEN ORGANIZATION OF AMERICA is a great patriotic group of which I am proud to be a life member, and would be great for all good Americans to join. This hardcore org is not just for law enforcement but for concerned citizens as well. Afterall WE THE PEOPLE are supposed to be in charge of America, NOT our elected officials as it has deteriorated into. In these horrific times of rampant asbuse of power & criminal corruption at the very top, I can think of no better way for WE THE PEOPLE to make the ultimate DON’T TREAD ON ME statement to those in power. It is time for WE THE PEOPLE to take back our constitutionally guaranteed power.
