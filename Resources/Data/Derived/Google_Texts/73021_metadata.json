Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Committee, argued that their approach offered genuine relief to small financial institutions that were not the original target of Dodd-Frank, as opposed to Republicans, which she said wanted to help big banks under the guise of aiding the little guy.\n\nBrown and Waters are among the more liberal voices on financial regulation among Democrats, but they were joined by a pair of more moderate lawmakers who also threw their support behind the measure: Sen.

John Carney (D-Del.).\n\n\u201cOur legislation fine-tunes Dodd Frank so it works as intended,\u201d said Carney.\n\nThe details of the legislation are largely similar to an amendment Senate Democrats proposed to a bill offered by Banking Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), as well as measures already passed by the House. Most of its provisions are aimed at providing modest relief to smaller institutions by, for example, subjecting them to fewer regulator examinations.\n\nEven though Dodd-Frank is largely finished, the fight over the 2010 law still breaks strongly down partisan lines. Democrats have resisted nearly every effort by Republicans to advance significant changes to the 2010 law, arguing that GOP proposals are aimed primarily at defanging the law, rather than improving it.\n\nIn May, the Senate Banking Committee passed Shelby\u2019s legislation down a strict party line vote, and the White House has regularly threatened to veto GOP bills passed by the House that would change Dodd-Frank.\n\nShelby has said he is prepared to continue discussing ways to revisit the law, so now the relevant Democrats in the debate are presenting a unanimous front advocating for a handful of modest changes to that landmark law.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Key Democrats have unanimously agreed to set a modest tweaks to the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, in an effort to build momentum for their plan over various, more dramatic GOP proposals.", "description": "Key Democrats have unanimously agreed to set a modest tweaks to the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, in an effort to build momentum for their plan over various, more dramatic GOP proposals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Key Democrats have unanimously agreed to set a modest tweaks to the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, in an effort to build momentum for their plan over various, more dramatic GOP proposals.", "title": "Democrats line up behind targeted Dodd-Frank tweaks", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/243924-democrats-line-up-behind-targeted-dodd-frank-tweaks", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/243924-democrats-line-up-behind-targeted-dodd-frank-tweaks", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-03T15:41-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Schroeder", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Richard Shelby, United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States federal banking legislation, Wall Street reform,Heidi Heitkamp, Sherrod Brown,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-03T15:41:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/243924-democrats-line-up-behind-targeted-dodd-frank-tweaks", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Key Democrats have unanimously agreed to set a modest tweaks to the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, in an effort to build momentum for their plan over various, more dramatic GOP proposals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Democrats line up behind targeted Dodd-Frank tweaks"}, "dcterms.title": "Democrats line up behind targeted Dodd-Frank tweaks"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cfc\"", "article_summary": "Key Democrats have unanimously agreed to set a modest tweaks to the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, in an effort to build momentum for their plan over various, more dramatic GOP proposals.\nOn Wednesday, top Democrats on the Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees introduced legislation that would make several targeted changes to existing financial rules, and announced that every Democrat on both committees was supportive of the proposal.\nIn May, the Senate Banking Committee passed Shelby\u2019s legislation down a strict party line vote, and the White House has regularly threatened to veto GOP bills passed by the House that would change Dodd-Frank.\nEven though Dodd-Frank is largely finished, the fight over the 2010 law still breaks strongly down partisan lines.\nADVERTISEMENTAs the two parties have duked it out over the future of Dodd-Frank, Democrats are hoping a unified approach can lend heft to their effort to keep the law largely intact, while making small changes to help small banks and credit unions."}
