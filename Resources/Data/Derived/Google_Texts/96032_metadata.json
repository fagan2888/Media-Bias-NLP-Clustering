Leading payday lender Wonga (above) has the highest default fees at \u00a330\n\nHowever, ten of 17 leading payday lenders have default fees of \u00a320 or more, and four charged \u00a325 and above, with Wonga topping the table at \u00a330.\n\nLegal experts at the consumer group Which? claim the penalty charges imposed by many of the firms are excessive and therefore illegal.\n\nIt has written to the highest charging firms warning them that its legal advice is that the fees are unlawful under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (UTCCRs).\n\nHigh charges are one of the biggest factors that tip borrowers into a spiral of debt with small loans suddenly ballooning in size.\n\n\n\nConcern: High charges are one of the biggest factors that tip borrowers into a spiral of debt (file picture)\n\nPrevious Which? research has found that more than half of payday loan users \u2013 56per cent - had incurred charges for missed or bounced credit repayments over 12 months.\n\nOne in five said they had been hit with \u2018unexpected charges\u2019.\n\nIn 2006, the Office of Fair Trading found that penalty charges for credit cards should be no more than \u00a312, unless there are exceptional factors.\n\nWhich? has been calling for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to introduce a cap on the level that firms can charge in default fees, as part of plan to put a cap on the total cost of credit from January 2015.\n\nAccusation: Which? Executive director Richard Lloyd, said: 'We believe payday lenders are exploiting borrowers with excessive fees'\n\nResearch by the organisation found that half \u2013 48per cent - of payday loan users took out credit it turned out they could not afford to repay.\n\nE xecutive director at the group, Richard Lloyd, said: \u2018We believe payday lenders are exploiting borrowers with excessive fees which can push them even further into debt.\n\n\u2018If they cannot justify why these charges are so high and refuse to cut them, we would look to take further steps to protect vulnerable consumers.\n\nThe regulator must also take action to ensure all fees are fair, proportionate and only reflect lenders\u2019 costs.\u2019\n\nWhich? recently launched its \u2018Clean up Credit\u2019 campaign which calls for the FCA to clamp down on excessive charges and irresponsible lending, and to make sure borrowers are being treated fairly whatever form of credit they\u2019re using.\n\nWonga said its \u00a330 penalty fee has been independently assessed by outside business consultants as a fair reflection of its admin costs.\n\nA spokesman said: \u2018We charge a one-off default fee of \u00a330 on late repayments that reflects the additional costs we incur in collecting these loans. This charge has been independently assessed as reflecting these expenses.\n\n\u2018As with all our costs, we are completely transparent about our default fee and it\u2019s clear to customers when they apply for a loan, and at least three further times before their repayment date.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Penalty,charges,30,missing,repayments,payday,loans,illegal", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2538357/Penalty-charges-30-missing-repayments-payday-loans-illegal.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Ten of 17 leading payday lenders have default fees of \u00a320 or more, and four charged \u00a325 and above, with Wonga topping the table at \u00a330.", "title": "Penalty charges of up to \u00a330 for missing repayments on payday loans 'are illegal'", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2538357/Penalty-charges-30-missing-repayments-payday-loans-illegal.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/13/article-2538357-130AF872000005DC-938_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2538357, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Penalty,charges,30,missing,repayments,payday,loans,illegal", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-01-13T01:30:49.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Sean+Poulter,+Consumer+Affairs+Editor", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-01-13T01:35:56.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Penalty charges 30 missing repayments payday loans illegal"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Ten of 17 leading payday lenders have default fees of \u00a320 or more, and four charged \u00a325 and above, with Wonga topping the table at \u00a330.", "title": "Penalty charges of up to \u00a330 for missing repayments on payday loans 'are illegal'", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2538357/Penalty-charges-30-missing-repayments-payday-loans-illegal.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/13/article-2538357-130AF872000005DC-938_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Ten of 17 leading payday lenders have default fees of \u00a320 or more, and four charged \u00a325 and above, with Wonga topping the table at \u00a330."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfaad\"", "article_summary": "'Illegal' charges: Rip-off penalty charges imposed by payday loan giants on borrowers who miss a repayment may be illegal, it has emerged.\nPenalty charges of up to \u00a330 for missing repayments on payday loans 'are illegal'Rip-off penalty charges on payday loans are 'illegal', it has been revealedThey should reflect the actual administration cost of pursuing paymentMost leading lenders, including Wonga, have default fees of \u00a320 or moreRip-off penalty charges imposed by payday loan giants on borrowers who miss a repayment may be illegal, it has emerged.\nclaim the penalty charges imposed by many of the firms are excessive and therefore illegal.\nLeading payday lender Wonga (above) has the highest default fees at \u00a330However, ten of 17 leading payday lenders have default fees of \u00a320 or more, and four charged \u00a325 and above, with Wonga topping the table at \u00a330.\nA maximum figure of \u00a312 is used by some payday loan companies and most credit card firms."}
