The Southern Poverty Law Center has placed likely GOP 2016 presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson on its “extremist watch list,” citing the neurosurgeon’s “anti-LGBT” views.

According to the SPLC’s profile of Carson, after rising to prominence in 2013, he began speaking to “right-wing and hate group gatherings” where he would link gay people with “pedophiles.” The SPLC also says Carson compares the U.S. to Nazi Germany and “endorses biblical economic practices for 21st century America.”

To substantiate these claims, the SPLC cited some of Carson’s remarks during speeches and media appearances. This includes his October 2013 speech to the Values Voter Summit in which he said Obamacare is “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,” and numerous quotes about his support for traditional marriage — notably, the following passage from Carson’s book, America the Beautiful:

“[I]f we can redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures as opposed to between a man and a woman, we will continue to redefine it in any way that we wish, which is a slippery slope with a disastrous ending, as witnessed in the dramatic fall of the Roman Empire.”

The “extremist watch list” includes neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
