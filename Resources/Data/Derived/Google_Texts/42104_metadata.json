The district also wants to see a 20 percent decrease in emissions.\n\nRefineries would have to compile a profile of all emissions over one year.\n\nFrom the Bay Area News Group:\n\nPolitical pressure for the tougher rules mounted after a 2012 fire at Chevron\u2019s Richmond oil refinery sent thousands to hospitals with eye, throat and lung irritation. With the new proposals, clean air regulators say they want a more holistic approach that goes further than existing rules and permits aimed at reducing pollution from specific types of boilers, towers, other equipment and manufacturing processes.\n\nAir district Rule Manager Greg Nudd said the proposal \u201cgoes beyond what we traditionally include in the emissions inventories for the refineries to include things like emissions from things like ships, trains, and trucks that bring in crude and take product out.\u201d\n\nThe rules would put air monitors in the communities around refineries. And they would require refineries not to exceed baseline levels for certain pollutants that can affect public health.\n\nThe rules would affect the Chevron, Shell, Tesoro, Phillips 66 and Valero refineries.\n\nThe Western Petroleum States Association opposes the 20-percent-reduction goal. From Richmond Confidential last fall:\n\nGuy Bjerke, spokesman for WSPA (objected) to the resolution, saying the emission cap will affect the current collaborations between the refineries and the district on laying down the rules for tracking refineries\u2019 emissions, reporting the contents of crude oil, and assessing any related health risks. \u201cJust working on these will take a lot of dollars and a lot of time,\u201d Bjerke said.\n\nMeanwhile, Andres Soto of Communities for a Better Environment, told BANG the rules are too weak: \u201cWe are very disappointed with the staff proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe community suffers asthma, increased cancer risk and other problems from this pollution.\u201d\n\nYou can read the air tracking and emissions mitigation rules at the BAAQMD site.\n\nHere are the upcoming meetings this week. Occupy Oakland, among other groups, is advocating for strong rules.\n\nBenicia\n\nMonday, March 16, 5:30 PM \u2013 7:00 PM\n\nBenicia Senior Center\n\n187 East L Street\n\nRichmond\n\nTuesday, March 17, 5:30 PM \u2013 7:00 PM\n\nMadeline F Whittlesey Community Room\n\nRichmond Public Library 25 Civic Center Plaza\n\nMartinez\n\nWednesday, March 18, 5:30 PM \u2013 7:00 PM\n\nContra Costa County Chambers\n\n651 Pine Street\n\nSan Francisco\n\nFriday, March 20, 2015 10:30 AM \u2013 Noon\n\nAir District Board Room, 7th Floor\n\n939 Ellis Street", "article_metadata": {"description": "2012 Chevron Refinery fire as seen from the Berkeley Hills.
