In addition to hindering conception, obesity \u2014 defined as a body mass index above 30 \u2014 is linked to a host of difficulties during pregnancy, labor and delivery.\n\nThese range from gestational diabetes, hypertension and pre-eclampsia to miscarriage, premature birth, emergency cesarean delivery and stillbirth.\n\nThe infants of obese women are more likely to have congenital defects, and they are at greater risk of dying at or soon after birth. Babies who survive are more likely to develop hypertension and obesity as adults.\n\nTo be sure, most babies born to overweight and obese women are healthy. Yet a recently published analysis of 38 studies found that even modest increases in a woman\u2019s pre-pregnancy weight raised the risks of fetal death, stillbirth and infant death.\n\nPersonal biases and concerns about professional liability lead some obstetricians to avoid obese patients. But Dr. Sigal Klipstein, chairwoman of the committee on ethics of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says it is time for doctors to push aside prejudice\n\nand fear. They must take more positive steps to treat obese women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant.\n\nKlipstein and her colleagues recently issued a report on ethical issues in caring for obese women. Obesity is commonly viewed as a personal failing that can be prevented or reversed through motivation and willpower. But the facts suggest otherwise.\n\nAlthough some people manage to shed as much as 100 pounds and keep them off without surgery, many obese patients say they\u2019ve tried everything, and nothing has worked.\n\n\u201cMost obese women are not intentionally overeating or eating the wrong foods,\u201d Klipstein said. \u201cObstetricians should address the problem, not abandon patients because they think they\u2019re doing something wrong.\u201d\n\nKlipstein is a reproductive endocrinologist at InVia Fertility Specialists in Northbrook, Illinois. In her experience, the women who manage to lose weight are usually highly motivated and use a commercial diet plan.\n\n\u201cBut many fail even though they are very anxious to get pregnant and have a healthy pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the new reality, and obstetricians have to be aware of that and know how to treat patients with weight issues.\u201d\n\nThe committee report emphasizes that \u201cobese patients should not be viewed differently from other patient populations that require additional care or who have increased risks of adverse medical outcomes.\u201d\n\nObese patients should be cared for \u201cin a nonjudgmental manner,\u201d it says, adding that it is unethical for doctors to refuse care within the scope of their expertise \u201csolely because the patient is obese.\u201d\n\nObstetricians should discuss the medical risks associated with obesity and \u201cavoid blaming the patient for her increased weight,\u201d the committee says. Any doctor who feels unable to provide effective care for an obese patient should seek a consultation or refer the woman to another doctor.\n\nWhat women can do\n\nObesity rates are highest among women \u201cof lower socioeconomic status,\u201d the report notes, and many obese women lack \u201caccess to healthy food choices and opportunities for regular exercise that would help them maintain a normal weight.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, obese women who want to have a baby should not abandon all efforts to lose weight. Obstetricians who lack expertise in weight management can refer patients to dietitians who specialize in treating weight problems without relying on gimmicks or crash diets, which have their own health risks.\n\nWeight loss is best attempted before a pregnancy. Last year, the college\u2019s committee on obstetric practice advised obstetricians to \u201cprovide education about possible complications and encourage obese patients to undertake a weight-reduction program, including diet, exercise, and behavior modification, before attempting pregnancy.\u201d\n\nAn obese woman who becomes pregnant should aim to gain less weight than would a normal-weight woman. The Institute of Medicine suggests a pregnancy weight gain of 15 to 25 pounds for overweight women and 11 to 20 pounds for obese women.\n\nAlthough women should not to try to lose weight during pregnancy, \u201ca woman who weighs 300 pounds shouldn\u2019t gain at all,\u201d Klipstein said. \u201cThis is not harmful to the fetus.\u201d\n\nKlipstein also noted that obesity can cause physiological changes that can negatively affect pregnancy, starting with irregular ovulation that can result in infertility.\n\nObese women are more likely to have problems processing blood sugar, which raises the risk of birth defects and miscarriage. There is also a greater likelihood that their babies will be too large for vaginal delivery, necessitating a cesarean delivery that has its own risks involving anesthesia and surgery.\n\nThe babies of obese women are more likely to develop neural tube defects \u2014 spina bifida and anencephaly \u2014 and to suffer birth injuries like shoulder dystocia, which may occur when the infant is very large.\n\nHigh blood pressure, more common in obesity, can result in pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, which can damage the mother\u2019s kidneys and cause fetal complications like low birth weight, prematurity and stillbirth.\n\nIt is also harder to obtain reliable images on a sonogram when the woman is obese. This can delay detection of fetal or pregnancy abnormalities that require careful monitoring or medical intervention.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/hfbrody15a.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeed2\"", "article_summary": "They must take more positive steps to treat obese women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant.\nThe Institute of Medicine suggests a pregnancy weight gain of 15 to 25 pounds for overweight women and 11 to 20 pounds for obese women.\nKlipstein and her colleagues recently issued a report on ethical issues in caring for obese women.\nTo be sure, most babies born to overweight and obese women are healthy.\n\u201cMost obese women are not intentionally overeating or eating the wrong foods,\u201d Klipstein said."}
