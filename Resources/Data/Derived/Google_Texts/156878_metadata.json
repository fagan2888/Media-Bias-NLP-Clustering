David Schaffner III voluntarily turned himself in to school authorities while at a football game, after he realized he\u2019d kept his pocketknife after hunting. Instead of rewarding him for his honesty or at least mitigating the punishment somewhat, the school gave him the same punishment it would give a student who tried to sneak a weapon into a school event:\n\nThere is no metal detector, no bag check there, but Schaffner grabbed a security guard.\n\n\u201cIntentionally, willfully handed the pocket knife,\u201d he said.\n\nHe even voluntarily wrote out and signed a statement, saying:\n\n\u201cI was in the woods behind my house at my tree stand and forgot to take my knife out of my pocket \u2026 came to the game and gave it to the security guard.\u201d\n\nWith that, the Fox Chapel principal kicked him out of the game and then early Monday morning kicked him out of school for 10 days.\n\nSchaffner says the punishment sends a horrible message.\n\n\u201cTo me it sends a message, you should probably lie, \u2018cause you\u2019re going to get punished,\u201d he said.\n\nNow the family has to hire a lawyer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Video: Student suspended for 10 days after accidentally carrying pocketknife to school", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "The kicker?
