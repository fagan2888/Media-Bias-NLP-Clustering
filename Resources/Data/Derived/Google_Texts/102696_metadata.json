Clippers owner Steve Ballmer has joined other billionaires and millionaires in donating money to push a gun control initiative in Washington state, which will expand firearm background checks to online purchases and gun shows.\n\nBut online sales from any retail store anywhere in the country already require a background check.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to Bloomberg.com, \u201cBallmer and his wife gave $580,000\u201d to the initiative. In so doing they took their place along side a myriad of other uber-wealthy donors who spend money in hopes of securing the kind of gun control the state\u2019s legislature wouldn\u2019t pass.\n\nOther donors include Bill and Melinda Gates, who gave $50,000; Jon Shirley, who gave $50,000; Nicolas Hanauer, who gave $385,000; and Rich Barton, who gave $42,500.\n\nBarton told Bloomberg.com that financial support for more gun control made sense: \u201cIt\u2019s blindingly obvious that everyone who buys a gun ought to get a background check.\u201d\n\nElliot Rodger (Santa Barbara gunman), Ivan Lopez (Ft. Hood gunman 2014), Aaron Alexis (DC Navy Yard gunman), James Holmes (Aurora theater gunman), and Nidal Hasan (Ft. Hood gunman 2009) all got a background check for their gun purchases, but that did not prevent their crimes.\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
