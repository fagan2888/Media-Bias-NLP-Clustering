Joe Manchin (D-WV) says people should not be penalized for failing to sign up for healthcare insurance if the enrollment system does not work properly.\n\nFile Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV)\n\nManchin said that is why he is working with Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) on a proposal to delay for one year the penalties created in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cOne year, it should be a one-year transition (with) no fines at all,\u201d he said of the proposal on Thursday\u2019s MetroNews \u201cTalkline\u201d with Hoppy Kercheval. \u201cOne year in transitioning into this law, trying to fix and repair the parts that are fixable and identifying those that might not be fixable.\u201d\n\nWith the Manchin-Isakson proposal, the individual mandate would still take effect in January as scheduled.\n\nIt would be January 2015, though, before penalties for not having health insurance would take effect at the already established second year rates.\n\n\u201cYou have to give it an effort to try to repair things, rather just throwing everything out, the way people have done,\u201d said Manchin.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) is working on an alternative proposal that would push back the individual mandate, the requirement that people have health insurance or pay penalties starting in the New Year. Manchin said he aims to meet with Rubio next week to discuss the differences in their proposals.\n\nOn Capitol Hill Thursday, the contractors who built the problem-plagued healthcare.gov website\u2014including CGI Federal\u2014went before members of U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThose contractors testified confusion between companies and heavy website traffic have continued to bog down the portal for enrollment for coverage through the federal exchanges. West Virginia is one of more than 30 states participating in those federally run health insurance marketplaces.\n\nCheryl Campbell, CGI\u2019s senior vice president, said the Obama Administration bears the responsibility for the continued problems as the \u201csystems integrator or quarterback on this project.\u201d\n\nU.S. Health and Human Resources Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is scheduled to testify in front of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee next week.\n\nManchin said the Affordable Care Act should do what it claims to do. \u201cNobody should be made to buy insurance that\u2019s inferior to what they already have or costs more than what they already have. That\u2019s not affordable health care,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the penalties are delayed, Manchin said he\u2019ll be working to address three questions in the coming year. \u201cIs it affordable to people that have never been able to buy it before? Are we keeping people healthy? Are we driving down the costs of health care?\u201d\n\nThe open enrollment period continues through March 31. To avoid penalties, White House officials said individuals who do not have health insurance will have to have it by then.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He says people should not be punished because the enrollment system is broken and they cannot buy health insurance.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "He says people should not be punished because the enrollment system is broken and they cannot buy health insurance.", "title": "Manchin proposes 1-year delay for Affordable Care Act penalties", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2013/10/24/manchin-proposes-one-year-delay-for-affordable-care-act-penalties/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/U.S.-Capitol-Dome.jpg", "height": 345}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/U.S.-Capitol-Dome.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-24T14:53:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-24T17:32:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d47\"", "article_summary": "To avoid penalties, White House officials said individuals who do not have health insurance will have to have it by then.\nWest Virginia is one of more than 30 states participating in those federally run health insurance marketplaces.\nThat\u2019s not affordable health care,\u201d he said.\nIt would be January 2015, though, before penalties for not having health insurance would take effect at the already established second year rates.\nFile Sen.
