(AP) - Quarterback Cam Newton was troubled by what he said he heard from referee Ed Hochuli during the Carolina Panthers\u2019 27-22 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.\n\nNewton was upset over what he felt was a borderline late hit by Saints defensive tackle Tyeler Davison - but was even more baffled by the explanation he said he received from Hochuli.\n\nAfter taking a hit near the sideline as he released the ball, Newton got up looking for a flag and turned toward Hochuli for explanation. The referee said something to the quarterback and Newton stopped in his tracks and looked back and laughed in disbelief.\n\n\u201cThe response that I got was, \u2018Cam you\u2019re not old enough to get that call,\u2019\u201d Newton said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m looking at him like, \u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u201cGeez, I didn\u2019t think you had to have seniority to get a personal foul or anything like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nNFL spokesman Michael Signora told The Associated Press that \u201cofficials make decisions based upon the play on the field, and no other factors.\u201d\n\nSignora added: \u201cOn the play in question, there is no roughing the passer because the quarterback is out of the pocket and a runner, and no unnecessary roughness because the contact is not late.\u201d\n\nNewton, now in his fifth season, said it is frustrating when other quarterbacks get similar calls to go their way.\n\n\u201cHeaven forbid he gets any rookies - they\u2019re going to have a long day, man,\u201d Newton said.\n\nHochuli had left the stadium before Newton\u2019s postgame remarks and was unavailable for comment.\n\nNewton threw for 315 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score as Carolina improved to 3-0 on the season for the first time since 2003, the only season the Panthers have been to the Super Bowl.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Quarterback Cam Newton was troubled by what he said he heard from referee Ed Hochuli during the Carolina Panthers' 27-22 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Quarterback Cam Newton was troubled by what he said he heard from referee Ed Hochuli during the Carolina Panthers\u2019 27-22 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.", "title": "Newton says Hochuli told him: \u2018Not old enough\u2019 to get call", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/27/newton-says-hochuli-told-him-not-old-enough-to-get/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/27/3d81112277a53a2b830f6a706700c9aa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/27/3d81112277a53a2b830f6a706700c9aa.jpg", "description": "Quarterback Cam Newton was troubled by what he said he heard from referee Ed Hochuli during the Carolina Panthers' 27-22 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Newton says Hochuli told him: \u2018Not old enough\u2019 to get call"}, "Author": "STEVE REED", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b0c\"", "article_summary": "After taking a hit near the sideline as he released the ball, Newton got up looking for a flag and turned toward Hochuli for explanation.\n\u201cThe response that I got was, \u2018Cam you\u2019re not old enough to get that call,\u2019\u201d Newton said after the game.\nThe referee said something to the quarterback and Newton stopped in his tracks and looked back and laughed in disbelief.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C.
