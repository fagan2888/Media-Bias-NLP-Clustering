In the course of its investigation of Operation Choke Point, the committee has learned that federal regulators are pressuring banks to terminate relationships with legal yet disfavored industries, without regard to the legitimacy or risk profile of individual companies.\n\nIssa and Jordan\u2019s requests for documents follow demands to Attorney General Eric Holder and the Justice Department for information about the agency\u2019s secretive operation, in recent letters sent by Republicans in the House and Senate.\n\nAn editorial Oct. 10 in the New York Times defended the controversial actions taken by the Justice Department and federal regulators against industries that are out of favor with the Obama administration.\n\n>>> Commentary: How Operation Choke Point Undermines Rule of Law, Harms Economy\n\nNorbert Michel, an expert in financial regulations at The Heritage Foundation, said the newspaper was wrong in its assessment of Operation Choke Point on \u201cmany levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, third-party payment processors are usually liable for fraud-related chargebacks, so there is a built-in incentive to only sign up legitimate merchants,\u201d Michel said, adding:\n\nIt\u2019s true that every single person does not follow the law, but the notion that banks commonly flout federal regulations is absurd. Regardless, the FDIC letter released today is crystal clear. The FDIC openly acknowledged they initiated a compliance investigation for one reason: The bank was processing payments on behalf of payday lenders. It even admits disdain for payday loans.\n\nIn the House panel\u2019s letters to Yellen and Curry, they request material about Choke Point \u201cas soon as possible, but no later than 5 p.m. on October 30.\u201d\n\nFDIC Regional Director Letter", "article_metadata": {"description": "A House committee today released a letter showing government regulators pressuring an Ohio bank to terminate all relationships with payday lenders.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A House committee today released a letter showing government regulators pressuring an Ohio bank to terminate all relationships with payday lenders.", "title": "This Document Proves Operation Choke Point Exists (If You Had Any Doubt)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalive395835.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-28T09:45:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/ZynvDY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A House committee today released a letter showing government regulators pressuring an Ohio bank to terminate all relationships with payday lenders.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalive395835.jpg"}, "title": "This Document Proves Operation Choke Point Exists (If You Had Any Doubt)", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive ovvereach,executive power,regulation", "published_time": "2014-10-17T18:01:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-28T09:45:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "choke point, operation choke point, FDIC, yellen, fdic choke point, eric holder choke point, sen crapo, choke point letter, choke point nyt, OCP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c69\"", "article_summary": "Regardless, the FDIC letter released today is crystal clear.\nIn the course of its investigation of Operation Choke Point, the committee has learned that federal regulators are pressuring banks to terminate relationships with legal yet disfavored industries, without regard to the legitimacy or risk profile of individual companies.\nIn the House panel\u2019s letters to Yellen and Curry, they request material about Choke Point \u201cas soon as possible, but no later than 5 p.m. on October 30.\u201dFDIC Regional Director Letter\nAccording to a May 29 report by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which released the letter, the FDIC is one of the main regulatory agencies involved in executing the Department of Justice-coordinated initiative known as Operation Choke Point.\nA House committee today released a letter showing government regulators pressuring an Ohio bank to terminate all relationships with payday lenders."}
