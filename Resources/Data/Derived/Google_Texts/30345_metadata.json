Samm Newman, 19, like many other individuals today, regularly exercised this right up until she received a notice that her account had been discontinued. The teen believes the real reason for her account\u2019s deletion has more to do with discrimination of her size-24 figure and less to do with the company's \"occasional mistake.\"\n\nSize Discrimination?\n\nNewman uploaded many photos of herself onto the photo-sharing smartphone app, but it\u2019s a particular photo of her wearing nothing but a bra and a pair of boy shorts that caused her account to be taken down, Nbc4i reported. Instagram claimed her account was removed because she violated the company\u2019s rule on \u201cwhat not to do\u201d by sharing photos that showed nudity or mature content. Newman calls this size discrimination, claiming that she was targeted for her plus-size waistline. \u201cI didn't find them or the bra at all inappropriate. They covered me entirely and I've seen pictures like that all over Instagram,\u201d Newman explained to Nbc4i.\n\nSamm Newman is confident with her body size and regularly post pictures showing off her figure to her Instagram account. photo courtesy of NBC4I screenshot Photo courtesy of NBC4I screenshot\n\nInstagram: 'We Made A Mistake'\n\nInstagram has since reinstated Newman\u2019s account and apologized for what they referred to as \u201ca mistake,\u201d and \u201cwrongly removed content.\u201d Instagram told NBC4 they are currently \u201clooking into\u201d why Newman\u2019s account was removed but have still not provided an exact reason. Still, only half the battle is over for Newman, who hopes to raise awareness on fat-shaming and size discrimination. \u201cFat is not a bad word,\u201d she told NBC. \u201cHow confident can you be if you keep censoring yourself because people don\u2019t want to look at you? I\u2019m going to make a difference in the world, regardless of whether Instagram cooperates or not.\u201d\n\nFat-Shaming Happens On An Average Of Three Times Every Day\n\nA study from Western New England University found that overweight or obese women get fat-shamed an average of three times per day, the Daily Mail reported. A total of 1,077 overweight and obese women were asked to keep a daily diary for a week; 74 percent recorded hearing nasty comments from others, 72 percent wrote of being stared at, and an unsettling 12 percent recorded they were physically attacked. \u201cTeenagers made animal sounds outside the store,\u201d wrote one of the volunteers, while another explained how \u201cthe dentist was worried I might break his chair.\u201d According to the study, \u201cEmerging data indicate that weight stigma may have negative health consequences such as binge eating, reduced weight loss success, and diminished personal exercise and dietary health.\u201d\n\nNBC4: Columbus, Ohio News, Weather, and Sports (WCMH-TV)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "overweight, teen, believes, her, instagram, account, was, temporarily, removed, because, size", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Nineteen-year-old Samm Newman believes that Instagram's temporary deletion of her account was not a mistake but a case of size-discrimination.", "title": "Did Instagram Delete This Teen\u2019s Account Because She Was Too Fat?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/overweight-teen-believes-her-instagram-account-was-temporarily-removed-because-size-discrimination", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/fat-shaming.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nineteen-year-old Samm Newman believes that Instagram's temporary deletion of her account was not a mistake but a case of size-discrimination.", "title": "Did Instagram Delete This Teen\u2019s Account Because She Was Too Fat?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/overweight-teen-believes-her-instagram-account-was-temporarily-removed-because-size-discrimination", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/fat-shaming.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/16/fat-shaming.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-16T14:11:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T14:11:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Nineteen-year-old Samm Newman believes that Instagram's temporary deletion of her account was not a mistake but a case of size-discrimination."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb865\"", "article_summary": "Size Discrimination?\nSamm Newman is confident with her body size and regularly post pictures showing off her figure to her Instagram account.\nStill, only half the battle is over for Newman, who hopes to raise awareness on fat-shaming and size discrimination.\nNewman calls this size discrimination, claiming that she was targeted for her plus-size waistline.\nThey covered me entirely and I've seen pictures like that all over Instagram,\u201d Newman explained to Nbc4i."}
