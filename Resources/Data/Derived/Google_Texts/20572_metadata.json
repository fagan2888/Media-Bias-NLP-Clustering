It was not the leap forward new general manager Jeff Bridich envisioned when he was named to replace Dan O\u2019Dowd last October.\n\nThe season was not without drama. Third baseman Nolan Arenado, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and second baseman DJ LeMahieu made the National League all-star team. Then, near the trade deadline, Bridich traded Tulowitzki to the Toronto Blue Jays in a blockbuster deal.\n\nThat trade signaled a dramatic change of direction at 20th and Blake, but it didn\u2019t change the Rockies\u2019 fortunes.\n\nHere is a glimpse back and a look forward as Bridich attempts to revive a franchise where 90-plus losses have become the norm.\n\nPitching predicament\n\nTulowitzki, along with veteran reliever LaTroy Hawkins, was traded to acquire pitching prospects, although the Rockies had to accept high-priced veteran shortstop Jose Reyes as part of the deal. The Rockies received right-handers Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro and Jesus Tinoco from the Blue Jays.\n\nHow they perform will determine whether Bridich made a smart move.\n\nLeft-hander Jorge De La Rosa and emerging right-hander Chad Bettis are expected to anchor the rotation in 2016, and the Rockies have high hopes for the development of rookie right-hander Jon Gray.\n\nBut frustrated Rockies veterans such as Carlos Gonzalez and Arenado say the Rockies will never turn things around until the club adds a veteran, front-line starter to its rotation, either through free agency or a trade. The Rockies again had the worst ERA in baseball.\n\nBridich\u2019s take: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any of the market play out yet (for a pitcher), or even begin to, so it\u2019s a tough question to answer. I think there are \u2014 in terms of our depth \u2014 internal answers that we are very hopeful we\u2019re going to have, next year.\u201d\n\nTelling numbers: 7-13 record, 6.32 ERA and 33 homers allowed for Kyle Kendrick, who signed a one-year, $5.5 million deal as Colorado\u2019s No. 1 pitching acquisition during the offseason.\n\nReyes in play\n\nThere was speculation by much of the media that the Rockies would quickly trade Reyes after he was acquired from the Blue Jays. It didn\u2019t happen, and Reyes became Colorado\u2019s starting shortstop \u201cfor the foreseeable\u201d future, as manager Walt Weiss said. Still, the Rockies might try to move him in the offseason. Reyes lacks Tulowitzki\u2019s power and range, and his offensive skills have declined noticeably in recent years.\n\nBridich\u2019s take: \u201cBased on how the trade happened and the finality of it, we are excited to have Jose, because he\u2019s an established veteran and there are a lot of things we like about his game. \u2026 Moving forward we plan on him being here. Having depth at key positions is important, obviously.\u201d\n\nTelling number: $44 million owed to Reyes over the next two seasons, making him the club\u2019s highest-paid player.\n\nCarGo\u2019s future\n\nGonzalez, 29, still healing up and trying to find his timing after undergoing left knee surgery in August 2014, started the season in a deep funk that lasted through May. Then he re-emerged as one of baseball\u2019s most dynamic outfielders, teaming with Arenado to become the first pair of Rockies sluggers to hit 40 homers in a season during the humidor era at Coors Field.\n\nStill, trade rumors are likely to swirl around Gonzalez during the offseason. He will get $17 million in 2016 and $20 million 2017 before he becomes a free agent. Bridich will listen if teams come calling, but he said Gonzalez remains a core element to the Rockies\u2019 future.\n\nBridich\u2019s take: \u201cI never doubted CarGo, especially based on everything we were seeing in his rehab. We saw it working. We saw how hard he was working. \u2026 This wasn\u2019t a veteran doing as little as he could trying to get by. No, this was a guy trying to get back. This was a guy who was angry that he was injured and wanting to get back to the way he was.\u201d\n\nTelling number: CarGo\u2019s 27 second-half homers are the most since Jose Bautista hit 30 for Toronto in 2010.\n\nThe good\n\nThe Rockies did some things well, starting with Arenado\u2019s play at third base that should earn him his third consecutive Gold Glove. LeMahieu improved as a hitter and played superbly at second base. The same can be said for center fielder Charlie Blackmon.\n\nBridich\u2019s take: \u201cOur defense, I don\u2019t know if I can call it better, but it\u2019s maintained its high level of execution and high level of performance.\u201d\n\nTelling numbers: Arenado leads the National League in total chances, putouts, assists and double plays.\n\nThe bad\n\nNot only was the starting pitching awful, so was the bullpen, as its NL-worst 4.75 ERA entering Saturday showed. The relievers got marginally better in August and September, but by then they had blown so many games that they crippled Colorado\u2019s chance of improving its record. The offense, which hit a major league-best .302 at home, was batting only .228 on the road and had a .278 on-base percentage away from Coors Field, worst in team history.\n\nBridich\u2019s take: \u201cWhat didn\u2019t we improve on? Other than the record? I mean, there is a lot of stuff that adds up to that record. I think, overall, the consistency of our pitching. And the consistency of our offense.\u201d\n\nTelling numbers: Longest winning streak: four games.
