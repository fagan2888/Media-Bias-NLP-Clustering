She\u2019s a senior vice president at the health system, but was trained as a CPA.\n\nAnd the more she looked at Medicare\u2019s Pioneer ACO program \u2014 arguably the government\u2019s most ambitious accountable care pilot \u2014 the more she worried that the numbers weren\u2019t adding up for her organization, one of the 32 original Pioneers.\n\n\u201cWe had very favorable underlying performance,\u201d Fleury told California Healthline. For instance, Sharp\u2019s ACO reduced readmissions and hit quality benchmarks, achieving some of the Pioneer program\u2019s major goals.\n\nBut the Pioneer program\u2019s unfavorable financial methodology meant that Sharp\u2019s ACO essentially broke even, Fleury said, rather than get a chance to share in millions of dollars in new savings produced by delivering better care.\n\nPart of the problem was the way that the Pioneer program benchmarks Medicare payments, which penalized Sharp as California\u2019s wage index went up between 2012 and 2014. And another challenge was how the Pioneer program incorporates disproportionate-share hospital payments in its benchmark, given that states have unevenly adopted the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \u201cBecause the model is a national model, if you\u2019re in an expansion state like California, your ACO helps to pay for the expansion,\u201d Fleury said.\n\nTaken together, she said, the math was obvious. \u201cWhen we projected those issues for 2014, we thought we were at risk of having a shared loss, even though our performance was favorable,\u201d Fleury concluded.\n\nSo Sharp HealthCare ACO decided to leave the Pioneer program \u2014 the 10th organization in the past 15 months to walk away.\n\n\u201cWe were getting harmed,\u201d Fleury added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s basically the case for all California ACOs.\u201d\n\nPioneer Program\u2019s Promise and Peril\n\nTo understand the importance of the Pioneer program, it\u2019s important to understand its backdrop. While most media coverage of the ACA has focused on the law\u2019s coverage expansion provisions, the triple aim underpinning Obamacare also included two other important objectives \u2014 lowering health care costs and boosting quality.\n\nLawmakers weren\u2019t entirely sure how to achieve those complicated aims, so the ACA included a flurry of payment reforms and other pilots intended to push providers to be more efficient, accountable stewards of care.\n\nAs designed, the Pioneer program is arguably the most bold test of those goals: Organizations that had some experience in coordinating care were encouraged to form ACOs and taking on more risk for their Medicare patients. Essentially, these organizations would be leading the path away from fee-for-service reimbursement and toward population health, showing other providers how it could be done.\n\nTo incent performance, the Pioneer program was built around a carrot-and-stick approach. Hit certain quality and financial targets and your organization stands to share in millions of dollars in cost savings; miss those targets and you end up writing a check to CMS.\n\nThe program\u2019s promise was generally hailed, but there were some early signs of trouble.\n\nWhile CMS received 80 applications for 32 spots back in 2011, the agency had trouble wooing some \u201cposter boy\u201d health systems like Cleveland Clinic and Intermountain Healthcare to participate. And in some cases, those top hospitals have remained skeptical and opted to sit out from all of Medicare\u2019s ACO pilots.\n\n(It\u2019s important to distinguish the Pioneer program from the Medicare Shared Savings Program, which has attracted hundreds of participants, including a number of California-based organizations. MSSP offers less potential upside for participants, but significantly less downside risk, too.)\n\nWithin months of Pioneer\u2019s launch, participants began pushing back against CMS, saying that the program\u2019s metrics were turning out to be too ambitious and the penalties too aggressive. Many hospitals were unhappy that CMS didn\u2019t promptly share the necessary data they needed to track spending. Some ACOs had problems just keeping patients within network and preventing them from \u201cleaking\u201d out to other health care providers.\n\nAnd when a small parade of organizations began leaving the Pioneer program last summer, most of them echoed what Sharp said this summer: The financial terms are too punitive.\n\nWhat Pioneers Are Teaching Us\n\nInterestingly, many of the ACOs that left the Pioneer program ended up shifting to MSSP, Medicare\u2019s lower-stakes pilot.\n\nAnd that makes one lesson clear: With the right incentives, providers do have an appetite for taking on more risk. But under the Pioneer program, CMS may not have been feeding them the right mix.\n\n\u201cMedicare ACOs were never a fair deal,\u201d health care consultant John Gorman wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cThe rules tilt the playing field toward CMS, often to the detriment of the ACO. [And] most significantly, the downside risk, as required by CMS, is irrational.\u201d\n\nInstead of Medicare\u2019s ACO pilots, organizations may end up opting for a more traditional opportunity: To get into the business of Medicare Advantage.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019ve spoken with leaders of Pioneer ACOs, we\u2019ve heard that patient churn and the network leakage issue as something they have really struggled with,\u201d the Advisory Board\u2019s Hamza Hasan said in an interview last month. The Advisory Board Company produces California Healthline on behalf of the California HealthCare Foundation.\n\n\u201cAnd they have found that patient churn and network leakage tends to be a lot lower in Medicare Advantage than MSSP.\u201d\n\nGorman agrees that organizations dropping out of the Medicare ACO program are well-suited to go into Medicare Advantage.\n\n\u201cA successful Medicare ACO has already mastered the hardest parts of eldercare: care management and an engaged network of high-performing providers,\u201d Gorman wrote. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing [are] insurance functions, which can be built or bought.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he thinks ACOs that had trouble succeeding in MSSP or Pioneer could see more rewards by either partnering with an existing Medicare Advantage plan or by \u201cbuild[ing] your own Medicare Advantage plan and move up the food chain.\u201d\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThere\u2019s another lesson to glean from the Pioneer program\u2019s stumbles, experts say: In the grand scheme of Obamacare and its many pilots, some failure is ok. Not all of the ACA\u2019s delivery reforms may end up working quickly or well, or even working at all.\n\nBut some of the unintended consequences \u2014 like Pioneer ACOs getting into caring for Medicare Advantage patients \u2014 could still end up being advantageous and help achieve Obamacare\u2019s goals.\n\n\u201cWe need to be patient on these pilots,\u201d Ashish Jha of the Harvard School of Public Health told California Healthline earlier this year. \u201cThey were never going to be the magic bullet that so many people hyped them up to be.\u201d\n\nAlthough with some changes, perhaps the Pioneer program can be more of what people hoped it would be. CMS will overhaul how the Pioneer program approaches risk adjustment and enact other programmatic fixes, which will result in the model more closely resembling MSSP and could make it more palatable to participants. Those modifications will take effect in January 2015.\n\n\u201cDo I believe ACOs can work? Obviously, we pulled out,\u201d Sharp\u2019s Fleury says.\n\n\u201cBut if the model is structured appropriately, it can work.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nOne insurer guides two states\u2019 fate: Wellmark dominates the individual insurance market in Iowa and South Dakota, but it has elected not to join the ACA\u2019s insurance exchanges \u2014 a decision that significantly affects state residents\u2019 purchasing decisions, Pauline Bartolone writes for Capital Public Radio/Kaiser Health News.\n\nMore insurers line up to sell on exchanges: At the Washington Post, Jason Millman breaks down HHS\u2019 announcement on insurer participation in the exchanges. (The only state to see a decline in the number of insurers on the exchange was California; see California Healthline\u2018s deep look into why.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Ten of Medicare's 32 Pioneer ACOs now have dropped out of the high-profile program, after San Diego's Sharp HealthCare informed CMS that it would be leaving the two-year-old pilot.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Ten of Medicare\u2019s 32 Pioneer ACOs now have dropped out of the high-profile program, after San Diego\u2019s Sharp HealthCare informed CMS that it would be leaving the two-year-old pilot.", "title": "Why One Pioneer ACO Quit the Program \u2014 and What It Reveals About the ACA", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/why-one-pioneer-aco-quit-the-program-and-what-the-decision-reveals-about-aca/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-09-24T07:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-24T07:30:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But under the Pioneer program, CMS may not have been feeding them the right mix.\nSo Sharp HealthCare ACO decided to leave the Pioneer program \u2014 the 10th organization in the past 15 months to walk away.\n(It\u2019s important to distinguish the Pioneer program from the Medicare Shared Savings Program, which has attracted hundreds of participants, including a number of California-based organizations.\nTo incent performance, the Pioneer program was built around a carrot-and-stick approach.\nPart of the problem was the way that the Pioneer program benchmarks Medicare payments, which penalized Sharp as California\u2019s wage index went up between 2012 and 2014."}
