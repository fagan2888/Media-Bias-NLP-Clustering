Cheri Bustos, (D) Illinois.\n\nAs Rep. Bustos greets retired Lt. Col. Dan Swanson, the Iraq War veteran recalls terrorism that threatens Iraqi soldiers.\n\n\"Your family is going to be dead unless you lay down your uniform,\" he said.\n\nIt's terror that ISIS is launching on Iraq. Motivation for U.S. airstrikes, long after troops came home.\n\nRelated: U.S. airstrikes begin on ISIS militants in Iraq\n\n\"I think we have to send a message,\" he said.\n\nDan Swanson worked closely with Iraqi leaders. He helped to recruit, train and supply its soldiers during the difficult transition.\n\nNow, that transition is turning again to violence.\n\n\"The attacking of civilians. The killing of Christians.

Bustos as she tours the Calmer Corn Heads Plant.\n\n\"We certainly don't want to go backward because we've invested a lot of American resources and American lives in this,\" she said.\n\nRepublican challenger Bobby Schilling also supports the airstrikes.\n\nBut Schilling also says that the situation is completely out of control because President Obama has ignored dire warnings for far too long.\n\n\"It is time for President Obama to step up and lead by putting forth a long-term strategy to deal with this national security threat,\" Schilling said.\n\nSwanson hopes that airstrikes will be enough. Still, a long separation of time and distance can't stop the frustration.\n\n\"It's very sad to see that,\" he concluded. \"The Iraqi people deserve better.\"\n\nReflections from an officer reaching from Illinois to Iraq.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A retired lieutenant colonel says he hopes U.S. airstrikes will be enough to stop ISIS attacks on civilians in Iraq.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "A retired lieutenant colonel says he hopes U.S. airstrikes will be enough to stop ISIS attacks on civilians in Iraq.", "title": "Retired military officer says \u2018we have to send a message\u2019 in Iraq", "url": "http://wqad.com/2014/08/08/airstrikes-hit-close-to-home-for-retired-american-officer/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/promo231796881.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/promo231796881.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2014-08-08T19:47:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T20:51:13+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "keywords": "news, congresswoman cheri bustos, dan swanson, iraq", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "As Rep.
