Meredith Warren, a Republican political analyst and consultant, counters: \u201cBut Sanders should take a long look in the mirror. Both he and many of his Democratic cohort, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are fiercely pushing a campaign message specifically intended to divide America along different lines\u2014economic ones.\u201d\n\nWarren, a graduate of Boston University\u2019s College of Communication, where she majored in broadcast journalism, should be congratulated for drawing attention to the media\u2019s double standard.\n\nOn one occasion, during an appearance on Iowa public television, Sanders was asked about promoting class warfare. He turned the question around and insisted that class warfare was being waged by the rich against the middle class and the poor.\n\nThe problem for Sanders is that his political philosophy is ultimately based on the notion of the elimination of the bourgeoisie\u2014the middle-class owners of property\u2014as set forth in the Manifesto of the Communist Party, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. \u201cThis person must indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible,\u201d it says. This is the theory of class warfare.\n\nIn his book, Why Communism Kills: The Legacy of Karl Marx, Dr. Fred Schwarz argued that \u201cThe liquidation of the bourgeoisie is an essential step of the path to Communism. This is why Communism must kill.\u201d\n\nIn his famous \u201cTime for Choosing\u201d speech in 1964, Ronald Reagan captured the essence and attraction of Marxism, saying, \u201cWe have so many people who can\u2019t see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one.\u201d\n\nAmerican economist Henry Hazlitt said it a different way: \u201cThe whole gospel of Karl Marx can be summed up in a single sentence: Hate the man who is better off than you are. Never under any circumstances admit that his success may be due to his own efforts, to the productive contribution he has made to the whole community. Always attribute his success to the exploitation, the cheating, the more or less open robbery of others.\u201d\n\nThat is the essence of the Sanders campaign strategy.\n\nIn his book, Socialism in America, John L. Bowman writes about envy being one of the driving forces behind socialism: \u201c\u2026the simple desire to want what another has.\u201d He added, \u201cAfter all the moralizing about justice, freedom from oppression, disparity of wealth, and obligation to help others according to their needs, the truth may be that socialists are just plain envious of those with money.\u201d\n\nBowman says one reason for socialist envy is that \u201csocialists often lack the ability to make money.\u201d A good example was Marx, the father of communism, who is usually described in glowing terms as a philosopher, journalist, historian, and economist. But \u201che never earned a living wage and was largely supported by Engels,\u201d notes the entry at biography.com. Paul Johnson\u2019s book Intellectuals, notes Bowman, said that Marx was \u201cunwilling to work at a job, borrowed money to live, and was incompetent with personal finances, all of which led to lifelong money problems and his subsequent hatred of money, money lenders, usury, and capitalists.\u201d Bowman adds, \u201cDuring the last part of his life, Marx and his family lived in a two-room apartment on Dean Street, near Soho in London in dire poverty.\u201d\n\nSanders has escaped such a fate because he has been a career politician. We\u2019ve noted that James O\u2019Brien, a political consultant and former publisher of Campaigns & Elections magazine, calculates that Sanders, who has been a mayor, member of Congress and a U.S. senator, has achieved the financial status of a millionaire. He concludes that Sanders and his wife have a net worth in the range of $1.2 to $1.5 million, not the $700,000 or less that is usually reported by the media.\n\nSanders apparently once performed manual labor on an Israeli commune or kibbutz dedicated to Joseph Stalin. The Times of Israel reported, \u201cLeaving the cabin he shared with a few other American college student volunteers, Sanders would have a quick bite of bread before heading out to the orchard. After 2 1/2 hours of work, he and the other 20 or so volunteers would sit down for a traditional 30-minute Israeli breakfast of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, butter and hard-boiled eggs\u2026The kibbutz belonged to the Israeli political party Mapam, which in the 1950s had been a communist, Soviet-affiliated faction. Kibbutz members had admired Joseph Stalin until his death, and they would celebrate May Day with red flags. They spoke of controlling the means of production, taking from each according to his abilities and giving to each according to his needs.\u201d\n\nIs this where and how Sanders first became a socialist? Sanders won\u2019t talk about it. The media have asked for details, but he and his campaign won\u2019t respond. AP reports, \u201cSanders won\u2019t identify the Israeli kibbutz where he briefly volunteered in the 1960s. When reporters found the kibbutz, Sha\u2019ar Ha\u2019amakim in northern Israel, he wouldn\u2019t comment.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion is inescapable: Sanders is a hard-core Marxist who preaches class warfare. He calls himself a democratic socialist, but he wants to avoid any mention of communism.\n\nDonald J. Trump has called him a communist, a charge Sanders denies. \u201cHe calls me a communist. That\u2019s a lie,\u201d Sanders thunders.\n\nYet, as we noted in our coverage of one of the Democratic debates, Sanders did not disavow his previous comments in support of the communist dictatorship in Cuba.\n\nHatred is \u201cthe heart of Marxism,\u201d Henry Hazlett said. \u201cThis is its animating force. You can throw away the dialectical materialism, the Hegelian framework, the technical jargon, the \u2018scientific\u2019 analysis, and millions of pretentious words, and you still have the core: the implacable hatred and envy that are the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for all the rest.\u201d\n\nMeantime, Communist China has more billionaires than the United States, according to the Hurun Global Rich List 2016. It finds that there are 568 Chinese billionaires, compared to 535 in the U.S. Beijing has replaced New York as the billionaire capital of the world.\n\nStill, the Constitution of the Communist Party of China declares, \u201cThe Communist Party of China is the vanguard both of the Chinese working class and of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. It is the core of leadership for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and represents the development trend of China\u2019s advanced productive forces, the orientation of China\u2019s advanced culture and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people. The realization of communism is the highest ideal and ultimate goal of the Party.\u201d\n\nOf course, as we\u2019ve argued, the communists use capitalism to create the wealth they couldn\u2019t create through socialism. Such a development is why many conservatives still love the old song by The Who, \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again,\u201d with the lyrics: \u201cMeet the new boss. Same as the old boss.\u201d Except that the new communist boss is actually worse than the old boss.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "When will socialist Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) be held accountable by the media for his own revolutionary and hateful rhetoric?", "title": "Hate is the Essence of Socialism", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/commiehaters1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-15T10:29:28+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/hate-is-the-essence-of-socialism/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "AIM Column", "published_time": "2016-03-15T10:28:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T10:29:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "When will socialist Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) be held accountable by the media for his own revolutionary and hateful rhetoric?", "title": "Hate is the Essence of Socialism", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/hate-is-the-essence-of-socialism/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/commiehaters1.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "article_summary": "AP reports, \u201cSanders won\u2019t identify the Israeli kibbutz where he briefly volunteered in the 1960s.\nSanders won\u2019t talk about it.\nAlways attribute his success to the exploitation, the cheating, the more or less open robbery of others.\u201dThat is the essence of the Sanders campaign strategy.\nWhen will socialist Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) be held accountable by the media for his own revolutionary and hateful rhetoric?\nOn one occasion, during an appearance on Iowa public television, Sanders was asked about promoting class warfare."}
