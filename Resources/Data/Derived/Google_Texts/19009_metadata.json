Mark Dayton and DHS Commissioner Emily Johnson Piper acknowledged problems persist but said the department has made progress and that the audit might overstate the issue.\n\nWHAT THE AUDIT FOUND\n\nThe nonpartisan Office of the Legislative Auditor took a random sample of 103 people enrolled in Medicaid and 54 people in MinnesotaCare between January and March of 2015. Auditors then used state employment data and tax returns to verify whether those individuals had actually qualified for the programs they enrolled in.\n\nThe sample was limited to people who enrolled using the MNsure software and to people who allegedly qualified for programs because of low income. That means the sample represented a population of about 270,000 people, out of more than 1 million receiving public assistance.\n\nOf those 157 people, the audit found 38 percent weren\u2019t eligible for their public program. Three-quarters of those people actually didn\u2019t qualify for any program, while the remainder qualified for a different public program.\n\nExtrapolating over the entire 270,000-person population, the auditor estimated that between 57,000 and 108,000 people received Medicaid or MinnesotaCare benefits but shouldn\u2019t have received any benefits at all.\n\nThe 157 people received $104,213 in overpaid benefits from January through May of 2015. That translates to between $115 million and $271 million over the entire population for the five-month period.\n\nCecile Ferkul, the deputy legislative auditor, cautioned that her findings applied to only a specific time period and specific population. She warned against assuming the same error rate in the rest of Minnesota\u2019s public programs or over a full calendar year.\n\n\u201cIt may be that there\u2019s more error in this time period than there would be in other time periods throughout the year,\u201d Ferkul said.\n\nMost of the issues found by the audit weren\u2019t new but had been identified in a previous 2014 audit. Out of 17 relevant findings in the 2014 report, this year\u2019s update found DHS had fully resolved just two and partially resolved five. That left 10 problems with no significant progress.\n\nWHY THE PROBLEMS EXIST\n\nSoftware glitches are responsible for many of the failures to adequately check enrollees\u2019 eligibility:\n\nThe audit found information wasn\u2019t accurately and fully transferred between the MNsure software and the department\u2019s separate payment software. This sometimes let to discrepancies between the two systems about which program an enrollee was in, how many children they have or how many people live in their household.\n\nThe MNsure software often had difficulty connecting to the federal government\u2019s computers to share information.\n\nSoftware didn\u2019t cross-check reported income or family information with available tax records or wage information.\n\nOther issues were due to human error. The audit found many state and county workers didn\u2019t follow correct procedures when dealing with enrollees and recommended training improvements.\n\nWHAT\u2019S BEING DONE ABOUT IT\n\nIn response to the audit, the Department of Human Services said it\u2019s addressing all the issues identified.\n\nMost of the fixes, such as improving the transfer of data from the MNsure software to DHS\u2019s payment software, are scheduled to get done this year.\n\nImprovements to employee training is identified as an \u201congoing\u201d issue.\n\nA few of the issues have already been fixed, DHS said, such as a temporary solution to billing errors that will be rolled out next month.\n\nWHAT LEADERS SAY ABOUT THE AUDIT\n\nIn a response to the audit, Piper acknowledged the \u201cserious\u201d problems in the report and said the \u201cneed for improvement is critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccurate eligibility determinations are a basic function that we must get right to ensure the integrity of our public health care programs,\u201d Piper said in a letter.\n\nBut she also suggested the 38 percent error rate the Office of the Legislative Auditor found was \u201coverstated.\u201d\n\nIn a different audit DHS conducted of itself, the department found 16 percent of Medicaid enrollees weren\u2019t eligible for the program \u2014 still \u201ctoo high,\u201d Piper said, but \u201cmuch lower\u201d than the 38 percent found by OLA.\n\nPiper said DHS\u2019s own review also found most of those ineligible cases were still eligible for another public program \u2014 a contrast to OLA\u2019s finding that most people ineligible for their present program didn\u2019t qualify for any other programs, either.\n\nGovernor Dayton, speaking Thursday morning about MNsure\u2019s private insurance marketplace, said he hadn\u2019t read the audit. But he defended DHS, saying the agency has made improvements even as it still struggles with some issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to take an auditor\u2019s report and whack again, when there\u2019s a positive story here that needs to be told,\u201d said Dayton.\n\nThat positive story, Dayton said, includes major progress from the disastrous MNsure rollout in 2013. The governor conceded that he and other state leaders \u201cseriously underestimated the magnitude of this task\u201d and also that Minnesota made a mistake when it hired Maximus Inc. as the lead contractor to build software to manage both the state\u2019s public health programs and the MNsure private insurance marketplace.\n\nMinnesota effectively took over the project from Maximus in mid-2014, but MN.IT Services are still trying to resolve major bugs almost two years later.\n\nRepublicans said the audit vindicates what they\u2019ve said for years: that the MNsure software is an unsalvageable mess and that Medicaid and MinnesotaCare have lots of waste, fraud and abuse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent more than $300 million on this failed Obamacare exchange, and it somehow still can\u2019t figure out how to prevent hundreds of millions in benefits from going to those who aren\u2019t eligible,\u201d said Rep. Greg Davids, R-Preston, in a statement.\n\nRepublicans say Minnesota should stop spending millions to fix the MNsure software and instead let the federal government run the private health insurance marketplace and start from scratch with new software to run public health programs. Dayton opposes that.\n\nLast year, Republicans proposed a crackdown on waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid and MinnesotaCare that they predicted would save the state $150 million per year. DHS said such an effort would save about $75 million per year and would take several years to implement.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Twin Cities", "description": "More than 80,000 Minnesotans enrolled in public health programs for which they weren\u2019t eligible last year, an estimated cost to taxpayers of hundreds of millions of dollars.
