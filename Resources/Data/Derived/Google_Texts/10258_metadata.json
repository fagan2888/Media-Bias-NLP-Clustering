Timothy Schenck\n\nThe Last Brucennial, a showcase of works from more than 600 female artists, opened on Thursday and will run from Wednesday to Sunday until April 4.\n\nPresented by Vito Schnabel, the art dealer son of artist Julian Schnabel who directed \u201cThe Diving Bell and the Butterfly,\u201d the event is the fifth and final installment of an alternative biennial run by the New York artist collective called the Bruce High Quality Foundation.\n\nMr. Schnabel said he was introduced to the group by his sister Lola, also an artist, and started working with them eight years ago after meeting several members at Cooper Union, which his sister attended.\n\nThe location for the final Brucennial, at 837 Washington Street, a recently completed commercial building next to the future site of the Whitney Museum of American Art, was appropriate because the event markets itself in direct opposition to shows like the Whitney Biennial.\n\nRather than a carefully curated group show, the Brucennial is intended to be a celebration of an ever-widening community of artists, both known and unknown, said Mr. Schnabel.\n\nArt works in the show range in value from $5 to more than $100,000.\n\nOn Thursday night, throngs of young artists and art aficionados in parkas and beanies hustled to gain entry to the opening night.\n\nInside the tightly packed space, Mr. Schnabel said the event was deliberately timed to coincide with the opening of the Whitney Biennial on the same night.\n\nActress and artists Lucy Liu is pictured at the opening of the Last Brucennial.\n\nTimothy Schenck\n\n\u201cThe Whitney Biennial is a show where curators pick who they think their favorite artists are at this time, but this art show is a little more democratic and encapsulates what is happening today as best as it can,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Schnabel said the Brucennial exhibited works from artists from all over the world.\n\n\u201cThere are some things you may not like as much as others but it kind of becomes one work in itself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see Louise Bourgeois or Cecily Brown or Tracey Emin or Pat Steir next to Kathryn Kerr, who people might not know now but they will soon.\u201d\n\nAmong the works featured at the event is Hanna Linden\u2019s Pussy Riot balaclava and Tracey Emin\u2019s neon sign \u201cTrust Yourself.\u201d\n\nActress and artists Lucy Liu is pictured at the opening of the Last Brucennial.
