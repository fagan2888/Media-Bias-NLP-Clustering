She was loving. She stood up for what is right. She didn't let people get her down,\" Samantha Flynn said of her mother.\n\nThis weekend marked the eighth year since the deadly shooting that killed eight people.\n\nJust a few years after the shooting that took her mother\u2019s life, Samantha Flynn was a junior at Millard South High School when a student shot and killed the assistant principal.\n\nThe tragedies, according to Samantha Flynn, have given her a new purpose.\n\n\"I just, through the whole thing, I just remember the comfort from (the officers),\" Samantha Flynn said, remembering the day her mother was killed. \"I was just this little girl and they were just doing their job, but they still made me feel safe, protected, comforted. One just came up and gave me a hug.\"\n\nThat embrace left a lasting memory and is now motivating Samantha Flynn to get a degree in criminal justice from the University of Nebraska-Omaha. Her goal is to become an Omaha police officer.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe already has an idea what she might say to a family facing devastating news.\n\n\"Don't give up, because it will get better,\" Samantha Flynn said. \"It's totally about giving back and being there for the community who was there for me, who is still there for me. I owe my life to this community.\"\n\nSamantha Flynn said she will graduate in the spring of 2017. At the ceremony, she said, her mother's presence will be felt as she walks across the stage.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sun, 06 Dec 2015 22:43:11 CST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Alexandra Stone", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "This weekend marked the eighth year since a deadly shooting inside Omaha's Von Maur.", "title": "Daughter of Von Maur victim plans on becoming police officer to serve community", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/daughter-of-von-maur-victim-plans-on-becoming-police-officer-to-serve-community/36830730", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/36831164/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/6ink2tz/-/von-maur-PNG.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/daughter-of-von-maur-victim-plans-on-becoming-police-officer-to-serve-community/36830730", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/36830730", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/36830730", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/36830730"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/36830730", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/36830730", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "keywords": "Von Maur", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/AlexandraStoneReports"}, "news_keywords": "Von Maur", "description": "This weekend marked the eighth year since a deadly shooting inside Omaha's Von Maur."}, "article_summary": "[Video: Daughter of Von Maur victim plans on becoming police officer to serve community]Samantha Flynn was 13 years old when her mother, Beverly Flynn, was killed in Omaha\u2019s Von Maur shooting.\nSamantha Flynn has been touched by tragedy much more than your average 21-year-old.\n\"I called my mom, wanting her to come get me and she didn't answer,\" Samantha Flynn recalled.\nThat embrace left a lasting memory and is now motivating Samantha Flynn to get a degree in criminal justice from the University of Nebraska-Omaha.\nSamantha Flynn said she will graduate in the spring of 2017."}
