Lindsey Graham touted himself as a \u201cvery good commander-in-chief\u201d who would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to defeat ISIS if he were to win the presidency in 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president because I\u2019m very much worried about where we\u2019re going,\u201d said Graham, R-S.C., who entered the presidential race in June.\n\nGraham, who said the best decision he ever made was going into the Air Force, promised to make national defense the highest priority if he were elected president.\n\n\u201cHomegrown terrorism is what keeps me up at night right now,\u201d Graham said.\n\nGraham also sounded the alarm about the possibility of ISIS terrorists coming from Iraq or Syria to attack America.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t defend ourselves over there, they\u2019re coming here,\u201d Graham said. \u201c[I will do] whatever it takes, as long as it takes to defeat these guys.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest threat to America, Graham said, is the possibility of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. The U.S. and other world powers are currently in negotiations with Iran to contain Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nSwitching gears to relate to the crowd (which primarily featured older people) Graham theorized that the amount of money coming into the Medicare and the Social Security system is lower than it used to be because there are less people working.\n\nAs the Baby Boomers start retiring, Graham said, more people are taking money out.\n\n\u201cI want to fix the hole in the boat,\u201d Graham said about fixing Social Security for future generations.\n\nGraham stated that the retirement age should be adjusted and the age extended.\n\nFewer taxes and less regulation can \u201ccreate an economy where people are competing for your labor,\u201d Graham said.\n\nFinally, Graham, who embraces immigration reform, said that employers should be required to use E-Verify for their employees \u2014 which determines if a worker is eligible to work in the country.\n\nHe said that legal immigration should be increased, and that the U.S. should work with Mexico to secure the border.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
