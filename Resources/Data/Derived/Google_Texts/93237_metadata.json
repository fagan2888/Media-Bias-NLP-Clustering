So, for foes of the Affordable Care Act, time is running out.\n\nPrograms such as Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and welfare have a way of becoming entrenched and politically untouchable. And Republicans know it, adding urgency to their efforts to kill the landmark health care law, which offers subsidies for millions to help pay for insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to kill a vampire than a bad government program,\u201d said Rep. Pete Olson, R-Sugar Land, invoking a bit of conservative folk wisdom from Phil Gramm, the former Texas senator. \u201cOnce this thing gets up and running, it\u2019ll be tough to kill, just like all government programs are. That\u2019s why there\u2019s some sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who dug in hardest ahead of the government shutdown, demanding that Congress defund Obamacare, warned over and over that once the law takes hold, there may be no turning back.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration knows that in modern times, no major entitlement program that\u2019s been implemented has ever been unwound,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz told Texas reporters in late July. \u201cTheir objective, I believe, is to get as many Americans as possible addicted to the subsidies, addicted to the sugar, in order to entrench Obamacare as a permanent feature of our economy.\u201d\n\nAt Families USA, a left-leaning group that supports the law, executive director Ron Pollack said Wednesday that he agrees with critics who expect political momentum and public opinion to make it exceedingly hard to overturn.\n\n\u201cIf they had confidence it was going to fail, why put much effort into stopping it? This is really going to help people,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they have reached a fevered pitch at this moment.\u201d\n\nOct. 1 was a key milestone, as uninsured Americans began signing up \u2014 albeit with many glitches \u2014 through online marketplaces. Their coverage will take effect Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cThey recognize that it\u2019s a point of no return,\u201d Pollack said, \u201cand as people get the benefits and get the protections, they\u2019re going to value this very highly, and they will be very mad at any politician who takes this lifeblood away from them.\u201d\n\nAbout a third of the population has a pre-existing medical condition. For someone with a history of asthma or diabetes or cancer, the law protects them from being denied coverage, charged more, or getting kicked off insurance.\n\nMillions of Americans will enjoy subsidized premiums; benefits taper out but even a family of four earning up to $94,200 would get help.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Medicaid expansion. Texas along with about half of all states refuses to participate; Gov. Rick Perry says the state budget can\u2019t handle it. Elsewhere, this element of the law will cut dramatically the number of poor Americans without health coverage.\n\nBudget showdown\n\nWith the government\u2019s nonessential functions shut down and the nation\u2019s credit line due to run out on Oct. 17, the budget showdown has merged with a fight over the debt ceiling. Conservatives are trying to keep the focus on the health care law.\n\n\u201cThe only acceptable way out of this is some sort of deal that funds the federal government without funding Obamacare,\u201d Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action for America, told reporters Wednesday. The tea party group worked with Cruz to generate demand for a defunding showdown.\n\nHe doubts Obamacare will be popular, because it\u2019s too costly and \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d But \u201cgiving out billions of dollars in subsidies is going to be a difficult thing to roll back,\u201d and the Oct. 1 opening of enrollment \u201ccreated some urgency. \u2026 Clearly, it\u2019s easier to take on an entitlement program before it takes root.\u201d\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, the deputy GOP leader in the Senate, shunned the tactic of linking Obamacare and the budget. But he agrees with the impetus.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned that the longer it goes on, the harder it will be to dismantle,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, I have to say that the president and his administration are doing a lousy job of rolling this out, and there\u2019s a very good chance that a lot of this will sort of collapse under its own weight.\u201d\n\nLaw confusion\n\nConfusion about the law has prevailed.\n\nThe latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, conducted in late September, found that half of the public \u2014 and two-thirds of people without health insurance \u2014 don\u2019t know how the law will affect them and their families.\n\nThat means most of the people with the most to gain aren\u2019t aware that Medicaid will expand in many states, or that subsidies will help lower-income people pay for insurance. Advocates are betting that as the law comes into focus, and more people leave the ranks of the uninsured, approval will rise.\n\n\u201cYes, when it\u2019s implemented there is a concern among people on our side of the aisle that there will be a lot of benefits that people will like,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., a member of the GOP leadership. But co-pays and premiums will rise for some people, and overall costs will be harmful to the economy, he argued.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a slam dunk even when it\u2019s implemented,\u201d he said.\n\nOpponents have long invoked the language of addiction to describe the evils of Obamacare.\n\nLate last month, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., a top tea party leader, told the conservative site World Net Daily that \u201cPresident Obama can\u2019t wait to get Americans addicted to the crack cocaine of dependency on more government health care.\u201d\n\nCruz has used less inflammatory language.\n\nEither way, Pollack called it offensive, a \u201ctrivialization of something that is a life and death matter for so many people. \u2026 To say that when you\u2019re getting help that this is like sugar or crack demonstrates such a total lack of understanding of people\u2019s realities when they can\u2019t afford insurance.\u201d\n\nFollow Todd J.
