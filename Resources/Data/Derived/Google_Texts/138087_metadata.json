It said some of these problems are related to funding shortages, and said the IRS is making efforts to address these issues.\n\nBut it said problems related to Obamacare persist.\n\n\u201cTIGTA is also concerned that the IRS\u2019s existing fraud detection system may not be capable of identifying Affordable Care Act refund fraud or schemes prior to the issuance of tax refunds,\u201d TIGTA said. \u201cAs a result, TIGTA plans to continue oversight of this area.\u201d\n\nThe report also warned that Obamacare will pose several implementation challenges in the coming years.\n\n\u201c[S]ystems development activities to implement ACA provisions will require extensive IRS resources,\u201d it said. \u201cThe ACA contains an extensive array of tax law changes that will present a continuing source of challenges for the IRS in the coming years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IRS estimates that at least 42 provisions will either add to or amend the tax code and at least eight will require the IRS to build new processes that do not exist within the current tax administration system,\u201d it added.\n\nObamacare requires the IRS to collect information from health insurance providers and drug manufacturers, and the IRS will try to do so through a so-called ACA Information Returns (AIR) project. That project will involve validating, accepting and processing forms that will be provided by these commercial actors.\n\nTIGTA reviewed this system late last year, and at the time indicated that it fund \u201cvulnerability weaknesses\u201d in this project that could pose problems down the road. But it said it could not determine whether this issue had been solved yet.\n\nRepublicans have argued for months that there aren\u2019t enough safeguards in place to ensure the law is implemented properly. One key complaint from the GOP involves the failure of the government to create a system to verifying whether people are eligible for health care subsidies in the form of tax credits.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released a report Wednesday that said the IRS's information management system may not be fully capable of detecting fraudulent efforts to get Obamacare benefits.
