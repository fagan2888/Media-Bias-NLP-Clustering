Gilad Rom CC BY 2.0\n\nDuring his 1932 inaugural presidential speech, former U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt told a nation in the midst of one of the worst economic depressions in history, \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201d Now, a study from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands may prove there\u2019s some scientific basis to this famous quote.\n\nFacing your fears in order to conquer them isn\u2019t only good advice, it may soon be scientific fact \u2014 albeit with a catch. Researchers found that by using a treatment known as \u201cmemory reconsolidation,\u201d they could reduce volunteers\u2019 arachnophobia by eliminating their fearful memories of spiders. Memory reconsolidation is based on the idea that when a memory is recalled, it must be consolidated all over again. However, using a drug that blocks the formation of new memories can also work to block this reconsolidation process \u2014 and by extension, someone\u2019s fear of spiders. The aforementioned catch: the person has to be around the spider for a few minutes.\n\nFor the study, the team recruited 45 volunteers to receive a randomized dose of either a placebo or propranolol, an amnestic drug used to treat high blood pressure and heart conditions, which can also cause memory loss. Then, participants were briefly exposed to a tarantula. According to the press release, results revealed that up to a year after the initial treatment, volunteers who had received the propranolol displayed a \u201cdrastically reduced\u201d desire to avoid the creatures and were more comfortable with getting close to them.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time scientists have said exposure can be an effective way to treat phobias. In 2014, British psychiatrist Dr. Russell Green developed Phobia Free \u2014 an app that urges users to interact with animated spiders and scorpions in an attempt to help them conquer their fears. However, what makes the Dutch study unique is that it uses amnestic drugs during these fear confrontations.\n\nWhile it\u2019s normal for us to feel afraid in potentially harmful situations, whether it\u2019s looking down from a high-up building or facing dangerous-looking spiders, a phobia is described as an irrational fear that disrupts sufferers\u2019 quality of life \u2014 not only can it cause extreme emotional distress, but it can also interfere with a person\u2019s ability to function normally.\n\nThe researchers said more studies would determine how successful this treatment is on different patient populations as well as patients with varying degrees of phobia. But for now, the results are promising. Current phobia and anxiety treatments involve taking a number of sedatives and antidepressant medications, and attending psychotherapy for what could be many years. In a recent statement, co-author Dr. Merel Kindt said this proposed intervention would involve \u201cone single, brief intervention that leads to a sudden, substantial, and lasting loss of fear.\u201d\n\nSource: Soeter M, Kindt M.
