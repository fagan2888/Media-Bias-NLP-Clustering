Bannon, Coulter said, \u201cIf this had happened a year ago \u2026 we\u2019ve seen how Republicans have behaved. They\u2019re utterly craven.They would probably pass, or Senate Republicans would confirm whomever Obama sends up. They\u2019d ring their hands. Lindsey Graham would be leading the charge, talking about how it\u2019s the President\u2019s right to decide. Now that Donald Trump has come on the scene, I think Washington Republicans may be starting to get the message. We\u2019re really ticked off at them.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCoulter added, \u201cLook, if they let somebody go through, I mean, I think Trump is going to win anyway but it\u2019s just going to get him another ten million votes.\u201d\n\nCoulter also recently discussed Scalia\u2019s passing and legacy with host Stephen K. Bannon on Saturday, as well.\n\nCoulter praised Scalia for going beyond pointing out the absurdity of left-wing activist Court decisions, explaining why they were wrong in a clear and witty manner. She stressed the importance of Scalia\u2019s humor to keep readers engaged, comparing it to presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s use of humor to hold an audience. \u201cWe used to wait for his opinions to come out, particularly the dissents, and read them over dinner\u2026 and quote from them for months on end, his particularly hilarious lines\u201d Coulter said of Scalia\u2019s jurisprudence. She cited Scalia\u2019s dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey as a particular favorite, mourning the way other Republican-nominated judges such as David Souter, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, and Anthony Kennedy would so often betray the conservative base. While Coulter said all of Scalia\u2019s writing was \u201cvery clear and very strong,\u201d his dissents were especially energetic. \u201cUsually when he was writing a dissent, he\u2019d gotten kinda fed up with the other Justices, and he would just let loose,\u201d she chuckled.\n\nThe full Breitbart News Sunday interview with Ann Coulter can be heard below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ann Coulter on Antonin Scalia And The GOP", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ann Coulter on Antonin Scalia And The GOP", "title": "Ann Coulter on Antonin Scalia And The GOP - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/AP_844510772916.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-02-15T09:27:22-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/15/ann-coulter-on-antonin-scalia/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ann Coulter on Antonin Scalia And The GOP", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/AP_844510772916.jpg", "title": "Ann Coulter on Antonin Scalia And The GOP - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Radio,Coulter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2016-02-15T07:54:42-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Radio", "modified_time": "2016-02-15T09:27:22-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20cb\"", "article_summary": "While Coulter said all of Scalia\u2019s writing was \u201cvery clear and very strong,\u201d his dissents were especially energetic.\nCoulter praised Scalia for going beyond pointing out the absurdity of left-wing activist Court decisions, explaining why they were wrong in a clear and witty manner.\nThe full Breitbart News Sunday interview with Ann Coulter can be heard below.\nSpeaking to host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K.
