Thereafter, the administration may only hold mothers and daughters for five days, unless there are \u201cextenuating\u201d circumstances\u2013as when \u201c70,000 Central American families\u201d flooded into America in 2014 and overwhelmed the system. Under such circumstances the government may hold mothers and children for 20 days instead of five.\n\nThe option of a 20-day detention is the only quasi-concession the administration received from Judge Gee.\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
