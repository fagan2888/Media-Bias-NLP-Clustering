They also got the third consecutive quarter of GDP declines.\n\nAccording to the data (.pdf here) released by the U.S. Board of Economic Advisors (BEA), \u201cthe deceleration in real GDP in the first quarter reflected a larger decrease in nonresidential fixed investment, a deceleration in PCE, a downturn in federal government spending, an upturn in imports, and larger decreases in private inventory investment and in exports that were partly offset by an upturn in state and local government spending and an acceleration in residential fixed investment.\u201d\n\nPCE \u2013 or personal consumption expenditures \u2013 expanded at a 1.9 percent clip, the lowest uptick since the first quarter of 2015.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the recent history of this critical measure courtesy of our friends at Zero Hedge \u2026\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\n(Graph via Zero Hedge)\n\nThe estimates released by the BEA this week represent \u201cadvance\u201d data. A supposedly more complete measure will be released on May 27. In the meantime, two branches of the Federal Reserve bank publish regular updates on what they believe to be the \u201clive\u201d GDP of the U.S. economy.\n\nFor those of you keeping score at home, GDP growth \u2013 or the value of all the goods and services produced by a country \u2013 has been hard to come by in the era of obscenely big government. The American economy hasn\u2019t grown at an annual rate of five percent since 1984, and hasn\u2019t hit the four percent mark since 2000.\n\nHell, the economy hasn\u2019t grown at even a three percent clip in eleven years.\n\nBy contrast, growth exceeded five percent in twelve out of thirty years from 1950-1980. And it exceeded four percent in seventeen out of those thirty years.\n\nBottom line? The perpetual expansion of the welfare state, unchecked crony capitalism, wide open borders, reckless global interventionism, rigged trade deals, manipulated currency, the imposition of socialized medicine (a.k.a. \u201cObamacare\u201d) and unrestrained deficit spending are conspiring to destroy the American economy.\n\nOur choice is simple: Reject politicians of both parties who embrace these things, or continue voting for them \u2026 in which case we should expect things to continue getting worse.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2016/04/28/another-recession-alarm-q1-growth/", "type": "article", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/economy-625x370.jpg", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "title": "Another Recession Alarm: Q1 Growth Nonexistent"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "For those of you keeping score at home, GDP growth \u2013 or the value of all the goods and services produced by a country \u2013 has been hard to come by in the era of obscenely big government.\nAMERICA\u2019S ECONOMIC EXPANSION IS GRINDING TO A HALTThe United States economy expanded at its slowest quarterly rate in two years \u2013 posting a 0.5 percent growth rate during the months of January, February and March.\nBy contrast, growth exceeded five percent in twelve out of thirty years from 1950-1980.\nThey also got the third consecutive quarter of GDP declines.\nThe American economy hasn\u2019t grown at an annual rate of five percent since 1984, and hasn\u2019t hit the four percent mark since 2000."}
