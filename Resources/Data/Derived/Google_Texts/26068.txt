The deadline has come and gone and our governor has denied Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands of our Alabama citizens and rejected over $16 billion dollars of federal monies that will help bring jobs to the State.



The only reason anybody can think, besides the lack of intellect of our Governor is that his political base will do anything to stop the unavoidable; the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Bentley is a medical doctor, he is supposed to know care for the sick and the suffering but he chooses the political dictates rather than the ethical roots of his medical profession.



My request to the Alabama legislators is: impeach Mr. Bentley! I do not know how in the thousands of pages of our Constitution this procedure is allowed or outlined. If an impeachment is not possible. Recall Mr. Bentley! If I had a political organization I would have tried, but I am sure there are people in this state with the ability to collect the signatures and I am also sure there will be millions willing to sign it. But even if these efforts do not succeed, Mr. Bentley will be sadly remembered as the doctor who rejected the Hippocratic Oath and embraced the Machiavelli path.
