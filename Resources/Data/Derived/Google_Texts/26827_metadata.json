However, by now, one month in, a third of resolution makers will be reso-losers.\n\nEventually, more than 90 percent will fail.\n\n\u201cPeople fail with their resolutions because they go too deep, try to do too much, and are too vague,\u201d said my friend Peter Walsh, America\u2019s favorite professional organizer. I called him after stumbling on his \u201c31 Days 2 Get Organized,\u201d challenge, which is on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWhich is exactly why I don\u2019t make any,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy commit to something that will just make me feel bad about myself?\u201d\n\nBut as I review his challenge, which consists of spending just 10 minutes a day, every day, tackling one area of your home \u2014 your nightstand, your coats, your glassware \u2014 I see that success just may be in reach.\n\nI also think of the other things that losing weight and getting organized have in common: Both are best accomplished through many small, sustainable changes.\n\n\u201cSmall steps, consistently applied, yield huge results,\u201d says Walsh.\n\n\u201cThis is hard for me,\u201d I say. \u201cI approach everything kamikaze-style or not at all.\u201d\n\nThen it occurs to me that maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t succeed. I then shut up and listened.\n\n\u201cJust 10 minutes a day. In one week, you\u2019ve invested an hour or more and you\u2019ll see significant results,\u201d says Walsh, who added, \u201cHey, if 10 minutes turns into 15 or 20, I won\u2019t complain. That\u2019s the guerrilla nature of this.\u201d\n\nWalsh has posted a daily, one-minute video for every day of the challenge. That leaves nine minutes to tackle the area. Go!\n\nAs Walsh and I speak, I open my desk drawer. It\u2019s a jumble of old bank receipts, a page of 33-cent stamps, ticket stubs to a U2 concert, dead batteries, a monkey wrench, an empty airline bottle of Bloody Mary mix, an expired passport and spools of adding-machine tape for a machine I don\u2019t even own.\n\nWho did this? There is only one answer.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I challenged the challenger, \u201csay in 31 days, you restore order. Will it last?\u201d\n\nWalsh\u2019s answer reminded me of another principle shared by the processes of getting organized and losing weight.\n\nThose who succeed at losing weight and keeping it off substitute the word \u201clifestyle\u201d for the word \u201cdiet.\u201d Likewise, those who finally get organized and clutter-free must substitute the word \u201cnow\u201d for \u201clater.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you eliminate that one word from your vocabulary \u2014 I\u2019ll clean that later; I\u2019ll fold that later; I\u2019ll deal with that mail later \u2014 constant order will be yours,\u201d Walsh promised. \u201cDecisions delayed is the definition of clutter.\u201d\n\nBy now, I\u2019ve dumped everything out of that desk drawer. I\u2019m going in.\n\nThough Walsh designed the 31-day challenge start Jan. 1, Feb. 1, or any date, will work. Start the countdown now. Not later.\n\nHere are five easy ways to start, courtesy of Walsh.\n\n1. Pick one drawer\n\nIt can be in the kitchen, bedroom or office. Empty it. Toss what you don\u2019t need and reorganize it, putting back in only what belongs, and like with like.\n\n2. Get under one sink\n\nPull everything out. Wipe it down, then consolidate duplicates. Put back only what goes there. Try putting all cleaning supplies in one plastic caddy. Make the space sparkling, decluttered and organized.\n\n3. Make a donation basket\n\nGet a laundry basket. Then go around the house and pick seven things to put in it to donate them. Keep the basket by the door you use to leave the house, and get in the habit of tossing items in there that others may appreciate, but that you don\u2019t need, use or want.\n\n4. Wrangle your recipes\n\nI think I\u2019m organized, but here\u2019s a weak spot. I have a little notebook crammed with food-stained folded pieces of papers bearing recipes that I\u2019ve gathered over the years, the way a storm gathers clouds. It\u2019s a disorganized mess. Scan and digitally file them, said Walsh, then let them go. Or better, but more painful, toss them and make a pact with yourself that all recipes from now on will be digitized.\n\n5. Tackle the lower third\n\nThis is my favorite. Go into your closet, kitchen, office, or anywhere you have stacks of shirts, towels, papers or platters. Then pull out the lower third and get rid of it. \u201cIt sounds drastic,\u201d said Walsh, \u201cbut once people think about this, they slap themselves up the side of their head. Of course! We tend to use or wear the same items over and over again. And they stay on the top of the pile. The lower third, we seldom or never use. That third is not so hard to tackle.\u201d\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).
