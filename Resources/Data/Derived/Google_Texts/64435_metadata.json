Ted Cruz (R-TX) has fired his communication director, Rick Tyler, for peddling a video that falsely claims Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) was mocking the Bible, upon encountering one of his campaign staffers, along with his father, Rafael, at a Hampton Inn in South Carolina (via Politico):\n\nRubio ran into Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael Cruz, and a staffer in South Carolina on Saturday at a Hampton Inn. According to the Daily Pennsylvanian, which posted the video, the blog also had staffers present during the encounter. The website reported that Rubio suggested that the Bible did \u201c[n]ot have many answers in it.\u201d Cruz communications director Rick Tyler posted the story on Facebook but later deleted it and apologized after a Cruz staffer said Rubio didn\u2019t make any such comment. \u201cI want to apologize to Senator Marco Rubio for posting an inaccurate story about him here earlier today,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThe story showed a video of the Senator walking past a Ted Cruz staffer seated in the lobby of a hotel reading his Bible. The story misquoted a remark the Senator made to the staffer. I assumed wrongly that the story was correct. According to the Cruz staffer, the Senator made a friendly and appropriate remark.\u201d [\u2026] In the clip, Rubio tells the staffer he has \u201ca good book there.\u201d \u201cAll the answers are in there,\u201d he added. \u201cEspecially in that one.\u201d\n\nEarlier this afternoon, Sen. Cruz announced that he had asked for Tyler\u2019s resignation:\n\nTyler posted the story on Facebook but later deleted it and apologized after a Cruz staffer said Rubio didn\u2019t make any such comment. But Cruz decided greater action was needed. \"Our campaign should not have sent it. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked for Rick Tyler\u2019s resignation,\u201d Cruz said about the social media posting about the Daily Pennsylvanian article. He said he spent the morning investigating before coming to his conclusion. He added, \u201cI have made clear in this campaign that we will conduct this campaign with the very highest standards of integrity.\u201d Tyler\u2019s exit comes as the Cruz campaign has been under increased fire from his rivals, who have accused him of running a dirty campaign.\n\nThis video has correct transcript; any other is another dirty trick by Cruz camp. How do I know? I'm in the video!! https://t.co/llZGimU5Jp \u2014 Alex Conant (@AlexConant) February 21, 2016\n\nPrior to his termination, Sarah Rumpf at IJ Review contacted Tyler, saying that he backtracked on the false claim about the bible incident once the staffer in the video, named Collins, backed the Rubio campaign\u2019s version of events:\n\nTyler told Independent Journal Review that he called Collins, the Cruz staffer who was reading the Bible in the video, and asked him about the incident. According to Tyler, Collins backed up the Rubio campaign\u2019s version of the Senator\u2019s words. \u201cNo, no, no, he was very nice to me,\u201d Collins reportedly said about Rubio. \u201cI realized that the story got it wrong, so I deleted the post,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cWhen he [meaning Collins] told me it was wrong, I pulled it down.\u201d When asked about the reason for the several hours delay in deleting the Facebook post, Tyler said he \u201cforgot\u201d he had the Facebook post until another colleague on the campaign called him and told him, and then he deleted it.\n\nThe Rubio campaign responded by saying that Tyler was a good man, who had the \u201cunenviable task\u201d of working with a candidate who would \u201cdo or say anything to get elected.\u201d As Allahpundit noted, this firing had to come, given how South Carolinians thought Cruz ran an unfair campaign, and that Cruz needs to make sure that he a) doesn\u2019t look as if he \u201csmeared Rubio to death\u201d should he win b) he needs this Rubio-Cruz battle to be won fair and square should he draw Rubio\u2019s former supporters into his tent.\n\n.@marcorubio's director of communications, @AlexConant, responds to firing of Rick Tyler. pic.twitter.com/OUoN4hSC59 \u2014 Lauren Selsky (@LJSelsky) February 22, 2016\n\nPrior to Tyler\u2019s dismissal, Erick Erickson noted that it\u2019s become almost a fact on the campaign trail that Cruz is running a dirty presidential bid. This firing might have been an attempt to quell that narrative, but the damage is already done.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Out..05/27/2016 11:04:31AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Out.", "title": "Ted Cruz Fires Communications Director For Peddling Falsehoods About Rubio Video", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/02/22/ted-cruz-fires-communications-director-over-rubio-kerfuffle-n2123225", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/2/22/17.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Out.", "title": "Ted Cruz Fires Communications Director For Peddling Falsehoods About Rubio Video", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/02/22/ted-cruz-fires-communications-director-over-rubio-kerfuffle-n2123225", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/2/22/17.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz Fires Communications Director For Peddling Falsehoods About Rubio Video, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe story showed a video of the Senator walking past a Ted Cruz staffer seated in the lobby of a hotel reading his Bible.\n\u201cI want to apologize to Senator Marco Rubio for posting an inaccurate story about him here earlier today,\u201d Tyler said.\nAccording to Tyler, Collins backed up the Rubio campaign\u2019s version of the Senator\u2019s words.\nThe website reported that Rubio suggested that the Bible did \u201c[n]ot have many answers in it.\u201d Cruz communications director Rick Tyler posted the story on Facebook but later deleted it and apologized after a Cruz staffer said Rubio didn\u2019t make any such comment.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked for Rick Tyler\u2019s resignation,\u201d Cruz said about the social media posting about the Daily Pennsylvanian article."}
