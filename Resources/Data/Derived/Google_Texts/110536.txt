In one week, three major presidential candidates have stopped in Phoenix.

"They really think that Arizona is not only an important state but that the issues here really resonate across the country," political consultant Barrett Marson said.

First it was Republican candidate Donald Trump. Saturday it was Democrats Gov. Martin O’Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who drew the biggest crowd so far since starting his campaign.

"We can do it when we stand up and say, 'Enough is enough! The billionaires aren't going to have it all,'" Sanders said at the rally.

More than 11,000 people showed up, but Marson said many of them were in town for the Netroots Nation Conference.

"A lot of those people are from out of state," Marson said. "Those aren't just Arizonans. If you were to do that next week, that would not have been nearly as well attended."

Trump is still getting attention for the controversial comments he made during his rally before 4,200 people at the Phoenix Convention Center.

"Mexico is taking, I respect the country, they are taking our jobs; they're taking our manufacturing; they're taking our money; they're taking everything, and they’re killing us on the border,” he said at the rally.

"He got a good showing here in Arizona, and I’m sure he's going to want to build on that," Marson said.

There were also plenty of protesters at his speech.

"There's no doubt that Donald Trump is putting Arizona on the map as far as presidential politics, and people really need to start coming here and addressing the issues that we really care about whether it's the economy, Obamacare, immigration," Marson said.
