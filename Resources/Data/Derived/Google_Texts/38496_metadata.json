It provides a graphic example of how the TV outlet constantly works to cultivate a following as \u201cthe Broncos station.\u201d\n\nSome may wonder why 9News needs another reporter on the Broncos beat. Hardworking veteran Rod Mackey covers this turf well.\n\nNews director Christy Moreno puts the move in a station perspective, saying, \u201cCovering the Broncos is a year-round job.\u201d\n\nShe added that Klis, who covered the team for The Post for 10 years, will be on \u201cthe Broncos beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis knowledge about the team and the NFL in general is invaluable.\u201d\n\nMackey will still be involved in Broncos coverage and other sports stories.\n\nThis current relationship between Channel 9 and the Broncos, first signed in 2011 and renewed two years ago, is billed as a \u201cpartnership\u201d \u2014 an expensive one, as far as Channel 9 is concerned.\n\nThe station has never published details of the financial agreement, which covers many aspects of Broncos activities.\n\nExamples: One-on-one interviews with John Elway, the first local locker room access to players after games and cooperation with players and organization members when it comes to interviews and producing weekly programs such as \u201cBroncos Huddle,\u201d \u201cBroncos Tonight\u201d and \u201cBroncos Game Day Live.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most important, and profitable, part of the agreement allows KTVD-Channel 20, a sister station, to broadcast preseason games not covered by the national networks.\n\nThis summer, KTVD will televise \u2014 in prime time \u2014 all four contests: Aug. 14 at Seattle, Aug. 22 at Texas, Aug. 29 vs. San Francisco and Sept. 3 vs. Arizona.\n\nSince Broncomania builds steadily during late summer. the four games will draw a hefty advertising response while not disturbing Channel 9\u2019s national advertising schedule load on NBC.\n\nBeing an NBC affiliate also adds to Channel 9\u2019s prestige and pocketbook.\n\nIn recent years, \u201cNBC Sunday Night Football\u201d has been the most-watched network series in prime time, producing over-the-top ratings and strong advertising support.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t change during the upcoming season. And the Broncos are in the mix three times: Sept. 27 at Detroit, Nov. 1 at home against Green Bay and Nov. 29 at home against New England, a Tom Brady-Peyton Manning duel that could set an all-time audience figure for the NBC series, nationally and locally.\n\nSuch is the profit and power of being \u201cthe Broncos station.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, KCNC-Channel 4, Channel 9\u2019s major audience ratings challenger, is not sitting on the broadcasting sideline.\n\nCBS4,\u2019 once \u201cthe Broncos station,\u201d has its own local coverage agenda.\n\nLed on-air by the aggressive Vic Lombardi, the station continues to produce weekly seasonal Broncos programming while not trampling on Channel 9\u2019s corporate toes.\n\nAnd from strictly a game-viewing perspective, Channel 4 will be \u201cthe Broncos station,\u201d broadcasting 11 of the 16-game schedule on CBS, including the season opener on Sept. 13 in Denver against Baltimore, where Broncos coach Gary Kubiak was the offensive coordinator last season, and a Thursday night game Sept. 17 at Kansas City against the Chiefs.\n\nFox Sports and ESPN each have a Broncos game. The former will cover Minnesota\u2019s visit to Denver on Oct. 4. ESPN has the Cincinnati BengalsBroncos clash Dec. 28 in Denver, marking the 24th consecutive season the Broncos have been on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s a big season for Broncomania \u2014 and for \u201cthe Broncos station.\u201d\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post. Contact him at tvtime@comcast.net.\n\nTebow will have a job somewhere\n\nTim Tebow has TV job security even if he doesn\u2019t make the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 roster.\n\nESPN executive vice president John Wildhack recently sent a national e-mail memo saying, \u201cTim Tebow has a home at ESPN when his playing career is done.\u201d\n\nWildhack cited Tebow\u2019s analyst work last season on the network\u2019s SEC Channel, praising his \u201cwork ethic and passion for football.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dusty Saunders: Mike Klis adds to 9News\u2019 following as \u201cthe Broncos station\u201d", "title": "Dusty Saunders: Mike Klis adds to 9News\u2019 following as \u201cthe Broncos station\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/26/dusty-saunders-mike-klis-adds-to-9news-following-as-the-broncos-station/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-26T20:46:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T22:11:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad6c\"", "article_summary": "Mike Klis, veteran Denver Post Broncos beat writer, begins a television career Monday at KUSA-Channel 9.\nCBS4,\u2019 once \u201cthe Broncos station,\u201d has its own local coverage agenda.\nthe four games will draw a hefty advertising response while not disturbing Channel 9\u2019s national advertising schedule load on NBC.\nLed on-air by the aggressive Vic Lombardi, the station continues to produce weekly seasonal Broncos programming while not trampling on Channel 9\u2019s corporate toes.\nBeing an NBC affiliate also adds to Channel 9\u2019s prestige and pocketbook."}
