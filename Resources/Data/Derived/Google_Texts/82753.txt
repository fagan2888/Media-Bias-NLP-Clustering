The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Tuesday tapped Kevin Griffis to permanently serve as its top adviser on public affairs.

Griffis is currently the acting assistant secretary for public affairs, reporting directly to HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.

The White House announced the position on Tuesday, along with a half dozen other new administrative posts.

“These fine public servants bring a depth of experience and tremendous dedication to their important roles. I look forward to working with them,” Obama wrote in a statement.

He has served as a senior adviser to HHS’s assistant secretary for public affairs since May 2014. Previously, he helped run the campaign for Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and served as an adviser for the Department of Commerce.
