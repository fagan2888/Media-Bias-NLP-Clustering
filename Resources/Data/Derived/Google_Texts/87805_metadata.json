In fact, he writes, \u201cRepublicans have pounced on the narrow networks, citing them as further proof that President Obama lied when he said the Affordable Care Act would not cost people their doctors.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Baker wants you to know that none of this is Obama\u2019s fault (nothing ever is) \u2014 \u201c\u2026it\u2019s a market dynamic that Obamacare really didn\u2019t cause: It\u2019s a business balance between price and quality that existed long before the law was created.\u201d\n\nHe even quotes GW professor Sara Rosenbaum (who couldn\u2019t possibly be biased) as saying, \u201cThe administration has shouldered the blame for things that are so vastly beyond its control, and has attempted valiantly to work these problems out.\u201d\n\nYou see, it\u2019s just that those mean old insurers have chosen narrow networks in order to lower premiums \u2014 Obamacare has nothing to do with that decision even though it is valiantly shouldering the blame. Not only that, but \u201cit\u2019s largely up to the states to determine whether an insurance plan\u2019s network is adequate enough to actually make those benefits accessible.\u201d So poor Obama is being blamed for things that are entirely the doing of insurance companies and state regulators.\n\nBut before you get out your hankies to weep for Obama\u2019s victimhood let\u2019s consider a couple of things:\n\nMaybe, just maybe, Obama did cause the premiums to be higher by requiring coverage for every little thing anyone could ever want, from free contraception to pediatric dental in case the contraceptives didn\u2019t work. And maybe premiums are also higher because Obama requires insurers to accept everyone who applies without any difference in premiums due to their health status. Maybe insurers are trying to do what they can to keep down costs despite those extraordinary requirements.\n\nMr. Baker also minimizes the effect of skinny networks by suggesting that the main consequence is that there are fewer providers available and that people who were previously uninsured didn\u2019t have a doctor to lose, so wouldn\u2019t be bothered. The problem with that line of thinking is that it isn\u2019t just the number of providers, but the quality of those providers. If an insurance company reduces its payments by, say 40%, the best doctors and hospitals will decline to participate. They are in high demand and don\u2019t need to cut their fees to attract new patients. That leaves the second-rate doctors in the network. The newly insured will be getting second-rate care. One might think even Democrats would be concerned about that.\n\nNow, I wouldn\u2019t let the insurers off the hook here, either. Reducing their networks is not the only way to hold down premium costs. They might, for instance, simply limit what they pay to a fixed amount regardless of who provides the service. They could agree to pay $65 for a doctor\u2019s office visit \u2014 any doctor, anywhere. You might go to Dr. Jones who charges $65, while I much prefer Dr. Smith who charges $85. I am willing to pay the extra $20 to see the doctor I trust. The insurer is no worse of because Smith is not in the network. It pays the same $65 regardless.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t have to be confined to physician visits. WellPoint in California has decided to pay a flat $30,000 for a joint replacement regardless of the hospital. John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis puts it like this:\n\nLike other third-party payers, WellPoint discovered that the charges for hip and knee replacements in California were all over the map, ranging from $15,000 to $110,000. Yet there were 46 hospitals that routinely averaged $30,000 or less. So WellPoint entered an agreement with CalPERS (the health plan for California state employees, retirees and their families) to pay for these procedures in a different way.\n\nThe results were dramatic. Costs dropped by almost 20% in just a couple of years as facilities dropped their prices to attract CalPERS enrollees.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/03/the-buck-stops-where/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Confused-Doctor.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "The Buck Stops \u2013 Where?"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef53\"", "article_summary": "Maybe insurers are trying to do what they can to keep down costs despite those extraordinary requirements.\nAnd maybe premiums are also higher because Obama requires insurers to accept everyone who applies without any difference in premiums due to their health status.\nHe notes that some people are concerned about the limited networks offered by some of the plans on the Exchanges.\nCosts dropped by almost 20% in just a couple of years as facilities dropped their prices to attract CalPERS enrollees.\nThe problem with that line of thinking is that it isn\u2019t just the number of providers, but the quality of those providers."}
