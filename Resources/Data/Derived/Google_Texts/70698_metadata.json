Fellow co-host Raven-Symon\u00e9, no stranger to controversy herself, said that she plans to leave the country if a Republican is \"nominated.\"\n\nFrom Yahoo:\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s episode of ABC\u2019s daytime talk-fest \u201cThe View,\u201d Raven-Symon\u00e8 made a bold declaration \u2014 and a promise that we will hold her to. \u201cMy confession for this election is if any Republican gets nominated I\u2019m gonna move to Canada with my entire family,\u201d she asserted. Asked if she was joking, Raven-Symone declared, \u201cI already have my ticket. I literally bought my ticket, I swear.\u201d\n\nWhile I assume she means \"elected\" rather than \"nominated\"--like it or not, a Republican will at very least be the party nominee in the general election--it'll be curious to see if she follows through with her threat to leave.
