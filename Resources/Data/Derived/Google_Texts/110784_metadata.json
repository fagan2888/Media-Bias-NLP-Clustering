Americans have favored chicken as a broad category over beef in their diet since the early 1990s and the trend has only continued since then.\n\nThe National Chicken Council predicts that in 2014, Americans will have consumed 157 percent more chicken per capita compared to 50 years ago based on USDA data; while Americans will have consumed 27 percent less beef per capita in 2014, compared to 50 years ago.

The return of chicken fries on Burger King\u2019s menu has helped the company drive up its third-quarter sales. And Popeye\u2019s is reinventing itself to win the fried chicken war, as Forbes reported.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the golden age of poultry will continue in 2015.\n\nThe National Chicken Council estimates that the per capita consumption of poultry in 2015 will surpass that of red meat, which includes beef and pork, for the first time ever.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the staggering rise of beef prices this past year, poultry -- especially chicken -- is the top choice on Americans\u2019 shopping lists", "title": "2014: The Year the Chicken Beat the Bull", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/24/2014-Year-Chicken-Beat-Bull", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Whole_Chicken_emeadow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/24/2014-Year-Chicken-Beat-Bull", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Whole_Chicken_emeadow.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With the staggering rise of beef prices this past year, poultry -- especially chicken -- is the top choice on Americans\u2019 shopping lists", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1360\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe beef prices are at record high because cattle herd is low,\u201d said Tom Super, vice president of communications at the National Chicken Council.\nWith the staggering rise of beef prices this past year, poultry -- especially chicken -- is the top choice on Americans\u2019 shopping lists.\nThis is all mostly due to rising beef prices and concerns about health and fat consumption.\nMeanwhile, the price of a pound of fresh whole chicken only rose 0.4 percent to $1.50 and the price of a pound of boneless chicken breast actually fell 4.5 percent to $3.48.\nThe National Chicken Council estimates that the per capita consumption of poultry in 2015 will surpass that of red meat, which includes beef and pork, for the first time ever."}
