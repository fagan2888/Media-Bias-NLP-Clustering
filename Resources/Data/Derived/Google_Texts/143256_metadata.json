This the best course for everyone, especially our associates. We look forward to returning to the table and working through issues with the union. Kroger remains committed to providing all associates a solid and competitive pay and benefits package in this next contract. The parties have signed a contract extension through June 4.\"\n\n---\n\nKroger union employees voted Wednesday morning to reject the company's latest offer and to authorize a strike.\n\nThe strike would impact stores across the Roanoke Valley region, including Waynesboro, Staunton, and Harrisonburg.\n\nRead below for the full release from the union:\n\nThis morning, Kroger employees voted unanimously to reject the company\u2019s \u201clast best offer\u201d and to authorize a strike at 41 stores in the Roanoke Valley region. The associates are union members with the United Food & Commercial Workers\n\nLocal 400 and work as cashiers, meat cutters, stockers and clerks at Kroger stores.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but at the end of the day, we had to do it. Sometimes enough is enough,\u201d said Kevin Johnson, a Kroger associate and union member who voted in favor of the strike authorization.\n\nThe vote to authorize a strike took place at a union membership meeting at the Salem Civic Center earlier this morning. Before voting to authorize the strike, the members voted unanimously to reject a proposed collective bargaining agreement Kroger described as its \u201clast best offer\u201d to associates.\n\nThe offer would have provided only slight wage increases and no paid sick days for store associates. It also fell short of renewing Kroger\u2019s commitment to providing health insurance for its retirees.\n\n\u201cIt was a slap in the face,\u201d explained Todd Dolehanty, one of thirteen Kroger associates who make up the union\u2019s bargaining team in contract negotiations with the company. \u201cKroger is more successful than ever before. They just gave the CEO a 17% raise. But they told us, the people who make that success possible in the first place, that all they could afford was a quarter.\u201d\n\nKroger presented the last-\u00adminute proposal less than one hour before the current collective bargaining agreement was set to expire at midnight on Sunday, May 8. The bargaining committee voted unanimously to reject the offer before presenting it to the full membership for a vote this morning.\n\nKroger is the largest traditional grocer in the United States and made a record-\u00adbreaking $2.4 billion in profits last year alone. Last week, Rodney McMullen, the CEO of Kroger, was rewarded a 17 percent pay raise by the company\u2019s board of directors. His total compensation jumped from $9.2 million to a staggering $11.2 million. Assuming he works an average number of hours per year, which the federal Office of Personnel\n\nManagement estimates to be 2,087, McMullen now makes $5,366.55 per hour, or $89.44 per minute.\n\n\u201cThe company is earning record profits, $2.4 billion. It's time they take care of the associates that are in there every day working hard to make sure that company is successful,\u201d said Dawn Greenway, who works in the deli at a Kroger store in Roanoke and is a member of the union\u2019s bargaining committee.\n\n\u201cThe customers come into the stores for the local people employed there, not for the corporation,\u201d explained Mary Little, a department manager who has worked at the store in Boonsboro for nearly a decade.\n\nDespite its skyrocketing success, Kroger has refused to provide its associates with paid sick days and is proposing to force all retired employees off of the company-\u00adprovided healthcare and onto \u201cObamacare\u201d exchanges funded by taxpayers.\n\nThe strike authorization affects 41 Kroger stores in the region stretching from Kingsport, TN to Harrisonburg, VA. Approximately 3,000 of the affected associates are union members with Local 400 of the United Food & Commercial Workers (UFCW).\n\nKroger Stores Affected:\n\nKroger #118, Clifton Forge, VA\n\nKroger #202, Roanoke, VA\n\nKroger #208, Roanoke, VA\n\nKroger #209, Roanoke, VA\n\nKroger #210, Blacksburg, VA\n\nKroger #215, Radford, VA Kroger #226, Salem, VA\n\nKroger #228, Waynesboro, VA\n\nKroger #239, Charlottesville, VA\n\nKroger #255, Abingdon, VA\n\nKroger #261, Johnson City, TN Kroger #273, Bluewell, WV\n\nKroger #310, Harrisonburg, VA\n\nKroger #316, Princeton, WV Kroger #320, Salem, VA Kroger #322, Vinton, VA\n\nKroger #325, Roanoke, VA\n\nKroger #326, Lynchburg, VA\n\nKroger #327, Lynchburg, VA\n\nKroger #328, Kingsport, TN Kroger #330, Salem, VA\n\nKroger #334, Charlottesville, VA Kroger #335, Bristol, VA\n\nKroger #343, Staunton, VA\n\nKroger #345, Christiansburg, VA\n\nKroger #347, Rocky Mountain, VA\n\nKroger #350, Martinsville, VA\n\nKroger #359, Charlottesville, VA Kroger #364, Daleville, VA\n\nKroger #367, Johnson City, TN\n\nKroger #375, Roanoke, VA\n\nKroger #377, Forest, VA\n\nKroger #391, Roanoke, VA\n\nKroger #399, Hardy, VA\n\nKroger #400, Roanoke, VA\n\nKroger #401, Roanoke, VA\n\nKroger #402, Blacksburg, VA\n\nKroger #403, Waynesboro, VA\n\nKroger #404, Lexington, VA\n\nKroger #406, Appomatox, VA\n\nKroger #408, Lynchburg, VA\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kroger union employees voted Wednesday morning to reject the company's latest offer and to authorize a strike.", "language": "english", "author": "WHSV Newsroom", "og": {"url": "http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Area-Kroger-stores-could-start-strike-379962421.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Kroger+img.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Kroger union employees voted Wednesday morning to reject the company's latest offer and to authorize a strike.", "title": "Area Kroger stores could start strike"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kroger union employees voted Wednesday morning to reject the company's latest offer and to authorize a strike.", "title": "Area Kroger stores could start strike", "url": "http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Area-Kroger-stores-could-start-strike-379962421.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Kroger+img.jpg", "creator": "@WHSVnews", "site": "@WHSVnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Area Kroger stores could start strike", "fb": {"app_id": 108762971134, "pages": 65714680335}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "SeTCC1UrHA660Yrcmg1WXJUJ64XrPdobHPsmWMz55O4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Area Kroger stores could start"}, "article_summary": "Kroger Stores Affected:Kroger #118, Clifton Forge, VAKroger #202, Roanoke, VAKroger #208, Roanoke, VAKroger #209, Roanoke, VAKroger #210, Blacksburg, VAKroger #215, Radford, VA Kroger #226, Salem, VAKroger #228, Waynesboro, VAKroger #239, Charlottesville, VAKroger #255, Abingdon, VAKroger #261, Johnson City, TN Kroger #273, Bluewell, WVKroger #310, Harrisonburg, VAKroger #316, Princeton, WV Kroger #320, Salem, VA Kroger #322, Vinton, VAKroger #325, Roanoke, VAKroger #326, Lynchburg, VAKroger #327, Lynchburg, VAKroger #328, Kingsport, TN Kroger #330, Salem, VAKroger #334, Charlottesville, VA Kroger #335, Bristol, VAKroger #343, Staunton, VAKroger #345, Christiansburg, VAKroger #347, Rocky Mountain, VAKroger #350, Martinsville, VAKroger #359, Charlottesville, VA Kroger #364, Daleville, VAKroger #367, Johnson City, TNKroger #375, Roanoke, VAKroger #377, Forest, VAKroger #391, Roanoke, VAKroger #399, Hardy, VAKroger #400, Roanoke, VAKroger #401, Roanoke, VAKroger #402, Blacksburg, VAKroger #403, Waynesboro, VAKroger #404, Lexington, VAKroger #406, Appomatox, VAKroger #408, Lynchburg, VA\nThe strike authorization affects 41 Kroger stores in the region stretching from Kingsport, TN to Harrisonburg, VA.\n---Kroger union employees voted Wednesday morning to reject the company's latest offer and to authorize a strike.\nThe associates are union members with the United Food & Commercial WorkersLocal 400 and work as cashiers, meat cutters, stockers and clerks at Kroger stores.\nSometimes enough is enough,\u201d said Kevin Johnson, a Kroger associate and union member who voted in favor of the strike authorization."}
