Segarra is casting this as a race between \"us\" and \"them,\" while others are calling it a fight for Latino pride.\n\nSegarra effectively lost the Democratic endorsement to Luke Bronin -- a Greenwich native, a relative Hartford newcomer, and a white lawyer. Now, he's preparing for a primary -- and here's how state Rep. Minnie Gonzalez framed the fight ahead:\n\n\u201cThis fight we\u2019re going to finish in the streets. This fight is ours. It\u2019s ours with Pedro,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nAnd here\u2019s Segarra at a union endorsement, telling the crowd that there are \u201coutside interests\u201d trying to take the city over:\n\n\u201cPolitical power should not come from a chosen few privileged who feel, because they have power \u2013 the power of money \u2013 that they can buy themselves into office. This office is not for sale. Because this office belongs to us. And we own it. We own it,\" Segarra said.\n\nSo that leaves the obvious question. Who's the \"us\"?\n\n\u201cThe \u2018us\u2019 for me is the 124,942 people that reside in the city. That is the us,\u201d Segarra told WNPR.\n\nAnd the \"them\"?\n\n\u201cThe \u2018them\u2019 is people who are disengaged, and people who really have no real connection to our city. People whose length of residency in the city and whose efforts in terms of what they have produced for the city is very slim or none, at best,\u201d Segarra said.\n\nSegarra is careful not to define the contest as a racial or ethnic competition between Bronin and himself. The mayor does live in a big gated house in one of the city\u2019s wealthier neighborhoods bordering West Hartford \u2013 where many of his neighbors are white. But he said race isn't the issue.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s white is not the issue. The fact that he\u2019s disconnected and not really from here, and has a profile that\u2019s unlike anything that you see in our city, that\u2019s what makes him very disconnected,\" Segarra said.\n\nStill, Segarra is a proud Latino, and so are many of his supporters.\n\nTake Elvis Tejada, for instance. He writes in the local Spanish-language press. After Segarra walked out of the Democratic convention, Tejada wrote this in Identidad Latina:\n\nThey want to take away city hall from us. This seat isn\u2019t Pedro\u2019s. It belongs to the Peruvians, Dominicans, Brazilians, Colombians, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans.\n\nTejada goes on to say this race has awakened the Puerto Rican and Hispanic monsters.\n\n\"I cannot tell the Latino community not to be prideful that they have a Latino mayor,\" Segarra said. \"I cannot do that. They\u2019re entitled to that, right? But I will disencourage them, however, to turn this into some type of racial competition.\"\n\nSegarra's rhetoric falls flat for people like Janice Flemming, the founder of The Voices of Women of Color -- representing women of diverse backgrounds in the city. That organization is supporting Bronin.\n\n\"I have a hard time understanding that rhetoric when I sit at the table daily with Black, Latino women who have all decided that they wanted to go with Luke,\" Flemming said.\n\nShe also doesn't buy the idea that outsiders are trying to take city hall away from those who have it now.\n\n\"First of all, let's be clear. No one can take anything from you that is earned. And when you're consistent on what you're doing and if people see progress, then nobody can really touch you. So, I don't know who the 'us' the 'they' are. But, what I do know is that we're prepared to do the work for the guy that we believe in,\" Flemming said.\n\nFor his part, Bronin said that if anyone is disconnected, it\u2019s the mayor.\n\n\u201cI think some of the rhetoric he\u2019s been using is very disappointing and verging on irresponsible. We are a diverse city. And for Hartford to be as strong as it should be, we need to come together. The mayor needs to be the mayor of all of Hartford,\" Bronin said.\n\nThe primary is September 16.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra and his team are using some polarizing rhetoric as they try to hold on to Hartford city hall.
