Comet 209P/LINEAR is \u201can obscure, dim comet that circles the Sun every 5.1 years,\u201d as Sky and Telescope describes it. It radiates from a faint, little-known constellation known as Camelopardalis, the giraffe, which hovers near the North Star.\n\nThe best option for seeing the potential 100 to 200 meteors per hour\u2014one to two per minute\u2014is from a dark location, Sky and Telescope says. There is a slight chance, though, that this could become a meteor storm of 1,000 hourly.\n\n\u201cThis year the Camelopardalids could put on a display that rivals the well-known Perseids of August,\u201d according to a statement from NASA.\n\nRELATED: \u2018Fireball Champions,\u2019 Earth Grazers: Perseid Meteors Set Sky Ablaze\n\n\"Some forecasters have predicted more than 200 meteors per hour,\" said NASA astronomer Bill Cooke.\n\nThing is, it\u2019s not a sure thing. Astronomers agree that Earth will pass through the debris stream from this comet, but no one knows how much debris is waiting. It was left by the comet more than a century ago, and is thus a complete unknown.\n\n\"We have no idea what the comet was doing in the 1800s,\" said Cooke. \"There could be a great meteor shower\u2014or a complete dud.\"\n\nEither way, the one-time nature of this opportunity makes it worth getting up early\u2014or staying up late, depending on how you want to work it. Below, NASA explains why, and gives local times for best viewing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Astronomers across Turtle Island will be scouring the skies on Friday night in hopes of catching a cascade of stars, and we\u2019re not talking the red carpet kind.The May Camelopardalids, a new meteor shower, could set the sky ablaze to start off Memorial Day weekend.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/23/cascading-stars-may-kick-memorial-day-weekend-new-meteor-shower-154971", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/shooting_stars_clouds-cropped-thinkstock-179077784.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Cascading Stars May Kick Off Memorial Day Weekend in New Meteor Shower"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Cascading Stars May Kick Off Memorial Day Weekend in New Meteor Shower"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/23/cascading-stars-may-kick-memorial-day-weekend-new-meteor-shower-154971", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-23T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "meteors, shooting stars, meteor shower, Camelopardalids, Camelopardalid meteors, sky, space, astronomy", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Cascading Stars May Kick Off Memorial Day Weekend in New Meteor Shower"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe574f\"", "article_summary": "If the brand-new Camelopardalid meteor shower indeed comes to pass, it would be the first\u2014and only\u2014sight of what could be a firestorm of shooting stars, astronomers say.\nComet 209P/LINEAR is \u201can obscure, dim comet that circles the Sun every 5.1 years,\u201d as Sky and Telescope describes it.\nRELATED: \u2018Fireball Champions,\u2019 Earth Grazers: Perseid Meteors Set Sky Ablaze\"Some forecasters have predicted more than 200 meteors per hour,\" said NASA astronomer Bill Cooke.\nAstronomers across Turtle Island will be scouring the skies on Friday night in hopes of catching a cascade of stars, and we\u2019re not talking the red carpet kind.\nAstronomers agree that Earth will pass through the debris stream from this comet, but no one knows how much debris is waiting."}
