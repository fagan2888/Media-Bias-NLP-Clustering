Texas Health Resources, YouTube/screenshot\n\nThere\u2019s a party in Maryland, apparently. On Thursday night Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released a video of nurse Nina Pham joking around with her doctors. Pham, 26, became the first person infected with Ebola in the U.S. after caring for a Liberian patient in the hospital.\n\nOn Monday, she received a transfusion of antibodies to help fight the virus. She also received plasma from Kent Brantly, one of the first Americans involved with the outbreak \u2014 along with Nancy Writebol \u2014 to have survived infection. Pham is reportedly in good condition and improving.\n\nAccording to the hospital, after Pham's physician and coworker Dr. Gary Weinstein filmed the brief interaction, in which Pham goes from laughing to wiping away tears, she was flown to a National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Md. Texas Health Presbyterian says the move comes out of fear that the virus has overwhelmed the hospital.\n\nMore than 4,400 people have died from Ebola infections since its initial outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. The agency has called the outbreak the worst on record, and is scrambling to secure more funding to protect workers, doctors, and patients. The virus carries a mortality rate of around 70 percent across the three worst-hit countries, spreading through direct contact with blood or saliva.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nina, pham, texas, nurse, ebola, jokes, her, doctors, quarantine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ebola nurse and patient Nina Pham wants to hold a party in Maryland, even if she is in full quarantine.", "title": "Texas Nurse With Ebola Jokes With Her Doctors [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nina-pham-texas-nurse-ebola-jokes-her-doctors-quarantine-307318", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/ebola.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ebola nurse and patient Nina Pham wants to hold a party in Maryland, even if she is in full quarantine.", "title": "Texas Nurse With Ebola Jokes With Her Doctors [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nina-pham-texas-nurse-ebola-jokes-her-doctors-quarantine-307318", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/ebola.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/ebola.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-10-17T09:20:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-17T09:20:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ebola nurse and patient Nina Pham wants to hold a party in Maryland, even if she is in full quarantine."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd24\"", "article_summary": "On Thursday night Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released a video of nurse Nina Pham joking around with her doctors.\nEbola nurse and patient Nina Pham wants to hold a party in Maryland, even if she is in full quarantine.\nTexas Health Presbyterian says the move comes out of fear that the virus has overwhelmed the hospital.\nTexas Health Resources, YouTube/screenshotThere\u2019s a party in Maryland, apparently.\nPham, 26, became the first person infected with Ebola in the U.S. after caring for a Liberian patient in the hospital."}
