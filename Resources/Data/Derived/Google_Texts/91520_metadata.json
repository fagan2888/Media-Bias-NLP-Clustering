John Kasich is billed as the most moderate candidate in the 2016 Republican presidential field. Why?\n\nJim Newell Jim Newell is a Slate staff writer.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have much to do with his economic policy proposals, which are a plain-vanilla conservative blend of spending cuts, deregulation, and massive tax cuts predominantly favoring the wealthy. Toss in a dash of supply-side magic powder and you supposedly have a balanced budget, the rousing policy issue that Kasich, who helped balance the budget as a congressman in the \u201990s, has pegged as central to his candidacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nKasich, as he laid it out in one of his final New Hampshire town halls Monday before his second-place finish, calls for \u201cno more federal regulations outside of health and safety for one year,\u201d and promises to task his vice president with \u201cunraveling the regulatory morass in this country.\u201d He wants to compress the tax code to three brackets with a top marginal rate of 28 percent, down from the current 39.6 percent. He would lower the long-term capital gains rate back to 15 percent, lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, and eliminate the estate tax. He would cut Social Security. He would freeze nondefense discretionary spending, bump up defense spending (while targeting Pentagon waste), and block-grant federal food stamp and Medicaid programs to the states. All of this, he says in Mitt Romney\u2013esque language, is to inspire the \u201cjob creators\u201d to do their thing. Kasich is also strictly pro-life and once tried to crush unions in Ohio, though he did seem to cool down when voters overruled him in a referendum.\n\nSupporting a path to legalization shouldn\u2019t be enough to make Kasich liberals\u2019 favorite Republican candidate.\n\nSo what makes Kasich, once a welfare-cutting chief lieutenant in the Gingrich revolution, a \u201cmoderate\u201d this cycle? Eh, a couple of high-profile policy issues. He supports a path for legalization for undocumented immigrants. He also accepted the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion in Ohio with moralistic language that conservatives interpreted as a hostility against them: \u201cNow, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter,\u201d he famously said in 2013, \u201che\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.\u201d\n\nIt should be reiterated that the discretionary spending cuts and block-granting of programs for the poor that he proposes would amount to a disaster for the poor. But hey, one time in 2013 he said we should be nice to the poor, so there you go. Moderate!\n\nSupporting a path to legalization (not citizenship) and not rushing to blast all poor people into outer space should not be enough to make him liberals\u2019 favorite Republican candidate, though there\u2019s a low bar there. A policy apostasy or two aside, Kasich, also a former Fox News host and Lehman Brothers banker, is a fairly uniform conservative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat makes him stand out is what makes so many other so-called moderate heretics, such as ex\u2013House Speaker John Boehner or Sen. Lindsey Graham or Sen. John McCain, stand out in the Republican Party of 2016: He\u2019s a tactical realist who understands the limits of governance\u2014and thus, how to govern.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get any really big thing done if you just have one party,\u201d Kasich said while answering a question about his Social Security reform plan on Monday. \u201cWe have to have some form of bipartisanship. You\u2019ve got to have some people in the other party say, \u2018OK.\u2019 And in the course of it, you\u2019re going to have to talk to them about some of the things they want. You can\u2019t give away the store. There\u2019s a few places [I\u2019ll] have to give. That\u2019s life! I mean, where is it that we don\u2019t give? I don\u2019t know why we think politics is the only place where the answer is no, no, no, no, no.\u201d\n\nYou will not find many candidates who will admit this, which is to say \u201cadmit\u201d that they would govern in the way the United States government is designed to operate. Kasich doesn\u2019t paint the apocalyptic portrait of American politics or the state of the world that, say, Sen. Ted Cruz or every other candidate does. He\u2019s saying that he knows how to do what needs to be done, but in order to achieve it you\u2019re going to have to cut some deals with Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "He shouldn\u2019t be.
