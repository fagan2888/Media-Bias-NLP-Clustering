Louisiana Republican Rep. Vance McAllister announced on Tuesday that he\u2019s bringing Willie Robertson, whom he called a \u201cfriend, constituent and small business owner.\u201d South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham announced on Twitter Tuesday evening that he had given a guest ticket to Robertson\u2019s wife, Korie.\n\nProud to provide my guest ticket to tonight\u2019s SOTU to Korie Robertson. #DuckDynasty @bosshogswife pic.twitter.com/UKSGePeHry \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) January 28, 2014\n\nThe hit A&E reality show came under fire after Willie Robertson\u2019s father, Phil, made insensitive remarks about gay men in a December article in GQ. The patriarch was briefly suspended but was given back his gig.\n\nJoining them is Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, who was invited by Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, according to the Dallas Morning News. Hannity, a conservative stalwart, has expressed interest in running for political office in the Lone Star State.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has invited \u201cOhio employers struggling under Obamacare.\u201d That includes Joe Brown, president and CEO of Hartzell Propeller in Piqua, Wayne Deschambeau, president of Wayne HealthCare in Greenville, Laura Doerger-Roberts, president of Vinylmax Windows in Hamilton, and David Lippert, president of Hamilton Caster & Manufacturing Company.\n\n\u201cThese men and women have one important thing in common: the president\u2019s health care law is making it harder for them to hire,\u201d Boehner said in a statement. \u201cThey represent the countless number of employers across the country who are struggling right now, and having run a small business, I know where they are coming from. Their presence at the State of the Union is one way to help ensure their stories are told.\u201d\n\nThe purported target of the \u201cBridgegate\u201d traffic jam, Fort Lee, N.J. Mayor Mark Sokolich, will attend the speech with New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell. Earlier this month, emails revealed Christie\u2019s aides were involved in a plan to close traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge,possibly for political payback against Sokolich.\n\nHere are some other notable guests who have been invited to attend:\n\n\n\nJason Collins \u2013 The NBA vet, who announced he is gay in a Sports Illustrated story last spring, will be a guest of first lady Michelle Obama. The 35-year-old, who last played with the Washington Wizards, told ESPN: \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal that the administration has extended its hand to not only me, but my family, and also sports fans and also the gay community.\u201d\n\nJoey Hudy \u2013 The 16-year-old from Arizona, who impressed Obama with his marshmallow cannon at a science fair at the White House in February 2012, will be seated with the first lady\u2019s section. \u201cI am honored to announce that I will be sitting in Mrs. Obama\u2019s box during the State of the Union,\u201d the teen wrote on his blog.\n\nCarlos Arredondo and Jeff Bauman \u2013 The two survivors of the 2013 Boston Marathon attack will also be guests of President Obama\u2019s. An iconic photo from the double bombings showed Arredondo, 53, and Bauman, 27. Arredondo is seen helping Bauman, who lost both legs in the explosion. Bauman later helped identify the bombers. According to the White House, the two men have become \u201cclose friends.\u201d\n\nChad Henderson \u2013 The former Obama volunteer became a thorn for the White House after telling several media outlets he signed up for the Affordable Care Act. It turns out he didn\u2019t, and Henderson has since come out against the president\u2019s signature policy. He will be a guest of Texas Rep. Steve Stockman\u2019s. \u201cChad Henderson is Obamacare personified. He pushed ObamaCare on other people but refused to buy it himself because he would pay more,\u201d Stockman said in a statement. Last year, the lawmaker brought conservative rock star and gun-rights advocate Ted Nugent to Obama\u2019s State of the Union.\n\nSimone Sonnier-Jang \u2013 The Los Angeles fast food worker, who helped spark a national debate on inequality, will accompany Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez. Obama is expected to call again for raising the minimum age, which would undoubtedly affect the McDonald\u2019s employee.\n\nKenneth Bae\u2019s family \u2013 Myunghee Bae and Terri Chung, the mother and sister of the American who is currently behind bars in North Korea, will be the guests of Democratic Reps. Rick Larsen of Washington and Charles Rangel of New York. Bae, who was in North Korea as a tourist in 2012, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for alleged anti-government crimes. The punishment came amid high tensions between the U.S. and North Korea following Pyongyang\u2019s third nuclear test. The White House has repeatedly urged North Korea to release Bae, a Christian missionary who was living in China and leading tours to North Korea.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "From \"Duck Dynasty\" cast member Willie Robertson to conservative radio host Sean Hannity, here's a look at some of the guests who made the cut.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/duck-dynasty-state-of-the-union", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "From \"Duck Dynasty\" cast member Willie Robertson to conservative radio host Sean Hannity, here's a look at some of the guests who made the cut.", "title": "'Duck Dynasty' stars are attending the State of the Union", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/duck-dynasty-state-of-the-union", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/ap746185302111.jpg?itok=MzLnPYFS", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "'Duck Dynasty' stars are attending the State of the Union", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/duck-dynasty-state-of-the-union", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/ap746185302111.jpg?itok=Jfx9wic2", "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "From \"Duck Dynasty\" cast member Willie Robertson to conservative radio host Sean Hannity, here's a look at some of the guests who made the cut."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-28T17:30:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "From \"Duck Dynasty\" cast member Willie Robertson to conservative radio host Sean Hannity, here's a look at some of the guests who made the cut.", "nv": {"author": "aliyahfrumin", "title": "'Duck Dynasty' stars are attending the State of the Union", "tags": "democrats,duck-dynasty,republicans,state-of-the-union", "published": 1, "date": "01/28/2014 17:30:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/duck-dynasty-state-of-the-union"}, "news_keywords": "Democrats, Republicans, Duck Dynasty, State of the Union"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfddd\"", "article_summary": "Last year, the lawmaker brought conservative rock star and gun-rights advocate Ted Nugent to Obama\u2019s State of the Union.\nThe White House has repeatedly urged North Korea to release Bae, a Christian missionary who was living in China and leading tours to North Korea.\nThe punishment came amid high tensions between the U.S. and North Korea following Pyongyang\u2019s third nuclear test.\nBae, who was in North Korea as a tourist in 2012, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for alleged anti-government crimes.\nCarlos Arredondo and Jeff Bauman \u2013 The two survivors of the 2013 Boston Marathon attack will also be guests of President Obama\u2019s."}
