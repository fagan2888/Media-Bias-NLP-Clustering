On the Jimmy Kimmel Live show, Khalifa performed his famous song \u201cBlack and Yellow\" while the three ladies took turns signing the lyrics.\n\nAmerican Sign Language is a very demonstrative and expressive visual language, so it would only make sense that it would combine a language and performance at the same time. Statistics on Deaf Americans range because of the different scales that measure a person's level of deafness. According to Gallaudet Research Institute about two to four of every 1,000 people in the United States are \"functionally deaf.\u201d Anywhere from nine to 22 out of every 1,000 people have a severe hearing impairment or are deaf, and 37 to 140 out of every 1,000 people in the United States have some kind of hearing loss.\n\nASL interpretation is, as the name suggests, an interpretation of verbalized words. So you\u2019ll notice in the video below that the \u201ctranslations\u201d are not exact interpretations of what Khalifa raps.\n\nThe rapper is not that first music star to incorporate ASL into a performance. Wu-Tang Clan performed in Israel and had a sign language interpreter by their side signing the lyrics. Needless to say, their Deaf fans were extremely happy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "american sign language, wiz khalifa, jimmy kimmel", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Hip hop artist Wiz Khalifa is appealing to his deaf fans by including sign language interpreters in his performance.", "title": "Watch These Sign Language Interpreters Rap With Hip Hop Artist Wiz Khalifa [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rapper-wiz-khalifa-performs-black-and-yellow-jimmy-kimmel-live-help-american-sign-language-276022", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/wiz-khalifa-asl-interpreters_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hip hop artist Wiz Khalifa is appealing to his deaf fans by including sign language interpreters in his performance.", "title": "Watch These Sign Language Interpreters Rap With Hip Hop Artist Wiz Khalifa [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rapper-wiz-khalifa-performs-black-and-yellow-jimmy-kimmel-live-help-american-sign-language-276022", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/wiz-khalifa-asl-interpreters_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/wiz-khalifa-asl-interpreters_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-11T11:05:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-11T11:05:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hip hop artist Wiz Khalifa is appealing to his deaf fans by including sign language interpreters in his performance."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc569\"", "article_summary": "On the Jimmy Kimmel Live show, Khalifa performed his famous song \u201cBlack and Yellow\" while the three ladies took turns signing the lyrics.\nAmerican Sign Language is a very demonstrative and expressive visual language, so it would only make sense that it would combine a language and performance at the same time.\nWiz Khalifa wants to share his art and music with the Deaf community, and sign language interpreters Holly Maniatty, Joann Benfield, and Amber Galloway Gallego are helping him with that.\nWu-Tang Clan performed in Israel and had a sign language interpreter by their side signing the lyrics.\nSo you\u2019ll notice in the video below that the \u201ctranslations\u201d are not exact interpretations of what Khalifa raps."}
