The state House voted Friday to abolish Cover Oregon, the troubled independent agency that had been unable to deliver a working health-care exchange.

On a 42-14 vote, the House sent Gov. Kate Brown a measure that would jettison Cover Oregon and fold the operations of the agency into the state Department of Consumer and Business Services.

"We can put an end to an unfortunate chapter in our history," Rep. Nancy Nathanson, D-Eugene, said in support of Senate Bill 1.

The measure won bipartisan backing although some lawmakers were opposed because they said they weren't sure the consumer services agency had a valid plan for managing the insurance program.

Cover Oregon was created to manage Oregon's health insurance exchange under the federal Affordable Care Act, also often known as Obamacare. After the Cover Oregon website failed to work, the state last year began using the federal website to provide health insurance options for people seeking coverage under the new law.

Oracle America, the California software firm that had the contract to develop the Cover Oregon website, has threatened to go to court to block the legislation. The company, which is involved in a high-stakes legal battle with the state, says it's an attempt by the state to gain additional legal immunity.

Brown has praised the bill and indicated she would sign it.
