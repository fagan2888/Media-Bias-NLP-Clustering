This year, though, The Fan Club will be closed by the time homecoming rolls around.\n\nIn August, owner Stacey Schultz announced plans to close the business this fall. Schultz and her husband, Nick, have operated The Fan Club for several years, but now that their kids are out of high school and moving on with life, the Schultzes have chosen to move on with their own lives, as well.\n\nAlthough the announcement may surprise some \u2014 especially just as a new school year gets started \u2014 Stacey Schultz said the closing has been coming for more than a year. Competition from Farmington High School\u2019s school store and online sportswear companies have contributed to a decrease in sales over the past few years, she said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really made enough in the past two years to continue doing it,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cWe talked about it last year, but I wasn\u2019t ready yet. I hadn\u2019t made my personal peace with it.\u201d\n\nBut last year\u2019s cold winter stretched into a cool and damp spring. Business that ordinarily came along during the spring months was slow to come. The summer months went by. And finally Nick and Stacey decided the time had come to close The Fan Club.\n\nSince their kids are no longer in the local schools, they don\u2019t have the ties with FHS they did before. Nick has another business, and Stacey has already been looking for a new job in the corporate world.\n\nSimply put, the time has come to move on.\n\n\u201cThis never was our lifelong dream, to operate a sports apparel store or an ice cream shop,\u201d said Schultz, who also formerly owned Bugaloo\u2019s ice cream shop. \u201cThose were just moments of opportunity that presented themselves in our lives.\u201d\n\nThe move to close has been coming on all summer, she added. She\u2019s been running deep discounts on many items and putting clearance tags on others in an attempt to whittle down the store\u2019s inventory. Schultz worked out a deal with the FHS school store for them to take the remaining Tiger-wear inventory, and that went out over the weekend. As word of the store closing has gotten around, even some of the racks used to hold the inventory have been sold.\n\nThe Fan Club has also served the students at Rosemount High School, and Schultz has an array of Irish-wear still available at the store, and will cut prices on those items.\n\nThe Schultzes own several buildings in downtown Farmington, and they plan to hang on to the property. They are also working to line up new tenants for The Fan Club\u2019s site.\n\nBut by the time homecoming rolls around at the end of the month, The Fan Club itself will most likely be closed.\n\n\u201cHomecoming week is not going to be pretty, but we can\u2019t run a business based on one week out of the year,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nThe Fan Club will continue to sell out its remaining inventory until the end of September. Whatever is left at that time will be donated to an area charity.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,business,news,Business,Farmington,Community", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Michelle Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "Farmington Independent", "description": "Store will close by the end of September\r\nMichelle Leonard\r\nStaff writer\r\nNormally, the months between homecoming and Christmas are the busiest time of the year for The Fan Club Athletics in downtown Farmington.
