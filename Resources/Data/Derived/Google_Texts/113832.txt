George P. Bush won his race for Texas land commissioner Tuesday night, becoming the first member of the Bush political dynasty to win his initial bid for elected office.

The 38-year-old attorney from Forth Worth captured about 59 percent of the electorate, besting his closest competitor by 22 points, according to results posted by News Channel 10 KFDA in Amarillo, Texas.

Mr. Bush is the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the nephew of former President George W. Bush and grandson of former President George H.W. Bush.

None of those elder Bushes, however, won their first bids for office.
