Bassi, is being published by the American Meteorological Society.\n\nBassi comes to town to discuss and sign his book, Nov. 16 at the Boulder Bookstore and Nov. 17 at the Museum of Boulder.\n\n\"Boulder is a sun-earth city,\" Bassi responded when asked about the history of science in Boulder.\n\nHis book shares the unlikely stories of how this came to be.\n\nIn his second career after serving 26 years in the U.S. Air Force, Bassi earned a Ph.D. in history from the University of California-Santa Barbara in 2009. He's currently assistant professor of Arts and Sciences at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Worldwide.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Air Force sent Bassi to graduate school at the University of Colorado-Boulder to study space weather. He earned a master's degree in astrophysics and discovered the topic for a future Ph.D. thesis and book.\n\nIt was a natural fit.\n\n\"I love history and I love science,\" Bassi, a San Diego resident, said with enthusiasm.\n\nNow a specialist in 20th century U.S. science history, Bassi researched his thesis topic at multiple archives. While a Guggenheim Fellow at the National Air and Space Museum, he sifted through 80 boxes of Shapley's unprocessed papers at the Library of Congress.\n\nThe Boulder science story begins in the 1940s with Walter Orr Roberts, of Harvard University, and the High Altitude Observatory in Climax, Colo., according to Bassi.\n\nIn the 1950s, during the Cold War, the U.S. government was looking to move some facilities out of Washington, D.C., because of the threat of nuclear attack.\n\nThe Boulder Chamber of Commerce and Boulder citizens were certainly boosters for bringing the National Bureau of Standards' Central Radio Propagation Lab to Boulder. But Bassi discovered documents that showed formidable Democratic Colorado Gov. and U.S. Senator Edwin \"Big Ed\" Johnson claimed credit for bringing the NBS to Boulder.\n\nThe influence of Janet Roberts, wife of Walter Orr, shouldn't be overlooked. Roberts and his young family had moved to Boulder after Harvard teamed with the University of Colorado on the High Altitude Observatory, and Roberts began teaching at CU.\n\nLater, he was appointed the first director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. While locations were being discussed for the new facility, Janet Roberts let her husband know she preferred to stay in Boulder. Eventually NCAR was built here.\n\nThe history of Boulder science becomes more than a tale of pure scientific inquiry, thanks to personal drama, wheeling and dealing, political dynamics and unconventional funding sources.\n\nFormer CU presidents Robert Stearns, Ward Darley and Quigg Newton were instrumental in building Boulder's scientific community, Bassi says.\n\nThey took full advantage of opportunities for expanding scientific research programs after World War II.\n\nOther prominent scientific cities came with strong military connections and were centrally planned by the government, Bassi says.\n\nHis book suggests that Boulder's development as a science center had a very different dynamic. Less classified information led to more communication and sharing among scientists, he explains.\n\nWith the influx of hundreds of high-level scientists and their open and questioning minds, Boulder was forever changed.\n\nThrough the lens of Boulder, Bassi says, you can see how science developed in the United States from the 1930s to the 1960s:\n\n\"It's the story of how science moved West.\"\n\nCarol Taylor and Silvia Pettem write about history for the Daily Camera.
