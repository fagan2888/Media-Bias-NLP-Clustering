The Senate, meanwhile, has worked on a longer, six-year, $275 billion transportation funding measure, but lawmakers in the upper chamber have yet not revealed how their legislation would be paid for.\n\nThe traditional source of transportation funding has been revenue from the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax. The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and has struggled to keep pace with construction costs as vehicles have become more fuel efficient.\n\nThe federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on transportation projects, but the gas tax only brings in about $34 billion annually at its current rate.\n\nLawmakers have turned to other areas of the federal budget in recent years to close the gap, but Foxx argues the resulting temporary patches are preventing states from undertaking badly needed large construction projects.\n\n\"Congress's failure to pass a long-term bill of great concern to all of us who are engaged in the work of building and maintaining our nation's transportation infrastructure,\" he wrote. \"Careening from self-inflicted crisis to self-inflicted crisis undermines our system. We need Congress to break the cycle of short term extensions; we need a long-term bill with significant growth.\"\n\nTransportation advocates have pushed Congress to increase the gas tax for the first time in two decades to pay for a long-term infrastructure funding extension, but lawmakers have been reluctant to ask drivers to pay more at the pump.\n\nThe Obama administration, meanwhile, has suggested that lawmakers approve a six-year, $478 billion transportation funding bill that it says can be paid for largely with taxes that could be collected on corporate profits that are stored overseas.\n\nRepublicans have said they are open to the idea, known as repatriation, but the parties have squabbled about the rate of the corporate taxes and whether companies should be required to participate.\n\nFoxx said in his letter that the Obama administration's plan would end the streak of short-term infrastructure funding bills in Washington that has lasted for the better part of a decade.\n\n\"In an effort to provide long-term stability, and to move away from the uncertainty caused by short-term extensions that undermine State transportation programs, the administration\u2019s GROW AMERICA proposal and its Fiscal Year 2016 budget request call on Congress to enact a six-year, $478 billion surface transportation reauthorization proposal,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Not only does this proposal provide states with extended funding certainty, it also increases Federal surface transportation investment by 45 percent, providing funding growth and smart policy reforms to strengthen the American economy,\" Foxx continued.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Transportation Department said payments would be cut off on July 31.", "description": "The Transportation Department said payments would be cut off on July 31.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Transportation Department said payments would be cut off on July 31.", "title": "Feds warn states about highway funding cliff", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247817-feds-warn-states-about-highway-funding-cliff", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/construction_capital_beltway_hov_lanes_va_07_2010_mario_ortiz.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-14T12:36:33-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-14T12:36-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247817-feds-warn-states-about-highway-funding-cliff", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-14T11:25-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, MAP-21 Reauthorization, Grow America Act, DRIVE Act, Gas Tax, Repatriation,Anthony Foxx,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-14T11:25:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T12:36:33-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247817-feds-warn-states-about-highway-funding-cliff", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Transportation Department said payments would be cut off on July 31.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds warn states about highway funding cliff"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds warn states about highway funding cliff"}, "article_summary": "The transportation funding debate has loomed large in Washington this year as lawmakers punted in May deadline, pushing the deadline to July 31.\nThe traditional source of transportation funding has been revenue from the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax.\nFoxx said in his letter that the Obama administration's plan would end the streak of short-term infrastructure funding bills in Washington that has lasted for the better part of a decade.\nLawmakers in both parties have expressed a desire to pass a new transportation funding bill, but consensus on how to pay for it has been elusive.\nThe Senate, meanwhile, has worked on a longer, six-year, $275 billion transportation funding measure, but lawmakers in the upper chamber have yet not revealed how their legislation would be paid for."}
