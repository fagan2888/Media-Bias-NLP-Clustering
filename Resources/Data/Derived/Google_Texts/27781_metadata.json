To effectively tackle this issue, he told attendees that healthcare leaders need to provide \"a quality of care that's standard but that is delivered in a customized way.\"\n\nThat goal, in turn, can't be accomplished without understanding the unique needs of diverse groups of patients, such as the aging lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) population, said Jerrold Maki, vice president of special projects at Stanford Health Care (pictured right). At the very least, providers need to have \"just an awareness that there's a need\" to address care quality disparities among LGBT patients, Maki told FierceHealthcare in an exclusive interview.\n\nHowever, the tide is definitely turning toward inclusion. \"For so long, [diversity initiatives have] been focused on racial issues,\" he said. \"Finally there's recognition that LGBTers are part of that.\"\n\nProviders throughout the continuum of care also need to undergo training on how to treat LGBT patients, according to Maki. \"Caregivers have to be comfortable learning about the patient's sexual history,\" he told FierceHealthcare.\n\nAnother group that suffers from healthcare disparities is the rising Latino population, David Luna, principal consultant for Teammates for Health Equity, said during the seminar. Access to care is a particularly pressing issue for this population, he said, so \"we're going to have to figure out solutions to the fact that a large portion of the Latino population does not have a medical home.\"\n\nTreating the Asian-American population, on the other hand, comes with its own unique challenges, said James Lee, executive vice president and chief operating officer at NewYork-Presbyterian/Lawrence Hospital. For example, while Asian women have the longest life expectancy of any ethnic group in the United States and Asian-Americans are less likely to live in poverty than the U.S. population, he said language and cultural barriers can impede their access to healthcare, and 50 percent of Americans with hepatitis B are of Asian descent.\n\nDiversity in healthcare is also an issue close to the heart of Henry Ford Health System CEO Nancy Schlichting, a member of the LGBT community who discussed the subject at a breakfast for women healthcare executives. Inclusion isn't only the right thing to do, she said, it also makes good business sense for healthcare systems. \"When every community feels that this is a place where they will be treated well, guess what? We grow,\" Schlichting said.\n\nWhile the task may seem daunting, Boyd suggested the best approach to chip away at healthcare disparities is to take on \"bite-sized pieces\" by developing successful outreach and health management programs. The bottom line is, \"health should be available to all people the same way,\" he said.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n2015 ACHE Congress: Healthcare industry needs strong, diverse leadership\n\nACHE 2015: 4 habits of highly effective healthcare leaders\n\n4 ways to tackle healthcare disparities\n\nThe future of population health management\n\nMore hospitals protect gay patients--but not staff--from discrimination\n\nHow one rural hospital is rethinking population health management\n\nLack of education breeds disparities despite equal access to care\n\nHow healthcare leaders can make it clear that black lives matter\n\n3 ways hospitals can address healthcare disparities among diverse patient populations", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare's biggest challenge in an era of value-based care is to target the causes of poor health before patients require medical intervention, according to a panel discussion on\u00a0population health management\u00a0for diverse populations this week at the\u00a0American College of Healthcare Executives' 2015 Congress.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare's biggest challenge in an era of value-based care is to target the causes of poor health before patients require medical intervention, according to a panel discussion on\u00a0population health management\u00a0for diverse populations this week at the\u00a0American College of Healthcare Executives' 2015 Congress.", "title": "ACHE 2015: Healthcare must focus on vulnerable populations", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/ache-2015-healthcare-must-focus-vulnerable-populations/2015-03-19", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "ACHE 2015,ACHE Congress,American College Of Healthcare Executives ACHE,Fierce exclusive,Healthcare Disparities,Jerrold Maki,LGBT patients,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction,Population Health Management,Stanford Health Care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb492\"", "article_summary": "Providers throughout the continuum of care also need to undergo training on how to treat LGBT patients, according to Maki.\nAnother group that suffers from healthcare disparities is the rising Latino population, David Luna, principal consultant for Teammates for Health Equity, said during the seminar.\nWhile the task may seem daunting, Boyd suggested the best approach to chip away at healthcare disparities is to take on \"bite-sized pieces\" by developing successful outreach and health management programs.\nRelated Articles:2015 ACHE Congress: Healthcare industry needs strong, diverse leadershipACHE 2015: 4 habits of highly effective healthcare leaders4 ways to tackle healthcare disparitiesThe future of population health managementMore hospitals protect gay patients--but not staff--from discriminationHow one rural hospital is rethinking population health managementLack of education breeds disparities despite equal access to careHow healthcare leaders can make it clear that black lives matter3 ways hospitals can address healthcare disparities among diverse patient populations\nTo effectively tackle this issue, he told attendees that healthcare leaders need to provide \"a quality of care that's standard but that is delivered in a customized way.\""}
