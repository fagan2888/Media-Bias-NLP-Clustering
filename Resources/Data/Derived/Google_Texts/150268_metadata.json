Featured guests include Gary Harbison, executive director for the Missouri Coalition for Oral Health. Here is a sample of their conversation.\n\nQ&A: The Dental Care Landscape in Missouri\n\nCould you give us a bit of an overview of the challenges Missouri faces when it comes to oral health?\n\nIt\u2019s a much more complex issue that most people realize. You have basically every number available that says a bad story about Missouri. We know that we\u2019re 47th among states in access to oral health. That\u2019s a terrible place to be for Missouri. It means a lot of people are not getting oral healthcare when they need it, and that\u2019s very important because without good oral health, you\u2019re not going to have good overall health. Any of the other numbers tell the same story. About the only thing we\u2019re good at is fluoridation of public water, which is a great public health intervention.\n\nWhy are so many people without dental insurance?\n\nIt is not a priority for the public. It\u2019s not a priority for policymakers. In the Medicaid program, and this is one of the issues we\u2019ve been working on, there is no coverage for adults on Medicaid in Missouri. It is in the budget for 2016. The budget has been signed, but it hasn\u2019t moved to implementation and there are some details as to why that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nSo we\u2019re really waiting to see if that budget goes into effect with the money for adult dental care and Medicaid?\n\nThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s paid for by tax amnesty funds, which started November 1, but the administration has maintained that money has to be coming in before they\u2019re going to start moving to implementation. There\u2019s a couple of administrative pieces that will slow it down further.\n\nDental healthcare for adults hasn\u2019t been in Medicaid since 2005.\n\nThat\u2019s correct. It\u2019s been many, many years. We consider the work that we\u2019ve done, as a coalition and with our partners to get it back into the budget both for 2015 and 2016, to be a real success story. But we want to see that next piece. We want to see it be moved to implementation.\n\nHow is dental care for children and young people in Missouri specifically today?\n\nWe\u2019re better in Missouri. For a long time, our Medicaid level of kids has been fairly high\u2014that is, the poverty level that you have to have to achieve Medicaid eligibility. Matter of fact, it\u2019s at the level that the Affordable Care Act requires for kids. However, behind that there are problems. Rates are very poor for providers. They\u2019re unchanged for a number of years. We only have 11 percent of the dentists in Missouri participating in the Medicaid program. So, if you\u2019re a child with Medicaid and your parents want to get dental care for you, you\u2019re still going to have issues with accessing.\n\nWhy do you think the provider rates are so low?\n\nI think the state hasn\u2019t taken a good, hard look at what this means, that people cannot actually access care. Until they do that and pull those rates up\u2014and there has been progress there in the past few years\u2014but until they do that, it\u2019s unlikely that private practitioners are going to come back to the Medicaid table in large numbers. We have had growth in federal-qualified health center dental services. They have generally prioritized children, so that\u2019s been helpful. But they\u2019re not everywhere and they can\u2019t serve everyone\u2014they\u2019re not that big.\n\nWhat are those centers?\n\nFQHCs [federal-qualified health centers] are federally funded, and there\u2019s state funding. They provide services on a sliding scale, and so a lot of people access care by going to those clinic through the state of Missouri.\u201d\n\nAnother thing that I\u2019ve been reading about is that people are actually going to the emergency room because of dental problems. Could you tell us a little about that?\n\nWe have lots of people go into emergency rooms for untreated dental conditions. These are not like an accident where you broke a tooth and then you go to the ER. These are situations that could have been handled if they had regular dental care. They haven\u2019t, so they get in pain. They maybe have swelling in their face. It gets to the point where it\u2019s intolerable and they go to the ER. Many of these folks are Medicaid folks, because they had Medicaid coverage for emergency room services, even though they don\u2019t have coverage for dental. They go there and the emergency rooms are expensive and they don\u2019t provide dental care. So what would typically be done is that they would do an assessment and determine, yes, this person is in terrible pain and they have an infection, so they get painkillers, antibiotics, and they\u2019re told \u201cGo get a dental appointment,\u2019 which they typically can\u2019t do. They end up back in the emergency room later.\n\nIt\u2019s a circle, because you\u2019re not addressing the real problem.\n\nIt\u2019s about $17.5 million that they spend in the emergency room per year on that situation.\n\nIs that nationwide or just in Missouri?\n\nThat\u2019s Missouri.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money.\n\nIt is a lot of money and a tremendous amount of inefficiency in our system.\n\nInterview has been edited for length and clarity\n\nTo hear the rest of Harbinson's interview and more about what is being done to improve dental care access in Missouri, listen to the entire show.\n\nIntersection is produced by Caty Eisterhold and Daniela Vidal.
