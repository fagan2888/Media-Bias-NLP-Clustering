Reuters\u2019 Alexandra Ulmer crafts a dead-perfect look at the disastrous outcomes from Hugo Chavez\u2019 embrace of Castro-style communism in Venezuela, and the potential reckoning Chavez\u2019 family and political heirs may face in less than two weeks. She starts with an orange tree planted by Chavez himself in honor of his own revolution, and how it has turned as sickly as his nation:\n\nJust like its botanical namesake, the movement Chavez called \u201cThe Beautiful Revolution\u201d is ailing ahead of Dec. 6 legislative elections \u2013 including in Sabaneta, his sleepy hometown in Venezuela\u2019s agricultural heartland. Over a decade of increasingly dysfunctional state controls and the end of an oil bonanza have triggered one of the OPEC nation\u2019s most severe economic crises. Just blocks from where Chavez grew up and sold his grandmother\u2019s papaya sweets to make ends meet, Venezuelans now line up for hours hoping a truck will make its way across the palm tree-sprinkled flatlands to deliver scarce rice or toilet paper. Rampant inflation and the near-collapse of the bolivar currency have destroyed salaries, while violent crime leads many to barricade themselves inside when the region\u2019s vast sky turns dark.\n\nThe destruction of the once-vibrant Venezuelan economy has served as a warning to its neighbors. Argentinians booted the Peronists from power last week, along with their Chavez-lite economic policies, in favor of free-market-friendly Mauricio Macri. Macri pledged during his campaign to end nationalizations, bring back foreign investors, and return to a pro-Western foreign policy, which won him a seven-point victory over the Kirchner machine. The Chavistas in Venezuela reacted \u2026 poorly:\n\nIf that seems a little like overcompensation, well, read the rest of Ulmer\u2019s article. The Chavistas are politically vulnerable, and without Chavez himself, they are being exposed as corrupt. In order to deal with the popular unrest that Chavez\u2019 policies have wrought, the Chavistas are renaming everything in sight for Chavez in an attempt to exhume his political corpse and put it on the campaign trail. So far, though, that doesn\u2019t appear to be working, and they are clearly frightened that Venezuelans will make the same choice that Argentinians did last week. That is, if the Chavistas allow them to make that choice, which still remains to be seen.\n\nUlmer returns to the diseased tree Chavez planted at the end of the article, for a final ironic coup de grace:\n\nChavez\u2019s kin might need a miracle \u2013 as does his tree named \u2018revolution\u2019. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked for help, poison for the infestation, and things like that,\u201d said Hidalgo in the backyard where Chavez once played marbles and ate mangoes. \u201cBut they haven\u2019t sent anything.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing to send. Welcome to the end state of what happens when you run out of other people\u2019s money.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Running out of other people\u2019s money.", "title": "Reuters: In Venezuela, a tree named \u201cRevolution\u201d wilts from disease", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/27/reuters-in-venezuela-a-tree-named-revolution-wilts-from-disease/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T18:46:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-27T18:24:39+00:00"}, "keywords": "Argentina, chavez, communism, Nicolas Maduro, socialism, Venezuela,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Reuters: In Venezuela, a tree named \u201cRevolution\u201d wilts from diseaseposted at 1:46 pm on November 27, 2015 by Ed MorrisseyAnd so does the Chavista movement \u2014 like the tree, from the inside out.\nWelcome to the end state of what happens when you run out of other people\u2019s money.\nUlmer returns to the diseased tree Chavez planted at the end of the article, for a final ironic coup de grace:Chavez\u2019s kin might need a miracle \u2013 as does his tree named \u2018revolution\u2019.\nThe Chavistas in Venezuela reacted \u2026 poorly:If that seems a little like overcompensation, well, read the rest of Ulmer\u2019s article.\nArgentinians booted the Peronists from power last week, along with their Chavez-lite economic policies, in favor of free-market-friendly Mauricio Macri."}
