Reid, Founder and CEO, EaseCentral.\n\n\u201cThe MACRA options allow a provider to choose how they will be paid and the results will differ based on practices. Providers will choose between different reimbursement methods that will clearly effect how networks broadly treat Medicare patients,\u201d he says.\n\nMerit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) versus the Alternative Payment Model (APM) are reimbursement mechanisms that will produce a different payment result to provider groups based on their practice patterns, according to Reid.\n\nReid\n\n\u201cThe care received by a patient will likely be different based on the method adopted by the provider,\u201d Reid says. \u201cHow is that best for the consumer? Once a provider chooses the reimbursement model, practice patterns will likely follow to maximize results.\"\n\nWith the goal of improving cost control by linking reimbursement more closely to outcomes, MACRA leaves all reporting in the hands of the provider, according to Reid.\n\n\u201cWhen identifying issues such as \u2018efficient resource use\u2019 relative to \u2018patient outcome\u2019 as a driver for financial reimbursement, providers are going to be under financial pressures when making daily decisions about what is best for their patients,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cWe have to address cost as a society, we all realize this,\u201d Reid says. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s hard enough to select a quality provider. Now, the patient is going to have to be aware of how their condition fits into a reimbursement model selected by their provider, to determine which source will provide the best care.\u201d\n\nNext: Grappling with the complexities", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "MACRA, which will further the shift to value-based reimbursement, has industry insiders grappling with the complexities, particularly those related to reporting guidelines for providers.", "Description": "MACRA, which will further the shift to value-based reimbursement, has industry insiders grappling with the complexities, particularly those related to reporting guidelines for providers.", "og": {"url": "http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/managed-healthcare-executive/news/macra-final-rule-could-hit-healthcare-industry-hard", "image": "http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/HealthCare/2016/05/11/0da2777d-5884-47c0-97c7-5d093302d905/Nilesh%20Chandra%20(002).jpg.jpeg", "site_name": "Managed Healthcare Executive", "description": "As CMS released the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) implementation proposed final rule to align and modernize how Medicare payments are tied to the cost and quality of", "title": "MACRA final rule could hit healthcare industry hard"}, "DC.identifier": "http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/node/421624", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.date": "2016-05-11", "last-modified": "Wed, 11 May 2016 19:12:33 GMT", "DC.creator": "Tracey Walker", "DC.source": "Managed Healthcare Executive", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "alternative payment models, Business Strategy, CHIP, Consumers, EaseCentral, Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Healthcare Reform, Hospitals & Providers, Hospitals & Providers Strategy, Legislation, MACRA, Medicare, Medicare beneficiaries, MHE Articles, MIPS, PA Consulting Group, providers, reporting structure", "emsContentType": "MACRA final rule could hit healthcare industry hard", "DC.title": "MACRA final rule could hit healthcare industry hard"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHowever, it\u2019s hard enough to select a quality provider.\nProviders will choose between different reimbursement methods that will clearly effect how networks broadly treat Medicare patients,\u201d he says.\nReid\u201cThe care received by a patient will likely be different based on the method adopted by the provider,\u201d Reid says.\nOnce a provider chooses the reimbursement model, practice patterns will likely follow to maximize results.\"\n\u201cThe MACRA options allow a provider to choose how they will be paid and the results will differ based on practices."}
