(APRIL GUILMET PHOTO)\n\nRockin'\n\nSouth School drama club lends funky touch to fairy tale\n\n\n\n\u2014 Over 200 years after the Brothers Grimm penned \"Snow White,\" a cast of more than 60 South Elementary School students is lending a modern twist to the beloved fairy tale.\n\n\n\nFrom the colorfully painted backdrops of woodland scenes and magic mirrors to the upbeat musical score, \"The Rockin' Tale of Snow White\" tells the familiar story in a way the Grimms never could have imagined.\n\n..\n\nPerformances of the musical will take place on Thursday and Friday evenings. The cast will also perform the show for their classmates and teachers during school hours on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nTeacher Deanna Poulin, who has led the school's drama program for the past several years, said the show is school's first musical.\n\n..\n\n\"There's a lot of different components to this particular show,\" Poulin said. \"We have ballads, we have rapping. There's all kinds of music and dancing.\"\n\n\n\nAnimals sing and dance, Snow White's magic mirror has a penchant for rap music and as for these seven dwarves, well they're more likely to \"doo-wop\" than \"hi-ho.\"\n\n..\n\nAuditions for the show took place in the fall, giving the students plenty of time to build stage props, paint backdrops and perfect their costumes, with rehearsals held twice each week.\n\n\n\nFifth-grader Jillian Maguire plays the role of the evil queen and she said she's been having plenty of fun perfecting her character.\n\n..\n\n\"I just think of stuff that makes me angry,\" she said. \"Then I take it out on stage.\"\n\n\n\nPlaying the role of the queen's sinister pet bats are fourth-grader Sage Matzker and fifth-grader Jonathan Mok.\n\n\n\n\"We get to rap along with our buddy, the queen,\" said Matzker. \"It's definitely not like the Disney movie.\"\n\n..\n\nFellow fifth-grader Greg Lindquist has been polishing his hip-hop moves to play the role of the singing and dancing magic mirror.\n\n\n\nLindquist had two words to describe his first theater experience. \"It's awesome,\" he said.\n\n..\n\nBoth public performances of \"The Rocking Tales of Snow White\" will begin at 7 p.m. Tickets are $2 per person or $10 per family. Students and staff will also host a bake sale during intermission, with all proceeds to go toward next year's annual show.\n\n..\n\naguilmet@newstote.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Londonderry South Elementary School to perform 'The Rockin' Tale of Snow White' this week.", "title": "Rockin' | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Londonderry South Elementary School to perform 'The Rockin' Tale of Snow White' this week.", "title": "Rockin' | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140407/NEWS04/140409386", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20140407/NEWS04/140409386/AR/0/AR-140409386.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Education", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "date": "2014-04-07 00:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "keywords": "Education, Entertainment, Londonderry, Photo Feature,", "twitter": {"description": "Londonderry South Elementary School to perform 'The Rockin' Tale of Snow White' this week.", "title": "Rockin' | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140407/NEWS04/140409386", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20140407/NEWS04/140409386/AR/0/AR-140409386.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda97\"", "article_summary": "Both public performances of \"The Rocking Tales of Snow White\" will begin at 7 p.m. Tickets are $2 per person or $10 per family.\nSouth School students, from left, Sage Matzker, Jillian Maguire, Jonathan Mok and Greg Lindquist rehearse a scene from \u201cThe Rockin' Tale of Snow White\u201d Friday afternoon.\nStudents and staff will also host a bake sale during intermission, with all proceeds to go toward next year's annual show.\nTeacher Deanna Poulin, who has led the school's drama program for the past several years, said the show is school's first musical.\nFellow fifth-grader Greg Lindquist has been polishing his hip-hop moves to play the role of the singing and dancing magic mirror."}
