Univision and NBC cut ties to Donald Trump and he won't be returning to The Apprentice, his long-running television show, because of the inflammatory comments he made about Mexican immigrants last week. But, he doesn't seem to care. Despite the comments, or maybe because of them, his appeal seems to rise with his belligerence.

I'm not sure the Republican Party is as happy with him as he is with himself. Trump told the New York Times that Reince Priebus, party chairman for the party, tried to quietly urge him to "soften his tone on immigrants even as he offered praise of his candidacy." Republicans seem stuck between a rock and a hard place - they need the votes of voters that love him - even if the party doesn't love Trump. So, who are these people that love him?

We also talk about the vast landscape of technologic narcissism, a topic that embraces death by selfie stick, charging your phone on the Broadway stage and Arianna Grande's famous lick.
