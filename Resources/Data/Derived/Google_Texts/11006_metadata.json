Both companies stand accused of egregious human rights abuses at their facilities, from denial of mental and physical health care to inadequate nutrition.\n\n\u201cPrivate prisons have a long and well-documented history of giving to candidates of all levels and both parties and hiring lobbyists across the spectrum, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that prisons are trying to get in good with presidential candidates,\u201d Cristina Parker of Grassroots Leadership, a Texas-based organization that opposes prison profiteering, toldCommon Dreams.\n\n\u201cWe already know that, in the immigration system, private prisons have a huge and outsized influence and they certainly don\u2019t need any more,\u201d Parker added. \u201cIt is bad for all of us when these multibillion dollar companies use their considerable financial influence to try to pressure lawmakers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "'It is bad for all of us when these multibillion dollar companies use their considerable financial influence to try to pressure lawmakers.'", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sarah Lazare | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "'It is bad for all of us when these multibillion dollar companies use their considerable financial influence to try to pressure lawmakers.'", "title": "Private Prison Lobbyists Fundraising For Clinton", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/private-prison-lobbyists-fundraising-for-clinton/207939/", "image": "http://www.commondreams.org/sites/default/files/styles/cd_large/public/headlines/geo_0.jpg?itok=9BvX2eTy", "updated_time": "2015-07-24T16:04:16-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It is bad for all of us when these multibillion dollar companies use their considerable financial influence to try to pressure lawmakers.'", "title": "Private Prison Lobbyists Fundraising For Clinton", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DEM-2016-Clinton-_Muha.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "private prison", "published_time": "2015-07-25T05:00:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T16:04:16-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Critics say the fresh evidence of Clinton\u2019s ties to lobbyists for the private prison industry raises a host of new concerns.\n\u201cWe already know that, in the immigration system, private prisons have a huge and outsized influence and they certainly don\u2019t need any more,\u201d Parker added.\n\u201cAkin Gump lobbyist and Clinton bundler Brian Popper disclosed that he previously helped CCA defeat efforts to compel private prisons to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests,\u201d noted Fang.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor[findthebest id=\u201d2u4F7VlEuuV\u201d title=\u201dHillary Clinton Presidential Candidate Profile\u201d width=\u201d600\u2033 height=\u201d500\u2033 url=\u201d//www.findthebest.com/w/2u4F7VlEuuV\u201d link=\u201dhttp://presidential-candidates.insidegov.com/l/40/Hillary-Clinton\u201d link_text=\u201dHillary Clinton Presidential Candidate Profile | InsideGov\u201d]\u201cThe future of both criminal justice reform and immigration are critical for private prison firms,\u201d notes Fang.\nAmong those funneling money into Clinton\u2019s campaign are:Richard Sullivan of the firm Capitol Counsel, documented lobbyist for GEO Group."}
