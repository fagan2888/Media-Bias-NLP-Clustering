Harry Reid to \u201cquit the race-baiting already\u201d after he embarrassingly referred to Clarence Thomas as a white man.\n\n\u201cHarry Reid is the da Vinci of distraction,\u201d the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote Friday. \u201cThe moment any scandal, policy failure or political defeat crashes down on him \u2014 and there have been plenty the past few years \u2014 the Senate majority leader unleashes outrageous rhetoric that\u2019s better suited for a sandbox than what once passed for the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body.\n\n\u201cWorse, the Nevada Democrat has become especially fond of slinging race cards just to crank up the outrage,\u201d the editorial read.\n\nThe comments come after Mr. Reid last week blasted the Supreme Court for its decision to overturn part of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate.\n\nThe senator railed against the \u201cfive white men\u201d who ruled that some businesses do not have to provide some forms of birth control if doing so violates the employer\u2019s religious beliefs.\n\nAssociate Justice Clarence Thomas, a black conservative, was one of the five who ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby.\n\n\u201cSen. Reid\u2019s slip was no accident,\u201d the Review-Journal continued. \u201cHe believes racial and ethnic minorities are ideologically monolithic constituencies who are incapable of independent or \u2014 gasp! \u2014 right-of-center thinking. In the majority leader\u2019s mind, Mr. Thomas is not an African-American because the justice doesn\u2019t blindly subscribe to liberal orthodoxy.\n\n\u201cNever mind that Sen. Reid himself, like the entire Senate Democratic leadership, is as white as an Irishman in a snowstorm,\u201d the paper quipped.\n\n\u201cWe thought the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president was supposed to herald an age of post-racial politics,\u201d it concluded. \u201cSo much for hope and change. Quit the race-baiting already, Sen. Reid. You\u2019re clearly colorblind \u2014 in all the wrong ways.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nevada's largest daily newspaper is telling Sen.
