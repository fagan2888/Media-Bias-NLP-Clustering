It\u2019s pretty clear that Fox has an agenda, and that is to destroy Donald Trump while ignoring Ted Cruz. On the first count, they failed miserably \u2014 while they certainly managed to pull off the second one. For now.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn spite of Fox\u2019s efforts \u2014 that were so blatant that even Bloomberg noticed \u2014 Trump survived Thursday\u2019s debate. And while some may say he slipped just a little, it\u2019s clear he still has the momentum and a big lead. The attempt was so shameful that across the Internet and talk radio today, Fox\u2019s moderators are the big losers. The debate moderation was nothing short of cringeworthy. Fox News, or at least Bret Baier, Chris Wallace and Megyn Kelly, remain remarkably uncurious about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton \u2014 while remaining obsessed with their own face time and with starting fights on stage between participants.\n\nIn addition, they are trying to inject themselves into the story \u2014 and doing so in a way that indicates they have no idea what is going on outside the Beltway. They might as well be one of the networks featured on Netflix\u2019s House of Cards. Consider a few stunning \u2014 and what should be embarrassing \u2014 numbers from Thursday\u2019s debate:\n\n40: Ted Cruz was ignored for 40 straight minutes during the debate \u2014 with the mods even skipping Cruz on the topics of Iran and, yes, even ObamaCare. How in the world can you take yourself seriously when you don\u2019t invite Cruz into an ObamaCare discussion? Perhaps it\u2019s because Fox was so arrogantly assuring everyone back during the Cruz ObamaCare shutdown filibuster that it was going to cost the Republicans the Senate \u2014 in 2014. How did that turn out?\n\n59: It was 59 minutes before a single moderator mentioned any Democrat \u2014 and it was a question that involved Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s as if Barack Obama hasn\u2019t been President for almost 7 years and as if these are just normal times and this is just a normal election. Maybe that\u2019s what Fox thinks. It apparently has never crossed their collective minds that what voters want are plans for defeating the Democrats and then for rolling back the 7 years of devastation that have been wrought by them. They\u2019re not interested in any of that.\n\n31: Talk about ego. The three moderators of the primetime debate, none of whom were was sharp as any of the 17 candidates in either debate, spent nearly a third of their time on themselves! Yes, with 10 candidates needing exposure, 31 per cent of the air time went to the Fox crew. Not even Donald Trump got even close to that kind of exposure \u2014 and he got more than any other candidate by far.\n\n1: Bret Baier doggoned well knew that one, and only one candidate, would refuse to pledge to support whoever the Republican nominee is \u2014 and he started off the entire debate with that insulting and smarmy \u201cby a show of hands\u201d charade. This is the utmost in subtle pomposity \u2014 as it puts the moderator in the position of professor while the candidates are subconsciously relegated to student status. By the way, over the years it\u2019s been intellectually vapid, as well; almost all of the \u201cshow of hands\u201d questions are impossible to fully answer theoreticals.\n\n3 out of 4: Three out of the first four questions asked by Chris Wallace were specifically designed to get two specific candidates on the stage at each other\u2019s throat. They wanted a cat fight \u2014 and when they got it with the Rand Paul v. Chris Christie exchange, Megyn Kelly squealed her delight.\n\nAnd so on. And this is why Fox is being widely criticized on conservative social media and by talk radio hosts. But not all is lost for Fox, I guess. The New York Times and CNN gave them rave reviews. Unabashedly. And why not? Fox left Obama and Hillary largely unscathed. They barely mentioned Planned Parenthood. Just a few seconds on ObamaCare. No wonder the far left loved Fox last night.\n\nThat\u2019s called damning with praise.
