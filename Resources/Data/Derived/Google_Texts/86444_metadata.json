First, he was ushered to the podium to the strains of Guided by Voices\u2019 \u201cMotor Away.\u201d Yes, that happened.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThen, to top it all off, Carney explained that he, like George Washington cutting down the cherry tree, had never told a lie. Asked whether he had ever lied to the media, Carney stated, \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d That, of course, was a lie.\n\nBut on June 18, he explained, \u201cHonestly, it is not because I\u2019m a paragon of virtue, it is because that would be a terrible way to do the job.\u201d A few weeks ago, he similarly stated, \u201cWhen I go stand up at the podium in front of the White House press corps, I never lie. I never say something that I know is untrue. Credibility is enormously important to a press secretary.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right about lying. It is a terrible way to do the press secretary\u2019s job. Which is why Carney was perhaps the worst press secretary in modern history. Here are just a few of Carney\u2019s biggest lies:\n\nBenghazi Emails Not About Benghazi. In April, an email from deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes dated September 14, 2012, emerged. It showed that Rhodes had explicitly listed as a \u201cgoal\u201d that the White House not be blamed for a \u201cbroader failure or policy\u201d \u2013 and that, to that end, then-UN ambassador Susan Rice should talk about how the \u201cprotests are rooted in an Internet video.\u201d\n\nCarney told the skeptical press that the email wasn\u2019t actually about Benghazi. \u201cThe document was explicitly not about Benghazi,\u201d he said with a straight face, \u201cbut about the general dynamic in the Muslim world at the time.\u201d\n\nThe American Legion Thinks The White House Is Handling The Veterans Administration Beautifully. As Jeff Dunetz of TruthRevolt.org wrote:\n\nIn mid-May 2014, Carney announced that the American Legion had praised the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \u201cresignation\u201d of top VA health official Dr. Robert Petzel. Carney was only off by 100%. The actual American Legion statement was, \u201cthe move by VA is not a corrective action, but a continuation of business as usual. Dr. Petzel was already scheduled to retire this year, so his resignation now really won\u2019t make that much of a difference.\u201d\n\nHe Knows Lots of People Named Hilary Rosen. After Democratic advisor Rosen, who routinely visited the Obama White House, said on national television in 2012 that Ann Romney had \u201cnever actually worked a day in her life,\u201d Carney stated that he knew a lot of people named Hilary Rosen. Which was funny, because Hilary Rosen knew at least a thousand Jay Carneys.\n\nIf You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep Your Health Plan. Carney was one of many Obama officials who repeated this lie over and over again. As late as October, Carney stated, \u201cThe fact of the matter is, if you had insurance on the individual market prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and you have that plan today, you can keep it, you\u2019re grandfathered in forever. No matter how crummy the plan is.\u201d Politifact named it the 2013 Lie of the Year. Carney then half-denied that anyone had ever made the claim: \u201cYou know, end-of-the-year categorizations like that are always fun, even when they don\u2019t jive with past characterizations of the very same statement, but we\u2019re focused on implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nObama Will Warn Congress If He Engages in a Taliban Swap. Back on June 21, 2013, Carney stated, \u201cthere are some issues that we would like to discuss with the Taliban directly, and this includes the safe return of Sergeant Bergdahl, who has been gone for far too long\u2026.As we have long said, however, we would not make any decisions about transfer of any detainees without consulting with Congress and without doing so in accordance with U.S. law.\u201d Well, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nObama Never Opposed Signing Statements. Jay Carney, 2011: \u201cHis concern was with what he saw as an abuse of the signing statement by the previous administration. So that the positions he took in signing statements on the budget bill entirely consistent with that position, you need to retain the right to, as president, to be able to issue those signing statements, but obviously they should not be abused.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama, 2008: \u201cThat\u2019s not part of his power, but this is part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he goes along. I disagree with that. I taught the Constitution for 10 years. I believe in the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States. We\u2019re not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end-run around Congress.\u201d\n\nThis is just a slight sampling. Carney was in fact the proprietor of a carnival of lies. We\u2019ll just be sad to see the carousel stop spinning.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
