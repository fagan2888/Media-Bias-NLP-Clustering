But happens when two (or more) people reside in the same home, and only one of them consents to the search while the other refuses? Do the police have sufficient consent to conduct a warrentless search in that instance?\n\nThe Supreme Court addressed this question in the 2006 case of Georgia v. Randolph and came down against the police. At issue was a domestic violence investigation where the male suspect refused to let the police search his home while his wife welcomed the search. The police went in. Yet according to the Supreme Court, the man\u2019s refusal should have stopped the cops in their tracks. \u201cA physically present inhabitant\u2019s express refusal of consent to a police search [of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant,\u201d the Court ruled.\n\nToday, the Supreme Court returned to this subject with a new ruling in favor of law enforcement. At issue in Fernandez v. California was a 2009 search by the Los Angeles Police Department of the home of a robbery suspect. When the officers first arrived, suspect Walter Fernandez denied them entry, but because his girlfriend Roxanne Rojas exhibited signs of recent injury, Fernandez was arrested on separate charges of domestic violence. While Fernandez was being booked, one of the officers returned to the apartment and gained Rojas\u2019 permission to conduct a search, which soon turned up evidence linking Fernandez to the robbery.\n\nWriting for a 6-3 majority, Justice Samuel Alito upheld the LAPD\u2019s actions. \u201cA warrantless consent search is reasonable and thus consistent with the Fourth Amendment irrespective of the availability of a warrant,\u201d Alito wrote. Moreover, he added, \u201cDenying someone in Rojas\u2019 position the right to allow the police to enter her home would also show disrespect for her independence.\u201d\n\nWriting in dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, accused the majority of weakening the Fourth Amendment and granting the police too much latitude. \u201cInstead of adhering to the warrant requirement,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, \u201ctoday\u2019s decision tells the police they may dodge it, nevermind ample time to secure the approval of a neutral magistrate.\u201d This ruling, she charged, \u201cshrinks to petite size our holding in Georgia v.
