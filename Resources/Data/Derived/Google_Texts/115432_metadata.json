Money has indeed overwhelmed the system since 2008. This rise of big money in politics has endangered democracy and emboldened those who want to put democracy up for sale to aggressively attack the modest campaign spending regulations that still remain.\n\nA recent Demos report explores how, since Citizens United, the following have occurred:\n\nIn the 2012 election .01 percent of all Americans contributed more than 28 percent of all individual contributions.\n\nIn the 2012 election, Sheldon Adelson spent an estimated $150 million, $98 million through dark money channels. In 1980, by contrast, the largest donor gave $1.72 million (inflation-adjusted).\n\nA 2013 study finds, \u201cmillionaires receive about twice as much representation when they comprise just 5 percent of the district\u2019s population than the poorest wealth group does when it makes up 50 percent of the district.\u201d\n\nAnother 2013 study finds that the richest 1 percent of Americans are \u201cextremely active politically and that they are much more conservative than the American public as a whole with respect to important policies concerning taxation, economic regulation, and especially social welfare programs.\u201d\n\nIn the 2014 midterms, in the most competitive races, candidates got 86 percent of individual contributions from donors giving more than $200.\n\nAmericans are increasingly skeptical of claims that democracy by the wealthy is compatible with their interests. In a recent study commissioned by CNBC and Burson-Marsteller, 73 percent of American consumers believe that the government is more on the side of corporations than average citizens. Research by Pew suggests that trust in government has reached an almost record low, and the most recent ANES data find that 63.4 percent of Americans earning less than $30,000 agree (24.5 percent \u201cstrongly agree\u201d) that public officials don\u2019t care what people think.\n\nAs Jedediah Purdy notes in Dissent, \u201cUnlike early Americans, who were obsessed with the decline and fall of republics, the justices seem to suppose that, once established, democracy cannot fail. This view flies in the face of history. It also suggests why the justices seem so complacent about the danger that their own rulings will erode democracy.\u201d Purdy is correct, and the evidence is strong the dominance of money in politics has already overpowered the voices of middle-class Americans and Americans of color. As the evidence above suggests, Americans have very little voice in democracy, and increasingly feel that their government is not responsive. Low voting rates, particularly among the poor (far below average among OECD countries), are a symptom of our crisis of democracy. A recent poll finds that 54 percent of Americans who don\u2019t vote say they don\u2019t pay attention to politics because the political system is too corrupt.\n\nBut this is not the end of the story. Although a small group of unelected justices has attempted at every turn to weaken democracy \u2014 since 2006 the Roberts Court has struck down every money-in-politics law it has considered and removed critical protections for voting when it gutted the landmark Voting Rights Act \u2014 it\u2019s up to Americans to take it back.\n\nHere are some proposals:\n\nPublic Financing\n\nTo counter the influence of big money in politics we need structures that encourage small donors to get involved. Such a system would mean that politicians would be dependent on, and thus responsive to, their constituents, not just rich donors. Connecticut is a great example of public financing. In Connecticut, 90 percent of legislative candidates and both gubernatorial candidates participated in that state\u2019s clean elections program. These candidates report being able to spend more time with their constituents. Once candidates were no longer exclusively dependent on wealthy donors and businesses, the influence of lobbyists decreased, which has been cited as an important step in guaranteeing paid sick leave to workers and raising the minimum wage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years ago, conservatives on the high bench changed American elections forever.
