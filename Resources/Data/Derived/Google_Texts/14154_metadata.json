The state\u2019s uninsured rate is nearly 10 percent higher than the national average but it is an improvement.\n\nDown from 30 percent the previous year, the study reports Texas, like all of the states in the U.S., showed lower uninsured rates after the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\n\nOverall, the state\u2019s healthcare performance improved but Texas still has the greatest number and the largest percentage of people who do not have health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing but not surprising,\u201d said Dr. Theresa Willis.\n\nA pediatrician with the Austin Diagnostic Clinic, Dr. Willis said where you live matters when it comes to healthcare.\n\n\u201cIf you live in west Texas you may have to drive a significant distance to see a pediatrician or a family practitioner,\u201d Dr. Willis said.\n\nThe study found 64 percent of Texas children 19 and 35 months-old received all their recommended vaccines -- down 8 percent from 2013.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never seen polio. They\u2019ve never seen a child with measles,\u201d Dr. Willis said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that present fear.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has done so well vaccinating against those diseases that Dr. Willis said they are rarer, but she warns that could change if vaccination rates continue to drop.\n\n\u201cThose disease are still out there. We still see those cases,\u201d Dr. Willis said. \u201cA very real concern is that those diseases are going to make a comeback.\u201d\n\nThe pediatrician said vaccines are safe and effective, but she believes access to care and misinformation from \u201cpseudo research\u201d are the reasons behind the declining vaccine rates; not cost.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program helped change the picture of access to care for kids from low-income families in Texas.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t have anything for the working-poor parents in Texas. They are left out of the marketplace because states were supposed to do Medicaid for them and our state hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Anne Dunkelberg, Associate Director at the Center for Public Policy Priorities.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was written under the assumption that every state would offer Medicaid to adults who live below the poverty line. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled the federal government could not punish state that did not participate.\n\nDunkelberg said, \u201cSo, you end up in this crazy situation where the parents in a family of four earning $25,000 have this great subsidy in the market place. They are paying maybe $40 a month to cover both parents. But their next-door neighbors who earn $1,500 less, the poorer family, they don\u2019t have any help because the marketplace is only set up to serve people above the poverty line.\u201d\n\nAccording to CPPP, Texas is one of 19 states that has not pursued Medicaid expansion or an alternative program to offer care to low-income adults.\n\nDunkelberg said the state\u2019s uninsured rate impacts everyone.\n\n\u201cAll of us pay higher local taxes because that\u2019s really where the buck stops.\u201d\n\nPeople who go to emergency rooms with a legitimate medical emergency have to be taken care of, so hospitals and local governments must make up the cost difference when an uninsured person is treated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study ranks Texas as the state with the worst health care system in the U.S. when it comes to accessibility and affordability.&nbsp;", "author": "Rachel Glaser", "og": {"site_name": "EVERYTHINGLUBBOCK", "description": "A new study ranks Texas as the state with the worst health care system in the U.S. when it comes to accessibility and affordability.", "title": "Texas ranks last for healthcare affordability and accessibility", "url": "http://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/state-regional/texas-ranks-last-for-healthcare-affordability-and-accessibility", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/everythinglubbock/photo/2015/12/14/health%20care%20still_1450139590813_5993426_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 453216701501112, "pages": 100662759989507}, "article": {"section": "State & Regional", "published_time": "2016-01-06T21:48:04+0000", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T21:48:04+0000"}, "keywords": "State & Regional,News", "google-site-verification": "HWbORwOH0OZMh6naBffHQ9zxwnwnPkY9WRPtMP5ev7k", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "A new study ranks Texas as the state with the worst health care system in the U.S. when it comes to accessibility and affordability.\nA pediatrician with the Austin Diagnostic Clinic, Dr. Willis said where you live matters when it comes to healthcare.\nThe state\u2019s uninsured rate is nearly 10 percent higher than the national average but it is an improvement.\n\u201cIf you live in west Texas you may have to drive a significant distance to see a pediatrician or a family practitioner,\u201d Dr. Willis said.\nDunkelberg said the state\u2019s uninsured rate impacts everyone."}
