Only the date next to it \u2014 April 1, 1917 \u2014 roots it in the horrors of World War I.\n\nThe piece of graffiti is just one of nearly 2,000 century-old inscriptions that have recently come to light in Naours, a two-hour drive north of Paris. Many marked a note for posterity in the face of the doom that trench warfare a few dozen miles away would bring to many.\n\n\u201cIt shows how soldiers form a sense of place and an understanding of their role in a harsh and hostile environment,\u201d said historian Ross Wilson of Chichester University in Britain.\n\nEtchings, even scratched bas-reliefs, were left by many soldiers during the war. But those in Naours \u201cwould be one of the highest concentrations of inscriptions on the Western Front\u201d that stretches from Switzerland to the North Sea, said Wilson.\n\nThe site\u2019s proximity to the Somme battlefields, where more than a million men were killed or wounded, adds to the discovery\u2019s importance. \u201cIt provides insight into how they found a sense of meaning in the conflict,\u201d said Wilson.\n\nNaours\u2019 underground city is a 3-kilometer (2-mile) -long complex of tunnels with hundreds of chambers dug out over centuries in the chalky Picardy plateau. During the Middle Ages villagers took shelter there from marauding armies crisscrossing northern France. By the 18th century the quarry\u2019s entrance was blocked off and forgotten.\n\nIn 1887 a local priest rediscovered the site and it eventually became a tourist attraction. That\u2019s what likely drew the soldiers to it during the war, said Gilles Prilaux, an archaeologist for France\u2019s national archaeology institute. He began a three-year study of the tunnels last July, intending to focus on the site\u2019s medieval past \u2014 only to stumble upon this more recent slice of history.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise\u201d Prilaux said of the discovery of the World War I graffiti left by soldiers from Australia, Britain, Canada and the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WWI graffiti sheds light on soldiers\u2019 experience", "author": "Greg Keller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "WWI graffiti sheds light on soldiers\u2019 experience", "title": "WWI graffiti sheds light on soldiers\u2019 experience", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/05/wwi_graffiti_sheds_light_on_soldiers_experience/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/france-wwi-graffiti.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WWI graffiti sheds light on soldiers\u2019 experience", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/france-wwi-graffiti.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "WWI graffiti sheds light on soldiers\u2019 experience", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "WWI graffiti sheds light on soldiers\u2019 experience", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde840\"", "article_summary": "Only the date next to it \u2014 April 1, 1917 \u2014 roots it in the horrors of World War I.\n\u201cIt was a big surprise\u201d Prilaux said of the discovery of the World War I graffiti left by soldiers from Australia, Britain, Canada and the U.S.\nThe piece of graffiti is just one of nearly 2,000 century-old inscriptions that have recently come to light in Naours, a two-hour drive north of Paris.\nThat\u2019s what likely drew the soldiers to it during the war, said Gilles Prilaux, an archaeologist for France\u2019s national archaeology institute.\nEtchings, even scratched bas-reliefs, were left by many soldiers during the war."}
