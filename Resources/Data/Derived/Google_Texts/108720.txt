What financing secret can you offer to help an entrepreneur looking for money?

HENRY ELKUS: Investors want to see a disruptive business. If an idea is protectable and it can succeed against better-financed and more experienced competitors, it has an exponentially higher chance of achieving a great return on investment. During an entrepreneur’s pitch to investors, it’s paramount to communicate these traits right away.

In our case, the specialized fabrics we use, our crowdsourced design process and our philanthropic campaigns were the first dimensions of the business that we presented. For inventors, having an issued patent that prevents a product from being copied by larger competitors would help secure a deal.

Even if a prospective investor believes a patent would inevitably be worked around, the profit from selling the rights to the patent or selling the business could be enough to receive an excellent return.
