Hillary also criticized Obama\u2019s foreign policy earlier this month despite the fact that she served as his secretary of State and, as the White House pointed out in response, was \u201cfully on-board\u201d with the Obama foreign policy strategy at the time.\n\nClinton has also waxed hypocritical by promising to fight for youth jobs when her support of HillaryCare and eventually Obamacare has only done young Americans an economic disservice by forcing universities to cut student work hours and raise tuition.\n\nUnfortunately for Clinton, her inability to shake Obama\u2019s shadow will not do her any favors leading up to the 2016 election. Currently, the president has extremely low job approval ratings on the economy, foreign affairs, immigration and the like, the majority of Americans actually disapproving of his actions with respect to these issues.\n\nAs Congressman Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) so eloquently put it, \u201cHillary Clinton is very beatable because a Hillary Clinton presidency is basically the same thing as an Obama third term.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Hillary Clinton has a tough presidential race ahead of her if she decides to compete for the Oval Office in 2016, especially considering 56 percent of Americans disapprove of the way in which President Obama is handling health care.", "title": "Hypocritical Hillary: Clinton attempts to distance herself from...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/26/hypocritical-hillary-clinton-attempts-distance-president-obama-supporting-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "universal-health-care", "published_time": "2014-08-26T11:43:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-26T11:43:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "so eloquently put it, \u201cHillary Clinton is very beatable because a Hillary Clinton presidency is basically the same thing as an Obama third term.\u201d\nHillary Clinton has a tough presidential race ahead of her if she decides to compete for the Oval Office in 2016, especially considering 56 percent of Americans disapprove of the way in which President Obama is handling health care.\nUnfortunately for Clinton, her inability to shake Obama\u2019s shadow will not do her any favors leading up to the 2016 election.\nThis isn\u2019t the only Obama issue on which Clinton finds herself stuck.\nClinton has also waxed hypocritical by promising to fight for youth jobs when her support of HillaryCare and eventually Obamacare has only done young Americans an economic disservice by forcing universities to cut student work hours and raise tuition."}
