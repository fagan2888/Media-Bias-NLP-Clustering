Anthony List, an organization which works to elect pro-life leaders, compiled a list detailing where each candidate stands. Here\u2019s where they stand (listed in alphabetical order).\n\nJeb Bush\n\n\u201cSubstantial research evidences that at five months, unborn babies are capable of feeling pain, just as they are able to hear sounds or stretch their bodies,\u201d former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., wrote in a letter in 2014. \u201cIt is right and just for a humane and compassionate society to act in the interests of these individuals to protect them from pain and suffering.\u201d\n\nBen Carson\n\n\u201cExtending, preserving and maintaining the quality of life of all individuals has never been more important than it is now. Children are our most precious resource and our efforts to protect them should know no bounds. I urge our legislators in Congress to swiftly vote on the legislation known as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\u201d former neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson recently wrote on Facebook.\n\nChris Christie\n\nIn a recent statement to the Susan B. Anthony List, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., said he encourages Congress to \u201ctake swift action\u201d on the legislation.\n\n\u201cI am proud to be a pro-life Republican. I believe that every life is an individual gift from God, and that no life is disposable. When I was preparing to run for governor of New Jersey there were those who told me there was no way I would be elected as a pro-life candidate. I told them that they were wrong, that the voters would accept the sincerity of my beliefs even if they felt differently. Today, I am a living example that being pro-life is not a political liability anywhere in America,\u201d Christie said.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the only Republican to officially declare his candidacy so far, supports the legislation.\n\n\u201cNo one can doubt the reasonableness of this legislation,\u201d Cruz wrote in a letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in 2014:\n\n\u201cWe are a nation that models itself on a code of natural and human rights, which we believe are not the inheritance of a privileged few but the birthright of people everywhere. Yet today we are one of just seven countries worldwide to allow elective abortions after 20 weeks.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nCarly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, wrote in a blog post for SBA List that \u201cscience supports those of us that believe in the sanctity of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt 20 weeks, or five months into a pregnancy, an unborn child feels pain. At 20 weeks of life, an unborn child can suck his thumb, yawn, stretch, and make faces. An unborn child at 20 weeks IS a human life. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (S.1670) protects the unborn in limiting abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It is legislation that is vital in protecting the dignity of life,\u201d she wrote.\n\nLindsey Graham\n\nGraham introduced the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the Senate in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe now know that an unborn child at the 20th week of pregnancy can feel pain. \u2026 Given these facts and my continued strong support for life, I believe there is a compelling interest in protecting these unborn children who are among the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMike Huckabee\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics; it is about life. Life that is precious and valuable. It is about the value of life in our country,\u201d former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., wrote in a letter regarding the federal legislation in 2014.\n\nBobby Jindal\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal, R-La., signed pain-capable legislation into law in Louisiana in 2012.\n\n\u201cIt is incumbent upon us to protect the weakest and most vulnerable among us, and these new laws will protect innocent human life,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nRand Paul\n\nSens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who will announce his candidacy April 7, wrote in a letter to Graham in 2014 that he supported the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n\n\u201cI support your efforts to raise awareness of this bill and join your call for consideration in the U.S. Senate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlease let me know how I can be of assistance.\u201d\n\nRick Perry\n\nFormer Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, also signed pain-capable legislation into law during his time in office.\n\n\u201cThis is an important day for those who support life and for those who support the health of Texas women. In signing House Bill 2, we celebrate and further cement the foundation on which a culture of life in Texas is built,\u201d Perry said in a statement in 2013 after the law\u2019s passage.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in recent op-ed that pain-capable legislation \u201cis sound policy and widely supported by the public.\u201d Rubio is expected to announce his 2016 intentions April 13.\n\n\u201cThe dignity of each and every human life is fundamental. And [although] deep disagreements exist among our people about abortion, surely we should aspire to be a nation where we protect unborn babies who can feel pain, respond to touch, and recognize their mothers\u2019 voices.\u201d\n\nRick Santorum\n\n\u201cAs a committed pro-life American, I believe this legislation is an important step towards protecting our nation\u2019s unborn children,\u201d former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., wrote in a letter in 2014.\n\nScott Walker\n\n\u201cLife is a value I learned from my parents, and it\u2019s a value I have cherished every day, predating my time in politics,\u201d Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., wrote in an open letter last month.\n\nHe continues to say that he supports pain-capable legislation both in Wisconsin and at the federal level.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What their views are.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "What their views are.", "title": "Where Do GOP Candidates Stand on 20-Week Abortion Ban?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150403_Ultrasound.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-03T21:44:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BWDlEc"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "What their views are.", "title": "Where Do GOP Candidates Stand on 20-Week Abortion Ban?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150403_Ultrasound.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-04-04T03:01:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T21:44:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, abortion, pro-life, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, Ben Carson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2718\"", "article_summary": "In a crowded field of Republican presidential candidates, is there room for agreement on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act?\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (S.1670) protects the unborn in limiting abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\u201cThis is an important day for those who support life and for those who support the health of Texas women.\nA recent Quinnipiac poll shows 60 percent of Americans support pain-capable legislation.\nHe continues to say that he supports pain-capable legislation both in Wisconsin and at the federal level."}
