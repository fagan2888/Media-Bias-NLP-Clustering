Under our precedents that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons.\u201d\n\nWhen Thomas says that SCOTUS\u2019s precedents demonstrate that the commonality of the AR-15 is evidence of its protections under the Second Amendment, he is alluding to the court\u2019s decision in District of Columbia v Heller (2008). There the court explained that the test of commonality is one of the chief means of ascertaining which weapons are protected for the people\u2019s possession.\n\nAccording to Heller, \u201cthe sorts of weapons protected\u201d by the Second Amendment when it was written were those \u201cin common use at the time.\u201d And this has been true throughout the 224 years that have passed since the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification. It means the guns \u201cin common use\u201d among the citizenry are the guns protected by the Bill of Rights. And with five million AR-15 owners in America today, those rifles are certainly \u201cin common use\u201d among the citizenry, and therefore protected.\n\nCertain other weapons are easily recognized as not \u201cin common use\u201d\u2014shoulder-fired rockets, rocket propelled grenades, etc.\u2014and are not covered by the precedents that exist under the Second Amendment.\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
