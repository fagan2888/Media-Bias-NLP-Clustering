Study Finds It Would Cost Little\n\nVeronica Thomas\n\nCommonHealth Intern\n\nDo you believe yourself to be fat when others say you are too thin?\n\nWould you say that food dominates your life?\n\nHave you recently lost more than 14 pounds in a three-month period?\n\nI wonder, if I had answered these questions during my sophomore year of high school, would my anorexia have been caught earlier on? As a female ballerina with a Type A personality, I was an obvious candidate, but it took several months of starving myself before my eating disorder was diagnosed and treated.\n\nAccording to a new Boston Children\u2019s Hospital study, school screenings with questions like these could be a cost-effective way to detect eating disorders. At 35 cents apiece, a brief questionnaire could help identify and treat some of the most serious and potentially dangerous psychiatric disorders in kids.\n\nYet while the price is low, recent experiences with school obesity screening suggest that the issues can go beyond money.\n\nEating disorders, which include anorexia, bulimia and binge-eating disorder, affect at least 3.8 percent of teen girls and 1.5 percent of teen boys in the U.S. While effective therapies exist, only about 3 to 28 percent of teens actually receive treatment.\n\nIf left untreated, eating disorders can lead to serious medical complications, hospitalizations and even death. I think my own anorexia went undiagnosed for so long mainly because of the many lies I told about my diet\u2014\u201dI already ate,\u201d \u201cI had a huge lunch\u201d\u2014and the countless hours I spent in school and dance classes, out of my parent\u2019s sight and scrutiny.\n\nBut I was lucky: I narrowly avoided hospital time. I only had to make frequent visits to my own health care trifecta\u2014pediatrician, dietician and therapist. Had my anorexia been more severe or diagnosed even later\u2014as is often the case\u2014my treatment might have involved residential therapies and been much more expensive.\n\nSo could school screenings help catch the diseases earlier? The new study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, assessed whether they could help minimize both the health burdens and the cost burdens of eating disorders.\n\nUsing a computer simulation, the researchers compared the annual screening of 10- to 17-year-olds with a no-screening scenario. The screening instrument used\u2014the SCOFF questionnaire\u2014 is a self-administered set of five questions scored by school staff. The hypothetical students identified as being at risk for an eating disorder were referred to clinicians for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nCompared to students receiving no screening, those who were theoretically screened received more treatment and recovered from their eating disorder more quickly.\n\n\u201cSchool-based screening would allow youth who may otherwise go undetected to access services which may significantly improve their health and quality of life,\u201d says Dr. Kendrin Sonneville, the director of nutrition training at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Division of Adolescent Medicine and one of the study authors. The study finds that screening is a cost-effective way to identify high-risk youth who are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, including low-income, minority, overweight and male teens.\n\nA recent poll found that 53 percent of adults are on board with school-based eating disorder screening.\n\n\u201cI do think that eating disorder screenings should be incorporated into schools,\u201d says Beth Mayer, executive director of the Multi-Service Eating Disorders Association, a Newton-based support network and resource on eating disorder awareness and detection. \u201cScreenings can lead to early intervention, which could potentially prevent serious and chronic eating disorders.\u201d\n\n\u201cScreenings can lead to early intervention, which could potentially prevent serious and chronic eating disorders.\u201d \u2013 Beth Mayer,\n\nMulti-Service Eating Disorders Association\n\nHowever, mandatory school screenings are often not without controversy.\n\nIn addition to vision and hearing tests, many states require schools to conduct body-mass index (BMI) screenings, despite the lack of endorsement from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Last year Massachusetts actually banned the sending home of BMI score reports\u2014critically coined \u201cfat letters\u201d\u2014in an effort to protect children\u2019s privacy, as well as prevent stigmatization, bullying, and risky weight loss behaviors.\n\n\u201cWe went backwards in the eating disorder field when we began weighing kids at school,\u201d Mayer says. \u201cThat is the job of a physician.\u201d\n\nAs with BMI reporting, I wonder if a letter home to my parents about my eating disorder risk would have exacerbated my body image concerns or led to classmates\u2019 whispers behind my back.\n\n\u201cA potential consequence of mandatory eating-disorder screening can be a sense of shame in the student,\u201d Mayer says. \u201cScreenings should be done in total privacy so that no student has to feel ashamed or embarrassed.\u201d\n\nActually, I wonder if I would have been flagged at all. Would I have answered the questions honestly or lied, as I so often did? In addition to missing students completely, there\u2019s also the risk\u2014with all screenings\u2014of flagging the wrong students.\n\n\u201cNo tool can replace a clinical interview for diagnosis. Some students who screen positive and are referred to a clinician for further evaluation will not actually have an eating disorder,\u201d Dr. Sonneville explains. \u201cAlthough we account for the economic costs of such false positives in our study, we can\u2019t ignore the emotional burden this could place on the youth and families.\u201d\n\nAs with BMI screenings and other health topics introduced in schools, Dr. Sonneville says some parent opposition is to be expected.\n\n\u201cParents who have concerns about the screening should be able to opt out of screening for their child,\u201d she says.\n\nDespite the possible drawbacks of school screenings for eating disorders, I can\u2019t help but imagine how my high school experience might have been different had my signs of anorexia been caught earlier on. Had my two-year disorder been shortened or prevented, perhaps I would have spent my weekends obsessing about boys and friends rather than hiding out in my room, carefully planning my meals and calculating calories.\n\nWhile this study suggests that school screening is a promising option, the researchers were only able to simulate the cost-effectiveness over a 10-year period.\n\n\u201cMore research efforts should be dedicated to assessing long-term costs and consequences of eating disorders, which will strengthen the estimated cost-effectiveness of screening programs,\u201d Dr. Sonneville says.\n\nSo will the screening be coming to a school near you anytime soon? Maybe, but it all depends on the school district\u2019s priorities. \u201cSchool districts face many competing priorities and, understandably, some stakeholders may not prioritize health screenings such as eating disorders screening,\u201d Dr. Sonneville says.\n\nIn the meantime, pediatricians here in Massachusetts routinely screen children for mental and behavioral health issue\u2014more than any other state, in fact.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study finds that eating disorder screening in schools may be a cost-effective method of identifying the disorders early on.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A new study finds that eating disorder screening in schools may be a cost-effective method of identifying the disorders early on.", "title": "Should Schools Screen Kids For Eating Disorders?
