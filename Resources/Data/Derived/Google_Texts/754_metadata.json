But now her efforts may be needed on another front.\n\nObesity can take a heavy toll on older women, too: Their risk of developing chronic diseases, losing the ability to walk or dying earlier increases with excess weight. We get the particulars from a large national study, recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine, that tracked more than 36,000 post-menopausal women at 40 research centers and universities around the country.\n\nWhen the women enrolled in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative between 1993 and 1998, they were between 66 and 79 years old (average age: 72). The researchers recorded the subjects\u2019 heights, weights and health information, then followed up periodically thereafter. When the study concluded in 2012, the researchers divided their sample into five categories:\n\n*19 percent of these women were deemed healthy, meaning that \u201cthey survived to age 85 and had no major chronic diseases and maintained the ability to walk,\u201d said lead author Dr. Eileen Rillamas-Sun, an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\n\n*Another 14.7 percent began the study with one or more of five chronic disease (cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes or hip fracture), but did not develop any additional health problems, and remained mobile.\n\n*Nearly a quarter, 23.2 percent, developed one or more of the diseases during the study period, but maintained their ability to walk.\n\n*18.3 percent did lose their mobility \u2014 meaning they required crutches, walkers or wheelchairs \u2014 or that they reported limited ability to walk a block or climb a flight of stairs. The researchers used this measure of disability, Dr. Rillamas-Sun said, because \u201closing one\u2019s ability to walk contributes to loss of independence.\u201d\n\n*The remaining women, 24.8 percent, died before age 85.\n\nWhen the researchers looked at the impact on the women\u2019s health of obesity and being overweight, calculated by body mass index, \u201cwe found that women with a healthy body weight had a greater chance of living to 85 without developing a chronic disease or a mobility disability,\u201d Dr. Rillamas-Sun said. \u201cThe heavier you are, the worse your chances of healthy survival.\u201d\n\nNow some New Old Age readers \u2014 you know who you are \u2014 are already mentally composing comments like, \u201cWe didn\u2019t already know that obesity is bad for us?\u201d and \u201cWe needed a study funded by the National Institutes of Health to tell us this?\u201d\n\nWe did, on both counts. Older people and women have historically been underrepresented in \u2014 or actually excluded from \u2014 research trials. For years, experts assumed that findings from all-male studies applied to women, too, which has proved to be untrue.\n\nAlso, aside from gender disparities, \u201ca lot of research focuses on everyone 65 and older,\u201d Dr. Rillamas-Sun pointed out. \u201cWe looked at the old-old\u201d \u2014 those who are 85-plus.\n\nBut it is true that this work confirms what we thought we knew: Overweight women run a higher risk of health problems and disability, and those risks rise sharply when overweight becomes obese.\n\nCompared to older women with healthy body mass indexes (below 25), overweight women had a 20 percent greater chance of developing one of the five diseases. But women with Level 1 obesity (B.M.I. over 30 but below 35) had a 65 percent higher risk of disease, and women with higher levels of obesity were more than twice as likely to develop disease. The likelihood of dying before age 85 showed a similar pattern. (The data has been adjusted to account for demographic differences and health behaviors like smoking.)\n\nWhen it came to losing mobility, the researchers found even more striking differences. Overweight women had a 60 percent higher risk of losing the ability to walk, but obese women were three to six times more likely to lose their mobility. For African-American and Hispanic women who were overweight or obese, the odds of disease, disability or death before age 85 were higher yet.\n\nWhat this study doesn\u2019t address is whether losing weight later in life can protect older women from disease and disability. But the researchers are working on that. (And of course, some other factor other than obesity might be involved because \u2014 all together now \u2014 correlation is not causation.)\n\nBut we shouldn\u2019t wait for Dr. Rillamas-Sun\u2019s next publication to try to reduce overweight and obesity in older women.\n\nPaging the First Lady. Women often do gain weight after menopause, and losing it can be harder than when we\u2019re 35 (a challenge with which I\u2019m all too familiar). But it\u2019s not impossible, and the effort is worth undertaking \u2014 for our aging parents, and for ourselves.\n\n\u201cThis says, you can\u2019t be in denial any longer,\u201d said Dr. Rillamas-Sun. \u201cMost people need to see the numbers; they prove what is supposedly obvious. And we do have the numbers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/02/wpWATER.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Compared to older women with healthy body mass indexes (below 25), overweight women had a 20 percent greater chance of developing one of the five diseases.\nWhat this study doesn\u2019t address is whether losing weight later in life can protect older women from disease and disability.\nObesity can take a heavy toll on older women, too: Their risk of developing chronic diseases, losing the ability to walk or dying earlier increases with excess weight.\nBut we shouldn\u2019t wait for Dr. Rillamas-Sun\u2019s next publication to try to reduce overweight and obesity in older women.\nAlso, aside from gender disparities, \u201ca lot of research focuses on everyone 65 and older,\u201d Dr. Rillamas-Sun pointed out."}
