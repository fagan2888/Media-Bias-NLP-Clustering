Since I\u2019m not a lawyer, nobody should take anything that follows to the bank (especially the bank). The best I can offer is a hardcore nerd\u2019s take on the bill (SB 129). I\u2019m convinced that both the legislation\u2019s most vocal proponents and opponents greatly overestimate its importance.\n\nIn 1993, prompted by a U.S. Supreme Court decision that Congress thought interpreted the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of religious freedom too narrowly, Congress passed, with only three dissenting votes, and President Clinton signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It provided that government may not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion except to further a compelling government interest by the least restrictive means.\n\nThen in a 1997 case the Supreme Court held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is unconstitutional as applied to the states. In the wake of that decision, several states, Georgia being a laggard, enacted laws that basically incorporated the key provisions of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThere are several things about the Georgia bill that I think make it pretty innocuous. For example, contrary to a nut job who somehow turned up in my Facebook newsfeed claiming that Georgia\u2019s is \u201cby far the worst\u201d of all the state religious freedom restoration laws, it\u2019s largely cobbled together verbatim from the relevant federal sources. Every single passage from the Georgia bill that this person quoted as evidence of the bill\u2019s depravity was lifted straight from either the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that Congress voted on or from the corresponding sections of the United States Code. So the Georgia bill is no worse than the federal law it apes. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to decide how depraved that is.\n\nThen there\u2019s the view, apparently widely held, that if the bill is enacted into law, people will be able to exempt themselves from any legal requirement they don\u2019t like just by saying, \u201cSorry, against my religion.\u201d But anybody who seriously thinks that isn\u2019t paying attention.\n\nWhile the bill may leave it up to each of us to judge whether our free exercise of religion has been \u201csubstantially burdened,\u201d it doesn\u2019t leave it up to us to judge what the government\u2019s \u201ccompelling interests\u201d are. For example, the bill says, \u201cThe General Assembly finds and determines that,\u201d (among other things) \u201cCourts have consistently held that government has a fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating discrimination.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth focusing on discrimination, a particular worry among people who read the bill as a license to discriminate against gays and lesbians in public accommodations, employment, housing and so on.\n\nBut I don\u2019t see why they think that. As far as I know, Georgia has no statewide prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation. So anybody who\u2019s bent on discriminating against gays and lesbians on the basis of their sexual orientation doesn\u2019t need the Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u2019s permission. For all the state of Georgia cares, they can do that with impunity right now.\n\nMaybe the concern is that the bill, if enacted into law, will give people a way to go after ordinances like those in the city of Atlanta that do prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the aggrieved taking the Hobby Lobby route by claiming, say, that having to bake wedding cakes or take wedding photos for same-sex couples will violate their rights under the Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nBut remember, Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners won because they persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court that the government had ways of furthering its compelling Affordable Care Act interests less restrictive than requiring the owners to violate their religious beliefs. As far as I know, though, government has no way to advance an \u201coverriding\u201d interest in \u201ceradicating\u201d discrimination less restrictive than outlawing it. Elane Photography v. Willock, a celebrated case from New Mexico, which also has a religious freedom restoration law, is instructive here.\n\nSo my nerdy take on the Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act is that it\u2019s a solution in search of a problem and would leave things pretty much as they are if it becomes law. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for me to quell the suspicion that the din emanating from the bill\u2019s neighborhood is that of a now drearily routine phony war both sides welcome as a way to motivate and engage their forces. If the Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act becomes law, we\u2019ll find out whether I\u2019m right when the lawyers pile in.\n\nLeon Galis, a retiree living in Athens, is an occasional contributor to the Athens Banner-Herald editorial page.
