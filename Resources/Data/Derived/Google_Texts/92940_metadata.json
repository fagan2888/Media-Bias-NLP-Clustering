Fallon had Trump. Colbert had SJW darling Amy Schumer. The numbers not only weren't close, they were Colbert's worst loss to date.\n\nAn estimated 4.5 million viewers tuned in to see Donald Trump\u2019s appearance on NBC\u2019s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon... With a 1.15 in 18-49 rating, the episode marked Tonight\u2019s highest-rated Friday telecast in 18-49 since February 27 (also a 1.15) and its best Friday in overall viewership since February 20 (4.8 million). The Trump episode marked Fallon\u2019s biggest total-viewer margin (28%) over CBS\u2019s four-day-old The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nFallon not only beat Colbert among viewers overall, but also among the 18-45 demo that advertisers care about.\n\nColbert's numbers have been steadily dropping as viewers decide they would rather do anything than actually watch him talk. Or try to tell jokes. And Amy Schumer draws the same redundant mouth breathing SJW audience as Colbert.\n\nColbert doesn't understand the format or how to operate outside the comfort zone created by his old gig. It's what makes him weaker than Letterman. By next month, CBS will be panicking and trying to retool the show.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Colbert's numbers have been steadily dropping", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Colbert's numbers have been steadily dropping", "title": "Trump + Fallon Score Highest Ratings Win Over Colbert and Amy Schumer", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/260104/trump-fallon-score-highest-ratings-win-over-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/09/103387.800.jpg?itok=pRx6SHG0", "updated_time": "2015-09-12T22:16:37-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/260104/trump-fallon-score-highest-ratings-win-over-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/09/103387.800.jpg?itok=pRx6SHG0", "description": "Colbert's numbers have been steadily dropping", "card": "summary", "title": "Trump + Fallon Score Highest Ratings Win Over Colbert and Amy Schumer"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T22:16:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T22:16:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf64a\"", "article_summary": "Stephen Colbert continued failing badly on Friday.\nColbert had SJW darling Amy Schumer.\nAnd Amy Schumer draws the same redundant mouth breathing SJW audience as Colbert.\nColbert doesn't understand the format or how to operate outside the comfort zone created by his old gig.\nColbert's numbers have been steadily dropping as viewers decide they would rather do anything than actually watch him talk."}
