It was a packed house at Hoyt Sherman Place for Trump, who was not shy about touting his accomplishments and wealth.

He said he is a businessman who knows how to run the country.

“If I win, we will guarantee to make America great again,” Trump said.

Hundreds of enthusiastic Iowans listened as Trump talked for about an hour. His speech was only supposed to last 10 minutes, but Trump is known for going off script.

He said he wants to make American great again, and he promised to build up the military, take care of veterans and repeal Obamacare.

Trump took several jabs at other presidential candidates. He said politicians are killing this country, but he is not a politician, he said. He is a businessman who knows how to create jobs.

“I'm almost more disappointed in Republican politicians and even the people running for office. I watch them all the time and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set. They walk around talking about the weather. I say people just want a job,” Trump said.

It won't be long before Trump is back in Iowa. His state director said Trump will be in Oskaloosa and Winterset on June 27.
