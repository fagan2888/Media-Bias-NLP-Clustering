Dick Durbin said Tuesday the cancellations people might face of their coverage under Obamacare and the statement that individuals could keep their plans \u201cshould have been clarified.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you that a couple more sentences added to it would\u2019ve clarified it, and they should\u2019ve been added. The president has apologized. I think he said very clearly he was sorry if he misled people,\u201d Durbin (D-Ill.) said on CNN\u2019s \u201cLegal View with Ashleigh Banfield.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe number two Senate Democrat also acknowledged that he, in addition to President Barack Obama, told people that under the new law, if you like your plan, you can keep it.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Clinton: Obama should keep promise)\n\n\u201cI said it because I believed it. Now I know that I should have added that for 98 percent of American people, that is exactly true. For the other two percent who are in the individual market, there are frequent changes in policies,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nWhen pressed about the talking points, Durbin said he \u201ccertainly wasn\u2019t in on that decision,\u201d but added there are ways to move forward.\n\nHe knocked some of the alternative proposals to Obamacare as \u201cnot friendly\u201d and \u201cdesigned to derail this effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we need to look at the political reality. We need to be open to constructive changes to make this law work better, but there are those frankly, that do not want it to work at all,\u201d Durbin said.\n\n( WATCH: 7 quotes on Obamacare glitches)\n\nHe also addressed former President Bill Clinton\u2019s comments from an interview posted Tuesday that Obama should \u201chonor the commitment\u201d and let people keep their plans. The senator reemphasized that it will depend if \u201cthose on the other side are willing to sit down in a constructive fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201dI would say to to President Clinton, if we can bringing that bipartisan group together, we can start to solve some of the problems we\u2019re facing,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He says &quot;more sentences&quot; should have been added.", "title": "Durbin: ACA line needed clarification", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/dick-durbin-obamacare-clarification-99733.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/01/29/130129_dick_durbin_shinkle_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare (927),Dick Durbin (336)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He says &quot;more sentences&quot; should have been added.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0c0\"", "article_summary": "Durbin says his party must be open to constructive changes to Obamacare.\nFor the other two percent who are in the individual market, there are frequent changes in policies,\u201d Durbin said.\nWe need to be open to constructive changes to make this law work better, but there are those frankly, that do not want it to work at all,\u201d Durbin said.\nWhen pressed about the talking points, Durbin said he \u201ccertainly wasn\u2019t in on that decision,\u201d but added there are ways to move forward.\n| John Shinkle/POLITICO Durbin: ACA line needed clarificationSen.
