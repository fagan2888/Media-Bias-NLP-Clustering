She began an enterprise, called \u201cHey, Cupcake!,\u201d out of her family's kitchen two years ago. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the sixth grader earns around $200 a month selling her baked goods. Stirling hopes to use her income to one day open her own bakery. Her mother, Heather, also offered to match the money Stirling makes to buy a car when she turns 16. Additionally, \u201cshe has donated many to charitable events, including a fundraiser for a student with cancer and, most recently, taking some to residents at a senior care center,\u201d writes the Belleville News-Democrat.\n\nThe desserts didn't sit well with the local government, though. The health department called Stirling's parents and demanded that the girl cease operations, because she was violating the Illinois State Food Service Code. Stirling lacked the necessary permit and the kitchen wasn't properly licensed.\n\n\"The guy told me I either had to buy her a bakery or put in a second kitchen (in the house),\u201d Stirling's mother said.\n\nHow did the sleuths at the health department discover this renegade baker? She was on the front page of the local news. The News-Democrat wanted to highlight Stirling's entrepreneurship, so they wrote a feature about her.\n\nHealth Promotion Manager Amy Yeager told the Post-Dispatch, \u201cThe rules are the rules. It\u2019s for the protection of the public health. The guidelines apply to everyone.\u201d When asked whether it was worth the potential poor public relations, she said, \u201cPeople will react how they choose to react. But it is our job.\u201d\n\nThe sixth grade scofflaw doesn't blame the department for finally catching up with her code-violating behavior. She told KSDK, \"Well, I think it's just the rules are rules and they kind of need to be followed. I really don't blame the health department because it's not really their fault.\u201d\n\nThis isn't the first time law enforcement has tackled little criminals. Reason has covered numerous regulation-dodging lemonade runners, one of which had cancer, and even a zucchini black marketeer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The Health Department of Madison County, Illinois on Sunday shut down a baking operation run by an 11-year-old girl.
