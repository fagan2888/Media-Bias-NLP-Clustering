Many feared Gabrielle Giffords wouldn’t survive when the then-Arizona congresswoman was shot in the head in a mass shooting at a rally in Tucson in 2011. A severe brain injury left her paralyzed on the right side of her body and for some time took away her ability to speak.

On the third anniversary of that event Wednesday, after countless hours of rehabilitative therapy, Giffords did something that three years ago seemed utterly impossible: she went skydiving. And she was able to talk about the experience.

“Oh, wonderful sky. Gorgeous mountain. Blue skies. I like a lot,” she said in an interview on the Today show that aired Thursday. “A lot of fun. Peaceful, so peaceful.”
