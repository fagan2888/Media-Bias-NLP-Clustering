I think it was wrong that President Obama and Harry Reid forced the shutdown. They forced the shutdown because they wouldn\u2019t compromise on Obamacare,\u201d\n\nAccording to the site Cruz told Obama that any deal to reopen the government must also provide relief for those negatively affected by Obamacare. Cruz did not use the word \u201cdefund\u201d to describe his aspirations for changes to the health care law when speaking to reporters, but said he wants \u201csubstantial\u201d changes\n\nCruz adds:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that we are finally having discussions. That is an improvement. There was an awful lot of talk but then, at the end of the day, the president still said he wouldn\u2019t negotiate. We began talking, that was good today. But he continued to maintain that he will not negotiate or compromise on anything. And if that is the position, that\u2019s not going to lead to a resolution.\u201d\n\nMmm\u2026 We wonder what POTUS\u2019 response was.\n\nSOURCE: Politico | PHOTO CREDIT: Getty\n\nAlso On Global Grind:", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Hold On Now!
