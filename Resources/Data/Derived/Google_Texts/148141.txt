Underlying growth in health care costs and the sunset of the Affordable Care Act’s reinsurance program are the major drivers behind insurance premium increases this year, according to a new report from the American Academy of Actuaries.

Insurers are now filing their premium rate requests, and early requests show potential double-digit increases. The Department of Health and Human Services has said customers shouldn’t be concerned by the proposed hikes, because the actual increases have not been as high as first expected in recent years.

Increasing costs of medical services and prescription drugs are expected to grow more quickly than in recent years, though they remain low compared to historic levels, the report says.

The end of the reinsurance program this year will also be something insurers consider, the actuaries say. “By offsetting a portion of claims, the reinsurance program lowered premiums, and each year the gradual reduction in reinsurance funding resulted in a corresponding increase in premiums,” the report reads. “The final impact of the program on premiums will occur in 2017, when projected claims are expected to increase by 4 to 7 percent due to the reinsurance program ending in 2016.”

Changes to risk pool composition, insurers assumptions, the delay of the implementation of the Health Insurers Tax and the repeal of the small group exchange will also have an effect on changes in premium requests, the report says. Market competition, changes in insurers’ provider networks, benefit package changes and administrative factors can also affect premium rates, it adds.

Consumers’ premiums are also affected by increases in age, whether they’ve moved, their family status and how their chosen plan is designed.

As the Affordable Care Act has been implemented, insurers relearning more about the market, which affects their actions, the report says.
