White House declares new HealthCare.gov a success\n\nFollowing a frenzied race to fix the site, the Obama administration declared victory on Sunday in its effort to get HealthCare.gov working smoothly for the vast majority of users. In a six-page progress and performance report, administration officials said the troubled website could now handle at least 800,000 visitors per day. The new performance levels mark significant improvement after the ObamaCare website's disastrous Oct. 1 launch. Officials remain concerned about high volumes this month, with the potential for large numbers of people entering the site to apply for insurance coverage beginning Jan. 1.

U.S. and Afghanistan negotiations may lead to zero troop option\n\nAn increasing stalemate between the U.S. and Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai has made the prospect of keeping no troops in Afghanistan after 2014, a \"zero option,\" more realistic than the White House anticipated. After its longest war in history, the U.S. may have to dismantle the bulk of its counterterrorism infrastructure there and abandon Afghanistan's security forces. A wholesale withdrawal would also shut down \u00adforeign aid and sharply limit any U.S. diplomatic presence. The uncertainty over the long-term security deal has the potential to be particularly damaging on the eve of Afghanistan's presidential election, scheduled to take place next spring.

Analysts hope North Korea will release American hostage soon\n\nMerrill Newman, an 85-year-old American tourist and Korean War veteran who was detained from a plane departing from North Korea a month ago, may soon be released from detention. Yesterday, Pyongyang claimed that Newman had apologized for crimes during the Korean War and a recent trip. On Saturday, the White House urged North Korea to consider 85-year-old Merrill Newman's \"advanced age and health conditions\" and allow his return home, said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council. The situation underscores the continuing danger of visiting the police state even after tourist hotels have popped up.
