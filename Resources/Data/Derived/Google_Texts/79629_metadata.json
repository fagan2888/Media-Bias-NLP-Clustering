One vendor said he would be paying more than half of his earnings from the show just to move boxes if the new fee were to be charged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard your concerns about materials handling (drayage) and fully understand your apprehensions about the unknown dollar amounts,\u201d the fliers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to act on those concerns and eliminate those charges from the 2015 contracts now and the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wildly successful Con we\u2019re all experiencing this week is a collaborative effort,\u201d said Christine Tubbs, one of the event\u2019s lead organizers and the executive director of Pop Culture Classroom. \u201cOur merchants are important to us, and they\u2019re important to our fans. So it\u2019s only natural that we would be responsive to their needs.\u201d\n\nMany vendors who spoke with The Denver Post said that despite the elimination of cart service fees, they are still frustrated with the costs of the event, especially the planned increase in booth fees.\n\nRuss Tabor of AAAA Comic Book has been selling comic books since 1992 and has been a vendor at every Denver Comic Con. He said he\u2019s angry about the increase, but \u201cI\u2019ll probably come back and pay it. Prices are still getting pretty high.\u201d\n\nThousands flooded the Colorado Convention Center for the final day, boasting colorful costumes and eager to enjoy all things science fiction and fantasy.\n\nEvent organizers said 86,500 people attended this year\u2019s convention, far more than the 61,000 who attended last year and the 27,700 who attended the inagural event in 2012.\n\n\u201cI like that there\u2019s just so many people here who love nerdy stuff,\u201d said 29-year-old Katie Hofgard. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m at home amongst the nerds.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul\n\nStaff writers Rex Santus and Korene Gallegos contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Comic Con organizers change course on 2015 charges for unloading", "title": "Denver Comic Con organizers change course on 2015 charges for unloading", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/15/denver-comic-con-organizers-change-course-on-2015-charges-for-unloading/", "image": {"width": 517, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140615__comicconp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140615__comicconp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-15T17:20:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:50:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfba5\"", "article_summary": "Russ Tabor of AAAA Comic Book has been selling comic books since 1992 and has been a vendor at every Denver Comic Con.\nThe Denver Post reported Sunday that moving materials into the Colorado Convention Center in 2015 might cost vendors $65 to $95 for 100 pounds of goods.\nA decision to begin charging vendors for cart services at next year\u2019s Denver Comic Con has been rescinded, according to fliers at the convention Sunday.\nEvent organizers said 86,500 people attended this year\u2019s convention, far more than the 61,000 who attended last year and the 27,700 who attended the inagural event in 2012.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard your concerns about materials handling (drayage) and fully understand your apprehensions about the unknown dollar amounts,\u201d the fliers said."}
