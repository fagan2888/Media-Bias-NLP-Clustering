The state's rate is lower than the national percentage of uninsured children, which dropped to a historic low of 6 percent in 2014.\n\n\n\nThe study was based on U.S. Census Bureau American Community and researchers cited Insure Tennessee as \"the single most effective policy change Tennessee could make to keep pace with other states in helping more children get health care coverage.\"\n\nChildren in southern states were more likely to be uninsured than children from another other region, the researchers found.\n\nStates that have extended Medicaid coverage to more low-income adults - a process known as Medicaid expansion - saw almost twice the rate of decline in uninsured children as states that have decided against expansion, the report said.\n\nExpanded Medicaid is mostly aimed at working-poor adults, but the expansion of the program typically has a ripple effect that increases the rates of coverage among children.\n\nAccording to the report, states that expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act saw greater reductions in the number of uninsured children.\n\n\"It was a smart decision by New Mexico's leaders to expand Medicaid because helping uninsured parents provides a direct benefit to uninsured children\", said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown University research center.\n\nDespite the improvement, Nevada still posted the fourth highest rate of uninsured children among states in 2014.\n\nA quarter of the Florida children who remain uninsured are under age 6, Brennaman said, \"and that's that critical age when screening and preventive services can really have major implications for them, in terms of warding off big problems and allowing those children to reach their full potential\".\n\nBill Custer, a health insurance expert at Georgia State University, said the drop in the number of kids without coverage a year ago reflects \"the effect of the attention on changes in the availability of health insurance\" due to the ACA. \"Many children live in homes with parents who can't afford coverage for themselves\". \"Their families can take them to the doctor when they're sick so they don't wind up even sicker and in need of more expensive care in a hospital\".\n\n\"Because their parents were going to see what options they had to get coverage under the Affordable Care Act, we were able to capture a few of those kids that were missing\", he says.\n\nThe report also found that Hispanic and school-aged children were disproportionately uninsured, as well as children living in rural areas or low-income families.\n\n\"Obviously, we still have a ways to go in Georgia with 189,000 children that remain uncovered\", said Erica Fener Sitkoff, policy and outreach director for Voices for Georgia's Children, an advocacy group.\n\nMost of the 75,000 uninsured children in Washington are eligible for Apple Health for Kids, but are not enrolled.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The national uninsured rate for children has declined 16 percent since 2013, but Tennessee's rate has remained flat.\nThe state's rate is lower than the national percentage of uninsured children, which dropped to a historic low of 6 percent in 2014.\nA report published by Georgetown University found Tennessee has a child uninsured rate of 5.2 percent, or 78,000 children, with no significant change from 2013.\nDespite the improvement, Nevada still posted the fourth highest rate of uninsured children among states in 2014.\nMost of the 75,000 uninsured children in Washington are eligible for Apple Health for Kids, but are not enrolled."}
