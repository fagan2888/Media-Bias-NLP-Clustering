I urge anyone in the health industry, or with knowledge of health policy, to come and testify Tuesday.\"\n\nAssemblyman Matthew Titone (D-North Shore), a co-sponsor of the bill, called it a \"long haul\" and while he doesn't expect it to pass right away, \"this bill is really looking to jumpstart the dialogue and keep it going,\" he said. \"Is the bill perfect? Probably not. Is it the perfect conversation starter? Yes.\"\n\nTitone said it's a complex issue and \"it would streamline health care in New York State, it would be great for small businesses who are compelled to pay into employees' health insurance benefits.\"\n\nThe public hearing will be held on Tuesday, Dec. 16 at 10 a.m. in the Global Center for Academic and Spiritual Life, 5th Floor, 238 Thompson Street New York, NY 10012.\n\nThose interested in submitting/presenting testimony must complete and return a registration form as soon as possible. The form, and complete notice of this public hearing, can be found here.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "joe-borelli, matthew-titone, news", "title": "Assemblyman Joe Borelli opposes bill to create government-funded single-payer health plan", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Assemblyman Joe Borelli opposes bill to create government-funded single-payer health plan\", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/12/assemblyman_joe_borelli_oppose.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/16576677-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14759298\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-15T22:27:57Z\", \"author\": \"Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"joe-borelli\",\"matthew-titone\",\"news\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@SIAdvance", "description": "Assembly bill A05389A and Senate bill S02078A would create New York Health, which would require no premium, deductibles or co-pays.", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Writingrachel"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, December 15, 2014,  5:51 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.silive.com/latest_news/photo/borellijpg-d227e571da71b074.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rachelshapiro\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com\", \"author_id\": \"12017825\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Staten Island Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "SILive.com", "description": "Assembly bill A05389A and Senate bill S02078A would create New York Health, which would require no premium, deductibles or co-pays.", "title": "Assemblyman Joe Borelli opposes bill to create government-funded single-payer health plan", "url": "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/12/assemblyman_joe_borelli_oppose.html", "image": "http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/16576677-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "SILive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, December 15, 2014,  5:27 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Assembly bill A05389A and Senate bill S02078A would create New York Health, which would require no premium, deductibles or co-pays."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc4f\"", "article_summary": "Assembly bill A05389A and Senate bill S02078A would create New York Health, which would require no premium, deductibles or co-pays.\nBorelli (R-South Shore) is asking health care experts to testify to the Assembly Health Committee to discuss the costs and possible negative impacts.\nSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- A bill in the state Legislature would create a government-funded single-payer health plan and has drawn the ire of Assemblyman Joe Borelli, who is calling on experts to testify to the committee that's considering it.\nThe revenue would replace that of the local share of Medicaid, the state share of Medicaid, local payments for public employee health coverage and various other health care spending, the bill states.\nTitone said it's a complex issue and \"it would streamline health care in New York State, it would be great for small businesses who are compelled to pay into employees' health insurance benefits.\""}
