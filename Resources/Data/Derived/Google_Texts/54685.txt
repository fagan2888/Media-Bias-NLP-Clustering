Alaska has been aggressively seeking out such partnerships to gain more visibility over deal flow, and the favorable fee terms that come from writing larger checks to one manager. The last partnership that the Alaska Permanent Fund entered into on a similar scale was an up to $750 million account with Carlyle Group , approved in July 2013, to target natural resources, metals and energy.

Alaskaâ€™s proposed partnership with Apollo will include a $175 million separately managed account for unconstrained debt and distressed investments, $125 million for co-investments, and $100 million to source direct deals.
