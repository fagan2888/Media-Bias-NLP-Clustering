Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nMore than two years have passed, but veteran Supreme Court reporters can easily recall the day CNN and Fox News Channel got it wrong when announcing the court\u2019s Obamacare decision.\n\nGarrett Epps, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law who pens a column for The Atlantic, said he missed the reporting mess because he was actually inside the Supreme Court listening to Chief Justice John Roberts. He remembered Roberts talking about how the health care law\u2019s individual mandate could not be upheld using the Constitution's Commerce Clause. \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking, 'OK, well, he probably struck it down,'\u201d Epps recalled. \u201cThen he starts into this thing, \u2018Now on the other hand, view it as a tax.\u2019\u201d\n\nEpps was stunned. \u201cAnd this could have actually been the end of my career at the court because I was so gobsmacked, like everyone else in the room, that I turned to [then-Huffington Post Supreme Court correspondent] Mike Sacks, who was sitting in front of me, and I went, \u2018Holy crap,\u2019\u201d Epps said. \u201cAnd I should have been ejected, but the marshals, you could see them over there going, \u2018Holy crap,\u2019 so I survived.\u201d\n\nMarcia Coyle, chief Washington correspondent for The National Law Journal, had a similar \u2013 but less audible \u2013 reaction. \u201cI have a little more restraint than Garrett,\u201d she laughed. And Jess Bravin, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s SCOTUS reporter, said he was saved by looking at the syllabus, a summary of the decision. \u201cI looked at that first, and what saved me perhaps from making an error that day was seeing that combination of Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan \u2013 I said, 'That\u2019s unusual,'\u201d Bravin recalled, ticking off the last names of the more conservative chief justice and the four liberal members of the court.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those days where bare competence was treated by my bosses as superlative performance,\u201d Bravin added.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act case \u2013 properly known as the National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius \u2013 was part of a broader discussion on coverage of the court that brought the veteran reporters before an audience at the National Archives Wednesday night.\n\nCoyle called her beat both the best and one of the strangest. \u201cIt is an odd duck,\u201d she said. The biggest reason being that reporters don\u2019t really get access to the subjects they cover \u2013 and that\u2019s an understatement. \u201cSupreme Court justices \u2013 except for in the very, very special and wonderful moment when they have a book to sell \u2013 don\u2019t need publicity,\u201d explained Bravin.\n\n\n\nCoyle, who\u2019s also a Supreme Court analyst for \"PBS NewsHour,\" said she\u2019s had some luck because she\u2019s built a certain amount of trust with the justices throughout the years. She\u2019s also paid particularly close attention to how she\u2019s requested interviews. \u201cWhat I did was I wrote a request for an interview, submitted it to the head of the public information office and then waited and waited. Some of them were more prompt with their reply \u2013 they said 'no,'\u201d Coyle recalled. \u201cOthers, it took several months.\u201d\n\nEach of the justices have a particular interview style, and Coyle remembered Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's in particular. \u201cYou\u2019ll ask a question and then she\u2019ll sit there and there\u2019s this silence for the longest time and you want to give her the answer and you try to restrain yourself,\u201d Coyle said. \u201cAnd then she will answer and she\u2019ll come out with this perfect paragraph, but you have to be very patient.\u201d\n\nThat experience cemented something else in Coyle\u2019s mind as well: Even if the justices don\u2019t always talk to the press, they do care about the coverage. \u201cI know they follow the coverage, because, I\u2019ll tell you, my first interview with Justice Ginsburg, as I was leaving her chambers, she was behind me and she tapped me on the shoulder and she said, \u2018I watch you on the NewsHour on my treadmill,\u2019\u201d Coyle recalled.\n\nThe reporter then, with trepidation, asked Ginsburg how she was doing on the show.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Supreme Court Reporters Remember the Day of the Great Obamacare Screw-Up", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Three veteran Supreme Court reporters recall how they got it right and discuss why their beat is a challenge.", "title": "SCOTUS Scribes Recall Obamacare Confusion", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/10/09/supreme-court-reporters-remember-the-day-of-the-great-obamacare-screw-up", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/26/a8/246ee9484a61958168b779e9a913/141009-scotus-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three veteran Supreme Court reporters recall how they got it right and discuss why their beat is a challenge.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Supreme Court Reporters Remember the Day of the Great Obamacare Screw-Up"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nikki Schwab,Pulse,Supreme Court,Ginsburg, Ruth Bader,Wall Street Journal,CNN,Fox News,Affordable Care Act,Washington Whispers [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Three veteran Supreme Court reporters recall how they got it right and discuss why their beat is a challenge."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce35b\"", "article_summary": "Alex Wong/Getty ImagesMore than two years have passed, but veteran Supreme Court reporters can easily recall the day CNN and Fox News Channel got it wrong when announcing the court\u2019s Obamacare decision.\n\u201cSupreme Court justices \u2013 except for in the very, very special and wonderful moment when they have a book to sell \u2013 don\u2019t need publicity,\u201d explained Bravin.\nSome of them were more prompt with their reply \u2013 they said 'no,'\u201d Coyle recalled.\nCoyle, who\u2019s also a Supreme Court analyst for \"PBS NewsHour,\" said she\u2019s had some luck because she\u2019s built a certain amount of trust with the justices throughout the years.\nIt was a close call for some reporters on the SCOTUS beat when the Affordable Care Act decision came down in 2012."}
