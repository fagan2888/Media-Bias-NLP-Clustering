An inevitably male, white professor, obviously hoping to beat his students into intellectual submission on day one, begins the class with a bold declaration: \"There is no God.\" The students who aren't on Facebook dutifully type this into their notes. They don't know it now, but this is the beginning of the end for them and God; after all, the raison d'\u00eatre of the university is churning out militant secularists. Or at least, that's the caricature that some people, particularly conservative Christians, tend to toss around. The movie God's Not Dead, which was released last spring, includes a scene that's almost identical to this one\u2014except in the movie, the professor is challenged to a rhetorical battle by an earnest Christian student, who eventually \"proves\" this whole God's-dead schtick is really just about the professor's grief over the loss of his mother. The film, which was created by the Christian production studio Pure Flix Entertainment, grossed nearly $61 million in ticket sales.\n\nBut a new study suggests this stereotype isn't true\u2014in fact, college might make people more likely to be religious. \"The core finding is that the association between graduating from college and religious disaffiliation has changed drastically across generations,\" said Philip Schwadel, the study's author and a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For people who were born in the 1920s and '30s, the godless-college-grad stereotype is somewhat true: They were twice as likely as their uneducated peers to be religionless, not identifying with a particular church or synagogue or other religious institution. But over time, that trend changed. \"For those people who were born in the 1960s, there\u2019s really no difference between the college-educated and the non-college-educated in terms of their likelihood of disaffiliating from religion,\" Schwadel said. \"And for those born in the 1970s, it\u2019s actually the non-college-educated who are relatively likely to disaffiliate.\" Related Story Getting Married Later Is Great for College-Educated Women This may have happened for a few reasons, Schwadel said. \"The growth in college education may have led to a different population of people going to college.\" In the 1920s, only elites attended universities; especially at a time when religiosity was almost uniformly part of American life, it makes sense that this very small group of top intellectuals were the most likely to reject religion. Now that higher education has gotten somewhat more economically diverse and a lot more widespread, though, it seems natural that intellectual diversity at the university level has grown, too. But that doesn't explain Schwadel's most surprising finding: For people born during the 1970s, not going to college makes you more likely to say that you're not religious. The reason for this may be that atheism, agnosticism, and general religious indifference has become more normal across social classes, Schwadel said. \"For those people who were born earlier than the 1900s, it might have been something that wasn\u2019t acceptable among a lot of Americans, except those who were among the upper classes\u2014those select few who were going to college and graduating in the 1910s, \u201820s, and \u201830s. But as college education has grown, having no religious affiliation has become less ostracizing.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "For people born after 1960, having a college degree doesn&#39;t cause religious disaffiliation\u2014young, highly educated people are more likely to identify with a faith, according to a new study.", "author": "Emma Green", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "For people born after 1960, having a college degree doesn&#39;t cause religious disaffiliation\u2014young, highly educated people are more likely to identify with a faith, according to a new study.", "title": "It Turns Out Colleges Aren't Actually Atheist Factories", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/08/14596790949_0f8c3a3bc6_o/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/08/the-myth-of-the-godless-university/375950/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe8d\"", "article_summary": "\"The growth in college education may have led to a different population of people going to college.\"\nBut as college education has grown, having no religious affiliation has become less ostracizing.\"\n\"And for those born in the 1970s, it\u2019s actually the non-college-educated who are relatively likely to disaffiliate.\"\nBut a new study suggests this stereotype isn't true\u2014in fact, college might make people more likely to be religious.\nThe reason for this may be that atheism, agnosticism, and general religious indifference has become more normal across social classes, Schwadel said."}
