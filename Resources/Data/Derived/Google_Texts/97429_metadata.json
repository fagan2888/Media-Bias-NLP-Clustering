Among SOURCE\u2019s \u201ccommunity partners\u201d are Planned Parenthood of Maryland, which performs abortions and distributes contraceptives, and the pro-contraception Center for Adolescent Health.\n\nThis is not the first time that a problematic selection has been made to the board of trustees at Notre Dame. In 2011, newly elected trustee Roxanne Martino resigned from the board after The Cardinal Newman Society discovered and reported that she had contributed thousands of dollars to a pro-abortion organization.\n\nThe 2012 op-ed contributed to by Washington called contraception a \u201chuman right\u201d and dismissed religious freedom arguments against the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration's announcement that insurance companies must provide contraception averts an immediate threat to women's health; however, we fear the continued erosion of women's right to access contraception in the name of religious liberty,\u201d the opinion piece stated. \u201cWe look forward to practicing medicine in a country where all individuals have the right to complete health care \u2014 including contraception without deductibles and co-pays.\u201d\n\nThe op-ed squarely criticized the bishops\u2019 stance against the mandate.\n\nNational Catholic leaders, including Cardinal-designate Edwin F. O'Brien of Baltimore, have said that they would not comply with the law on religious grounds. After President Barack Obama announced a compromise on Friday \u2014 that insurance companies must provide free contraceptives when employers refuse to pay \u2014 Catholic officials still were not moved.\n\nAs physicians in training, we see contraception as an essential component of effective primary care, not as a political line item in Washington or the Vatican. Just as we provide tetanus shots and Pap smears, we prescribe contraception to maintain the well-being of our patients. Universal contraceptive access is a matter of reproductive justice and a major determinant of whether both men and women have control over their own futures, regardless of socioeconomic status.\n\nA few months after the op-ed was published, Politico reported:\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, who\u2019s suing the Obama administration over the birth control mandate, said Tuesday that President Barack Obama doesn\u2019t understand the \u201chorror\u201d that the Catholic Church feels over a \u201cstrangling\u201d religious exemption to the mandate.\n\nThe opinion piece from Washington and her fellow students contradicted the bishops\u2019 stance by saying, \u201cOur country's employment-based health insurance system does not give employers the standing to deny their employees safe and effective health care.\u201d\n\nDoctors for America, an organization which was originally named Doctors for Obama, touted the op-ed as part of its efforts on its website.\n\nIn 2012, Washington retweeted President Obama\u2019s announcement about the HHS Mandate which said, \u201cThanks to the Affordable Care Act, women won't have to pay out-of-pocket costs for contraception as of Aug. 1.\u201d\n\nAgain in 2012, Washington retweeted the following: \u201cMichael K. Williams of The Wire and Boardwalk Empire supports marriage equality: http://tinyurl.com/73plajv . Join him or Omar will get you.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2013, she encouraged others to join Organizing for Action, the Obama campaign\u2019s grassroots effort that includes advocacy for contraception and \u201creproductive rights.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame has sued the Obama administration over the HHS mandate but the University\u2019s commitment to its own lawsuit has been questioned numerous times. While the University\u2019s lawsuit clearly states that the HHS mandate \u201cwould require Notre Dame to commit scandal,\u201d President Fr. John Jenkins recently attempted to explain away the University\u2019s decision to submit to the mandate by saying at a student Town Hall event last semester, \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a scandal because we are not giving out contraceptives.\u201d\n\nJudge Richard Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reportedly questioned the University\u2019s desire for injunctive relief from the mandate since it had already submitted the required form to opt-out and switch the cost for abortifacients and contraceptives for employees to a third party administrator.\n\nBill Dempsey, chairman of the Notre Dame alumni group The Sycamore Trust, told The Cardinal Newman Society that with Washington\u2019s appointment, \u201cNotre Dame has just handed the government a loaded gun in its lawsuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is hard to believe that, after the embarrassment of the appointment as trustee of a contributor to the pro-choice cause a couple of years ago, the Notre Dame board would misfire again with the appointment of a public opponent of the University\u2019s and the Church\u2019s \u2019s stand against the abortifacient/contraceptive mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cMs. Washington should have the good grace to resign, or the board should force her to.\u201d\n\nDempsey added that Washington serving on the board of trustees is \u201ca threat to the school\u2019s claim of conscience, and her counsel as trustee in matters pertaining to the school\u2019s Catholic identity would be deeply suspect.\u201d\n\nAccording to the University, Washington studied biology and Catholic social teaching as an undergraduate at Notre Dame.\n\nThe University did not respond to The Cardinal Newman Society\u2019s inquiry by the time of publication.\n\nCatholic Education Daily is an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society.
