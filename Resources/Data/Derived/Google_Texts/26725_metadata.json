Firmly red states, by contrast, add up to only 149.\n\nIn short, a Republican candidate can win only by capturing all nine swing states and flipping a dyed-in-the-wool blue state, which Ladd considers virtually impossible.\n\n\u201cThis means that the next presidential election, and all subsequent ones until a future party realignment, will be decided in the Democratic primary,\u201d Ladd writes.\n\nThis analyst sees the midterm elections confirming a trend that has been growing over the past two decades.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are disappearing from the competitive landscape at the national level across the most heavily populated sections of the country,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile intensifying their hold on a declining electoral bloc of aging, white, rural voters.\u201d\n\nLadd buttresses his argument with several other observations. Democrats have consolidated their support in those parts of the country that generate most of the country\u2019s wealth outside the energy sector, he notes.\n\nAlmost half the Republican congressional delegation comes from the former Confederacy. (\u201cTotal coincidence,\u201d Ladd adds tongue in cheek. \u201cJust pointing that out.\u201d)\n\nEvery major Democratic ballot initiative, like minimum wage increases, won, even in red states, while every personhood amendment failed.\n\nLadd treats as an anomaly that some new governor candidates won in states that vote blue for president. \u201cTheir success was very specific and did not translate down the ballot at all,\u201d he says. These candidates, such as Bruce Rauner in Illinois, did not run on social issues, Obama or opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere has been, needless to say, considerable pushback on Ladd\u2019s view of the Blue Wall, including from leftist commentators. These critics attribute greater significance to governors like Republican Scott Walker in blue Wisconsin, and are not willing to accept the blueness of Virginia, for instance, as anything like permanent.\n\nThey want to average out red and blue in the four presidential elections since 2000, whereas Ladd perceives a trend going in one direction. They don\u2019t believe, as Martin Longman put it in the Washington Monthly, that things are as \u201cstatic\u201d as Ladd maintains, and argue that \u201cthe Blue Wall is not as impenetrable as it may seem.\u201d\n\nWhether or not there is a Blue Wall, it is the reason that Ladd gives for this shrinking Republican base that is perhaps more telling.\n\nIn an age of disruptive technologies and \u201cstaggering challenges\u201d that is \u201cbuilt for Republican solutions\u201d given the party\u2019s \u201ctraditional leadership on commercial issues,\u201d the GOP is missing the target, he says.\n\n\u201cWhat are we getting from Republicans?\u201d Ladd asks rhetorically. \u201cClimate denial, theocracy, thinly veiled racism, paranoia, and Benghazi hearings.\u201d\n\nDespite efforts new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to be conciliatory, he will not be able to hinder what Ladd predicts will be \u201cintense, horrifying stupidity\u201d in the next two years.\n\nPerhaps there is a new Ronald Reagan out there transformative enough to break down that Blue Wall, though Reagan was hardly an overnight success and there is no sign of anyone even close to his charisma at this point.\n\nUntil then, the notion of a Blue Wall may indeed be as predictive as this Republican analyst believes.", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The \u2018Blue Wall\u2019 virtually guarantees an Electoral College win in 2016, says Darrell Delamaide.", "creator": "@MKTWDelamaide", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CY371_KYmcco_ZG_20141104210749.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Darrell Delamaide", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-25T06:15:00-05:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-democrats-have-a-lock-on-the-white-house-2014-11-25", "author": "Darrell Delamaide", "parsely-title": "The Democrats have a lock on the White House", "description": "The \u2018Blue Wall\u2019 virtually guarantees an Electoral College win in 2016, says Darrell Delamaide.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The \u2018Blue Wall\u2019 virtually guarantees an Electoral College win in 2016, says Darrell Delamaide.", "title": "The Democrats have a lock on the White House", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-democrats-have-a-lock-on-the-white-house-2014-11-25", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CY371_KYmcco_ZG_20141104210749.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CY371_KYmcco_ZG_20141104210749.jpg"}, "article.id": "A2628AD2-7457-11E4-8ABE-CC187C6EBCFC", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc66\"", "article_summary": "Reuters Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell probably will preside over two years of fruitlessness before the Democrats will win the White House again.\nThere has been, needless to say, considerable pushback on Ladd\u2019s view of the Blue Wall, including from leftist commentators.\nThis means that these firmly blue states, the Blue Wall that Ladd is describing, account for 270 electoral votes \u2014 the number needed to be elected president.\nUntil then, the notion of a Blue Wall may indeed be as predictive as this Republican analyst believes.\nFirmly red states, by contrast, add up to only 149."}
