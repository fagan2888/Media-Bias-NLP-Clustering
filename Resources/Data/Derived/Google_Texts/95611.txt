The trouble with the rising cost of college is that no one really knows what college costs.

Oh, sure, we all know what the published tuition is at any given institution, as well as room, board and assorted fees. At private colleges the total often exceeds $50,000 a year. The figure at public institutions is lower, of course, but the upward trajectory has been similar.

But travel to many schools with a college-age child and you’ll quickly learn that a majority of students do not pay the sticker price. They get a tuition discount, and often a big one. So the actual average cost at any given institution is, well, a mystery.

And if you want to know what your cost would be, you’ve pretty much got to apply for admission.

We’ve long wondered why some universities don’t strike a blow for transparency by simply eliminating a great deal of the subsidy and reducing the sticker price to a figure closer to what the average student pays.

In other words, publicize a price that is actually meaningful.

Well, it seems that administrators at some small colleges have had the same idea, according to The New York Times. At Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C., for example, tuition has been reset at “$16,500, down 43 percent from the current year’s published price of $29,000.”

There’s a tradeoff, of course. The tuition discount rate will drop from 56 percent to 25 percent, according to Converse’s president. But presumably many students were getting discounts that took them only to the neighborhood of $16,500 anyway. Now they know up front what their families will need to come up with. No mystery. No anxiety while awaiting news regarding financial aid.

In most areas of the economy, providing a good product or service at a modest price is widely admired, but somehow the model was tossed aside in recent decades at many colleges. However, there’s no reason it can’t be restored.
