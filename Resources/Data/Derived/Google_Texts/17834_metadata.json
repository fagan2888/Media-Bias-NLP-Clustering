(AP) - Lemonia \u201cJoy\u201d Sims now has something awaiting her she never thought possible.\n\nA future.\n\n\u201cEvery sad word in the dictionary described me,\u201d she said. \u201cI never thought I would have peace or be able to smile.\u201d\n\nSims, a native of Chicago who now calls Quincy her home, has been battling a variety of mental illnesses for much of the past 21 years. She says she tried to commit suicide 10 times, attempting to end a life that began to spiral out of control at age 14 when her parents abandoned her and she became a ward of the state.\n\n\u201cMy mother chose drugs over me,\u201d Sims said. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle I am still alive.\u201d\n\nSims has been working in recent years with staff at Transitions of Western Illinois. She has become a shining example of how a relatively new approach to caring for and treating mental illness has provided hope \u2014 and a future \u2014 to people who years ago would have been locked up in a state institution and all but forgotten.\n\nSims soon will become a full-fledged member of society, thanks to what is called the \u201crecovery approach\u201d to mental illness. Part of this concept is the use of \u201crecovery specialists,\u201d staff members who once dealt with mental illness themselves and recovered.\n\nThe recovery process is regarded as a journey rather than a set outcome.\n\n\u201cThe key word in recovery is \u2018hope,\u2019\u201d said Alan Obert, who coordinates community-based services at Transitions.\n\nAn integral part of developing that hope is assisting someone like Sims to build a secure base and sense of self, be a part of supportive relationships and emphasize such intangibles as empowerment, social inclusion and coping skills.\n\nBarb Baker Chapin is the director of development at Transitions, which was founded as the Adams County Mental Health Center in 1955. She has worked in the mental health field for more than 40 years and says attitudes about mental health are much different today than when she began her career.\n\n\u201cRather than viewing a mental health problem as something to be embarrassed about or ashamed of, we now know that depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders are illnesses \u2014 just like diabetes or heart disease,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.\u201d\n\nObert said the approach to treating mental illness began to change dramatically around 2002 when President George W. Bush\u2019s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health helped establish a shift in attitudes and how mental health services would be delivered.\n\nThe commission emphasized what was termed a \u201crecovery approach.\u201d\n\nTransitions has embraced the concept of recovery and has tailored its services to that model during the past seven years.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that we focus with our consumers on what they want to do in life, rather than on what they cannot do,\u201d Obert said. \u201cWe help them focus on their dreams and their desires and help them develop a plan to achieve the goals they set for themselves. Sometimes goals relate to employment, living independently, participating in a hobby or sport, traveling, etc.\n\n\u201cWhatever the consumer identifies as something they would like to do, we try to assist them in achieving that goal. When we focus on what people can do rather than on what they cannot, people accomplish amazing things.\u201d\n\nTransitions employs three recovery specialists \u2014 Vickie Laack, Jeannie Schultz and Trisha Goodwin \u2014 who assist people with a mental illness. The recovery specialists are now staff members who themselves once dealt with a mental illness and have recovered. They serve as automatic inspirations to those in recovery, Obert said.\n\n\u201cOur recovery specialists bring a unique perspective to their work,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been there, and their successes help inspire those they serve. Much of their work involves helping consumers learn how to live with a mental illness.\u201d\n\nObert says the specialists conduct WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) groups in which they help consumers identify what makes them well then develop a plan to use these tools to stay well. They also help consumers take steps to reach the goals they set for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe recently received a grant that helps consumers who have a mental illness enter the workforce,\u201d Obert said. \u201cWhen a consumer mentions an interest in employment, we rapidly engage them in job-seeking activities. We also provide them supports, as needed, when they are hired. All of these services emphasize recovery and living a full, meaningful life.\u201d\n\nSims is looking forward to that kind of meaningful life. Ideally, she would like to become a recovery specialist after the necessary training.\n\n\u201cI want to get a job,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never filed taxes. I want to file taxes. A job can solve a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nLaack is impressed with the progress Sims has made in her journey.\n\n\u201cI knew her during some of her darkest times, when she was highly suicidal,\u201d Laack said. \u201cEach person\u2019s recovery is like a fingerprint. Each is different.\u201d\n\nAlong with combating mental issues, Sims also had to confront several physical problems that require continued therapy. She has had no family support through her ordeal.\n\n\u201cTransitions has been like my family. It has taken a long time and a lot of work, but I don\u2019t want to be disabled the rest of my life,\u201d Sims said.\n\nSchultz said that along with helping a consumer build a life-skills set, building trust is equally important.\n\n\u201cEveryone advances at their own speed,\u201d she said.\n\nSims said she can pinpoint the moment she felt she began to turn the proverbial corner in her recovery.\n\n\u201cI finally asked God that if he would show up and help me that I would do my part,\u201d she said. \u201c(It was then that) I started putting effort into everything in my life. When I wake up in the morning now, I am happy. Before, I didn\u2019t think that I could be helped.\u201d\n\nThe recovery specialists are as excited as those they help.\n\n\u201cWe get to see people get well,\u201d Laack said.\n\nThis relatively new approach to mental illness is in stark contrast to how those with mental issues were treated decades ago.\n\n\u201cIn the 1940s and 1950s, people who were suffering from a mental illness were housed in large institutions run by the state,\u201d Obert said. \u201cThere was little hope for recovery from their illnesses.\u201d\n\nObert said a community mental health care movement in the early 1970s resulted in community-based mental health treatment services and the closing of the large institutions.\n\nWith treatment and support available in the community, patients lived in the community rather than in state-operated institutions.\n\n\u201cWhile this movement provided more humane mental health treatment, our attitudes did not change much,\u201d Obert said. \u201cWe believed that people who suffered from a mental illness would likely never recover from their illnesses and would face a steady decline in functioning. They were given little hope of successful employment and living meaningful lives.\u201d\n\nThen along came \u201crecovery approach.\u201d\n\nGoodwin said even though she works as a recovery specialist and can now aid others in their own recovery, the process never ends.\n\n\u201cMy own recovery is like anyone else\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s day to day, month to month, year to year. Some days you think, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019 \u201c\n\nGoodwin, 34, was once a college athlete with dreams and goals. She once again has dreams and goals, which makes it easier to relay that kind of thought process to those she is trying to help.\n\n\u201cWe help create goals. We want to see those we are trying to help succeed get back to being part of society,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nSource: The Quincy Herald-Whig, http://bit.ly/1vG6VB6\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Quincy Herald-Whig, http://www.whig.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lemonia \"Joy\" Sims now has something awaiting her she never thought possible.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Lemonia \u201cJoy\u201d Sims now has something awaiting her she never thought possible.", "title": "EXCHANGE: New approach to treating mental illness", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/27/exchange-new-approach-to-treating-mental-illness/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/27/bfcbd7b79e3a992e660f6a70670027b0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/27/bfcbd7b79e3a992e660f6a70670027b0.jpg", "description": "Lemonia \"Joy\" Sims now has something awaiting her she never thought possible.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "EXCHANGE: New approach to treating mental illness"}, "Author": "STEVE EIGHINGER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e38\"", "article_summary": "This relatively new approach to mental illness is in stark contrast to how those with mental issues were treated decades ago.\nShe has worked in the mental health field for more than 40 years and says attitudes about mental health are much different today than when she began her career.\n\u201cThey are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.\u201dObert said the approach to treating mental illness began to change dramatically around 2002 when President George W.
