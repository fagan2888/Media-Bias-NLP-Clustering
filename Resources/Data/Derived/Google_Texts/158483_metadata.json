He\u2019s 6-feet, 248 pounds of heft. He once ripped a pitch at 103 mph \u2014 and he\u2019s the talk of Rockies spring training.\n\nThe 24-year-old reliever is the most compelling new name in Colorado\u2019s camp. Even if the very grown-up ballplayer talks like a shy kid.\n\n\u201cI never imagined that I would play in the big leagues,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cBut it was my dream.\u201d\n\nDiaz dreamed his way into the major leagues from Puerto la Cruz \u2014 a seaside city in north-central Venezuela, about a five-hour flight from Miami \u2014 where his mother, father and older brother keep tabs on his first season in the Rockies\u2019 organization.\n\nDiaz was just 14 when he left school to join a baseball academy in Puerto la Cruz. He signed a professional contract with the Los Angeles Angels when he was 16. His journey from the high-pressure teenage baseball factories in his home country to the big leagues isn\u2019t unusual. But that path from Puerto la Cruz to the big leagues is suddenly uncertain for other young players.\n\nVenezuela could become the new Cuba. International political relations are strained. Last week, President Barack Obama imposed a new round of sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials, accusing them of human-rights violations and corruption. Venezuela responded by requiring visas to visit and demanding the U.S. cut its embassy staff.\n\nMajor League Baseball is scrambling to react. Venezuela remains a prime pipeline of young talent. There were 224 players born outside the U.S. on opening-day rosters last year, about 26 percent of the total. Of those, 83 were born in the Dominican Republic and 59 in Venezuela.\n\nBut the Seattle Mariners last week became the latest team to close their academy system in Venezuela and move it to the Dominican Republic. Just four teams now have academies in Venezuela: the Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, Tampa Bay Rays and Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nObama\u2019s executive order, which declared a national emergency in response to an \u201cextraordinary threat to the national security\u201d in Venezuela, followed similar sanctions from Congress late last year.\n\nThe foreign ministry of Venezuela, under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, responded by buying a full-page ad in The New York Times that called the U.S. and Obama \u201ctyrannical and imperial.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird there right now,\u201d Diaz said when asked about the political climate in Venezuela.\n\nThe Rockies have a facility in Venezuela that\u2019s something short of an academy. It\u2019s a house converted into a dormitory. And the Rockies still have three scouts running an operation from the outpost.\n\nBut Rolando Fernandez, the Rockies\u2019 vice president of international scouting and development, couldn\u2019t visit Venezuela last week because of visa restrictions. He\u2019s not the only one. Fernandez said he has heard from other scouts who can\u2019t get to Venezuela.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m waiting to see what\u2019s the procedure,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI understand Major League Baseball is working with the minister of sports in Venezuela, an ex-player, to work on it.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the Rockies had seven players born in Venezuela on their roster. This year, they\u2019ll have two, Carlos Gonzalez and Jhoulys Chacin, and two more trying to break camp with the big-league team, Cristhian Adames and Diaz.\n\n\u201cThrough all these problems, baseball has continued to grow there,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy (to scout) as it was 15 years ago. But they don\u2019t want to damage the game of baseball. They love the game.\u201d\n\nDiaz, with his unique physical ability to throw very hard, was a typical kid in Venezuela before he was pegged by scouts for the big leagues.\n\n\u201cA lot of scouts were watching me because even when I was 14, I had a really good arm,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said I had a future as a catcher because of my size, but I couldn\u2019t hit.\u201d\n\nThe Angels recognized the problem and moved Diaz from behind the plate to the pitching mound when he was 19. He played on the Angels\u2019 Dominican summer-league team, then in the minors in Utah, Iowa and California.\n\nAngels general manager Jerry Dipoto said his scouts clocked Diaz with a 103-mph pitch last season. His arm was too live to ignore. So Diaz, at 23, jumped from Double-A to the majors a year ago.\n\nThe Rockies noticed. Their scouts measured him in the 101-102 mph range. But they liked his physical and mental makeup even more. So they worked a trade in December, sending backup infielder Josh Rutledge to the Angels.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very happy go-lucky guy, a very pleasant person to be around,\u201d said Jon Weil, the Rockies\u2019 assistant GM for player personnel. \u201cAnd it looks like he flips a switch when he gets out there. He turns into a super-aggressive, late-inning mentality type reliever. But when you meet him, he\u2019s very unassuming. I think that will bode well for him being a good teammate.\u201d\n\nDiaz is likely headed for Triple-A Albuquerque to start the season, but he\u2019s in line for a call-up during the season. The Rockies have three young relievers and a veteran competing for the seventh, and maybe eighth, chair in the bullpen, including Brooks Brown, 29; Tommy Kahnle, 24; and Rafael Betancourt, 39.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an interesting guy,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said of Diaz. \u201cYou don\u2019t see arms like that very often. He\u2019s a real strong kid, thick, just very powerful and explosive. That\u2019s the way he pitches too.\u201d\n\nDiaz approaches his budding career as the quiet kid in the corner of the clubhouse. He said he\u2019s thinking about how things are \u201cweird\u201d back home, but he loves where he\u2019s at with the Rockies.\n\n\u201cBaseball is the same everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nDiaz profile\n\nJairo Diaz is pitching for a spot in the Rockies\u2019 bullpen during spring training.
