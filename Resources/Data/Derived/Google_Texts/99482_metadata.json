(\u201cThe media elite don\u2019t vet their own, just the enemy.\u201d)\n\nAgain, Obama\u2019s entering his eighth year in office, but somehow he hasn\u2019t been vetted? Somehow all kinds of embarrassing and scandalous parts of his background remain under wraps? It\u2019s hard to believe. And as Media Matters detailed, not many journalists are buying the claim that Carson\u2019s being held to a unique standard.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion that others have not gone through this [scrutiny] ignores history,\u201d noted Washington Postreporter Ed O\u2019Keefe.\n\nThe not-vetted complaint works side-by-side with the revived \u2018liberal media bias\u2019 allegation that\u2019s been at the center of the Republican campaign season in recent weeks. Together, the two claims represent the Mantle and Maris of conservative whining. The conspiratorial bookends are often used to try to explain away Obama\u2019s two electoral landslide victories. Conservatives seem to think that if only the truth were revealed, \u201cThen the scales will fall from the voters\u2019 eyes and they\u2019ll boot him from the office he never deserved to occupy in the first place,\u201dwrote Paul Waldman at American Prospect.\n\nThe vetting claim reflects life inside the Fox News-generated bubble. It reflects a conservative movement that\u2019s increasingly allergic to bouts of reality and common sense. It goes to a core belief that they\u2019ve been right all along about Obama and his dastardly ways, it\u2019s just that the press won\u2019t inform the public.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: conservative commentators, and especially conservative bloggers, are ignoring the fact that Obama was vetted \u2014 by them. For more than two presidential election cycles.\n\nAnd it was priceless.\n\nObama\u2019s a Muslim. Obama was born in Kenya. Obama forged his birth certificate. Obama is the son of Malcolm X. Obama\u2019s hiding his gay past.\n\nAll of those claims, and much more, were forwarded by right-wing media outlets (including Fox News) that have been thrashing around in cesspools over the years, all in the name of vetting the elusive Obama. (The late blogger and satirist Al Weisel, known as Jon Swift, masterfully detailed the attempted vetting.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives have convinced themselves Ben Carson is being persecuted by the left.
