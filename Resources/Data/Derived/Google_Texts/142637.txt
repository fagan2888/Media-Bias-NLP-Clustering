As GOP presidential hopefuls take the stage in Wednesday night's CNBC Republican debate in Colorado, Main Street will be watching. From wages to health-care reform and taxes, small business owners are hoping to see key issues addressed.

The debate comes at a time when sentiment among America's small businesses is arguably holding steady, on a climb following the recession. The last reading from the conservative-leaning lobbying group the National Federation of Independent Business saw optimism edge slightly higher to 96.1. However, some like Lisa Hendrickson aren't convinced of a full recovery.

"The economy doesn't seem to be moving at a clip it needs to be, and I don't think we have people who are very clear on having a plan about how we take away barriers to economic growth, to support small businesses," said Hendrickson, who runs a small pricing strategy firm in Manhattan called Spark City.
