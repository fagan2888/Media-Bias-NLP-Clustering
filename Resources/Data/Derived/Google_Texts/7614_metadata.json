What do you say to the Pope?\"\"I would say, ISIS (the Islamic State) wants to get you. You know that ISIS wants to go in and take over the Vatican?\" Trump said.\"He talks about capitalism, you scare the Pope?\" Cuomo asked.\"The Pope, I hope, can only be scared by God,\" Trump said, before adding, \"The truth is, you know, if you look at what is going on, they better hope that capitalism works. It is the only thing we have right now. It is a great thing when it works properly.\"But capitalism hasn't been working properly in American, Trump said.
