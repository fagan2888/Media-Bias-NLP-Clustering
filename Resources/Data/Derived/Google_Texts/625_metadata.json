These services include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n--Health services to vulnerable or underserved people\n\n--Financial or in-kind support for public health programs\n\n--Health education, health screenings, and prevention services\n\n--Medical research and health professions education\n\n--Community-building activities such as neighborhood revitalization projects, or workforce development programs\n\n\n\nIn 2013, as tallied by the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon hospitals provided more than $1.9 billion in community benefit contributions to their communities, while providing care for 336,153 inpatients, more than 9.9 million outpatients, and more than 1.2 million emergency room visits.
