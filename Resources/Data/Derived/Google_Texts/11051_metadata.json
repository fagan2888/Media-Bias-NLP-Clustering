New York state has plans to establish a program of its own.\n\nSEE ALSO: HHS chief: Time for GOP \u2018to move on\u2019 if administration wins Obamacare case\n\nRep. Peter Roskam, Illinois Republican who chairs the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s oversight panel, says the Affordable Care Act of 2010 established the Basic Health Program but didn\u2019t provide funding for it. And so far, the GOP-led House has not appropriated the money, citing its opposition to the law.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has said the program is funded under permanent appropriations for tax credit programs, such as Obamacare\u2019s exchange subsidies.\n\nTax credit programs \u201caren\u2019t part of our discretionary budget every year,\u201d Mrs. Burwell told the congressman during a Ways and Means Committee hearing last week.\n\nSEE ALSO: Few GOP candidates are prepared with alternatives if court rules against Obamacare\n\nBut GOP lawmakers say the pool of money for Obamacare\u2019s tax credits does not also cover the Basic Health Program.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see how they can possibly hang their hats on a legal theory that lets them do this,\u201d Mr. Roskam said.\n\nThe secretary told Mr. Roskam she would meet with him and Rep. Tim Murphy, Pennsylvania Republican and chairman of oversight for the Energy and Commerce Committee, to elaborate on her position.\n\nThe Basic Health Program was designed to give states the flexibility to help out people who make 200 percent of the federal poverty or less, but may float in and out of Medicaid eligibility. The federal government pays out 95 percent of the cost it would have otherwise paid in exchange subsidies and cost-sharing payments for the enrollees.\n\n\u201cThe Basic Health Program is an option for states that provides flexibility and stability to both states and their consumers,\u201d HHS spokeswoman Meaghan Smith said. \u201cPayments to states that choose this option are fully funded under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe GOP\u2019s new concerns about the program parallel claims in House Speaker John A. Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against the administration.\n\nAs it stands, House Republicans are challenging Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to twice delay the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance mandate on employers and to continue reimbursing insurers who have reduced co-pays and deductibles for qualified Obamacare enrollees as a condition of participating in the state-based health care exchanges.\n\nThe lawsuit says Congress never authorized spending for the cost-sharing program, and indeed zeroed out funding for it, so Mr. Obama was breaking the law and violating Congress\u2018 constitutional power of the purse by continuing to disburse the funds.\n\n\u201cIt is Congress that wields the power of the purse, and more and more, the administration is acting like a purse snatcher,\u201d Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said at last week\u2019s hearing with Mrs. Burwell.\n\nThe administration argues it hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, once again citing the permanent appropriation that also covers Obamacare\u2019s exchange subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe House\u2019s statutory arguments are incorrect. The cost sharing reduction payments are being made as part of a mandatory payment program that Congress has fully appropriated,\u201d Justice Department attorneys said in court papers seeking to dismiss Mr. Boehner\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nU.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer in Washington is still deciding whether House Republican have legal standing to sue the president, although she seemed sympathetic to their arguments at a hearing last month.\n\n\u201cYou either appropriate money or you don\u2019t,\u201d she said at one point.\n\nMr. Roskam said complaints about the Basic Health Program could bolster the GOP suit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing this to the attention of the speaker,\u201d he said. \u201cso he can make a decision about informing the legal team and ultimately making a decision [whether to bring it up] at some point in the litigation, or initiating other litigation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans suing President Obama on claims he funded an Obamacare program without their permission now say the administration is sending millions out the door for a second, optional state program without asking Congress for the money first.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Republicans suing President Obama on claims he funded an Obamacare program without their permission now say the administration is sending millions out the door for a second, optional state program without asking Congress for the money first.", "title": "GOP takes aim at funding for Basic Health Program", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/gop-takes-aim-at-funding-for-basic-health-program/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/20/cf8ce984f4d18d17570f6a70670035ee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/20/cf8ce984f4d18d17570f6a70670035ee.jpg", "description": "House Republicans suing President Obama on claims he funded an Obamacare program without their permission now say the administration is sending millions out the door for a second, optional state progr", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP takes aim at funding for Basic Health Program"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Republican Party, Peter Roskam, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe51ca\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Roskam said complaints about the Basic Health Program could bolster the GOP suit.\nSEE ALSO: Few GOP candidates are prepared with alternatives if court rules against ObamacareBut GOP lawmakers say the pool of money for Obamacare\u2019s tax credits does not also cover the Basic Health Program.\n\u201cThe Basic Health Program is an option for states that provides flexibility and stability to both states and their consumers,\u201d HHS spokeswoman Meaghan Smith said.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see how they can possibly hang their hats on a legal theory that lets them do this,\u201d Mr. Roskam said.\nThe Basic Health Program was designed to give states the flexibility to help out people who make 200 percent of the federal poverty or less, but may float in and out of Medicaid eligibility."}
