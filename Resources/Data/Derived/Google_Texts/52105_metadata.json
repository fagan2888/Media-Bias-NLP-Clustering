The Kentucky Republican and libertarian-ish senator is among the people considered most likely to seek the GOP nomination for the presidency in 2016, and during his brief time in office he\u2019s held a variety of positions related to immigration, lurching from extreme nativism to measured support for moderate reforms. Last week, while on a trip to Guatemala to perform pro-bono cataract surgery, Paul tossed another policy position onto the pile: support for a bill passed by House Republicans to end President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shields certain young undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nSo, in the spirit of trying to figure out just what the hell is going on here, let\u2019s track the evolution of and changes to Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s stance on immigration.\n\nOne of the very first things Rand Paul did upon his entry into the U.S. Senate was to join Sen. David Vitter in proposing a constitutional amendment to end birthright citizenship \u2013 one of the foundations of U.S. citizenship law that has been in place since Reconstruction. His impetus for doing so was the threat posed by so-called \u201canchor babies.\u201d According to conservative mythology, pregnant immigrant women would cross the border into the U.S. immediately prior to giving birth so that their child would have U.S. citizenship. Then the immigrant parents would wait 21 years until their citizen child could sponsor them for residency.\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably surmised, it\u2019s not the most effective plan for circumventing immigration laws, which is probably why \u2013 all the nativist hype notwithstanding \u2013 it wasn\u2019t actually happening to any large degree. But newly ensconced Sen. Paul wanted to change the Constitution to end the \u201canchor baby\u201d threat. \u201cCitizenship is a privilege, and only those who respect our immigration laws should be allowed to enjoy its benefits,\u201d Paul said at the time.\n\nThat was a hardline position for Paul to take, but not entirely unexpected. During his 2010 campaign, Paul was an outspoken opponent of immigration reform bills being put forward by President Obama and the Democratic Congress. The DREAM Act, which would have created a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children, was killed by Republican filibusters in 2010. On the campaign trail, Paul lashed out at the legislation. \u201cWashington liberals are trying to push through the so-called DREAM Act, which creates an official path to Democrat voter registration for 2 million college-age illegal immigrants,\u201d Paul said at the time, calling it a \u201croundabout way of giving amnesty to illegal immigrant students and undermining the rule of law.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Paul came around to a more measured, less antagonistic attitude on immigration. Shortly after President Obama crushed Mitt Romney among Latino voters, Paul began talking about the need for Republicans to deal with undocumented immigration. In an interview with Politico, Paul laid out a plan for \u201can eventual path\u201d to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, paired with a plan to bar \u201cany new legal immigrants while we\u2019re assimilating the ones who are here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kentucky senator does the libertarian/Tea Party flip-flop time and again on immigration.
