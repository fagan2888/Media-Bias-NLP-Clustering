That it\u2019s one guy with a pen in this town, who is running the American economy?\u201d Ryssdal asked.\n\nWithout skipping a beat, Obama launched into an attack on House Republicans and blamed them for his overreach.\n\n\u201cWell, unfortunately, we have a Congress that\u2019s broken down. And I know that a lot of times people who are watching what\u2019s happening in Washington sort of feel like, \u2018You know, a plague on both their houses. Democrats, Republicans, they\u2019re all the same. None of them care about us.\u2019 But the truth is that we have a very specific problem. We have a House of Representatives that is so ideologically driven at this point that they are not able to carry out basic functions of government,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cSo we saw this during the government shutdown. The idea that we would shut down the government based on a notion that we\u2019ve got to drastically cut the basic safety net \u2014 despite the fact that the deficit has come down by more than half during my presidency \u2014 is not based on common sense, it\u2019s not based on any sound economic theories. It\u2019s based on the ideological predispositions of a handful of folks who are currently calling the shots in the House of Representatives,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe same is true, we just recently saw, with immigration reform; we have bipartisan support for immigration reform. We know that the economy would grow faster, that we would end up seeing $1.4 trillion in additional growth in the United States if in fact we passed immigration reform. We know that there are companies across the country, particularly in the high-tech sector, that are begging to have highly skilled immigrants \u2014 who we\u2019ve trained, we\u2019ve paid for and are now going back to their home countries to start businesses \u2014 stay here in the United States. Despite all that, we still couldn\u2019t get the House of Representatives to act, primarily because of politics, primarily because they\u2019re captive of a small ideological band inside their caucus.\u201d\n\nObama, aren\u2019t you tired of the blame game by now?\n\nThe full transcript of the Marketplace interview can be found here.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Official White House Photo by Pete Souza New day, same old story.
