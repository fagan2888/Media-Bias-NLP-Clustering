It\u2019s like the past seven years never happened for Republicans. And House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) says he has a \u201cbold, pro-growth agenda\u201d for 2016. In his weekly address Saturday, Ryan laid out the \u201cmission statement\u201d of that agenda:\n\n\u201cWe want to save the American Idea for the vast majority of Americans who believe it\u2019s just not there for them anymore. We want America to lead again. We want America to be confident again. That is our mission.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u201cBy giving the people a clear choice in 2016, we will seek a mandate to do big things in 2017 and beyond.\u201d\n\nWatch Courtesy of Speaker Ryan\u2019s Press Office:\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the mission statement. Here is the plan, vague and incomprehensible as anything coming out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth:\n\nThese discussions will focus on five areas. First, national security. How do we go about building a 21st-century military? What do we need to do to make sure we\u2019re equipped to defeat ISIS and the threat posed by radical Islamic terror? How do we make sure we are secure here at home? Next, jobs and economic growth. Our economy is far from its potential. Wages are still stagnant. Families are suffering. How do we fix our tax code? How do we rein in our regulatory state? How do we maximize our energy potential? Third, health care. Obamacare has driven up premiums, limited choices, and taken away access. These are not the signs of success \u2013 they\u2019re the signs of failure. If and when we repeal Obamacare, what solutions will lead to lower costs and a truly patient-centered health care system? Fourth, poverty and opportunity. There are 46 million Americans living in poverty today, and a big part of the reason is we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. How do we lift people up, bring them back into the workforce, and restore upward mobility? The last piece of this agenda \u2013 and it\u2019s so critical to all the others \u2013 is restoring the Constitution. The president\u2019s executive overreach has undermined the Constitution and damaged the people\u2019s trust. What needs to be done to restore the separation of powers and protect our constitutional liberties?\n\nThere are so many problems with these vaguely worded and deliberately (it is to be hoped \u2013 we don\u2019t want to believe they\u2019re that stupid!) misconceptions:\n\nFirst, notice he puts national security at the top of his list without once mentioning the biggest threat to our national security: climate change. He doesn\u2019t mention the domestic terrorists threatening our freedom at home, but turns the Islamic State into the new Soviet Union. He talks about being secure at home without once mentioning the scourge of gun violence and his own refusal to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists.\n\nNext, he ignores the fact that Obama has outperformed Reagan in job growth. He ignores the fact that by the end of 2009, Obama\u2019s economy was no longer hemorrhaging jobs but creating them. Ryan ignores that by this past summer, Obama had overseen 64 straight months of private sector job growth. Ignores that by September Obama had reached 66 months and overseen the fastest job growth pace since Bill Clinton. You\u2019d think none of that had ever happened. But it did.\n\nFourth, how are Republicans going to address poverty by eliminating the safety net? Is Ryan serious that the safety net and not giving all our money to rich people and corporations who ship jobs overseas and put all that money into un-taxable foreign bank accounts, is to blame? Yes, Ryan assumes if you\u2019re poor its because you want to be poor. It will work much better to just give all that money to rich people and corporations, because they\u2019ll share some of it with Paul Ryan.\n\nThe last piece of his agenda, allegedly putting the Constitution first, is the biggest joke of all. This is the party that assumed, when they won a majority in Congress, that Obama\u2019s re-election was inconsequential, that it was the Republican who had been given a mandate by the people, and that the president had to do precisely what they say. They are the ones who have violated the Constitution again and again to legislate religion, to stab the president in the back in the area of foreign policy. Executive overreach? How about legislative overreach?\n\nYou\u2019ve already got this one figured out, I suspect: Yes, the party that nearly ran our economy into the grave is going to \u2018fix\u2019 our economy using the same policies that nearly ran our economy into the grave.\n\nRyan is certainly using the right language, pretending to have learned the valuable lesson of the years he pretends never happened:\n\n\u201cTo do that, we can\u2019t just be an opposition party. We have to be a proposition party. If we do not like the direction the country is going in \u2013 and we do not \u2013 then we have an obligation to offer an alternative.\u201d\n\nWell\u2026that would be a first, wouldn\u2019t it? Sadly, he\u2019s saying this, but he doesn\u2019t mean it, as the most recent attempt to repeal Obamacare demonstrates. Republicans had NO alternative health care reform options to offer. Just kill Obamacare. Period. Back to the status quo that didn\u2019t work before and won\u2019t work now.\n\nThe big problem with Ryan\u2019s agenda is that as Robert Reich has demonstrated, that alternative has already been tried, and look where it got us in 2008. Ryan closes by saying, \u201cWe see it as our duty here in the people\u2019s house to offer real ideas, to tackle the real issues head on. We want a confident America. Now it\u2019s time to get to work.\u201d\n\nReal issues: like repealing Obamacare for the seventieth time? Another investigation into Benghazi after your definitive House report that there was nothing going on?\n\nTake heed, America. Because when Republicans say they\u2019re going to fix things, they mean they\u2019re going to destroy all the gains we\u2019ve made in the past seven years. That\u2019s Paul Ryan\u2019s one and only agenda.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan insists he is going to 'fix' things, but since Obama has already done that, he can only mean he's going to destroy them", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Paul Ryan insists he is going to 'fix' things, but since Obama has already done that, he can only mean he's going to destroy them", "title": "Paul Ryan's 'Pro-Growth Agenda' Calls for Giving Your Money to Rich People", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/01/17/paul-ryans-pro-growth-agenda-calls-giving-money-rich-people.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ryan-prosperity.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-17T07:55:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,Barack Obama,climate change,Congress,Economy,Islamic State,job growth,Obamacare,paul ryan,Pro-Growth Agenda,Republican Party,U.S. House of Representatives,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2016-01-17T07:55:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-17T07:55:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, climate change, Congress, Economy, Islamic State, job growth, Obamacare, paul ryan, Pro-Growth Agenda, Republican Party, U.S. House of Representatives"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3655\"", "article_summary": "Because when Republicans say they\u2019re going to fix things, they mean they\u2019re going to destroy all the gains we\u2019ve made in the past seven years.\nAnd House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) says he has a \u201cbold, pro-growth agenda\u201d for 2016.\nFourth, how are Republicans going to address poverty by eliminating the safety net?\nIt will work much better to just give all that money to rich people and corporations, because they\u2019ll share some of it with Paul Ryan.\nThat\u2019s Paul Ryan\u2019s one and only agenda."}
