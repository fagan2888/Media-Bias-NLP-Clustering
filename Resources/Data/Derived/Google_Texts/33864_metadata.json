Republicans were taking classes on how to talk to the ladies and members were under explicit instructions from the party\u2019s establishment to not just change their tones, but to shut their mouths when it came to women\u2019s bodies.\n\n[READ: Women Don't Need Democrats to Control Their Libido, Huckabee Says]\n\nBut the \u201cbinders of women\u201d and \u201clegitimate rape\u201d narratives that dominated the 2012 elections have morphed into a self-inflicted wound that continues to fester in the Republican Party. Democrats now are dusting off their 2012 election playbook and pouncing on any GOP foible that even remotely resembles a Todd Akin rape gaffe.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for opportunity to present itself,\u201d says Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. \u201cIt is not a hand we are overplaying. This is the hand [Republicans] keep giving us.\u201d\n\nAt the Republican Party\u2019s winter meeting last Thursday, former Arkansas Gov. and one-time GOP presidential nominee Mike Huckabee gave the Democrats midterm election fodder when he compared the Obama administration to \u201cUncle Sugar,\u201d who provides birth control for women because Democrats think women \u201ccannot control their libido.\u201d \u201cYou have people in the party who keep stepping on these issues, saying things that they may well believe, but aside from their base, are not very popular,\u201d says Jennifer Duffy, a campaign expert with The Cook Political Report.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just a Republican Party image problem or a matter of rhetoric Democrats are hoping to highlight: Democrats are looking for any opportunity to point to the parties\u2019 substantive policy differences, too.\n\nJust hours before President Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address Tuesday, women\u2019s issues dominated the legislative agenda. Democrats filed their amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the Affordable Care Act mandate that requires employers to provide birth control for their workers. Republican senators filed their amicus brief against upholding that portion of the law. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., delivered a speech at the National Press Club touting his Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would ban states from enacting some of the 205 laws Republican-controlled statehouses have passed since 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans across the Capitol passed the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would ban the government from offering tax credits to corporations and individuals who choose health care plans that offer abortion coverage.\n\n[ALSO: Politics Parties and PACs Key to Recruiting Women to Congress]\n\nAlso Tuesday, eight Democratic women held a photo op with Lilly Ledbetter, the namesake of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, the first bill Obama signed into law and one that extended the statute of limitations for women who wished to sue their employers for pay discrimination. It marked the first time in his presidency that Obama sought to define his party as the one to defend women\u2019s equality -- a message that helped secure him his second term in the White House. Now, Democrats are hoping their focus on women\u2019s rights can be a cure-all, the magic bullet that shields vulnerable lawmakers in Congress from the fallout of a rocky Obamacare implementation.\n\nDemocrats see the \u201cwar on women\u201d narrative as a way to motivate unmarried women -- a key constituency for the party, but one that has a history of staying home in midterm elections -- to vote in 2014. Last year\u2019s Virginia gubernatorial election gave Democrats a testing ground for implementing the strategy in an off-year election, and it worked. In that race, Democrats highlighted Republican Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s \u201cextreme\u201d record on women\u2019s health, and an exit poll conducted by the left-leaning Democracy Corps found that unmarried women voted by a 42-point margin to elect Democrat Terry McAuliffe.\n\n\u201cDemocrats need these voters to win and that means turn out to vote. But in order to turn them out, Democrats must speak to the issues that matter to them most,\u201d Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg wrote.\n\nRepublican pollsters say Democrats\u2019 strategy could backfire, because \u201cthe issues that matter most\u201d to women aren\u2019t related to abortion or contraception, and instead have everything to do with their pocketbooks.\n\n\u201cOur polls show that the most important issue to women as well as men is the economy and job creation and health care,\u201d says Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster. \u201cI can understand why the Democrats want to divert the attention from all those other issues, but those are the issues that are going to dominate the midterm election.\u201d\n\n[MORE: GOP Turns 'War on Women' Back on Democrats]\n\nExperts also warn that unlike in 2012, when the narrative surrounding the presidential election trickled down into congressional contests, each congressional race will have a much more localized focus. Jennifer Lawless, a political scientist at American University who studies women and politics, says that voters in midterm elections rely heavily on their local newspapers to set the agenda, not the national news.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot easier for a Republican candidate in an individual race to distance themselves from comments made by someone like Mike Huckabee in a midterm election cycle than it is in a presidential election year,\u201d Lawless says.\n\nIt may be too early to know whether Democrats can take their \u201cwar on women\u201d strategy all the way in 2014. But a lot depends on whether the Republican Party can keep its members from doing any more damage.\n\n\u201cThe residue in 2012 is not salient. It needs to be reactivated,\u201d Lawless says. \u201cYou cannot win the 2014 election based off Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Lauren Fox", "title": "Democrats Bet 2014 on \u2018War on Women\u2019 Encore", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Democrats dust off the 2012 playbook to hold the Senate, make up ground in the House.", "title": "Democrats Bet 2014 on \u2018War on Women\u2019 Encore", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/29/democrats-bet-2014-on-war-on-women-encore", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3b/71/f99d8be4483ebf6b0730e8703bb2/140129women-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats dust off the 2012 playbook to hold the Senate, make up ground in the House.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Democrats Bet 2014 on \u2018War on Women\u2019 Encore"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 29, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lauren Fox,Lauren Fox", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Democrats dust off the 2012 playbook to hold the Senate, make up ground in the House."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda672\"", "article_summary": "For a while, it looked like Democrats would have to stop accusing Republicans of waging a \u201d\u2018war on women\u201d in 2014.\nIt may be too early to know whether Democrats can take their \u201cwar on women\u201d strategy all the way in 2014.\nJust hours before President Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address Tuesday, women\u2019s issues dominated the legislative agenda.\nBut a lot depends on whether the Republican Party can keep its members from doing any more damage.\nDemocrats see the \u201cwar on women\u201d narrative as a way to motivate unmarried women -- a key constituency for the party, but one that has a history of staying home in midterm elections -- to vote in 2014."}
