He cast himself as a sharp manager and was more forceful than Coakley in denouncing recent problems with the state\u2019s health care website, which has been plagued by errors and has cost millions of dollars to fix.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing the next governor is going to have to do is have a firm hand on the tiller and follow through and execute,\u201d he said, adding later that \u201cthe next governor should be a weed whacker.\u201d\n\nRELATED: On environmental issues, candidate agree on core issues, disagree on specifics\n\nBaker repeatedly faulted Coakley for defending DCF against a lawsuit from a children\u2019s advocacy group that has accused the department of endangering foster children. That suit is at the heart of the Republican super PAC ad attacking Coakley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaker\u2019s attacks, along with those lobbed by Coakley and the three independent candidates, were often pointed, but not personal.\n\nEven when the debate delved into the emotional issue of child abuse, there were no fireworks or angry moments. Baker, in fact, went out of his way to praise Coakley\u2019s work as a prosecutor.\n\nRELATED: Jeff Jacoby: Running from the \u2018R\u2019 word\n\nRELATED: Scot Lehigh: The edge goes to Charlie Baker\n\n\u201cNo one is questioning your work as a child advocate across your long and distinguished career in the public sector,\u201d Baker, who at 6-foot-6 loomed over Coakley as she stood at a podium next to his. \u201cIt\u2019s work she, and all of us, should be proud of.\u201d\n\nBut he said DCF\u2019s recent history of botched cases shows Coakley was wrong to fight the advocacy group\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cMassachusetts and the children served by that department would have been better served if the Commonwealth had moved instead to fix what was wrong on that agency, instead of litigating that case,\u201d he said.\n\nCoakley argued that the case did not have merit and said she preferred to have the state try on its own to repair DCF, \u201crather than spend millions of dollars on outside lawyers.\u201d\n\nShe was clearly determined not to cede ground on the issue. When Baker said he had read briefs in that suit and found them compelling, Coakley pounced by saying her connection to the issue was far more personal.\n\n\u201cCharlie has read the briefs, but I have sat with those families,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sat with the people for years.\u201d\n\nThe debate, held at WBZ-TV and moderated by political analyst Jon Keller, could be the last to include the three independent candidates: former health care executive Evan Falchuk, venture capitalist Jeff McCormick, and Christian pastor Scott Lively. They are not slated to appear in the three final televised clashes before the Nov. 4. election.\n\nThe independent candidates were positioned at the edge of the stage, reflecting how the race has become a contest between the Republican and Democratic candidates who are essentially tied in the polls with fewer than four weeks remaining in the race.\n\nYet Falchuk sought to make the most of his time on air, and he delivered spirited broadsides that repeatedly cast Baker and Coakley as part of the same failed two-party system. During the exchange over child welfare, he blamed both Coakley and Baker for failing to overhaul DCF.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an argument going on, and both you guys, Martha and Charlie, have been having an argument with the Super PACs taking out ads attacking each other, talking about these issues that are really serious things and being used as political fodder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be able to work together on solving these issues.\u201d\n\nHe also accused both Baker and Coakley of abetting rising health care costs \u2014 Baker by helping to deregulate the health care market in the 1990s and Coakley by recently agreeing with a request by Partners HealthCare to acquire South Shore Hospital and Hallmark Health System, instead of filing a lawsuit to stop the merger.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both two sides of the same coin on this issue,\u201d he said.\n\nAt another moment, Falchuk chided Coakley and Baker for delving into policy details that he said were lost on voters and overlooked the larger problems plaguing state government.\n\nMcCormick presented himself as a business-minded political outsider, a perspective he said could help him repair DCF and other agencies.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely not something that prosecutorial skills or financial engineering will solve,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need roll-up-your-sleeves solutions on this. We need to change the system completely.\u201d\n\nLively railed against abortion, illegal immigration, and big government. But like McCormick, he was largely ignored by his rivals.\n\nIt was Coakley, though, who was often the aggressor going after Baker.\n\nWhen the debate turned to health care costs, for example, Baker promised to bring \u201cfull transparency\u201d to the market.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me that you can learn more about a refrigerator and washing machine than you can about health care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should get serious about opening up the cloak.\u201d\n\nBut Coakley seized on the issue to target Baker\u2019s tenure as chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.\n\n\u201cIn a not-for-profit, your salary went from over $600,000 to $1.7 million,\u201d she told Baker, echoing an attack line that a Democratic super PAC is using in an anti-Baker ad. \u201cHow do you explain that to people whose premiums went up, who lost their care?\u201d\n\nBaker said his salary was consistent with pay in the market and said that, by rescuing Harvard Pilgrim from the brink of financial ruin, he had helped save thousands of jobs.\n\nLater, when the topic moved to the state\u2019s faulty health care website, he turned on Coakley, accusing her of failing to use her influence to fix the site. He said he would seek waivers from the federal health care law to give Massachusetts more flexibility to manage its own system.\n\n\u201cAnd I repeat: We are the only state in the country that had a horrible experience with rolling out the Affordable Care Act, and no one lost their job,\u201d he said.\n\nCoakley said she, too, would seek waivers to give the state some flexibility but was more upbeat about the future of the federal health care law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only state in the country that actually tried to, and has provided the model, for what has happened at the national level,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown the way in Massachusetts and, under Governor Coakley, we will continue to do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.1227837861", "eomportal-id": 460774, "description": "Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker were more combative in their second debate, quarreling pointedly on Tuesday night over the state\u2019s troubled child protection system and its spiraling health care costs.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker were more combative in their second debate, quarreling pointedly on Tuesday night over the state\u2019s troubled child protection system and its spiraling health care costs.", "title": "Gubernatorial rivals spar over child agency, health care - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/10/07/gubernatorial-rivals-spar-over-child-agency-health-care/po4xY99bsacrCuBOhJ8JnK/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/10/08/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/debate-big.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Martha Coakley,Charlie Baker,debate,governor,DCF,health care,website,budgets,super PAC, Martha Coakley", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 18:57:01 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Martha Coakley,Charlie Baker,debate,governor,DCF,health care,website,budgets,super PAC, Martha Coakley,Democratic Party, Department of Children and Families (NJ), Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "01ebc466-4ea9-11e4-b9ef-a79c88ae923e"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt bothers me that you can learn more about a refrigerator and washing machine than you can about health care,\u201d he said.\nHe said he would seek waivers from the federal health care law to give Massachusetts more flexibility to manage its own system.\nWhen the debate turned to health care costs, for example, Baker promised to bring \u201cfull transparency\u201d to the market.\n\u201cWe should get serious about opening up the cloak.\u201dBut Coakley seized on the issue to target Baker\u2019s tenure as chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.\nCoakley said she, too, would seek waivers to give the state some flexibility but was more upbeat about the future of the federal health care law."}
