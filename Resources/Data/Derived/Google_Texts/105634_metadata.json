Ted Cruz this past weekend in the Republican Leadership Conference\u2019s much-ballyhooed straw poll\u2014he upped the ante.\n\nHe claimed that Obamacare has been even more damaging to the United States than the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n\n\u201cYou said Obamacare was the worst thing that has happened to this coutry since slavery. Why do you think it was worse than 9/11?\u201d I asked him.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause 9/11 is an isolated incident,\u201d he answered.\n\nWe were sitting in the Sirius XM Radio studio in Manhattan, where Carson was going on the air with conservative host Armstrong Williams to promote his just-published political manifesto, One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America\u2019s Future, which is No. 1 on The New York Times Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller List.\n\nWilliams, who is acting as the doctor\u2019s business manager, frequently interrupted as I attempted to explore Carson\u2019s unusual assertion during breaks in the program. Our exchange went something like this:\n\nMe: \u201cWho do you think caused families more pain\u2014Obamacare or Osama bin Laden?\u201d\n\nCarson: \u201cLet me explain.\u201d\n\nWilliams: \u201cLet him answer the question!\u201d\n\n\n\nCarson: \u201cThings that are isolated issues as opposed to things that fundamentally change the United States of America and shift power from the people to the government. That is a huge shift.\u201d\n\n\n\nMe: \u201cRight. But what do you think caused specific families more pain\u2014Obamacare or Osama?\u201d\n\n\n\nCarson: \u201cYou have to take a long term.\u201d\n\n\n\nMe: \u201cYou\u2019re not answering the question.\u201d\n\n\n\nCarson: \u201cWill you listen? You have to take a long-term look at the ascent of something that fundamentally changes the power structure of America. You have to be someone who reads. Who is well-read. I want you to go back tonight. I want you to pull out what Saul Alinsky says about health care under the control of the government.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt which point Williams cut the interview short and canceled a promised post-show session at Penn Station where Carson, a retired pediatric brain surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, would be waiting for his train back to Baltimore.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

After buying a new house, he just couldn\u2019t unload the old one. \u201cMy house was on the market for five years. And I said, \u2018I pay my tithes. I am faithful. I try to help people. So why is this happening to me?\u2019 \u201d Carson told me.\n\n\u201cAnd [then] I found out about the \u20181031 Exchange\u2019 [named for a tax code provision] where if you sell a piece of property and you make a very, very large profit on it, you don\u2019t have to pay huge taxes on it if you can roll it over into another property of higher value.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s story went on in this disjointed fashion, and didn\u2019t seem particularly illuminating, except to suggest that it definitely wasn\u2019t an ordinary crisis of faith and the Almighty must be a savvy adviser on the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nNeedless to say, the doctor\u2019s eccentric claim concerning the relative evils if Obamacare and jetliners crashing into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon didn\u2019t go over well with visitors to the new 9/11 Memorial. It\u2019s a shrine to more than 3,000 people\u2014Americans and foreign nationals\u2014who were killed on Sept. 11, 2001, inciting two costly wars in which thousands more Americans died.\n\n\u201cWho is he? Some kind of crackpot?\u201d asked an Irvine, Calif., man who declined to provide his name.\n\nYet Carson is undoubtedly a powerful new force in the GOP cosmology.\n\nWilliams had invited me to meet his friend, saying they wished to respond to my first article, on Carson\u2019s glib and troublesome ideology, in The Daily Beast two weeks ago. Williams said they especially objected to the headline calling Carson \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 Great Black Hope.\u201d\n\nOddly, however, when Williams asked his guest to respond on the air, Carson answered: \u201cI pretty much don\u2019t respond\u2026 I recognize that there is a large segment of society that sees everything through the prism of race. I never have.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Carson is not about race,\u201d Williams insisted later, notwithstanding that the doctor famously told right-wing talk jock Mark Levin that white liberals are \u201cthe most racist people there are. Because they put you in a little category, a box: \u2018You have to think this way, how could you dare come off the plantation?\u2019 \u201d Williams claimed that Carson\u2019s repeated comparisons of Obamacare to the enslavement of blacks in the South is actually about freedom, not race.\n\nAfter reading Carson\u2019s book, it\u2019s difficult to escape the conclusion that some of his ideas are a noxious mix of ignorance and certitude\u2014a dead-serious version of Stephen Colbert\u2014while some others are just plain disturbing. On Page 94 of One Nation, for instance, Carson takes refuge in the right-wing loon canard that big-government liberalism\u2014a phenomenon that, as a conservative, I\u2019m no fan of myself\u2014is a slippery slope to Nazism.\n\n\u201cThroughout history many societies have failed to push back and have allowed an overly aggressive government to expand and dominate their lives,\u201d Carson writes. \u201cNazi Germany is a perfect example of such a society\u2026[Adolf Hitler\u2019s] regime may have started out innocently enough, but because the people did not oppose a progressively overreaching government, the entire world suffered a great Holocaust.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s way too much here to unpack for this space, so let me just focus on Carson\u2019s jaw-dropping claim that the Third Reich \u201cmay have started out innocently enough.\u201d Really? Has the doctor never heard of Mein Kampf?\n\nCarson is currently in the midst of a 29-city, Sarah Palin-esque bus tour that will undoubtedly stoke interest in a 2016 candidacy. His showing in the straw poll last weekend\u201429.38 percent to Cruz\u2019s 30.33 percent\u2014left \u201cserious\u201d prospective candidates such as Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush eating the doctor\u2019s dust.\n\nThe mainstream media largely ignored Carson\u2019s showing at the leadership conference in New Orleans, giving the headlines to Cruz, maybe because it was hard to fit into conventional wisdom, particularly since, unlike Cruz, Carson didn\u2019t even attend.\n\nIf the media are baffled, they\u2019re not the only ones. \u201cHow is that possible when I am not there?\u201d Carson asked this week, according to Williams. \u201cI am not doing anything to earn this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "September 11, Obamacare, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201406050945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Republican presidential hopeful thinks that Obamacare has caused Americans more pain than jetliners crashing into the World Trade Center and two costly wars.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Really, Dr. Carson?
