Flights have already been canceled, schools closure announcements are going out, roadways are being treated and others are waiting to pull the plug.\n\nPLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES\n\nThe city\u2019s Emergency Operations Center will be open at 4 p.m. Sunday to monitor the weather. A crew of 100 city workers, along with 35 trucks, will begin preparing to keep Dallas streets clear two hours later at 6 p.m. The personnel will begin 12-hour shifts at midnight.\n\nCity spokeswoman Sana Syed said the city is readying to continue to deal with ice through Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are completely prepared to deal with this storm through Wednesday,\u201d Syed said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have planned for.\u201d\n\nThe North Texas Tollway Authority also called in extra crews and equipment for its roads, which include the Dallas North Tollway, Sam Rayburn Tollway and President George H.W. Bush Turnpike. The agency used a heavy application of brine to increase its chances of staying on roadways. But NTTA also had crews put down granular material in case Sunday\u2019s rains washed brine away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not relying on the brine alone,\u201d said Susan Slupecki, an NTTA spokeswoman.\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation pre-treated the region\u2019s highways with a saltwater mixture.\n\nSpokesman Tony Hartzel said the department will have spotters out to look for icy conditions so workers can quickly treat them. The department also has heavy equipment to scrape ice off the road.\n\nThe department doesn\u2019t track traffic accidents, but Dallas police and firefighters responded to hundreds of accidents during the December, February and March storms last year.\n\nWhile responding to one of the accidents late Feb. 10, Dallas firefighter William Scott Tanksley, 40, was hit by a car that careened out of control on the ice and knocked him off an overpass onto Interstate 20.\n\nThree others were also killed in accidents in North Texas last year during the February storm.\n\nDallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Lt. Joel Lavender said the department is making no special plans for the storm and will respond as usual.\n\nHartzel said people should do their best to stay safe.\n\n\u201cMy main advice for people is, if you don\u2019t have to go anywhere tomorrow, don\u2019t,\u201d Hartzel said. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be challenging conditions, the best thing is to stay off the roads.\u201d\n\nDallas Area Rapid Transit, meanwhile, is planning to provide an alternative to driving. The department has a proactive plan in place. The transit agency has announced they are planning to pare back light rail. Outlying stations, such as downtown Carrollton, the D/FW Airport, downtown Garland, Buckner and Hampton stations will not see trains. Shuttle bus service will serve those stations.\n\nBuses will run on a Saturday schedule.\n\nIf conditions worsen, DART could shut down the rail service totally.\n\nDuring ice storms past, DART was reactive and shut down train service when overhead electrical cables that power the trains froze. The agency had received some criticism in the past for not being proactive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made the commitment that we\u2019re definitely going to go with the new plan to make sure we don\u2019t end up getting some trains \u2013 or ultimately some passengers \u2013 stranded,\u201d said Mark Ball, a DART spokesman.\n\nTAPS Public Transit, which provides limited bus routes and paratransit rides in Collin County and several other counties, cancelled all routes and rides Monday.\n\nThe status of the airports, meanwhile, is still somewhat up in the air.\n\nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport spokesman David Maga\u00f1a said airlines cancelled roughly half of Monday\u2019s flights.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant impact for flights coming in and out of the airport,\u201d he said.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group has cancelled 961 Monday flights many of which were tied to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the carrier said Sunday evening.\n\nAirlines also cancelled more than 150 flights scheduled for Sunday. About 115 of those were evening arrivals and the rest were departures, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best way for customers to not be stranded without a flight and for airlines to manage expectations and flow rates at the airport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to know well in advance.\u201d\n\nMaga\u00f1a said he urges people to check in with airlines and keep on top of flight information.\n\nAirlines and the airport are also preparing to de-ice runways and planes.\n\nSyed, the city spokeswoman, said Dallas Love Field has its snow-and-ice removal team on standby. And she said the airlines are preparing to de-ice the planes.\n\nAirport spokesman Jose Torres said anyone with scheduled flights out of Love Field should contact their airline for flight status.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to maintain runways and taxiways open for incoming and outgoing flights,\u201d he said.\n\nSouthwest Airlines has already canceled some Sunday night and Monday morning flights, spokesman Thais Conway said.\n\nSCHEDULE CHANGES\n\nBut Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Sunday afternoon that all county government offices and courts would be closed Monday due to the forecast weather conditions.\n\nThe City of Dallas announced Sunday evening that that municipal courts would be closed Monday.\n\nThe weather could hit the pause button on the ongoing Erath County trial of Eddie Ray Routh, who is charged with killing famed Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield in February 2013.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Stephenville police said court had been delayed until 10 a.m. The trial was expected to wrap up early this week.\n\nThe Dallas Zoo will be closed Monday. The AT&T Performing Arts Center\u2019s elaborate presentation to announce its Broadway season Monday night at Winspear Opera House could be canceled, too.\n\nThe Garland Chamber of Commerce has postponed Monday\u2019s meeting featuring Mayor Douglas Athas\u2019 \u201cState of the City\u201d address.\n\nIn Richardson, the city\u2019s animal shelter, tennis center, gymnastics center and recreation centers will open at 10 a.m. The city also announced that it is sanding its roads.\n\nThe winter storms of yore claimed the annual Dallas Children\u2019s Health Holiday Parade and the Dallas Metro PCS marathon as victims.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nDallas ISD and Denton ISD announced Sunday that all schools and after-school activities are canceled Monday.\n\n\u201cWhen looking at weather conditions, the safety of our students and staff is always our top priority,\u201d said Dallas ISD Police Chief Craig Miller.\n\nSouthern Methodist University, University of Texas at Dallas, The University of North Texas, Texas Christian University, Arlington, Allen, Carrollton-Farmers Branch, Coppell, Dallas, Denton, Duncanville, Frisco, Fort Worth, Grapevine-Colleyville, Grand Prairie, Highland Park, Hurst-Euless-Bedford, Irving, Keller, Kennedale, Lancaster, Lewisville, McKinney, Midlothian and Plano ISDs have canceled school Monday. Terrell ISD classes will be delayed two hours.\n\nMost other school districts will assess whether delays or cancellations are necessary early in the morning. Most will notify radio and TV stations of closures by 6 a.m. Monday.\n\nThe Coppell vs. Duncanville, Conrad vs. North Forney, Kennedale vs. Lake Worth and North Crowley vs. Abilene boys basketball and the Arlington Seguin vs. Mansfield Timberview girls basketball playoff games hat were scheduled for Monday have been moved to Tuesday because of the inclement weather that is expected.\n\nSeveral other Dallas-area teams were waiting to see if they would have school Monday before making a decision.\n\nThe weather led to numerous closures and delayed starts last year. Afterward, DeSoto ISD tacked on an additional 30 minutes to school days for about a month rather than adding make-up days to the end of the year.\n\nHITTING HOME\n\nOncor Electric Delivery customers were hit hard last year. The December storms left about 800,000 customers without power at some point.\n\nOncor spokesman Chris Spears said they have crews on standby in areas\n\nthat have potential for icing in order to make any necessary outage\n\nrepairs.\n\nHe said they have also called in off system contractors from other\n\nparts of the state and surrounding states to serve as additional\n\npersonnel.\n\nAnyone experiencing a power outage can call the outage hotline at\n\n888-313-4747 or text OUT to 66267.\n\nThe December 2013 saw ice build up on power lines, tree limbs and houses. Water pipes also freeze and burst. The result was $30 million to $35 million in insured residential damage in the area, according to the Insurance Council of Texas.\n\nThe council\u2019s spokesman Mark Hanna said Sunday that residential damage is mostly caused when the conditions remain icy for 72 hours or more. But he said the damage isn\u2019t as bad as other weather events, such as tornadoes.\n\n\u201cComparatively speaking, it\u2019s not on the magnitude of severe thunderstorms and hurricanes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they do mount up.\u201d\n\nStaff writers Brandon Formby, Tasha Tsiaperas, Julie Fancher, James Osborne, Michael E.
