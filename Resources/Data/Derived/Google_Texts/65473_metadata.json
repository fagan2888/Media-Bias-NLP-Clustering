But the analysis didn't include data on the number of people who have coverage through their jobs this year, even though research indicates that the majority of Connecticut residents have employer-sponsored insurance.\n\nInstead, the number of uninsured was projected based on estimates of how many exchange customers were previously uninsured or had dropped coverage, without accounting for changes in employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nThe estimate also assumed that people with coverage stayed enrolled for the full year, although experts say it\u2019s not uncommon for people to move between coverage types, or on and off coverage, throughout the year. In the past 12 months, for example, enrollment in Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid program has fluctuated from 758,001 last October to 704,316 in August 2015. Enrollment in plans purchased through the exchange, Access Health CT, dropped from 110,095 in March to 95,601 this month.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by the Farmington research firm Acturus \u2013 formerly known as the Pert Group \u2013 was based on a 2014 estimate the firm developed, suggesting that the state\u2019s uninsured rate was 4 percent. That was derived by subtracting the number of exchange customers who were previously uninsured from the state\u2019s earlier uninsured rate, without accounting for changes in employer-sponsored insurance or other parts of the market.\n\nFor this year\u2019s analysis, Acturus projected the uninsured rate by using its 2014 estimate as a baseline. The firm estimated that some additional people had become uninsured since then, and subtracted the number of new exchange customers \u2013 people who bought private insurance or signed up for Medicaid \u2013 who were previously uninsured. The firm also accounted for people who, according to a survey of Access Health\u2019s current and former members, had dropped coverage and were now uninsured.\n\nThis year\u2019s analysis also included an overall picture of the state\u2019s insurance market, based on enrollment data from Access Health, individual-market enrollment figures reported by insurers to the Connecticut Insurance Department, statistics from the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s analysis of 2013 Census data and information from Acturus\u2019 survey of Access Health customers. The analysis estimated the number of people covered by employer-sponsored insurance by subtracting other types of coverage and its estimate of uninsured residents from the total population.\n\nCensus figures, by contrast, are based on surveys that ask people whether they have insurance.\n\nAccess Health Chief Executive Jim Wadleigh said that if the most recent Census estimate \u2013 which reported that about 245,000 people in Connecticut were uninsured in 2014 \u2013 is accurate, \u201cThen what that would tell us is we\u2019re actually doing a pretty poor job of reaching the uninsured and everything that we\u2019re doing from a marketing perspective is wrong.\u201d\n\nWadleigh said the exchange has found that it is difficult to find uninsured people to sign up, which he said would not be the case if the uninsured rate were still close to 7 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s important to have an accurate sense of the state\u2019s uninsured rate, Wadleigh said, for the exchange to ensure that its marketing campaigns and other efforts are working.\n\nAnother survey, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, reported earlier this year that Connecticut\u2019s uninsured rate dropped to 5 percent during the first six months of 2015.\n\nOpen enrollment for coverage for 2016 begins Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31. Access Health officials said they\u2019re aiming for 105,000 to 115,000 people to purchase private health plans through the exchange, including both existing and new customers.\n\nThose who don\u2019t have insurance in 2016 \u2013 and who don\u2019t qualify for an exemption to the law requiring most Americans to have coverage \u2013 will have to pay a fine of either 2.5 percent of their annual household income or $695 per person, whichever is higher.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/10/15/access-health-ct-says-uninsured-rate-lower-than-census-figures/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Census, insurance, uninsured", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/10/15/access-health-ct-says-uninsured-rate-lower-than-census-figures/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange released an analysis Thursday suggesting that the state\u2019s uninsured rate this year is 3.8 percent, but that figure comes with some caveats.", "title": "Access Health CT says uninsured rate lower than Census figures", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/10/15/access-health-ct-says-uninsured-rate-lower-than-census-figures/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/03/Pedro-Lopez-2-1170x877.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/10/15/access-health-ct-says-uninsured-rate-lower-than-census-figures/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd595\"", "article_summary": "Arielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.orgConnecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange released an analysis Thursday suggesting that the state\u2019s uninsured rate this year is 3.8 percent, significantly lower than the 6.9 percent the U.S. Census Bureau recently reported for last year.\nFor this year\u2019s analysis, Acturus projected the uninsured rate by using its 2014 estimate as a baseline.\nEnrollment in plans purchased through the exchange, Access Health CT, dropped from 110,095 in March to 95,601 this month.\nIt\u2019s important to have an accurate sense of the state\u2019s uninsured rate, Wadleigh said, for the exchange to ensure that its marketing campaigns and other efforts are working.\nWhile state and exchange officials praised the results and said they showed Connecticut has one of the lowest uninsured rates in the country, the estimated uninsured rate comes with some caveats."}
