While employers can seek exemptions to the law, the court argued that doing so poses a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on that organization\u2019s religious rights. [\u2026]\n\nThe ruling includes 30 references to Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the 2014 Supreme Court case that allowed certain for-profit companies to opt out of the mandate. Since that decision, multiple nonprofits, including universities, have taken legal action demanding to be granted the same permissions.\n\nUnder ObamaCare, employer healthcare plans are required to cover all federally approved forms of birth control. That includes, as the court notes, emergency contraception that some religious organizations believe is \u201cfunctionally equivalent to abortion on demand.\u201d\n\nGroups can receive an exemption by writing a letter to the Health and Human Services Department or filling out a two-page form to document their objections. Houses of worships are automatically exempt from the law.\n\nA White House spokeswoman on Thursday said the administration is \"disappointed\" in the decision, but believes the mandate will ultimately be upheld.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Next stop, Supreme Court?.05/26/2016 10:10:14AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Next stop, Supreme Court?", "title": "- Federal Court Rules Against Obamacare's Birth Control Mandate", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/18/federal-court-rules-against-obamacares-birth-control-mandate-n2053809", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/84/3ed8b3c5-b7b9-485e-a220-e1dc6cb6340e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Next stop, Supreme Court?", "title": "- Federal Court Rules Against Obamacare's Birth Control Mandate", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/18/federal-court-rules-against-obamacares-birth-control-mandate-n2053809", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/84/3ed8b3c5-b7b9-485e-a220-e1dc6cb6340e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Federal Court Rules Against Obamacare's Birth Control Mandate , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1dce\"", "article_summary": "Now more than ever it looks likely that the Supreme Court will take up Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate after a federal appeals court on Thursday ruled against it, directly contradicting an earlier federal court ruling on the issue.\nWhile employers can seek exemptions to the law, the court argued that doing so poses a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on that organization\u2019s religious rights.\n[\u2026]The ruling includes 30 references to Burwell v.
