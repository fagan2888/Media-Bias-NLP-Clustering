Sutter describes himself as the life of the party, but in reality, he\u2019s becoming a cautionary tale both at school and at home. When he wakes up lost on the lawn of Aimee, a classmate he barely knows is alive, he tries to take her under his wing. It\u2019s Sutter who needs rescuing; will he let Aimee in, and can he redeem himself?\n\nThe Spectacular Now offers an honest coming-of-age experience at the movies, perhaps the first since Liberal Arts, which dealt with growing up at several different stages of life. This film has some echoes of Say Anything, but without the precious quality of the 1989 film, and without the focus on cliques that other teen coming-of-age films usually provides \u2014 like The Perks of Being a Wallflower, for instance, which had a similar tone as this film does. Sutter isn\u2019t exactly Lloyd Dobler, who wanted to really live life. Sutter thinks of himself that way, but it\u2019s a conceit; he\u2019s really just numbing himself to life in order to escape his own feelings of worthlessness, which nearly bring him to disaster on multiple occasions.\n\nThere are no easy answers for Sutter or Aimee, both of whom make mistakes and struggle to come to terms with their relationship, made worse by Sutter\u2019s inability to face himself. (The Spectacular Now uses a clever framing device for this critical flaw, which is a college entrance submission in which Sutter has to describe his challenges in life. It changes at several points in the film.) The course of the relationship isn\u2019t predictable, and neither are Sutter\u2019s relationships with his mother and sister. The biggest relationship issue Sutter has is with himself, which comes to a point of realization when faced with the potential loss of a job in a men\u2019s clothing store \u2014 a very poignant scene, and heartbreaking for the insight Sutter gets when forced to face himself honestly.\n\nThe performances are mostly amazing, especially Miles Teller (21 & Over, Rabbit Hole) as Sutter and Shailene Woodley (The Descendants, \u201cThe Secret Life of the American Teenager\u201d) as Aimee, on whom the film mainly rests. Jennifer Jason Leigh chips in with a great performance in a critical scene in the end as Sutter\u2019s mom, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead does well as Sutter\u2019s sister Holly. Brie Larson convincingly plays Cassidy, the ex-girlfriend who turns out to be just a little too smart to stick with Sutter while he\u2019s spinning circles but can\u2019t snap him out of it, either. Kyle Chandler has a small part as Sutter\u2019s ne\u2019er-do-well dad in a sequence that fills in a lot of gaps for Sutter, and not in a pleasant way.\n\nEven with all of the drama and heartbreaks within The Spectacular Now, it is an uplifting film in the end \u2014 a film about redemption, a film about growing up, and a film about love \u2026 real love. It won\u2019t make most year-end Top Ten films lists, but it\u2019s very much a worthwhile experience. On the 5-point Hot Air scale, The Spectacular Now gets a 5 \u2014 if you can find it in the theaters:\n\n5 \u2013 Full price ticket\n\n4 \u2013 Matinee only\n\n3 \u2013 Wait for Blu-Ray/DVD/PPV rental or purchase\n\n2 \u2013 Watch it when it hits Netflix/cable\n\n1 \u2013 Avoid at all costs\n\nThe Spectacular Now is in limited release. I had to look around for it after getting a strong recommendation this week from my great friend Hugh Hewitt, and it was definitely worth the effort to seek it out. It\u2019s a nice surprise in this summer of mediocrity.\n\nHowever, The Spectacular Now is rated R for a reason. It has some bad language, but also contains strong sexual content and nearly-constant alcohol use. All of these are presented with blunt honesty and very little sensationalism, so if you take teenagers to see this film, be prepared for an honest discussion of all of them. The film will go over the heads of younger viewers and is not appropriate for them at all.\n\nUpdate: John Hanlon was similarly impressed.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Surprises.", "title": "Film review: The Spectacular Now", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/09/01/film-review-the-spectacular-now/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wceaLzbtuDY/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/wceaLzbtuDY/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-01T13:31:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-01T13:37:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "film, movies, reviews,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2709\"", "article_summary": "On the 5-point Hot Air scale, The Spectacular Now gets a 5 \u2014 if you can find it in the theaters:5 \u2013 Full price ticket4 \u2013 Matinee only3 \u2013 Wait for Blu-Ray/DVD/PPV rental or purchase2 \u2013 Watch it when it hits Netflix/cable1 \u2013 Avoid at all costsThe Spectacular Now is in limited release.\nThe Spectacular Now offers an honest coming-of-age experience at the movies, perhaps the first since Liberal Arts, which dealt with growing up at several different stages of life.\n(The Spectacular Now uses a clever framing device for this critical flaw, which is a college entrance submission in which Sutter has to describe his challenges in life.\nSutter describes himself as the life of the party, but in reality, he\u2019s becoming a cautionary tale both at school and at home.\nHowever, The Spectacular Now is rated R for a reason."}
