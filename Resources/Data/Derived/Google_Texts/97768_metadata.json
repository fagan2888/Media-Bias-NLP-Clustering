Outside Dublin Castle, watching the results announcement in its cobblestoned courtyard, thousands of gay rights activists cheered, hugged and cried at the news.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s vote, we have disclosed who we are: a generous, compassionate, bold and joyful people,\u201d Prime Minister Enda Kenny proclaimed as he welcomed the outcome. Beside him, Deputy Prime Minister Joan Burton declared the victory \u201ca magical moving moment, when the world\u2019s beating heart is in Ireland.\u201d\n\nIreland is the first country to approve gay marriage in a popular national vote. Nineteen other countries, including most U.S. states, have legalized the practice through their legislatures and courts.\n\nThe unexpectedly strong percentage of approval surprised both sides. More than 1.2 million Irish voters backed the \u201cyes\u201d side to less than 750,000 voting \u201cno.\u201d Only one of Ireland\u2019s 43 constituencies recorded a narrow \u201cno\u201d majority, Roscommon-South Leitrim in the boggy midlands.\n\nAnalysts credited the \u201cyes\u201d side with adeptly employing social media to mobilize young, first-time voters, tens of thousands of whom voted for the first time Friday. The \u201cyes\u201d campaign also featured moving personal stories from prominent Irish people \u2014 either coming out as gays or describing their hopes for gay children \u2014 that helped convince wavering voters to back equal marriage rights.\n\nBoth Catholic Church leaders and gay rights advocates said the result signaled a social revolution in Ireland, where only a few decades ago the authority of Catholic teaching was reinforced by voters who massively backed bans on abortion and divorce in the 1980s.\n\nVoters legalized divorce by a razor-thin margin in 1995 and now, by a firm majority, have dismissed the Catholic Church\u2019s repeated calls to reject gay marriage. Abortion, still outlawed, looms as the country\u2019s next great social policy fight.\n\nDublin Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said the \u201coverwhelming vote\u201d against church teaching on gay marriage meant that Catholic leaders in Ireland needed urgently to find a new message and voice for reaching Ireland\u2019s young.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a social revolution. \u2026 The church needs to do a reality check right across the board,\u201d said Martin, who suggested that some church figures who argued for gay marriage\u2019s rejection came across as harsh, damning and unloving, the opposite of their intention.\n\n\u201cHave we drifted completely away from young people?\u201d he asked. \u201cMost of those people who voted \u2018yes\u2019 are products of our Catholic schools for 12 years.\u201d\n\nDavid Quinn, leader of the Catholic think tank Iona Institute, said he was troubled by the fact that no political party and only a half-dozen politicians backed the \u201cno\u201d cause.\n\n\u201cThe fact that no political party supported them must be a concern from a democratic point of view,\u201d he said.\n\nFianna Fail leader Michael Martin, a Cork politician whose opposition party is traditionally closest to the Catholic Church, said he couldn\u2019t in good conscience back the anti-gay marriage side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply wrong in the 21st century to oppress people because of their sexuality,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the result was announced, thousands of celebrants flooded into the Irish capital\u2019s pubs and clubs \u2014 none more popular Saturday night than the city\u2019s few gay venues.\n\nAt the George, Ireland\u2019s oldest gay pub, drag queens danced and lip-synced to Queen and the founding father of Ireland\u2019s gay rights campaign, Sen. David Norris, basked in the greatest accomplishment of the movement\u2019s 40-year history.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Bold\u2019 Ireland votes to legalize gay marriage in landslide", "author": "Shawn Pogatchnik", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018Bold\u2019 Ireland votes to legalize gay marriage in landslide", "title": "\u2018Bold\u2019 Ireland votes to legalize gay marriage in landslide", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/24/bold_ireland_votes_to_legalize_gay_marriage_in_landslide/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/ireland-gay-marriage.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Bold\u2019 Ireland votes to legalize gay marriage in landslide", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/ireland-gay-marriage.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "title": "\u2018Bold\u2019 Ireland votes to legalize gay marriage in landslide", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u2018Bold\u2019 Ireland votes to legalize gay marriage in landslide", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Outside Dublin Castle, watching the results announcement in its cobblestoned courtyard, thousands of gay rights activists cheered, hugged and cried at the news.\nAt the George, Ireland\u2019s oldest gay pub, drag queens danced and lip-synced to Queen and the founding father of Ireland\u2019s gay rights campaign, Sen.
