(Photo: Karen Bleier/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House said Friday that metro Detroit will be among 20 U.S. communities competing to see which can reduce the percentage of uninsured people the most during the current open enrollment period for coverage under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\nAccording to the release from the White House, \u201cThe victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success.\u201d The open enrollment period began Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has helped to extend coverage to about 17.6 million people but more than 10 million who are eligible under the federally mandated insurance marketplaces across the nation have not gotten insurance, the White House said. The challenge is intended to bring that number down even further.\n\nIn the Detroit designated market area, which includes areas outside the city proper, there are about 95,000 people who are eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act who have not signed up for insurance. As of June 30 this year, about 289,000 had signed up for coverage in Michigan with most, 78%, receiving some level of tax credit to help cover the cost.\n\nOther cities taking part in the White House\u2019s Healthy Communities Challenge are Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Great Falls, Mont.; Kansas City, Mo.; Las Vegas; Long Beach, Calif.; Milwaukee; Nashville, Tenn.; New Orleans; Oakland, Calif.; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Richmond, Va.; Salt Lake City; Seattle and Tampa.\n\nContact Todd Spangler at 703-854-8947 or at tspangler@freepress.com.
