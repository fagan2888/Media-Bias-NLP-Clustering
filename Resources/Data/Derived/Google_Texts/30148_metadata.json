At least part of the reason is that Intel is subsidizing the cost of building Bay Trail tablets until the economies of scale bring the actual price of components down.\n\nThat means device makers that want to build a tablet, notebook, or other device can get a bargain on the cost of Intel\u2019s low power chips, as well as help paying for other components that work with those chips.\n\nIntel\u2019s hoping the move will increase its market share and help fend off the growing competition from Qualcomm, Samsung, NVIDIA, and other ARM-based chip makers.\n\nThe move means that Intel isn\u2019t actually making much money from the sale of low-cost tablets like the Dell Venue 8 Pro or Acer Iconia W4. In fact, the chip maker is probably losing money. But Intel is hoping that paying now to help bring the costs down will be an investment that pays off in the long run.\n\nBy the end of 2014, Intel hopes that about 40 million Windows and Android tablets will be powered by Intel Atom processors.\n\nHopefully by the time Intel stops subsidizing Bay Trail tablets, the costs of producing them will be lower and retail prices won\u2019t rise. On the other hand, there\u2019s always a chance that once consumers expect devices to offer Bay Trail or better performance, they\u2019ll be willing to pay a premium for devices that offer long battery life, decent performance, and the ability to run full desktop-style Windows apps (something you can\u2019t do at this point on a device with an ARM-based processor\u2026 unless Microsoft makes some serious changes to the way Windows RT works).\n\nvia PC World and CNET", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Liliputing", "description": "Wonder why you can get a Windows 8 tablet with an Intel Atom processor for less than the price of a Windows RT model with an ARM chip?
