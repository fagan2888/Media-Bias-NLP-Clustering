That\u2019s because Republicans made a lot of promises to them in the last election. Those commitments were instrumental to their victory; they were actions Americans were demanding and Republicans were vowing to deliver.\n\nAs we approach the first 100 days of the new Congress, let\u2019s examine how well Republicans have done in keeping their promises.\n\nVirtually every Republican running in 2014 promised to do everything he could to repeal Obamacare, beginning with its defunding, which a GOP majority in Congress could deliver. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had pledged repeatedly that he, too, would defund and repeal it. After the election, a majority of Americans expected an end to this monstrosity.\n\nHowever, when Republicans had their chance through defunding efforts, leadership buckled \u2014 if it had any intention in the first place to do anything, which is doubtful. Those election promises meant nothing when it came time to deliver. Mr. McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner have been absolutely useless in keeping the No. 1 promise the GOP made to voters in November.\n\nA year ago, I predicted that even if the Republicans took back the Senate they would not fight Obamacare. As I remarked then, Republicans are always \u201clike Wimpy with the hamburgers. I\u2019ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.\u201d It\u2019s even worse. They are hoping the courts, through King v. Burwell, will do their job for them.\n\nSo today, Obamacare is still the law of the land, and the GOP Congress is providing 100 percent funding for it.\n\nAs with Obamacare, Republicans running in 2014 promised voters that they would put a stop to Mr. Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive order granting amnesty to millions who entered the country illegally. Oh, the thundering speeches they delivered to their constituents. A vast majority of the voters who gave Republicans the Congress were, and still are against Mr. Obama\u2019s illegal actions, including almost half of Latino voters. Republicans ran more than 10,000 television ads against amnesty from Oct. 1 through Election Day.\n\nAnd what has the new Republican majority done?\n\nNothing. When a federal judge blocked Mr. Obama\u2019s executive order in February, the House voted against the president\u2019s amnesty order. Senate Republicans took up the fight to defund the part of the Department of Homeland Security bill that funneled taxpayer dollars to fund Mr. Obama\u2019s illegal actions. Republicans went back and forth over this budget process with the Democrats, who would not budge.\n\nSo the Republicans budged. Like they always do. Except this time they were in the majority, which was supposed to mean something.\n\nMr. McConnell eventually gave Mr. Obama and the Democrats exactly what they wanted \u2014 a clean funding bill that included paying for illegal executive amnesty. Of course, Mr. Boehner also strongly urged Mr. McConnell to take this course.\n\nRepublicans ran against amnesty and voters awarded them the Congress \u2014 and today, Mr. Obama\u2019s illegal amnesty orders still stand. So does the big government \u201ccromnibus\u201d that resulted in the Republican leadership\u2019s sellout on this issue.\n\nPresident Obama couldn\u2019t have been happier.\n\nConservative voters delivered Congress to Republicans in the last election because so many GOP politicians promised to pass a ban on abortions past the 20-week mark. It is at this point in the baby\u2019s development that science has proven definitely he or she feels the horrific pain of having his or her little body torn apart, or burned to death. The House had already passed this once in 2013.\n\nWith a Republican Senate, the GOP would finally be able to push this legislation through Congress. Mr. McConnell had even been outspoken in his support of such legislation.\n\nAnd so what did Republicans do?\n\nOn the same week as the March for Life in Washington, a number of Republicans withdrew support, preposterously claiming they feared it would alienate too many Americans, and especially women. But a majority of Americans supported the 20-week abortion ban, including women.\n\nThis ban was a no-brainer, the easiest pro-life bill imaginable. And the GOP failed miserably. Apparently, it\u2019s just what they do.\n\nIf Republicans can\u2019t get behind a bill as broadly popular as the 20-week abortion ban, what substantive pro-life legislation will they ever support? If Republicans can\u2019t get behind this piece of legislation \u2014 is the GOP even a pro-life party anymore?\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the topper. In addition to breaking their promises to repeal Obamacare, turn back amnesty and protect unborn children, the Republican establishment is actually running television ads attacking conservatives in Congress who want to honor their promises to their constituents. Mr. Boehner has fought constantly with the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservatives who actually believe in keeping their promises. Even with Republicans taking back Congress, most of the time it still seems like Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid are running the show because virtually nothing\u2019s changed.\n\nIn so many ways, the new GOP Congress is worse than disappointing. It\u2019s being run by frauds.\n\nRepublicans promised conservatives the moon in 2014 and have given us the shaft throughout 2015. No amount of Beltway spin or backpedaling can obscure this fact.\n\nA Republican Congress, or even White House, that does not govern conservatively will not remain in power for long. Worse still, many will wonder if it\u2019s even worth electing a Republican to the presidency if it means nothing to do so.\n\n\u2022 L.
