And you've seen the advertisements for products that say your infant can get a head start on that all-important skill of reading.\n\nBut can babies really learn to read?\n\nNot really, according to researchers who took 117 babies and had half the group use flashcards, DVDs and books while half did not. In 13 of 14 assessments, which included the ability to recognize letter names, letter sounds and vocabulary, the researchers found no difference between the groups.\n\nThe one category in which there was a difference: The parents of children exposed to the reading product were convinced their children were, in fact, learning new words and reading.\n\n\"The results really surprised us,\" says Susan Neuman of New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, who led the research, which involved babies 9 to 18 months old. \"We thought that at least some rudimentary skills would show up, but none did.\"\n\nYet several parents say they have seen an effect, and the creator of the product used in the study, \"Your Baby Can Read,\" says the babies exposed to it probably were reading but that the researchers missed it.\n\n\"Parents know their own children and would come up with more logical tests than the ones the researchers did,\" says Robert Titzer, founder of Infant Learning Co., which created \"Your Baby Can Read.\"\n\nIntended for infants as young as 3 months, \"Your Baby Can Read\" is one of several products that claim to teach babies to read. There's also the BrillKids learning system for babies and toddlers in English, French, Spanish, Mandarin and Thai.\n\nIntellectual Baby's Web site says its $139.95 baby reading kit (which includes 10 DVDs, two books and five sets of flashcards) can \"give your child a head start in life\" by taking advantage of the period when a young brain can \"effortlessly learn and absorb mass amounts of information.\"\n\nNeuman's study examined only \"Your Baby Can Read.\" In home and laboratory visits, the researchers used eye-tracking technology and other approaches to assess whether the babies were able to recognize letter names, letter sounds, vocabulary, words identified on sight and reading comprehension.\n\nNeuman doesn't believe young babies can read.\n\n\"To put it bluntly, parents are wasting their time when they think these materials are actually helping,\" she says.\n\nNeuman says some of the children in her study were mimicking the DVDs by raising their hands when they were supposed to and then getting positive reactions from their parents.\n\n\"The pleasure was sitting next to their mom and performing for their mom,\" Neuman says. \"It's not staring at a screen with words they don't understand.\"\n\nWiley Blevins, an author and educational consultant who has written about 15 books on methods for teaching early reading, says the earliest he has ever seen a child learn to read is 4 years old. He defines reading as analyzing words letter by letter and sound by sound and putting them together into a word.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/05/hfyouth20.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf71b\"", "article_summary": "Intended for infants as young as 3 months, \"Your Baby Can Read\" is one of several products that claim to teach babies to read.\nNeuman doesn't believe young babies can read.\nBut can babies really learn to read?\nNot really, according to researchers who took 117 babies and had half the group use flashcards, DVDs and books while half did not.\nHe defines reading as analyzing words letter by letter and sound by sound and putting them together into a word."}
