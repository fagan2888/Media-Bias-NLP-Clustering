Her thoughts on just about any topic are well worth hearing.\n\nBut truth be told, there\u2019s not much reason for \u201cHow to Build a Girl\u201d to exist. Its similarity to \u201cHow to Be a Woman\u201d extends a good way beyond its title. \u201cWoman\u201d is a work of autobiographical nonfiction, not exactly a memoir or life story, but a series of pieces considering various issues of young womanhood: body image, the tyranny of contemporary grooming standards, workplace sexism, pornography, the wedding industrial complex, abortion, motherhood, etc. Moran considers herself a humorist, and she approaches all of these concerns with a brisk, upbeat, profane and often very funny voice. \u201cHow to Be a Woman\u201d is less a self-help book than a series of rallying cries designed to help Moran\u2019s readers prevent themselves from being driven nuts by the countless paradoxes and dilemmas that arise from living in a female body during the 21st century.\n\nMoran is very, very good at this. For example, instead of meandering through such slippery, abstract concepts as \u201cobjectification,\u201d her critique of both porn and strip clubs has more to do with what she (accurately) perceives as the near-absence of female desire and pleasure in both. In her opinion, what\u2019s bad about a generation of children learning about sex from Internet porn is how seldom they will encounter \u201csomething that shows sex as something that two people do together, rather than a thing that just happens to a woman when she has to make rent. Something in which \u2014 to put it simply \u2014 everyone comes.\u201d Because Moran writes so frankly about her own teenage masturbatory adventures, in which she scavenged turn-ons from such unlikely sources as \u201cAn American Werewolf in London\u201d (or, really, any Jenny Agutter vehicle), she\u2019s able to present a counterimage of positive sexuality that has some life to it.\n\nBut \u201cHow to Build a Girl\u201d is not an essay or memoir but a novel, a work of fiction, albeit one that hews pretty closely to what Moran has revealed about her own life. Like Moran, Johanna Morrigan, the narrator of \u201cGirl,\u201d has grown up in a housing project in the decrepit West Midlands industrial town of Wolverhampton. She comes from a big family (four siblings to Moran\u2019s seven), with a musician father on disability, an unsteady supply of food on the table and no full-length mirrors (because the whole family would rather not know). Moran has a surly-but-loyal younger sister who adores George Orwell; Johanna has a surly-but-loyal older brother who adores George Orwell. Both girls sleep in the beds their grandmothers died on. Both suffered through a fat and fairly clueless pubescence, seething with big but inchoate lusts and aspirations. Both leave school young and launch precocious careers as rock critics for one of England\u2019s fierce, haughty pop-music papers.\n\nAlthough \u201cHow to Build a Girl\u201d comes with a disclaimer announcing that Johanna\u2019s \u201cfamily, colleagues, the people she meets and her experiences are not my family, the people I met or my experiences,\u201d this is pretty hard to credit. No doubt much of \u201cGirl\u201d is invented, but given the dozens of obvious parallels between Moran\u2019s life and Johanna\u2019s, it\u2019s impossible to tell which and this encourages the impression that the book is extensively autobiographical. This may not bother some of its readers, however. It\u2019s a strange feature of contemporary literature that readers expect memoirs to be scrupulously factual while at the same time seem to want novels to be only barely fictional. (Just listen to most interviews with fiction writers and see how often the questions tack toward a version of \u201cDid this really happen to you?\u201d)\n\nWe\u2019ve also got an unsung tradition of celebrity-written pseudo-novels. People like Nicole Richie (who published \u201cThe Truth About Diamonds,\u201d about \u201ca rock royalty princess and a card-carrying member of Hollywood\u2019s inner circle\u201d), Lauren Conrad (\u201cSweet Little Lies,\u201d about \u201cthe average girl next door\u201d who gets her own reality show) and Snookie (\u201cThe Shore Thing,\u201d about Jersey party girl who \u201cbecomes a local celebrity overnight\u201d) produce \u201cnovels\u201d whose main attraction is not their deft storytelling but the dish they supposedly deliver on the lives of the inexplicably famous. Labeling these books as fiction provides the authors with plausible deniability, and presumably the people who buy them believe they\u2019re getting the sort of quality dirt that no one would dare publish as nonfiction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why would the funny, lusty feminist writer turn to fiction when she's so much better at telling us the truth?", "title": "Caitlin Moran and the pitfalls of the essayist-turned-novelist", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Why would the funny, lusty feminist writer turn to fiction when she's so much better at telling us the truth?", "title": "Caitlin Moran and the pitfalls of the essayist-turned-novelist", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/21/caitlin_moran_and_the_pitfalls_of_the_essayist_turned_novelist/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/caitlan_moran.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why would the funny, lusty feminist writer turn to fiction when she's so much better at telling us the truth?", "title": "Caitlin Moran and the pitfalls of the essayist-turned-novelist", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/caitlan_moran.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Caitlin Moran, Editor's Picks, Feminism, Fiction, Sex, Women writers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae23\"", "article_summary": "Moran has a surly-but-loyal younger sister who adores George Orwell; Johanna has a surly-but-loyal older brother who adores George Orwell.\nMoran considers herself a humorist, and she approaches all of these concerns with a brisk, upbeat, profane and often very funny voice.\nBut truth be told, there\u2019s not much reason for \u201cHow to Build a Girl\u201d to exist.\nLike Moran, Johanna Morrigan, the narrator of \u201cGirl,\u201d has grown up in a housing project in the decrepit West Midlands industrial town of Wolverhampton.\nIts similarity to \u201cHow to Be a Woman\u201d extends a good way beyond its title."}
