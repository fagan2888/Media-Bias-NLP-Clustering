In recent years, coffee prices have also gone up because of a fungus ravaging crops in Mexico and Central American and beetles attacking plantations around the world.\n\nRelated: 9 Reasons You\u2019re Paying More for Groceries\n\nHowever, the rising cost of coffee isn\u2019t the only reason tea has become so popular.

Meanwhile Argo tea chain has been growing steadily for the past decade. It\u2019s also been hard to avoid the thousands of independent teahouses popping up around the country, especially in San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area.\n\nEven supermarkets are expanding their tea offering. Last week, Supermarket News reported that some Haggen Food & Pharmacy and Whole Foods stores have added kombucha stations where customers can fill out growlers with their favorite flavored fermented tea.\n\nRelated: 8 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Coffee\n\n\u201cWhile kombucha is still somewhat of a niche trend, its popularity has been growing,\u201d the article said. \u201cSN sister publication New Hope, which focuses on the natural foods industry, calls functional beverages like kombucha one of the next decade\u2019s top food and beverage trends.\u201d\n\nWith so much happening in the tea category, the industry is likely to experience another decade of growth.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With coffee prices doubling this year, Americans are increasingly turning to tea and a whole industry is flourishing as a result.", "title": "Why Tea is the New Coffee", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/13/Why-Tea-New-Coffee", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10132014_Tea_Pot.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/13/Why-Tea-New-Coffee", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10132014_Tea_Pot.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With coffee prices doubling this year, Americans are increasingly turning to tea and a whole industry is flourishing as a result.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8dc4\"", "article_summary": "While tea has been widely available at coffee shops and grocery stores (mostly in packaged dry tea bags), specialized tea parlors are sprouting everywhere in the country, and the one company that revolutionized the way we drink coffee is now trying to do the same with our tea.\nAmericans have been gravitating more toward healthier, which has prompted a whole range of types of tea to emerge, including green tea and white tea.\nWith coffee prices doubling this year, Americans are increasingly turning to tea and a whole industry is flourishing as a result.\nThe total wholesale value of tea sold in the U.S. has grown from under $2 billion dollars 10 years ago to well over $10 billion in 2013, according to the Tea Association of the USA.\nRelated: 9 Reasons You\u2019re Paying More for GroceriesHowever, the rising cost of coffee isn\u2019t the only reason tea has become so popular."}
