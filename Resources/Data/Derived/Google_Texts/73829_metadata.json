A lot.\n\nDonavan, 41 of San Francisco, is self-employed and buys his own health insurance. Currently he pays $841 per month for insurance for himself, his wife and three young children. But, Kaiser is canceling that policy and offering him a new one that fully complies with the Affordable Care Act. Effective Jan. 1, his family\u2019s premium is going up to $1,000, with a higher deductible.\n\nDonavan says he voted for Obama in both elections and calls himself a \u201cbig proponent\u201d of the health law. He has a pretty calm demeanor and says he was \u201csurprised\u201d by this news from Kaiser.\n\n\u201cI just keep coming back to the name \u2018Affordable Care Act,'\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d pay the same or less for better coverage.\u201d\n\nSubsidies are available for people to buy insurance, but they are dependent on income. Donavan says he earns too much to qualify.\n\nIndeed, nationally, a recent study from the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation (not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente) found that just over half of people currently buying insurance on the individual market will see their premiums go down.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president with the foundation, says that Donavan\u2019s situation \u201cencapsulates the diversity of experiences\u201d that people are likely to have with Obamacare.\n\nSome people may pay higher premiums, he said, \u201cand the reason those premiums are going up is because people with pre-existing conditions will now be able to get insurance, and those people often have very high medical bills. That money has to come from somewhere.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kaiser Permanente said in a statement that any individual\u2019s premiums depends on the coverage they currently have:\n\nSome provisions of the Affordable Care Act may contribute to premium increases, while others may contribute to reductions in premiums for the coverage that will be available starting in 2014. \u2026 The law mandates more comprehensive coverage starting in 2014. This means more services will be covered by insurance. \u2026 As a result of these improvements, the cost of coverage \u2013 in the form of the monthly premium \u2013 will increase for some members, simply to pay for the expanded coverage. It\u2019s important to note that individuals with some of the more expensive coverage plans \u2013 high-benefit plans, and others such as COBRA continuation plans \u2013 may see lower premiums next year.\n\nBut all this background is little comfort for Donavan. He acknowledges that his out-of-pocket maximum is less, and his new policy \u201cdefinitely protects from catastrophic bankruptcy situations, but most people, the first thing you think about is what\u2019s my monthly and what\u2019s my deductible.\u201d Those are both more expensive under his new policy.\n\nThis post has been updated to clarify that Donavan buys his own insurance and that he received notice his policy was canceled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The notice from Kaiser came in the mail about ten days ago.
