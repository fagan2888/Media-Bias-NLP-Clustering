Four of the five Ventura County residents who became sick from West Nile virus are from Simi Valley, a county official said Friday.

Ventura County Public Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin said the fifth person is from Camarillo.

All five cases were announced over the last several days. The Simi Valley resident who died of West Nile complications last week remains the county's only fatality from the virus, Levin said.

He said one West Nile patient was still in the hospital Friday morning but others have been released and are doing better.

Environmental health experts note hot weather places like Simi Valley can attract mosquitoes. Levin said clusters of cases happen sometimes with no real explanation.

"There's no logical reason for it," he said, noting that public health and environmental health officials have talked about redoubling control efforts. The efforts include regularly checking some 700 breeding sites in Simi Valley.

Two victims spent significant amounts of time outside Ventura County and could have contracted the virus elsewhere, Levin said.

Environmental health officials reported two more birds collected in Ventura County have tested positive for West Nile virus.

One bird was collected in the Oak Park area. The other was found in Ventura.
