John Kasich.\n\nThis week Kasich staked out the rather untenable position that Congress should repeal Obamacare but keep the Medicaid expansion part, as if they\u2019re two different things. \u201cFrom Day One, and up until today and into tomorrow, I do not support Obamacare,\u201d Kasich said Monday, then added: \u201cI don\u2019t really see expanding Medicaid as really connected to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nRecall that Kasich bypassed his state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature last year to expand Medicaid, invoking his Christian faith and musing that when St. Peter asked what you did for the poor, you \u201cbetter have a good answer.\u201d His answer, presumably, will be that he helped the poor by taxing the people of Ohio and trapping the poor in Medicaid, a deeply dysfunctional program that provides the worst health coverage in the country and the expansion of which is a major feature of Obamacare.\n\nIt would be possible\u2014and easier, in fact\u2014for Gov. Kasich to argue that reducing Medicaid enrollment is more compassionate in the long run. Still considered a potential contender for the Republican nomination in 2016, Kasich now finds himself in position that requires both defending his Medicaid expansion and condemning the increasingly unpopular healthcare law. Either he\u2019s woefully ignorant about Obamacare, or he knows he\u2019s being disingenuous but has chosen to defend Medicaid expansion because repeal would mean kicking thousands off the Medicaid rolls in Ohio.\n\nToo bad for Kasich. It would be possible\u2014and easier, in fact\u2014for him to argue that reducing Medicaid enrollment and restricting the program to the groups it was originally meant to serve\u2014the frail elderly, poor pregnant women and infants, the disabled\u2014is more compassionate in the long run. It would also give him a chance to make the case that expanding entitlements harms the poor by disincentivizing work and condemning them to second-class healthcare while benefiting large hospital systems and Medicaid managed-care companies.\n\nChoosing Politics Over Helping the Poor, Yet Again Alas, it\u2019s probably too late for Kasich, but Republican leaders will need to get this right if they want to bill themselves as conservatives. In a televised debate last week against his Democratic challenger, Sen. Mitch McConnell called for \u201cpulling out Obamacare, root and branch\u201d\u2014but then said it would be okay if Kentucky\u2019s relatively successful health insurance exchange, Kynect, continued. Of Medicaid expansion, which Kentucky\u2019s Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear opted into last year, McConnell simply said: \u201cThe states can decide whether to expand Medicaid or not. In our state, the governor decided to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell\u2019s version of repealing Obamacare \u2018root and branch\u2019 is more of a pruning. In other words, McConnell\u2019s version of repealing Obamacare \u201croot and branch\u201d is more of a pruning. He apparently doesn\u2019t have an opinion about the exchange, or his state\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid\u2014both of which are pillars of Obamacare. The Washington Examiner\u2019s Phil Klein called McConnell\u2019s position \u201cincoherent,\u201d and in a sense it is. How can you support repeal but claim indifference about the exchange?\n\nOn the other hand, as Avik Roy of Forbes noted, technically it would be possible to retain a state-based exchange while repealing Obamacare, although the exchange \u201cwould be meaningfully different than those under Obamacare.\u201d Namely, the exchange would function under the sole authority of the state, which would reassert its traditional role in regulating\u2014and perhaps, now, subsidizing\u2014health insurance.\n\nMaybe McConnell knows this, maybe not. It\u2019s possible that his attempt to make a distinction between Obamacare and Kentucky\u2019s exchange reflects a highly nuanced policy view of how to reform the law, but it\u2019s more likely that it reflects a political conundrum some Republicans feel they now face: how do you call for repealing a law that\u2019s ostensibly covering millions of Americans?\n\nFor McConnell, maybe it\u2019s enough to shift responsibility onto state leaders. Kasich, however, must treat Medicaid expansion as something completely separate from Obamacare, which it manifestly is not, and try to dismiss opposition as \u201ceither political or ideological.\u201d Some contend that Kasich isn\u2019t as incoherent as he seems\u2014that you can be in favor of repeal but also support states expanding Medicaid. That\u2019s true, strictly speaking, since various expansions of Medicaid have been tried over the years in red and blue states alike. And it\u2019s true that few Republicans support keeping Medicaid as it is. But that\u2019s not what Kasich is talking about; he\u2019s talking about Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, and trying to pry the two apart.\n\nRepublicans: The Party of Obamacare Lite Other Republican presidential hopefuls will also likely try this, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. His proposed Medicaid expansion would build on the current Healthy Indiana Plan, which funds health savings accounts for certain Medicaid enrollees, and create \u201cHIP 2.0\u2033\u2014essentially the same program but extended to the expansion population, with more benefits and larger taxpayer-funded HSA contributions for those who deposit a nominal amount of their own funds each month. Pence has touted his \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d proposal as a conservative way to expand Medicaid in the belief that such a thing is possible. A close examination of his plan shows that it is not. In fact, a close examination of all the Republican expansion plans to date reveals that truly conservative Medicaid reforms are incompatible with Medicaid rules as promulgated by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That hasn\u2019t stopped Pence from making his case, although it\u2019s possible he proposed a plan he knows he administration will reject just so he can say that he tried.\n\nA close examination of all the Republican expansion plans to date reveals that truly conservative Medicaid reforms are incompatible with federal Medicaid rules. Unfortunately for Kasich and all the other Republican governors who already took the plunge and expanded Medicaid, the data is hard to dispute: Medicaid expansion is driving Obamacare coverage. This week, the Heritage Foundation released a report detailing coverage gains under Obamacare, showing that out of the roughly 8.5 million Americans who gained coverage under the law, 6.2 million come from Medicaid expansion. Of the 2.4 million who gained private coverage, nearly all of them were previously insured, which means Obamacare\u2019s coverage of the uninsured has thus far been almost entirely a result of Medicaid expansion.That won\u2019t be how the administration talks about the numbers, but many Republican voters will be well aware of the connection between Medicaid expansion and Obamacare come 2016, in part because plenty of potential GOP contenders will use expansion as a cudgel against their rivals.That will be a problem for governors like Kasich and Chris Christie in New Jersey. They no doubt believe the issue cuts both ways, and reason that the longer Obamacare is in place the more difficult it will be to repeal. After all, who will pledge to tear out Obamacare \u201croot and branch\u201d if it means stripping 25 million poor Americans of Medicaid coverage?", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 06:51:18 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "With the midterms looming, Obamacare politics are again prominent.
