Four people were arrested. That heroin, which police said was stamped with the name \u201cHollywood\u201d as a marketing tool, was on the packaging of the heroin linked to some of the recent fatalities.\n\nWilk said police tried to spread the word through social media about the lethal potency of this batch of heroin.\n\n\" People will use a bag of heroin as they are use to, but it is much more potent, so they are getting much more heroin which is stopping their heart and stopping their breathing, \" said Wilk.\n\nThe arrests in the three cities may temporarily slow the retail heroin trade, but won\u2019t eliminate it, according to police. Wilk said the region needs more treatment beds for people struggling with opioid addiction.\n\n\" The addiction is extremely strong and powerful,\" said Wilk. \" It becomes a community problem and everybody has to come together to find a way to get people the rehab they need to get off this drug.\"\n\nAlthough the recent deaths occurred in the three cities in Hampden County, Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno said the opioid crisis is not isolated to urban areas of the state.\n\n\" I want to commend Gov. Baker for trying to hit this on the front end with prescription drugs which get put out there by some doctors and people get hooked,\" said Sarno.\n\nGovernor Charlie Baker filed a bill to address the opioid addiction crisis last October, and has appealed for the legislature to act quickly now that the winter recess has ended on Beacon Hill.\n\nLegislators are expected to water down some of Baker\u2019s bill, including a provision that would limit doctors to prescribing no more than a 72-hour supply of opioid pills in an initial prescription.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/police-warn-exceptionally-deadly-heroin-western-massachusetts", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201601/462404679.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Police Warn Of Exceptionally Deadly Heroin In Western Massachusetts"}, "story_id": 462404650, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ptuthill"}, "author": "Paul Tuthill", "org_id": 298, "dc": {"title": "Police Warn Of Exceptionally Deadly Heroin In Western Massachusetts"}, "nid": 52559, "datePublished": "2016-01-09", "keywords": "Massachusetts, drugs", "wordCount": 631, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Police in three western Massachusetts cities have seized thousands of bags of heroin and arrested more than a dozen people for heroin trafficking and distribution as they investigate recent overdose deaths.\nPolice believe an exceptionally pure batch of heroin has caused the deaths of at least eight people in western Massachusetts in the last week.\nPolice in Springfield, where one of the overdose deaths was reported, discovered 9,000 bags of heroin stashed inside a fake automobile bumper.\nThe arrests in the three cities may temporarily slow the retail heroin trade, but won\u2019t eliminate it, according to police.\nWilk said police tried to spread the word through social media about the lethal potency of this batch of heroin.\""}
