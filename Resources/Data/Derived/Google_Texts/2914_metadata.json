There are no earmarks to dangle in front of members. Plenty of Republicans, having discovered pathways to re-election by being party antagonists, have little reason to fear leadership. And plenty of other Republicans, tired of the conference catering to its most conservative members, are ready for a revolt of their own.\n\nScalise entered leadership last June after former Majority Leader Eric Cantor unexpectedly lost his primary, creating an open spot in the GOP\u2019s top ranks.\n\nIn a hotly contested three-way race, Scalise took the whip position on the first ballot . It was an impressive win by the then-Republican Study Committee chairman, who sold himself as a conservative voice in leadership.\n\nBut there was little time for celebration. Scalise hadn\u2019t even moved into Cantor\u2019s old office \u2014 Kevin McCarthy stayed in his whip office and just changed the sign \u2014 when he faced his first real test : pushing through a controversial border supplemental package.\n\nWeeks later, in September, Scalise helped sell conservatives on a short-term CR , even as many insisted a CR extending into the new Congress would be a stronger tactic for dealing with President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.\n\nScalise did it again in December with the so-called cromnibus .\n\nThen, an ugly blast from his Louisiana past nearly derailed the new majority whip.\n\nA reporter revealed Scalise had, in 2002, delivered a speech to a group founded by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, followed quickly by a report on a 1999 Roll Call article in which then-potential congressional candidate Scalise said he embraced many of the same conservative views as Duke \u2014 Scalise said he was just a more viable candidate.\n\nThe controversy complicated Scalise\u2019s leadership position. There were a couple of weeks in early January when it was clear either the story or Scalise would have to go . Ultimately, in a testament to his resilience, it was Scalise who persevered.\n\nScalise knows that, for the casual observer of American politics, his name now has a comma attached to it \u2014 with a dependent clause affixed on the other end noting the 2002 speech. He knows he has some work to do to be more than the-Republican-who-spoke-to-a-white-power-group.\n\nWhen CQ Roll Call asked for a brief, non-Wikipedia version of his biography, Scalise was more than happy to oblige. \u201cEspecially now,\u201d he said, seeming to reference the speech controversy, which litters his online biography.\n\nAs for the accusations he\u2019s racist \u2014 or has benefited from convincing bigoted voters he somehow shares their beliefs \u2014 Scalise seems to have moved on from apologizing and instead is hitting back.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen people come out who know me and say, 'That\u2019s not who he is,'\u201d Scalise said. \u201cThe media tried to come out and create some false narrative, and it didn\u2019t take hold because it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nThe truth, Scalise has always insisted, is that in 2002, he was talking to anyone who would listen \u2014 and that he had no staff to vet speaking requests. \u201cIf I was open, I\u2019d just go and speak.\u201d\n\nNow Scalise faces the task of restoring the luster to his brand. It\u2019s been noted in numerous publications \u2014 including this one \u2014 that Scalise shares a close friendship with black Democrat and fellow Louisiana Rep. Cedric L. Richmond.\n\nAnd beyond a small public relations campaign, Scalise is signaling to his congressional colleagues that he\u2019s not going anywhere. The first step in that process, it seems, is to raise money. Lots of it .\n\nIn the first quarter of this Congress, a quarter not typically known for big fundraising hauls, Scalise brought in more than $1.5 million. That\u2019s unprecedented for a whip at this point and a testament to Scalise\u2019s determination to get back on track. (He went ahead and doled out roughly $250,000 directly to members and another $350,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee.)\n\nIn Washington, fundraising is an easy way to measure power. And historic fundraising totals are a good way to show allies and opponents your career is far from over.\n\nNor did it hurt that Republicans ended their first 100 days in office by adopting a budget \u2014 a tougher task than it probably should be for the party \u2014 and by overwhelmingly passing a bipartisan deal ditching the Medicare \"doc fix\" for long-term changes.\n\nThat may be why, despite the setbacks, Scalise isn\u2019t ruling out eventually moving up the leadership ladder.\n\nHe demurs when asked if he\u2019s interested in, perhaps, becoming majority leader should Boehner retire and McCarthy become speaker. \u201cI was not even thinking I\u2019d be whip today a year ago,\u201d Scalise said.\n\nBut he notes that when he entered the Louisiana statehouse in 1996, he heard some colleagues predict, on their first day in office, they would one day be governor. \u201cAnd none of them [did] because a lot of them didn\u2019t focus on the job they had,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always believed if you work hard at the job you have, whatever opportunities come later, will be there because of what you do.\u201d\n\nA true politician's answer.\n\nScalise notes he hasn\u2019t asked Boehner if he\u2019s leaving at the end of this Congress \u2014 and Boehner hasn\u2019t told him. But Scalise said Republicans have plenty to focus on before they get involved in those discussions.\n\nFor one, Scalise said, they\u2019ll get a reconciliation bill on the president\u2019s desk that fundamentally dismantles Obamacare.\n\nFor another, Scalise continued, they\u2019ll pass that long-promised-but-yet-to-materialize Republican replacement for Obamacare. (He believes the Supreme Court will rule in favor of Republicans on King v. Burwell \u2014 far from a given \u2014 and said the case going their way would cause \u201ca real earthquake within the law.\u201d)\n\nAnd, Scalise said, he believes the Export-Import Bank, at least in its current form, won\u2019t be reauthorized . \u201cAt this point, [Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas] has said he wants it to expire, and I think it\u2019s on track to go that way.\u201d\n\nOverall, Scalise presents himself as a distinctly social animal, someone who genuinely enjoys the company of others. He notes he shares a flop house with GOP Reps. John Shimkus of Illinois, Kevin Brady of Texas and Erik Paulsen of Minnesota. (\u201cWe always get on Shimkus, you know, for not keeping the place clean enough, you know, and he blames us for throwing stuff on the ground and the dirty dishes, but it\u2019s a fun mix.\u201d)\n\nYes, Scalise has a serious job. But it's important to him that people know he knows how to have fun.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the answer you get when \u2014 channeling your inner James Lipton \u2014 you ask him: \"Who is Steve Scalise?\"\n\n\u201cSteve Scalise,\u201d he said, almost too comfortable talking about himself in the third person, \u201cis a happy warrior who believes in working hard and having fun along the way.\u201d\n\nPresented with the fact that \u201chappy warrior\u201d is just a Washington clich\u00e9, Scalise said he has \"battle scars\" from some big fights. \u201cI\u2019ve learned persistence, with some of the things I\u2019ve passed along the way, is the only way to get things done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the best attribute you can have is persistence,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: In Richmond\u2019s Defense of Scalise, a History of Camaraderie Congressional Black Caucus Sees Leverage in Steve Scalise Protests What Scalise and Vitter Told Roll Call About David Duke in 1999 The 114th: CQ Roll Call's Guide to the New Congress Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Majority Whip Steve Scalise walked to the floor on Feb. 27 for the vote on a\u00a0three-week continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security, he knew it was going to fail.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "When Majority Whip Steve Scalise walked to the floor on Feb. 27 for the vote on a\u00a0three-week continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security, he knew it was going to fail.", "title": "The Steve Scalise Comeback Tour", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/steve-scalise-comeback-tour", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/04/house_gop017_032415-445x296.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-04-28T09:00:20Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "When Majority Whip Steve Scalise walked to the floor on Feb. 27 for the vote on a\u00a0three-week continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security, he knew it was going to fail.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,author,category,category,category,CQToday Topic,kevin-mccarthy,leadership-race,republicans-2,steve-scalise,uncategorized,gops", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2015-04-28T09:00:20Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-28T09:00:20Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "When Majority Whip Steve Scalise walked to the floor on Feb. 27 for the vote on a\u00a0three-week continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security, he knew it was going to fail.", "title": "The Steve Scalise Comeback Tour", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/steve-scalise-comeback-tour", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/04/house_gop017_032415-445x296.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "When Majority Whip Steve Scalise walked to the floor on Feb. 27 for the vote on a three-week continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security, he knew it was going to fail.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the answer you get when \u2014 channeling your inner James Lipton \u2014 you ask him: \"Who is Steve Scalise?\"\nThen, an ugly blast from his Louisiana past nearly derailed the new majority whip.\nScalise entered leadership last June after former Majority Leader Eric Cantor unexpectedly lost his primary, creating an open spot in the GOP\u2019s top ranks.\nIn a hotly contested three-way race, Scalise took the whip position on the first ballot ."}
