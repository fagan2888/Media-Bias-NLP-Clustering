On Monday morning, more than 1,000 people gathered in Battery Park in something called Flood Wall Street, a demonstration that comes on the heels of Sunday’s historically attended People’s Climate March. Flood Wall Street seeks to connect the economy with issues of the environment, and, appropriately, its website features the tagline “Stop Capitalism. End the Climate Crisis.”

The campaign’s mission statement reads:

Flood, blockade, sit-in, and shut down the institutions that are profiting from the climate crisis. Wear Blue. On Monday, September 22nd at 9:00 am, thousands of people will gather at Battery Park in Lower Manhattan to confront the root cause of the climate crisis – an economic system based on exploiting frontline communities, workers and natural resources. On the heels of the largest-ever march on climate change, we have an opportunity to transform the economic system driving this crisis. Wearing blue to represent the sea that surrounds us, we rise to the steps of the NY STock Exchange at 12:00 pm, flooding the area with our bodies in a massive sit-in — a collective act of nonviolent civil disobedience 0 to confront the system that both causes and profits from the crisis that is threatening humanity.
