There is a reason the LePage administration has rejected expansion five times. And this sixth attempt is not the same; it is worse. Previous proposals would have cost Maine taxpayers more than $300 million over the next five years. This latest attempt will likely be even more expensive given the experiences of other states.\n\nSen. Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, claims, \u201cIt\u2019s just the right thing to do.\u201d Allow me to explain why it is not only wrong but detrimental to the state.\n\nMaine has already experienced the devastating consequences of expanding Medicaid and doing so again would be irresponsible and return Maine\u2019s budget from its current state of stability to one of perpetual crisis.\n\nSaviello is proposing the so-called \u201cprivate option.\u201d The private option isn\u2019t private \u2014 it uses the same taxpayer dollars that would fund traditional Medicaid expansion. In most cases, it ends up costing more than traditional expansion, because of the rapidly rising cost of health insurance plans. So much for the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act.\n\nThe private option typically relies on a state purchasing Qualified Health Plans for a portion of its expansion population. Last year, when Nebraska considered implementing the private option, that state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services found that Qualified Health Plans \u2014 or publically funded private insurance for those earning 100 percent of the federal poverty level and above \u2014 would cost the state 94 percent more than traditional Medicaid expansion.\n\nSaviello claims that his expansion plan is based on the success of other states. However, two of the states he cited \u2014 Kentucky and New Mexico \u2014 are facing massive Medicaid shortfalls.\n\nThere is no proof expanding Medicaid would reduce drug-fueled crime or resolve Maine\u2019s substance abuse problem.\n\nIt would be great if complicated problems such as drug addiction could be so easily resolved by just throwing money at them. New Hampshire, for example, with the same population as Maine \u2014 and an expanded Medicaid program \u2014 had double the number of heroin overdose deaths last year. Even so, Maine continues to increase funding for treatment services, spending more than $20 million annually on the uninsured. Furthermore, federal funding provided to the states for substance abuse treatment has increased from $3 billion in 2005 to more than $13 billion in 2015.\n\nMedicaid expansion backers argue expanding will enroll 60,000 working-age adults into Medicaid. In reality, that number is closer to 80,000. Every expansion state that has publically released its original enrollment projections has exceeded their enrollment projections, which has led to budget shortfalls.\n\nExpanding Medicaid would move people off private insurance coverage that they already have onto taxpayer-funded programs.\n\nSaviello claims he will not allow this to occur and will work closely with the federal government to make sure it does not happen. The senator, however, doesn\u2019t have this authority. If the state expands Medicaid, Maine can\u2019t choose who is eligible and who is not; it\u2019s dictated by the federal government.\n\nOther states have not been successful when it comes to working with the federal government on alternative Medicaid expansion plans. Jim Vokal with the Platte Institute in Nebraska stated, \u201cIn theory, the Legislature can put anything it would like in this bill, but in practice, LB 1032 [their proposed expansion bill] is just a dress-rehearsal for a negotiation with the federal government over a Section 1115 Medicaid waiver.\u201d\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchison is facing a similar uphill battle \u2014 he tried to implement accountability reforms such as work requirements and asset testing. The Obama administration has told Hutchison that any asset test is off the table and that the state would not be permitted to implement a work requirement but only \u201cwork encouragement.\u201d There is no proof Maine\u2019s experience would be any different.\n\nThe Editorial Board is correct; it\u2019s time to end the fight over Medicaid expansion.\n\nWhen Maine expanded in 2001 and again in 2003, it led to annual shortfalls in MaineCare of $50 million to more than $100 million. It did not improve the uninsured rate and charity care was not reduced. It destroyed the state\u2019s budget, caused the state to stop paying its bills leaving hundreds of millions in debt owed to Maine\u2019s hospitals and left our state\u2019s neediest and most vulnerable to pay the price.\n\nIt did not solve problems, it created them, a scenario playing out every day in states around the country as the financial and practical truth of massively expanding a government-welfare entitlement program comes home to roost.\n\nMary Mayhew is the commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It would be irresponsible, and return Maine's budget from its current state of stability to one of perpetual crisis.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "It would be irresponsible, and return Maine's budget from its current state of stability to one of perpetual crisis.", "title": "Mayhew: MaineCare expansion still a bad idea - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/484504_3edit_MaineCompass_mayhew.jpg", "height": 879}, "updated_time": "2016-02-29T14:29:26-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2016/03/01/mainecare-expansion-still-a-bad-idea/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/484504_3edit_MaineCompass_mayhew.jpg", "description": "It would be irresponsible, and return Maine's budget from its current state of stability to one of perpetual crisis.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mayhew: MaineCare expansion still a bad idea - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Columnists", "tag": "columnists", "published_time": "2016-03-01T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-29T14:29:26-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Every expansion state that has publically released its original enrollment projections has exceeded their enrollment projections, which has led to budget shortfalls.\nOnce again supporters of expanding Medicaid in Maine are making inaccurate statements and disregarding our state\u2019s past results with expanding MaineCare, Maine\u2019s Medicaid program.\nSaviello is proposing the so-called \u201cprivate option.\u201d The private option isn\u2019t private \u2014 it uses the same taxpayer dollars that would fund traditional Medicaid expansion.\nThe Editorial Board is correct; it\u2019s time to end the fight over Medicaid expansion.\nOther states have not been successful when it comes to working with the federal government on alternative Medicaid expansion plans."}
