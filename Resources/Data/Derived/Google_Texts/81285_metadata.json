A veteran of Presidential campaigns stretching over four decades, Caddell has had a front-row seat at many political defining moments in recent history.\n\nFor Caddell, the 2016 election is about voters revolting against Washington and the political classes that have dominated government and policy in recent years. \u201cThe system is on the verge of coming apart,\u201d Caddell noted. \u201cThe politicians in Washington aren\u2019t going to be able to put the genie back in the bottle.\u201d\n\nMost Republican campaigns have been left flat-footed in response, according to Caddell. He places the blame squarely on Republican party consultants, coming out of DC and the Republican National Committee, misunderstanding the mood of voters.\n\n\u201cThey have less feel for the electorate than the man in the moon,\u201d Caddell observed.\n\nCaddell noted that the only two Republican candidates who have not hired or surrounded themselves with national Republican consultants are Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Scott Walker, he said, surrounded himself with consultants out of Washington and out of the RNC and they immediately destroyed his candidacy.\n\nThe remaining candidates, he said, have listened to their consultants and have relied on out-dated messaging and strategies and have spent millions of dollars to no appreciable effect.\n\n\u201cMike Murphy has spent millions taking Jeb Bush from 17 percent [in the polls] to 4 percent,\u201d Caddell said.\n\nThe same sclerosis is plaguing Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign, according to Caddell. Although Rubio has done very well in the debates, Caddell said his campaign \u201cdoesn\u2019t move.\u201d He attributes this to the fact that Rubio\u2019s campaign is \u201crun by the Romney people.\u201d\n\nRubio is \u201cunwilling to run as an outsider\u201d, Caddell observed. Rubio\u2019s campaign seems to be focused on presenting the Florida Senator as the most conservative member of the political establishment. If, as Caddell thinks, the election is about an insurgency rather than ideology, Rubio\u2019s strategy is doubly wrong.\n\nCaddell also said that he was \u201csurprised [Rubio] hasn\u2019t used electability\u201d as a cornerstone of his campaign. More than half of Republican voters are angry at their political leadership, Caddell noted, but they also want to win in November.\n\nThe growing animosity between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, and the very negative tone of their campaigns against each other, does provide an opening for a third candidate to surprise in Iowa or New Hampshire, Caddell said.\n\nIt is unclear who that could be though, since the other candidates seem to be running to coming in third or fourth as their focus. \u201cWhen you run for President,\u201d Caddell said, \u201cyou have to run to win, not finish in a certain spot.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump and Cruz are dominating Republican polling, he sees possible dangers for both campaigns. Caddell believes Cruz is making a mistake running more as a conservative ideologue than an insurgent outsider. He believes Cruz is tied to a political \u201cmyth\u201d that the Reagan landslide victory in 1980 was a conservative wave election. Caddell believes that election was more of a revolt by voters against a terrible economy and the hostage situation in Iran than an embrace of conservative ideology.\n\nThe danger for Trump is more subtle. The establishment\u2019s hatred of Cruz and the recognition that Trump is at heart a deal-maker, have caused many old Republican establishment hands to embrace Trump recently.\n\nLast week, Bob Dole said he would prefer Trump over Cruz for the nomination. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who is the longest serving Governor in the country and has never been involved publicly in the Iowa Presidential caucuses, came out strongly last week against Cruz, specifically over the candidate\u2019s opposition to ethanol and wind power mandates and subsidies.\n\nCaddell said Branstad\u2019s comments against Cruz were a little disingenuous, since the Governor\u2019s son works for the ethanol lobby in the state.\n\nTrump, Caddell said, has been a little to quick to welcome the outreach from the political establishment.\n\nCaddell said the Iowa caucuses, which take place February 1, will be decided by turnout. In the last two elections, Caddell said, Republican turnout in the caucuses has been around 125,000 voters. Caddell said Trump and Cruz are essentially tied among voters who have caucused in the past. If turnout goes up appreciably, though, Caddell believes Trump could win.\n\nTurnout is also a factor in the Democrat race, Caddell said. Traditionally, around 130,000 Democrats have turned out for the caucuses. If that number gets closer to or about 200,000, like it did for Obama in 2008, then Sanders is likely to win.\n\nCaddell noted that Sanders\u2019 appeal to young voters is enormous. He said among voters under 30, Sanders is beating Clinton by something close to a 80-10 margin. The campaign so far has shown that Clinton \u201cwill lie about anything,\u201d Caddell said. \u201cIt is wearing thin.\u201d\n\nCaddell thinks Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren may have \u201cmissed her moment\u201d by declining to run. He thinks Sanders\u2019 great advantage right now is his \u201cauthenticity.\u201d Sanders is also helped by the fact that young voters \u201cdon\u2019t know what socialism is,\u201d Caddell said. \u201cAnd they won\u2019t,\u201d he added, \u201cuntil he\u2019s the nominee.\u201d\n\nSanders is resonating because he\u2019s talking about the political, and financial, system being rigged. Trump resonates because he says this same system is broken or incompetent. \u201cTrump and Sanders are drinking from different ends of the same trough,\u201d Caddell said.\n\nRevolts aren\u2019t always pretty, but they are the lifeblood of a Republic.
