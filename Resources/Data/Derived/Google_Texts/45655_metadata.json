The networks, similar to accountable care organizations, are composed of primary-care physicians, hospitals, clinics and other providers to manage care for the different patient populations.\n\n\n\nTrinity and Heritage will then contract with health insurers for full-risk capitated payments for those care networks. The organizations say the joint venture, named Trinity Health Partners, will help move their systems more quickly away from the current fee-for-service reimbursements and toward their shared goal of a \u201cpeople-centered health system.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're putting in place a system that is wired and engineered to see the patient wherever they are,\u201d Richard Gilfillan, M.D., CEO of Trinity, said in an interview at the J.P.
