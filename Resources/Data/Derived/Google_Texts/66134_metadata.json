WE DISCUSSED HIS VIEWS OF THE BROADER MIDDLE EAST, PARTICULARLY WHETHER THE U.S. AND IRAN ARE MORE LIKELY ALLIES IN IRAQ. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT IRAQ. HOW WILL IRAN USE ITS INFLUENCE THERE? DOES NURI AL MALIKI HAVE TO GO? >> WE BELIEVE THAT'S A QUESTION AND DECISION IRAQ HAS. >> NOBODY BELIEVES YOU ADOPT HAVE TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE OVER THAT GOVERNMENT. >> WE DO HAVE TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLLOWED CORRECT POLICIES. WE HAVE FOLLOWED THE CHOICES OF THE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN, IN IRAQ IN THE REST OF THE REGION, THAT'S WHY WE EXERCISE GREAT THERE. NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE GREATER MILITARY, BECAUSE WE RESPECT PEOPLE. MY ADVICE TO THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE DO THE SAME. TRY TO ASK IRANIANS, IRAQUIS, BODES MUCH BETTER FOR THE FUTURE. THAT RESPECT REQUIRES US TO DO TWO THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, NOW THERE IS A VERY DANGEROUS TERRORIST WHICH DOES NOT TARGET ONLY THE SHIA POPULATION IN IRAQ BUT TARGETS EVERY MEMBER OF IRAQI SOCIETY. >> TALKING ABOUT ISIS. >> SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND SYRIA. HAS MORE SYRIA THAN SHIA AND PUTTING MORE CITIZENS IN JEOPARDY IN IRAQ THAN IT HAS FOR YEARS. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WHICH IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR SECURITY PROBLEM NOT JUST FOR IRAQ BUT FOR SAUDI ARABIA, SYRIA, TURKEY. >> FOR IRAN AS WELL. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION, DOES IRAN FEEL IT IS ENCOMMON CAUSE WITH THE UNITED STATES FOR THE FUTURE OF IRAQ? WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT STAY TOGETHER OR DO YOU THINK IT WILL BREAK APART? >> I BELIEVE IRAQ, IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF EVERYBODY, AND I MEAN EVERYBODY, IN THE INTEREST OF STABILITY IN OUR REGION TO KEEP TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF IRAQ. TO KEEP IRAQ ONE. ALL ATTEMPTS TO BREAK UP ARE SHORT SIGHTED, WILL DO HARMISH EVEN THOSE TRYING TO DO GOOD. IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF NOT ONLY IRAN BUT THE UNITED STATES -- >> HOW DOES IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES COME TOGETHER TO DEFEAT ISIS. >> WE NEED TO AGREE ON PRINCIPLES. PRINCIPLES. WE NEED TO RESPECT THE CHOICES OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE. WE NEED TO USE WHATEVER INFLUENCE WE HAVE IN IRAQ AS WELL AS AFGHANISTAN IN ORDER TO CONVINCE VARIOUS FORCES INSIDE THE COUNTRY THAT THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD TO INCONCLUSIVITY IS WORKING TOGETHER. THAT IS THE CALL WE MADE TO EVERY PORTION OF SOCIETY. WE ARE IN CONTACT WITH VARIOUS PEOPLE INSIDE IRAQ. WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT BEFORE THIS HORRIFIC INCIDENT OF THE ATTACK BY ISIS AND WE CONTINUE TO CALL ON ALL FORCES IN IRAQ TO WORK TOGETHER TO FORM AN INCONCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT. THAT REPRESENTS AND RESPECTS THE WISHES OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE. NOW, WHOEVER THE IRAQI PARLIAMENT CAN COME UP WITH AS SPEAKER OF THE PARLIAMENT AND AS THE PRIME MINISTER, IRAN WILL RESPECT AS A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY WITH INFLUENCE. OUR ADVICE TO THEM IS NOT TO PICK THIS MAN OVER THIS OVER THIS MAN OF THE OUR ADVICE IS TO PICK A GOVERNMENT THAT CAN REPRESENT THE ENTIRE IRAQ AND BRING PEACE AND STABILITY TO THE REGION. >> 170,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN SYRIA, A THIRD OF THEM CIVILIANS. WHY DOES IRAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE ASSAD REGIME. >> THE QUESTION IS WHY THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO SUPPORT FORCES LIKE ISIS THAT ARE WREAKING HAVOC IN THIS REGION. THIS THE PROBLEM, THE UNITED STATES AND SOME OF ITS -- >> IS THAT FAIR TO SAY UNITED STATES IS SUPPORTING ISIS? >> THE UNITED STATES IS SUPPORTING THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DISMANTLE SYRIA, DESTROY SYRIA USING THESE TACTICS. YOU CANNOT PICK AND CHOOSE. >> ISN'T THAT WHAT IRAN IS DOING? >> THIS THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IN SYRIA. WE HAVE CALLED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING TO RESPECT THE WILL OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, TO ALLOW SYRIAN PEOPLE TO DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE, TO ALLOW SYRIAN PEOPLE TO USE POLITICAL PROCESSES MOD TO OBTAIN THE OBJECTIVE. >> THIS IS THE FORCE OF ASSAD'S FIST, NOT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE, ISN'T IT? >> NO, IT'S NOT. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE IN LEBANON WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT ASSAD'S FIST. WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ANY SPECIFIC GROUP, WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WHY DOESN'T UNITED STATES ABANDON THE IDEA OF PRECONDITIONS ON THE SYRIAN PEOPLE ABOUT WHO THEY SHOULD DECIDE TO GOVERN THEM. LET THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, LET THE PROCESS FORM, LET THE SYRIAN PEOPLE HAVE THE WILL AND HAVE THE CHANCE TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURE. YOU WANT THIS FOR YOUR SECHLT HAVE T -- HAVE THE RESPECT TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. DON'T MAKE OUR DECISIONS FOR US. LE US MAKE OUR OWN DECISIONS AND WE WILL HAVE A MUCH MORE SECURE AND BETTER WORLD. >> LET ME COME BACK TO WHERE WE BEGAN WITH THE FINAL QUESTION ON NUCLEAR COST. YOU SAID REPEATEDLY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE WEST AND AMERICA TO RESPECT IRAN. IT SEEMS LIKE A BIG ISSUE FOR AMERICA AND THE WEST IS TRUST OF IRAN. THERE'S SEVERAL POINTS THAT SEEM TO GO TO THAT MISTRUST. EFFORTS TO CONCEAL NUCLEAR FACILITIES BY IRAN. INSPECTORS STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN ACCESS TO A FACILITY THAT'S NEAR TEHRAN. IRAN HAS STUDIED HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE A WEAPON, SO THAT MIND-SET HAS BEEN THERE. PRESIDENT ROUHANI, HAS BEEN RAISED BEFORE, HAS WRITTEN IN HIS BOOK TALKING ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO IN THE PAST HE SAID NEGOTIATE WITH THE WEST TO BUY TIME SO IRAN COULD DEVELOP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON. YOU TAKE THAT TOGETHER, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE THAT IRAN DOESN'T WANT THE WORLD TO SEE. >> IF I MAY. ALL OF THESE DID NOT HAPPEN IN VACUUM. WHY DID IRAN NEED TO CONCEAL ITS PROGRAM? BECAUSE THE MINUTE -- EVERYTHING WE DID WAS LAWFUL. BUT THE MINUTE WE MADE IT PUBLIC, THE UNITED STATES WOULD TRY TO PREVENT OUR ACCESS TO VARIOUS FACILITIES EVEN TO FUEL TO ITS OWN BUILT REACTOR, THE UNITED STATES PREVENTED IT. NO QUESTION WE HAVE. WE OWN URANIUM ENRICHMENT FACILITIES OUTSIDE OF IRAQ, 10% BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET A GRAM. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FACILITY, WHEN THE UNITED STATES TALK ABOUT BOMBING IRANIAN FACILITIES OUT OF EXISTENCE, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IRAN TO DO? IRAN WOULD CREATE A FACILITY THAT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO BEING BOMBED. THAT IS WHAT ANY RATIONAL COUNTRY WOULD DO. IT'S NOT THAT WE WANT TO BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THAT COUNTRY. IT'S OUR PROGRAM, YOU'RE THREATENING, NOT YOU, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND ISRAEL, THREATENING TO ATTACK IT, USE BUNKER BUSTERS TO DESTROY IT. SO WE NEED TAKE IT TO A PLACE IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED. YOU TALK ABOUT OTHER FACILITIES. IF YOU'RE A CANCER PATIENT IN IRAQ AND NEED RADIO ISOTOPES IN ORDER FOR TREATMENT, YOU CANNOT GET IT. YOU CAN ONLY GET ONE DOSE AFTER GOING THROUGH SEVERAL PROCEDURES. EVEN THAT YOU CANNOT DO NOW, ALL BANKS BULLIED BY THE UNITED STATES NOT TO ACCEPT IRANIAN MONEY. HAVE YOU TO PUT CASH IN A SUITCASE, GO TO EUROPE AND BUY A DOSE OF RADIO ISOTOPE TO TREAT THE PATIENT. YOU PUT A COUNTRY WITH THE MANPOWER, WITH THE TECHNOLOGY, WITH HUMAN RESOURCES, WITH SCIENTISTS, MOST OF IRANIAN SCIENTISTS WORKING IN THE UNITED STATES ARE THE BEST. WE HAVE THE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY. A COUNTRY WITH ALL OF THIS, WITH THE WEALTH, RESOURCES, YOU DEPRIVE IT OF THE ABILITY TO GAIN ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND THEN YOU EXPECT IT TO SIMPLY SIT AND DIE QUIETLY. IT WON'T HAPPEN. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO ESTABLISH A NEW PARADIGM. THAT NEW PARADIGM IS TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR IRAN TO STICK TO OUR STRATEGIC DOCTRINE THAT WE DO NOT NEED NUCLEAR WEAPONS, BUT WE CANNOT BE DEPRIVED OF THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS. I CAN ASSURE YOU. I CAN ASSURE YOU, WITHIN THE NEXT 11 DAYS, WE CAN REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD PUT ALL THE CONCERN, ALL THE CONCERNS THAT ARE SERIOUS, IF YOU WANT NOT TO BE ALLAYED OF YOUR CONCERN, YOU WILL HAVE IT, BUT IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, ALL THESE CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED. IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EVEN A HYPOTHETICAL BREAKOUT, WE CAN EXTEND THIS BREAKOUT TO OVER THREE TO FOUR YEARS. NOT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS, BUT IN REALITY THREE TO FOUR YEARS. IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR NUCLEAR PROGRAM, SO THAT IT WILL NOT BE EVEN CONCEIVABLE FOR PEOPLE FROM IRAN TO GO ABOUT. WE'RE PREPARED TO DO ALL OF THAT, IN THE REALISTIC FRAMEWORK. WE HAVE PRESENTED IDEAS ABOUT IT. WE'RE ENGAGED IN SERIOUS PARTNERS IN FIVE PLUS ONE. I HOPE THEY ARE WORKING ON THE BASIS OF REALITIES AND NOT ON THE BASIS OF ILLUSIONS. >> WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Gregory talks with Javad Zarif on Iran's actions and their impact regionally and internationally.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "David Gregory talks with Javad Zarif on Iran's actions and their impact regionally and internationally.", "title": "Iranian Foreign Minister Explains His Country's Influence in the Mideast", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/meet-the-press/iranian-foreign-minister-explains-his-countrys-influence-in-the-mideast-303484483659", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/mtp_08iran2_140713.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "David Gregory talks with Javad Zarif on Iran's actions and their impact regionally and internationally.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/mtp_08iran2_140713.jpg"}, "title": "Iranian Foreign Minister Explains His Country's Influence in the Mideast", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "HTML5", "PreferredFormats": "M3U,F4M,MPEG4"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/meet-the-press/iranian-foreign-minister-explains-his-countrys-influence-in-the-mideast-303484483659", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "THIS THE PROBLEM, THE UNITED STATES AND SOME OF ITS -- >> IS THAT FAIR TO SAY UNITED STATES IS SUPPORTING ISIS?\nIT'S IN THE INTEREST OF NOT ONLY IRAN BUT THE UNITED STATES -- >> HOW DOES IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES COME TOGETHER TO DEFEAT ISIS.\nBUT THE MINUTE WE MADE IT PUBLIC, THE UNITED STATES WOULD TRY TO PREVENT OUR ACCESS TO VARIOUS FACILITIES EVEN TO FUEL TO ITS OWN BUILT REACTOR, THE UNITED STATES PREVENTED IT.\nEVEN THAT YOU CANNOT DO NOW, ALL BANKS BULLIED BY THE UNITED STATES NOT TO ACCEPT IRANIAN MONEY.\n>> THE QUESTION IS WHY THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO SUPPORT FORCES LIKE ISIS THAT ARE WREAKING HAVOC IN THIS REGION."}
