ARE, Sweden (AP) — After outclassing her opponents to win her fourth World Cup slalom race of the season, Mikaela Shiffrin invited a young girl with a bashful smile to join her on the podium.

Emma Lundell, 13, is fighting leukemia. Though it’s not over yet, she is starting to win that battle, and cites Shiffrin’s courage on the slopes as her biggest inspiration.

“I feel that beats anything I can do on the race hill,” an emotional Shiffrin said after the award ceremony Saturday in Are. “So she deserves to be on the top step of the podium.”

Shiffrin clocked the fastest time in both runs to beat second-placed Veronika Velez Zuzulova of Slovakia by 1.41 seconds. Sarka Strachova of the Czech Republic was third, 2.15 back.

The result means Shiffrin, who turned 20 on Friday, is close to winning her third consecutive crystal globe as the best slalom skier on the World Cup circuit at the season finals in Meribel.

Her closest rival, Sweden’s Frida Hansdotter, finished sixth in Are. To beat Shiffrin in the slalom standings Hansdotter needs to win the final race while Shiffrin fails to make the top 20.

“I will do what I can,” Hansdotter said. “But she is fantastic and in a class of her own right now.”

Despite her youth, Shiffrin already is Olympic and double world champion in slalom. She has 13 World Cup wins in slalom and one in giant slalom.
