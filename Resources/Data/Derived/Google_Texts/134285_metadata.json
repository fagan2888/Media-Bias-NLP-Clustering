About 65 percent were women and 40 percent were men.\n\n\"We also broke down where people were running, biking and walking,\" said Silliman, adding they were the most popular fitness activities.\n\nTexas is the top running state, according to the data, where the activity accounted for 47 percent of workouts. Idaho led in indoor and outdoor cycling that together accounted for 19 percent of the activities logged.\n\nWalking was by far the most common activity across all the states, but California, Oregon and Washington took the top three slots with about 40 percent of the data showing it was the favorite form of exercise.\n\nGregory Chertok, sports psychology consultant for the American College of Sports Medicine said the use of apps can strengthen exercise adherence.\n\nHe added that unlike self-reporting, which tends to be inaccurate with people overestimating or underestimating their competence, data from apps is more accurate.\n\n\"The app, unlike our own perceptions, gives us true, objective, hard data,\" he explained.\n\nFlorida-based fitness instructor and wellness coach Shirley Archer said collecting data can raise awareness about eating and activity habits.\n\n\"Awareness is a key step toward changing behaviors,\" said Archer, author of 15 books including \"Fitness 9 to 5.\" \"You can't change what you don't know that you're doing,\u201d\n\nOn the down side, she added, too much data can be overwhelming and even discouraging.\n\n\"People lose interest after the novelty has worn off,\" she said.\n\nBut Archer added that the information is useful for fitness experts to help improve workouts.\n\n(Reporting by Dorene Internicola; Editing by Richard Chang)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fitness, apps, data, reveals, american, workout, habits, most, active, states", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Millions of Americans are recording their workout routines and activities on apps that are giving fitness experts new insights into the habits of a logged-in population.", "title": "Fitness Apps Data Reveals American Workout Habits, Most Active States", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fitness-apps-data-reveals-american-workout-habits-most-active-states-341302", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/shutterstock174905432.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Millions of Americans are recording their workout routines and activities on apps that are giving fitness experts new insights into the habits of a logged-in population.", "title": "Fitness Apps Data Reveals American Workout Habits, Most Active States", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fitness-apps-data-reveals-american-workout-habits-most-active-states-341302", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/shutterstock174905432.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/shutterstock174905432.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-07-06T09:37:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T09:37:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Millions of Americans are recording their workout routines and activities on apps that are giving fitness experts new insights into the habits of a logged-in population."}, "article_summary": "New fitness apps are recording more workouts and are giving insight to fitness experts into how people train.\nIt combined its data with workout information from MapMyFitness' 25 million users to rank the states according to their diet, sleep and activity habits.\nPhoto courtesy of ShutterstockNEW YORK (Reuters) - Millions of Americans are recording their workout routines and activities on apps that are giving fitness experts new insights into the habits of a logged-in population.\nBut Archer added that the information is useful for fitness experts to help improve workouts.\n\"Seven of our top 10 active states were western states,\" said Rebecca Silliman of MyFitnessPal, which analyzed information recorded by its 65 million users."}
