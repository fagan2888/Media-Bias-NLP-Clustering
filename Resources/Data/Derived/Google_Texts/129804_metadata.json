All have been declared martyrs for the faith.\n\nReaders may also recall that there was a bit of controversy when the public statement about this tragedy released by the White House, speaking for President Barack Obama, merely condemned the \"despicable and cowardly murder of twenty-one Egyptian citizens in Libya by ISIL-affiliated terrorists.

The Islamic State executioners had been very specific in saying that their victims were chosen because of their connection to \"crusaders,\" the \"hostile Egyptian church\" and the \"Nation of the Cross.\"\n\nCitizens?\n\nNow there is this new vision of martyrdom, as noted in quite a few mainstream reports today. This material comes from the veteran correspondent David Kirkpatrick of The New York Times foreign staff, who is known for \"getting religion\" in the world around him:\n\nThe Islamic State released a video on Sunday that appears to show fighters from affiliates in southern and eastern Libya executing dozens of Ethiopian Christians, some by beheading and others by shooting.\n\nPrefaced by extensive speeches and interviews that appear to take place in the Islamic State\u2019s strongholds in Syria and Iraq, the footage of the killings, if confirmed, would be the first evidence that the group\u2019s leaders in those countries are coordinating with fighters who have taken up the group\u2019s banner in those parts of Libya, compounding fears of its expansion across the Mediterranean.\n\nTry to miss the religious content in this passage:\n\nMasked fighters lead a row of bound captives dressed in black into the desert and then shoot each of the prisoners in the back of the head. Another group of masked fighters leads a row of prisoners in orange jumpsuits along a beach and then beheads each of them with a long knife, placing the severed heads on the bodies lying on the sand in bloody surf. \u201cYou will not have safety even in your dreams, until you accept Islam,\u201d declares a masked figure, speaking English with an American accent, pointing a revolver toward the camera. \u201cOur battle is a battle between faith and blasphemy, between truth and falsehood.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I don't have much to add to the coverage. However, I wanted to underline, for GetReligion readers, the top of a new analysis by veteran religion-beat specialist John L. Allen, Jr., of Crux -- the author of a 2013 book entitled \"The Global War on Christians: Dispatches from the Front Lines of Anti-Christian Persecution.\"\n\nHere is my question: When Allen refers to a \"climate of denial\" in the following passage, in what settings do you think this denial is most prominent?\n\nThough it seems almost perverse to seek a silver lining in the rise of ISIS, nevertheless there actually is one. It has at least put an end to a longstanding climate of denial that violent anti-Christian persecution around the world is a genuine, and mounting, human rights menace.\n\nThe point is not that Christians deserve special privileges, or that they\u2019re the only ones at risk. It\u2019s rather that for a long time, the threats they face couldn\u2019t penetrate Western consciousness, where the typical American or European is more accustomed to thinking of Christians as the authors of religious persecution rather than its victims.\n\nThe White House? Maybe. The U.S. State Department? Most certainly.\n\nBut how about many elite and mainstream newsrooms? Is it safe to say that the Islamic State is in the process of killing the \"blind spot\" many journalists have shown on this issue?\n\nHas ISIS killed that blindness at last?\n\nLord have mercy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you follow issues of human rights and religious freedom abroad, you will \r\nsurely recall the recent incident in which the Islamic State released that \r\nvideo showing the execution of 20 Egyptian Coptic believers and one Ghanian \r\nman whose identity is harder to pin down.
