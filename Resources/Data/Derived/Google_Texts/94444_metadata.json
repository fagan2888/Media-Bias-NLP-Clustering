(Photo: Special to the Register)\n\nTens of thousands of Iowans who buy their own health insurance are about to receive a shock in the mail.\n\nWellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield is sending letters this week telling about 30,000 customers it plans to raise their premiums by 38 percent to 43 percent next year.\n\nWellmark sells about three-quarters of individual policies in Iowa\u2019s health-insurance market. The steep increases will affect people who bought relatively new plans that comply with rules of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnother 90,000 Wellmark customers who hold older individual insurance plans are expected to face smaller increases, which will be announced in June. The increases being proposed this week also don\u2019t affect the hundreds of thousands of Wellmark customers who obtain coverage via their employers. Their premiums are expected to rise less, because they are in larger, more stable pools of customers.\n\nWellmark Executive Vice President Laura Jackson said poor health and rising medical costs forced the company to seek state permission to raise premiums so aggressively on the plans in question. She said the company spent $1.27 on health care last year for every dollar in premiums it took in for those customers. The company says it lost $99 million on those customers in the past two years.\n\nShe said about 10 percentage points of the increase stem from the costs of a single, extremely complicated patient who is receiving $1 million per month worth of care for a severe genetic disorder.\n\nJackson noted many insurers nationally are planning large premium increases, for similar reasons. About two-thirds of the costs are for treatment of chronic diseases, many of which are preventable, she said. Many of the problems are related to factors such as smoking, unhealthful eating and lack of exercise. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot of lifestyle, with a little bit of genetics thrown in,\u201d she said.\n\nMedica, a much smaller health insurance carrier, is seeking an increase of nearly 20 percent on individual policies in Iowa. A spokesman declined to say how many Iowans would be affected. Coventry, which also sells individual health insurance plans in Iowa, declined to comment on how much it plans to increase premiums next year. The companies had to file their proposals with the state insurance division by Wednesday, but the division is not yet releasing the information publicly.\n\nGary Claxton, a vice president for the Kaiser Family Foundation, noted that many of the Wellmark customers in question could receive federal subsidies to help them pay premiums in 2017. Wellmark in the past has declined to offer policies that qualify for the Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are tied to consumers\u2019 income. But the company will offer such policies for 2017. Claxton said even with the premium increase, some of the customers might wind up spending less on health insurance next year because of the change.\n\nClaxton, whose foundation studies health care issues, said it\u2019s too soon to tell whether Wellmark\u2019s proposed increases will be in line with others nationally. But he said some carriers are having to dramatically increase prices to correct for underestimating the cost of new customers, including those who previously couldn\u2019t get insurance because they had pre-existing health problems. Because of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, insurers are no longer allowed to deny coverage or charge more based on such conditions.\n\nClaxton added that part of the reason for premium increases this year is the federal government is phasing out assistance for carriers that took on risky customers under the Affordable Care Act. He said rates should stabilize as the market adjusts to the new conditions.\n\nThe proposed premium increases filed this week need approval from State Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart, who plans to hold a hearing July 23. Wellmark's Jackson testified at a similar hearing last year. \u201cI\u2019ll just be blunt: Rate increases stink,\u201d she said then. \u201cThey do. And it is not something that any of us take in a light-hearted fashion.\u201d\n\nAfter last summer\u2019s hearing, Gerhart approved increases of 18 percent to nearly 29 percent for individual Wellmark customers. He expressed sympathy with consumers\u2019 complaints, but noted independent experts determined the increases were needed to cover rising health care costs.\n\nWellmark officials stress that they're continuing to try to rein in costs, including those due to overuse of tests, treatments and medications. For example, the company is announcing this week that it will offer a new \u201cBlue Simplicity\u201d option, which will encourage consumers to consider costs of care by having clear co-payments for services.\n\nThe set co-payments, which could range from $35 for a standard doctor\u2019s office visit to $4,500 for a hospitalization, are designed to let customers know exactly how much they\u2019ll be expected to pay before they undergo tests or treatment. In most current plans, Jackson said, many customers are stunned to learn after treatment that they\u2019re on the hook for hundreds or thousands of dollars. Their current out-of-pocket charges are often based on \u201cco-insurance,\u201d which is figured as a percent of what clinics and hospitals charge.\n\n\u201cThe whole goal was to make these simpler,\u201d she said of the new plans. \u201cThere\u2019s no math required.\u201d Once customers reached an annual out-of-pocket maximum, say $6,000, the insurance company would cover all additional costs.\n\nThe new plans also will set copay levels for medications based on how cost-effective they are, Jackson said. Ones that are highly effective could cost consumers little or nothing, even if they cost Wellmark a lot, she said. For example, a hepatitis drug that costs thousands of dollars but cures the disease could draw small copays. But copays in the hundreds of dollars could be charged for drugs that the company\u2019s experts see as ineffective, such as new classes of high blood-pressure medications.\n\nWellmark also is announcing this week that it has formed new insurance companies to offer policies in partnership with the Des Moines-based Mercy Health System and the University of Health System in eastern Iowa. Those plans will cost a bit less than other Wellmark products, but will require participants to get most of their health care from either Mercy or the UI-affiliated providers. Organizers hope those plans will lead to better coordination of care, which could improve outcomes and save money.\n\nWellmark and other insurers have tried numerous approaches to encourage members to live more healthful lives and consider the cost and value of medical treatments. Jackson said she wishes those efforts had prevented the need to keep raising premiums. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you want to stop trying, but it\u2019s definitely disappointing,\u201d she said.\n\nJackson said trends related to the Affordable Care Act have contributed to the cost increases but are not the main cause. For example, she said, people now have more freedom to buy insurance after they become seriously ill, then drop the coverage after being treated. Although the law now requires most people to have continuous coverage, the penalties aren\u2019t strong enough to prevent people from gaming the system, she said. She also cited fast-rising costs of prescription drugs, including \u201cspecialty drugs\u201d for such conditions as hemophilia and multiple sclerosis.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/27hgarx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The steep premium rises would affect people who bought individual policies in recent years.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "The steep premium rises would affect people who bought individual policies in recent years.", "title": "Wellmark plans 38% to 43% increases for some customers", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2016/05/12/wellmark-plans-38-to-43-increases-some-customers/84277758/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The steep premium rises would affect people who bought individual policies in recent years.", "title": "Wellmark plans 38% to 43% increases for some customers", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44224f5f0693afc905a5e6496f73a3b8b5190d16/c=40-0-280-240&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Insurance industry", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Insurance industry", "title": "Wellmark plans 38% to 43% increases for some customers", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3758d96facd4f719770352cb4aecabcd2314f9b2/c=70-0-250-240/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/80895fe4bbcd15d5ab1503ba862b9cc6f16fb435/c=40-0-280-240/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/361593a8f469527a579a5d5c1aed9a1efebd314e/c=0-0-320-240/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ca279bd746624fe3d7650b89e93360733a876d1/c=0-30-320-210&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-12T14:06:04.443000-05:00", "shorthed": "Wellmark plans 43% increases for some", "articleid": 84277758, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9fabdbb4e71f847f2d443c07f31bc8951d7e48af/c=0-30-320-210/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b53f8026c8841a9563b41fb2623239b2397abd9/c=92-0-227-240/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Another 90,000 Wellmark customers who hold older individual insurance plans are expected to face smaller increases, which will be announced in June.\nThe increases being proposed this week also don\u2019t affect the hundreds of thousands of Wellmark customers who obtain coverage via their employers.\nCoventry, which also sells individual health insurance plans in Iowa, declined to comment on how much it plans to increase premiums next year.\nOnes that are highly effective could cost consumers little or nothing, even if they cost Wellmark a lot, she said.\nWellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield is sending letters this week telling about 30,000 customers it plans to raise their premiums by 38 percent to 43 percent next year."}
