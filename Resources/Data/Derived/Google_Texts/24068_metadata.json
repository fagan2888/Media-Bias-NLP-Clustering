Roosevelt, who turns 70 next month, will be succeeded by Thomas A. Croswell, president and chief operating officer of Tufts Health, who will become CEO in January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are at the top of our game,\u201d said Roosevelt, who will stay on as a full-time adviser for six months, then work as a part-time consultant. \u201cWe\u2019re at a membership high, we\u2019re expanding regionally . . . We are very financially sound.\u201d\n\nAs chief executive, Roosevelt oversaw expansion of the nonprofit insurer\u2019s membership to more than 1 million from less than 600,000, Tufts Health said. He also led the insurer\u2019s expansion in Rhode Island and New Hampshire and spearheaded the acquisition of Network Health, an insurer that serves low-income families and individuals.\n\nTufts Health, which last year earned an operating profit of $7.1 million on revenue of $4.3 billion, is the state\u2019s third-largest commercial health insurer, after Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.\n\nRoosevelt said that cost containment remains a major challenge for the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all still dealing with the cost of the transition to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said, referring to the federal law also known as Obamacare, which has imposed new taxes on health insurers. \u201cWe\u2019re all standing by for a possible resurgence in medical costs, particularly the skyrocketing cost of pharmaceuticals.\u201d Government estimates show that health care spending is accelerating, in part because of higher costs of prescription drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoosevelt, a lawyer by training, previously worked as a top official at the Social Security Administration \u2014 a program founded by his grandfather, President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nRoosevelt cochairs the Democratic National Committee\u2019s rules and bylaws committee and said he plans to stay involved in politics. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1986 in a crowded Democratic primary that was won by former US representative Joseph P. Kennedy II.\n\nHe arrived at Tufts in 1999 as senior vice president and general counsel and was promoted to chief executive six years later. In 2011, Roosevelt explored a merger with Harvard Pilgrim, but the deal never panned out.\n\nIn 2013, he earned $2.3 million in salary, retirement benefits, and other compensation, according to tax filings.\n\nHealth care executives who know Roosevelt described him as someone who is well-liked, understands the issues, and can build consensus.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s almost like a professor. He\u2019s very knowledgeable about health policy. He has a long view,\u201d said Dr. David Torchiana, chief executive of Partners HealthCare. \u201cHe\u2019s easy to talk to, even though he has a famous family name.\u201d\n\nAcross the table from hospital executives, he is a deft negotiator, said Jeanette G. Clough, chief executive of Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge.\n\nRoosevelt \u201ctries to understand where you\u2019re coming from,\u201d she said. \u201cThat always makes for a better outcome, when both sides can walk in the shoes of the other.\u201d\n\nAs a past board chairman of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, he had \u201ca really uncanny ability to hear all sides and find a reasonable middle ground,\u201d said Lora M. Pellegrini, chief executive of the trade group.\n\n\u201cHe really is a true statesmen in every fashion of the word,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he talks, people listen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.744249485", "eomportal-id": 103897, "description": "Roosevelt, who turns 70 next month, will step down after 16 years with the insurer, including the last 10 as chief executive.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"city": "Watertown", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Roosevelt, who turns 70 next month, will step down after 16 years with the insurer, including the last 10 as chief executive.", "title": "James Roosevelt, CEO of Tufts Health, to retire - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/10/14/james-roosevelt-ceo-tufts-health-retire/xMnw6GbCxO6OtjCQ1eDtgM/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/10/14/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/kreiter_roundtable14_biz.jpg", "longitude": "-71.18283209999998", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3709299", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "James Roosevelt Jr.,Tufts Health Plan,retiring,health insurance,health care, James Jr Roosevelt, Franklin Delano  Roosevelt, Joseph P II  Kennedy,Social Security Administration, Senate", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 04:00:34 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "James Roosevelt Jr.,Tufts Health Plan,retiring,health insurance,health care, James Jr Roosevelt, Franklin Delano  Roosevelt, Joseph P II  Kennedy,Social Security Administration, Senate,House of Representatives, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "98efbcfa-72a2-11e5-a143-483e5f3b6608"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9816\"", "article_summary": "The chief executive of Watertown-based Tufts Health Plan is stepping down after 16 years with the insurer, including the last 10 as chief executive.\nJames Roosevelt Jr., one of thelongest reigning health care executives in Massachusetts, will retire at the end of the year.\nRoosevelt, who turns 70 next month, will be succeeded by Thomas A.
