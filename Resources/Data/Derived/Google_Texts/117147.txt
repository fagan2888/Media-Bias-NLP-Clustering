More than likely, if you’re a gal that likes to shop at Target and spends nearly a half an hour perusing through the makeup aisle, then you’ve come across beauty guru and renowned makeup artist Sonia Kashuk’s amazing makeup collection, which includes brushes, too.

Known for curating high quality, performance-based makeup formulas that are luxurious yet affordable, Kashuk is expanding her empire to include skincare this fall. “Skin care is such an integral part of a beauty regimen because great makeup starts with great skin,” she explains.

The forthcoming collection titled “Skin,” boasts of three skincare products: a Resurface Gentle Exfoliating Wash ($15), a microbead-free wash that uses hard-shelled algae to polish away dead skin cells, a Renew Micro Exfoliating Toner ($15), a gentle toning exfoliator with willow bark extract, aloe vera and Vitamin C to cleanse and protect skin, and lastly a Detox Purifying Black Mask ($16), a clay-based mask full of alpha-hydroxy acids to fight anti-aging as well as aloe vera, calendula flower and chamomile extracts to soothe and moisturize.

And if you happen to love the skincare line, then you’ll be in for a treat come November when Kashuk reveals more products. “We are always working on something new!” she divulged. Teaser, ladies: unlike other oil-based cleansers, Kashuk’s Dissolve Gel to Oil Makeup Removing Cleanser ($15) will melt away makeup, debris and other impurities with a simple swipe as it transforms from gel to oil in seconds.

Kashuk’s new line will be available this Sunday (Aug. 24) at both Target and Target.com.
