In a 2006 column, Krugman argued that the system was, \u201cone of the best-kept secrets in the American policy debate.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cpundits and policy makers don't talk about the veterans' system because they can't handle the cognitive dissonance. ... For the lesson of the V.H.A.'s success story -- that a government agency can deliver better care at lower cost than the private sector -- runs completely counter to the pro-privatization, anti-government conventional wisdom that dominates today's Washington.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Krugman wrote a column blasting Mitt Romney after the Republican presidential candidate called for partially privatizing the system. \u201cWhat Mr. Romney and everyone else should know is that the V.H.A. is a huge policy success story, which offers important lessons for future health reform,\u201d he wrote.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

Longman, in a 2005 article for the Washington Monthly that led to the book, wrote, \u201cIt turns out that precisely because the VHA is a big, government-run system that has nearly a lifetime relationship with its patients, it has incentives for investing in quality and keeping its patients well--incentives that are lacking in for-profit medicine.\u201d\n\nThe description of the system offered by liberals stands in stark contrast to the horrifying reality depicted in recent reports on how the veterans' health care system has neglected patients and covered up wait times \u2013 at a deadly cost.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported in February that backlogged orders for medical care were being mass purged at hospitals in Los Angeles and Dallas to make wait times seem less than they really were.\n\nLast month, CNN reported that at least 40 veterans had died waiting for treatment at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs medical system, and that many were put on a \u201csecret waiting list\u201d to mask the fact that 1,400 to 1,600 veterans had to wait months for doctors.\n\nEarlier this month, the Examiner's Mark Flatten also reported on patients in Texas who had trouble getting colonoscopies. \u201cBy the time that you do the colonoscopies on these patients, you went from a stage 1 to a stage 4 [colorectal cancer], which is basically inoperable,\u201d Dr. Richard Krugman, a former associate chief of staff at the Veterans Affairs health care system based in Harlingen, Texas, said in an interview.\n\nA Los Angeles Times investigation found that the problems with the system were widespread. Though the VA has touted improved wait times, the article quoted Dr. Jose Mathews, chief of psychiatry at the VA St. Louis Health Care System, as saying, \u201cThe performance data the VA puts out is garbage -- it's designed to make the VA look good on paper.\u201d\n\nLast September, I spent time in England researching the socialized British medical system, the National Health Service, for the Examiner's magazine edition, and encountered similar stories - of patient neglect and an unaccountable bureaucracy focused on gaming the system so they could claim to be meeting targets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a scandal involving long delays at Veterans Affairs hospitals mounts, it's worth recalling that liberals have long touted the socialized medical system as evidence that government-run health care can work.\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman has penned several valentines to the Veterans Health Administration over the years.
