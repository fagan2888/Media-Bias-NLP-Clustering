Before that, she thought she had actually semi-retired from Free Clinic of the New River Valley on July 30 There, she was director of programs, and then director of Patient and Volunteer Relations for almost five years.\n\n\u201cWhen this position became available, it was a great match for what I was looking for: It was in town (no more driving), close to my family, especially to my new grandson, and I was able to help my community once again.\n\nDebbie replaces Gary Elander, who recently retired after serving as director for nine years.\n\nDebbie grew up in Pulaski. She attended Pulaski County High School, New River Community College and Virginia Tech. Her first job out of college was teaching reading and English at Pulaski Middle School. She knew she wanted to return home and finish out her professional life in Pulaski.\n\nBefore working at the Free Clinic of the New River Valley, she was the physician recruiter and volunteer coordinator at Pulaski Community Hospital. She reflects, \u201cIt was a privilege to recruit physicians to our community and showcase the beauty of our area. Bringing qualified physicians to our area was important to our hospital, our patients and to our community.\n\n\u201cNow, I have more direct connection with the patients and actually see the positive outcome of the patient\u2019s medical treatment. It is awesome to see our physicians treat the free clinic patients in their offices and give them the excellent care they deserve. It is great to be back working with some of the physicians I actually recruited and see their desire in helping the clinic patients. I feel I have come full circle!\u201d\n\nThe clinic has a staff of six part time employees. \u201cThe clinic staff really cares about the patients and wants to see them succeed in overcoming any medical issues they may have,\u201d she said. \u201cOur patients are wonderful people who are hard working, good hearted folks. They just do not have health insurance and that is really scary.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI have seen patients who have put off seeing a physician for years. Then when they do finally decide to come in, they have several health concerns, which are compounded by not taking care of themselves earlier.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what she sees as the future of the clinic in light of the Affordable Care Act she responded, \u201cWell now that just depends on what day it is! Seriously, the free clinics of Virginia will remain if we have people in the community to donate their time, talent and money.\n\n\u201cThere will always be a segment of the population that will be uninsured. We are a private nonprofit organization that depends on grants, foundations, civic organizations and local governments to help meet our financial needs. We are determined to be here for our uninsured population\u201d.\n\nSuddarth suggested anyone interested in volunteering, whether it is a lay or professional volunteer, contact her at her office at 980-0922. She would also be happy to provide clinic tours and explain the work of the clinic to any individual or group interested in seeing the clinic.\n\n\u201cPeople need to take an interest in the clinic, be concerned for their uninsured neighbors, and get involved in this work. It\u2019s rewarding to help, but it\u2019s also satisfying to think you can make a difference in someone\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the saying, \u2018When you have your health, you have everything.\u2019 Just ask our patients,\u201d she said. \u201cI only ask for three hours per week to volunteer or any amount of monetary donation is greatly appreciated.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe are so fortunate to have this wonderful large building where we can see and treat patients of Pulaski County. I consider it an honor to work for our patients as hard as I can to make sure this clinic remains open for another 30 years.\u201d\n\nDebbie and her husband Bob, who also works in health care at LewisGale Hospital \u2013 Pulaski, reside in the town of Pulaski, where they have lived for the past 10 years.\n\nWritten by: Editor on November 26, 2013.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 1452308658361000}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36fd\"", "article_summary": "Clinic of Pulaski County names new director\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be back in my home town,\u201d said Debbie Suddarth, new executive director of the Free Clinic of Pulaski County.\nBefore working at the Free Clinic of the New River Valley, she was the physician recruiter and volunteer coordinator at Pulaski Community Hospital.\nIt is awesome to see our physicians treat the free clinic patients in their offices and give them the excellent care they deserve.\nIt is great to be back working with some of the physicians I actually recruited and see their desire in helping the clinic patients.\nShe would also be happy to provide clinic tours and explain the work of the clinic to any individual or group interested in seeing the clinic."}
