Following IOC vote defeats in 2005 and 2009 as separate sports, baseball and softball have merged into a single confederation as it competes against wrestling and squash for a single spot on the 2020 Olympic program, which will be decided by a Sept. 8 vote in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a partnership that could work together and use the attributes of both of our sports,\u201d said Don Porter, the American co-president of the World Baseball Softball Confederation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an awful lot of young female athletes all over the world that are playing our sport and there\u2019s a commercial side that baseball has that really strengthens our bid,\u201d Porter added. \u201cSo if we put it together it\u2019s a very strong added value to the Olympic program.\u201d\n\nThe biggest obstacle to the bid is its failure to guarantee the presence of Major League Baseball players. MLB commissioner Bud Selig has said the season won\u2019t be stopped to free players for the Olympics, but the confederation points out that there is plenty of room for negotiations \u2014 seven years \u2014 if it makes the cut.\n\n\u201cWe never asked MLB to stop the season,\u201d said Riccardo Fraccari, the Italian co-president of the confederation.\n\nThe bid proposes separate men\u2019s baseball and women\u2019s softball events of eight teams each, played as back-to-back six-day tournaments. That\u2019s a slightly different format from when baseball and softball were last played at the Olympics, at the 2008 Beijing Games. Baseball gained full medal status at the 1992 Barcelona Games and softball followed four years later in Atlanta. But both were dropped from the 2012 program in a 2005 vote. As things stand now, Fraccari is hoping some MLB players would come even if MLB doesn\u2019t stop.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s precisely why we chose such a short program \u2014 to permit all pros who want to come to do so,\u201d Fraccari said. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t apply only to MLB players but to players in all the major professional leagues around the world.\u201d\n\nBut as New York Yankees outfielder Ichiro Suzuki \u2014 who recently passed the 4,000-hit mark in a career split between Japan and MLB \u2014 pointed out, baseball already has a successful international tournament for pros with the World Baseball Classic. While supporting the Olympic bid, he suggested it should be strictly for amateurs.\n\n\u201cThey really need to make that division of amateurs to professionals,\u201d Suzuki said through an interpreter. \u201cSome countries are going to have all amateurs, some countries are going to have few. Some teams can then say, \u2018Well, we lost because we didn\u2019t have any of our professionals in that game.\u2019 So they just need to make it clear: amateurs are going to be here, professionals play in the WBC.\u201d\n\nPitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu, who is in the middle of a breakout season with the Los Angeles Dodgers and helped South Korea to gold in Beijing, favors a more open approach.\n\n\u201cEach country should decide on that,\u201d Ryu said of the pros vs. amateurs debate.\n\nAnd there are plenty of countries to decide, with baseball a top sport in the Americas and throughout much of Asia. It\u2019s growing in Europe, too, as evidenced by strong performances from the Netherlands and Italy at this year\u2019s Classic. And while softball\u2019s epicenter remains the United States, which swept gold at the first three Olympic tournaments, Japan won in Beijing and Australia took home medals from all four Olympic tournaments.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that baseball and softball brings to the table and where it can help out the Olympic Games is the sheer size of the market and the sheer size of the number of boys and girls at the youth level that play the sport,\u201d said Michele Smith, who played on two of the American teams that won softball gold and also pitched professionally in Japan for 16 years.\n\nAnother obstacle for previous bids was baseball\u2019s failure to crack down on doping. That changed earlier this month when 13 players, including four All-Stars, were suspended for their involvement in the Biogenesis drug case.\n\n\u201cMLB is working hard to get it out of their sport and we commend them for that,\u201d Porter said. Still, baseball and softball officials realize that wrestling, with a tradition dating to the ancient Olympics, is the favorite.\n\n\u201cBut we still think it\u2019s open,\u201d Porter said.\n\nAnd if Tokyo is chosen as the 2020 Games host the day before the sport vote, all the better. As Fraccari noted, \u201cHaving their national sport in the Olympics would be special.\u201d\n\nA look at the three sports in contention for one spot in the 2020 Olympics (IOC vote to be held Sept. 8 in Buenos Aires, Argentina):\n\nBASEBALL-SOFTBALL\n\nOlympic history: Baseball \u2014 exhibition or demonstration sport seven times; medal sport in 5 Olympics (1992, \u201896, 2000, \u201804, \u201808). Softball \u2014 in 4 Olympics (1996, 2000, \u201804, \u201808). Both voted out by IOC in 2005 after 2008 Games. Failed in separate bids for reinstatement.\n\nFederation: World Baseball Softball Confederation.\n\nBid leaders: Riccardo Fraccari (baseball) & Don Porter (softball).\n\nBid plans: International baseball and softball federations merged this year to improve Olympic chances; separate men\u2019s baseball and women\u2019s softball tournaments of eight teams each; played as back-to-back six-day tournaments at a single venue.\n\nPros: Baseball hugely popular in parts of Asia and Latin America; softball would bring women\u2019s sport back to games; no other bat-and-ball sport in the Olympics; Olympics is pinnacle for women\u2019s softball players; perseverance of both sports in seeking Olympic return. Cons: Baseball criticized for not delivering top major leaguers to the Olympics; MLB won\u2019t stop the season to free players for the games; high-profile doping scandals in baseball; Olympics not the ultimate goal for baseball players; both sports lack support and popularity in Europe.\n\nQuote: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of young girls and boys out there who want to get their Olympic dreams back.\u201d \u2014 Don Porter.\n\nChances: Likely headed for another strikeout.\n\nWebsite: www.PlayBall2020.com.\n\nSQUASH\n\nOlympic history: None. Just missed out on Olympic inclusion for 2012 and 2016.\n\nFederation: World Squash Federation.\n\nBid leader: M. Ramachandran.\n\nBid plans: Men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments, each of 32 players, played over five days. Matches played in two glass courts. Video review for refereeing decisions; replays on giant screens.\n\nPros: All five continents have produced men\u2019s and women\u2019s world champions; bid supported by tennis greats Roger Federer and Andre Agassi; squash played in other major multi-sports events (Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, Pan American Games); Olympics would be peak for squash athletes; clean doping record. Cons: Olympics already has three racket sports (tennis, badminton and table tennis); questions over how spectator- and TV-friendly sport would be; sport\u2019s elitist image; questions over how universal sport truly is.\n\nQuote: \u201cThe last time ... we had not changed our sport to suit the standards of the IOC. Now we have done that. We have spoken to the IOC. We have improved our sport and the result is there for everybody to see.\u201d \u2014 M. Ramachandran.\n\nChances: Once the favorite, now maybe a stroke too far.\n\nWebsite: http://squash2020.com/\n\nWRESTLING\n\nOlympic history: Dates back to ancient Olympics. Either Greco-Roman or freestyle wrestling or both have been in every modern Olympics except 1900. Surprisingly dropped from 2020 Games in February but made shortlist in May for possible inclusion.\n\nFederation: International Wrestling Federation.\n\nBid leader: Nenad Lalovic.\n\nBid plans: FILA changed leadership, with Lalovic replacing Raphael Martinetti, and adopted new fan-friendly rules after IOC snub. Scoring system simplified to reward attacking tactics. Women\u2019s medal classes to be increased.\n\nPros: Feeling that wrestling never should have been dropped in first place; FILA reacted well by making wholesale changes to improve the federation and sport; one of the most traditional of all Olympic sports; dynamic new leader in Lalovic; heavyweight backing of U.S., Russia, Japan, Iran and other countries. Cons: Inclusion would rule out addition of new sport; bringing back wrestling would mark IOC flip-flop; scoring rules difficult for average fan to understand.\n\nQuote: \u201cWe had the strength to change. We made mistakes in the past for sure. Now we are looking forward. We don\u2019t look back.\u201d \u2014 Nenad Lalovic.\n\nChances: A virtual lock.\n\nWebsite: http://www.fila-official.com/", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Sports, ANDREW DAMPF, Bud Selig, Don Porter, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Ichiro Suzuki, Michele Smith, MLB, Nenad Lalovic, Olympics, Riccardo Fraccari, the 2020 Olympics, the Olympic games, the Olympics, the World Baseball Classic, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Local, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "ROME - After striking out twice, baseball and softball officials are counting on a combined bid to get back into the Olympics.", "title": "Baseball-softball join together for Olympic bid", "url": "http://juneauempire.com/sports/2013-09-01/baseball-softball-join-together-olympic-bid", "image": "http://juneauempire.com/sites/default/files/12580096.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Find the latest news, crime, weather, business and community information from juneauempire.com and the Juneau Empire."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcecce\"", "article_summary": "As things stand now, Fraccari is hoping some MLB players would come even if MLB doesn\u2019t stop.\nThe bid proposes separate men\u2019s baseball and women\u2019s softball events of eight teams each, played as back-to-back six-day tournaments.\n\u201cWe wanted a partnership that could work together and use the attributes of both of our sports,\u201d said Don Porter, the American co-president of the World Baseball Softball Confederation.\nFederation: World Baseball Softball Confederation.\nThat\u2019s a slightly different format from when baseball and softball were last played at the Olympics, at the 2008 Beijing Games."}
