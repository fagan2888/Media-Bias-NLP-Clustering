Well, there may be some scientific truth to that.\n\nSealy UK surveyed 1,000 people and found those who sleep on the right side of the bed are 7 percent more likely to wake up grumpy in the morning than those who sleep on the left side. They're also 3 percent more likely to not like their job.\n\nBut the people who slept on the left side were 9.5 percent more likely to have a good outlook on life and 8 percent more likely to enjoy their job and have good friends.\n\nA sleep expert at Sealy UK said, \"While the margins are small, the research certainly highlights an interesting trend.\"\n\nIn 2011, a different survey of 3,000 adults had similar findings.\n\nSo if you're the kind of person who wakes up grumpier than the Grinch, maybe you should switch sides of the bed.\n\nAlthough, that may be easier said than done. In February, yet another survey concluded 40 percent of Americans have always slept on their chosen side of the bed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A survey in the U.K. found people who slept on the left side of the bed had extra pep in their step and those who slept on the right were grumpier.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "A survey in the U.K. found people who slept on the left side of the bed had extra pep in their step and those who slept on the right were grumpier.", "title": "You Really Can Get Up On The Wrong Side Of The Bed", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/you-really-can-get-up-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-bed/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1448299027.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A survey in the U.K. found people who slept on the left side of the bed had extra pep in their step and those who slept on the right were grumpier.", "title": "You Really Can Get Up On The Wrong Side Of The Bed", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/you-really-can-get-up-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-bed/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1448299027.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=ltMG4yeTqefC6gqgMMNVunDFIzXx9xZ0&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://53909", "iphone": "newsy://53909", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://53909", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "keywords": "newsy,newsy trending,side of the bed,sleep on what side of the bed,which side of the bed should you sleep on,right side of the bed,left side of the bed,what is the right side of the bed,sealy,sealy uk,sleep news,health news,the left side of the bed is the right side,the right side of the bed is the left side", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1448299027.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Have you ever been told you woke up on the wrong side of the bed?\nIn February, yet another survey concluded 40 percent of Americans have always slept on their chosen side of the bed.\nSo if you're the kind of person who wakes up grumpier than the Grinch, maybe you should switch sides of the bed.\nA survey in the U.K. found people who slept on the left side of the bed had extra pep in their step and those who slept on the right were grumpier.\nA sleep expert at Sealy UK said, \"While the margins are small, the research certainly highlights an interesting trend.\""}
