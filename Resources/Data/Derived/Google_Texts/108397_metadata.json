The car\u2019s top was down and the passenger sometimes waved at other motorists or stood up and danced.\n\nThe car also clipped another vehicle and rolled through populated crosswalks.\n\nIn Hollywood, the car sped past the famous Walk of Fame and TCL Chinese Theatre, stopping to turn in sharp circles and forcing heavy traffic to a stop.\n\nThe Mustang finally stopped in front of a home in South Los Angeles, where the driver got out and sat on the hood. A crowd gathered and exchanged hugs and high-fives with the men, who took selfies as they calmly waited for deputies to arrive and handcuff them.\n\nThey were arrested on suspicion of burglary. Reynolds, 20, remained jailed Saturday on $50,000 bail and Isaiah Young, 19, was being held on $80,000 bail. It was unclear whether they had retained lawyers.\n\nReynolds had three speeding tickets from 2013 to 2015 and twice had his driver\u2019s license suspended, the Times said, citing state Department of Motor Vehicle records. He was charged with reckless driving last year but the charge was dismissed, the paper said.\n\nBoth men lived in the neighborhood where they stopped. Neighbors described them as good-humored, friendly and polite. People crowded around to talk to the men after they stopped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here 22 years and never seen that many people in the street,\u201d Carla McKing said with a laugh. \u201cEveryone knew who they were in the convertible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the world is wrong with these boys,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cThey just made a bad choice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A driver who led authorities on a wild chase through Los Angeles that included making \"doughnuts\" on Hollywood Boulevard had Marine tactical driver training along with speeding tickets and license suspensions, records show.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/9/motorist-in-wild-la-chase-had-marine-driver-traini/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A driver who led authorities on a wild chase through Los Angeles that included making \u201cdoughnuts\u201d on Hollywood Boulevard had Marine tactical driver training along with speeding tickets and license suspensions, records show.", "title": "Motorist in wild chase had Marine driver training"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A driver who led authorities on a wild chase through Los Angeles that included making \"doughnuts\" on Hollywood Boulevard had Marine tactical driver training along with speeding tickets and license sus", "card": "summary", "title": "Motorist in wild chase had Marine driver training"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - A driver who led authorities on a wild chase through Los Angeles that included making \u201cdoughnuts\u201d on Hollywood Boulevard had Marine tactical driver training along with speeding tickets and license suspensions, records show.\nThe Mustang finally stopped in front of a home in South Los Angeles, where the driver got out and sat on the hood.\nHe was not deployed overseas but held the National Defense Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, records show.\nReynolds had three speeding tickets from 2013 to 2015 and twice had his driver\u2019s license suspended, the Times said, citing state Department of Motor Vehicle records.\n\u201cEveryone knew who they were in the convertible.\u201d\u201cWhat in the world is wrong with these boys,\u201d she told the Times."}
