The troubled kid, the killer band, the fame, the ambivalence, the shotgun, the end? Brett Morgen\u2019s Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck tells this tale one more time, but in a sleek new way, without the usual documentary signposts. Drummer Dave Grohl simply appears on the scene, unheralded by date or name. Pat Smear arrives. Courtney Love barrels in. Scribbled on a note we see only a phone number for Geffen Records, which would become the band\u2019s big-time home. A resolute impressionism prevails.\n\nWhat\u2019s really new about this powerful film, assembled over the course of eight years, is the way that it conjures Cobain\u2019s full presence\u2014his conflicting dreams and resentments, loves and fears. He seems to stand (and leap and fall and crawl) before us, and it\u2019s a mesmerizing sight.\n\nDirector Brett Morgen (The Kid Stays in the Picture) says that Love gave him unhampered access to a trove of previously unseen home movies, handwritten journals, drawings, voice recordings and work tapes (one of them a hallucinatory sound-collage that Cobain titled \u201cMontage of Heck\u201d). There\u2019s grainy, exciting footage of early rehearsals, sound checks and concerts, and the music comes roaring off the screen. Morgen also made the risky decision to illustrate some of the audio material with animated sequences (most strikingly over Cobain\u2019s recounting of an early suicide attempt). These passages, created by artists Hisko Hulsing and Stefan Nadelman, have a supple graphic-novel expertise that meshes beautifully with the stories we\u2019re hearing. They\u2019re a small triumph in themselves.\n\nThe course of Cobain\u2019s short life was famously prefigured by his unhappy childhood. We see him as a baby in the late 1960s, then as a little kid banging on drums and toy pianos, and soon discovering the joys of punk rock and pot (the beginning of his self-medication for the gastric pain that plagued him throughout his life). At the age of nine he is unmoored by his parents\u2019 divorce and subsequent rejection of their son (they farmed him out to relatives). This dismissal planted a seed of anger in Cobain that sprouted intermittently throughout his life. \u201cIf he ever felt humiliated,\u201d says bassist Krist Novoselic, now balding and contemplative, \u201cthen you\u2019d see the rage come out.\u201d (Unfortunately missing from the film is commentary by Grohl, whose schedule precluded his sitting for an interview until after the picture was locked\u2014an unfortunate muffed connection that could be rectified on a future DVD.)\n\nAt home with Love and their baby daughter, Frances Bean (one of the film\u2019s producers), Cobain is a different man, doting and affectionate even when he appears to be on the verge of a heroin nod (\u201cI\u2019m not on drugs, I\u2019m tired,\u201d he insists). And Love, often reviled as \u201cthe most hated woman in America\u201d (as she acknowledges at one point), comes across as an abrasive but entertaining eccentric. She isn\u2019t whitewashed, though, even by herself. In one latter-day interview, she admits a passing temptation to cheat on the adoring Cobain (she didn\u2019t), and says that he sensed it: \u201cHe took 66 Rohypnols and went into a coma.\u201d\n\nMorgen is admirably generous in allotting space for the music Cobain made with Nirvana, allowing much of it to play out at length. There\u2019s a lot of it, too, ranging from familiar tracks (\u201cLithium,\u201d \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit,\u201d selections from the famous MTV Unplugged performance, taped very near the end), to fascinating obscurities like Cobain\u2019s solo home recording of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cAnd I Love Her.\u201d The music still resounds, undimmed by age\u2014it has lost none of its bite and its furious impact. Unlike its bedeviled creator, it\u2019s very much alive.\n\n(Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck opens in some theaters this weekend. It debuts on HBO on May 4.)\n\nThe Room\n\nIn the pantheon of shitty movies, Tommy Wiseau\u2019s The Room has risen to preeminence. The picture is an unforgettable collision of demented ambition and utter incompetence, and 12 years after its initial release, it now sustains a cult that gathers at midnight screenings to jeer and howl at the picture\u2019s seamless absurdity.\n\nThe Room would have been a perfect object of derision on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Unfortunately, that beloved Z-movie cable series went off the air in 1999, four years before Wiseau\u2019s masterwork lurched onto the scene. But three members of the MST3K crew\u2014Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett\u2014still do business as a company called RiffTrax, selling pre-recorded commentaries to be played in tandem with bad movies that you have to rent yourself. And last week, as part of the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, they took over a downtown theatre for a live skewering of The Room that was entirely MST-worthy. On May 6, they\u2019ll be repeating this demolition and beaming it out to 650 theatres around the country. This is worth noting.\n\nA key element of the truly bad movie is a complete ignorance of its manifest awfulness. Pictures like Sharknado and Zombeavers are bad, it\u2019s true, but intentionally so, which kills the fun\u2014the on-the-nose titles eliminate the need to actually see the films. On the other hand, an unintentionally dreadful movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate\u2014a MST3K classic\u2014can only be endured in conjunction with rude robot wisecracks. Seen in unenhanced form, it\u2019s excruciatingly dull.\n\nWhat puts The Room in a class of its own is its overabundant idiocy. While you\u2019re still gasping at one of the film\u2019s moronic lines or vagrant plot knots, another one rises up to smack you in the head. The acting is deplorable, the story barely worthy of the name, the impoverished sets a celebration of what-the-hell. Wiseau, a strange-looking man who wrote, directed and produced this thing, gives himself a couple of sex scenes that provoke real horror. (Contemplating his lumpy, shirtless torso, one of the MST lads wondered if it was made out of Madonna\u2019s arms.)\n\nThe Room can be enjoyed, after a fashion, on its own. But Nelson, Murphy, and Corbett bring it down to a jaw-dropping new level. Tickets for their May 6 evisceration can be purchased at the RiffTrax Website.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Also: MST3K vets lower the boom on The Room.", "title": "Movie Reviews: Nirvana Roars Again in Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/04/24/movie-reviews-nirvana-roars-again-in-kur", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14298232507198.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Also: MST3K vets lower the boom on The Room.", "creator": "@kurt_loder", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14298232507198.jpg", "title": "Movie Reviews: Nirvana Roars Again in <em>Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck</em>", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-04-24T13:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/kurt-loder"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde995\"", "article_summary": "Brett Morgen\u2019s Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck tells this tale one more time, but in a sleek new way, without the usual documentary signposts.\n(Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck opens in some theaters this weekend.\nHow many people can there be, Nirvana fans or not, who don\u2019t know at least a part of the Kurt Cobain story by now?\nScribbled on a note we see only a phone number for Geffen Records, which would become the band\u2019s big-time home.\nThis dismissal planted a seed of anger in Cobain that sprouted intermittently throughout his life."}
