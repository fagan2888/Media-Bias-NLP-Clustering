The bipartisan group, led by Ohio\u2019s Mike DeWine and New York\u2019s Eric Schneiderman, targeted five leading retailers that either do business as pharmacies or feature them in their stores: Walmart, Kroger, Safeway, Walgreens and Rite Aid all received a letter urging them to stop selling cigarettes in their stores. Combined they make up a significant portion of the $91.5 billion in overall cigarette sales nationally.\n\nNaturally, many of the signatories are grandstanding for their own purposes. Among them were Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden (Joe\u2019s son) and Maryland AG Doug Gansler, who\u2019s running for governor. Richer still, Washington AG Robert Ferguson is urging this cigarette ban despite his state having recently legalized marijuana. Two decades ago, their predecessors hounded tobacco companies directly, receiving a cash settlement supposedly earmarked for state tobacco cessation programs but in reality a windfall for the states' general funds.\n\nMoreover, Ohio\u2019s DeWine, a Republican, has long been an advocate of nanny statism, beginning while he was a United States senator backing the provision that mandated states standardize a lower blood-alcohol threshold or lose part of their federal highway funding. Now he\u2019s trying to dictate private affairs from a different position as a state official.\n\nWe\u2019re not advocating cigarette smoking, but sadly, this sort of government parenting is becoming all too common. When ObamaCare\u2019s legality was challenged in the Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia questioned whether Americans could be mandated to buy broccoli given the individual mandate to buy health insurance. His question was prescient, as we expect government to interfere more frequently in health issues now that it\u2019s paying the tab. We\u2019ll soon see if any of these large retailers buckle under the current pressure, but don\u2019t be surprised when pharmacies aren\u2019t allowed to accept ObamaCare payments unless they stop selling cigarettes. Consider this effort a smoke signal of the future intent to butt in.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attorneys general put pressure on pharmacies to stop selling cigarettes.", "csrf-token": "fBzhlnFjFW0bH46oIHDXiTLvqbMdtgAI6leirydf8EI=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Attorneys general put pressure on pharmacies to stop selling cigarettes.", "title": "Health State Butts in on Cigarettes", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/24232", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2014-03-21-4bafa5b0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Two decades ago, their predecessors hounded tobacco companies directly, receiving a cash settlement supposedly earmarked for state tobacco cessation programs but in reality a windfall for the states' general funds.\nRicher still, Washington AG Robert Ferguson is urging this cigarette ban despite his state having recently legalized marijuana.\nHis question was prescient, as we expect government to interfere more frequently in health issues now that it\u2019s paying the tab.\nNow he\u2019s trying to dictate private affairs from a different position as a state official.\nAmong them were Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden (Joe\u2019s son) and Maryland AG Doug Gansler, who\u2019s running for governor."}
