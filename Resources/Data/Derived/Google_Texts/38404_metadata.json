Photo: Christian Capurro\n\nFar Rainbow\n\nEmily Floyd\n\nHeide Museum of Modern Art\n\n7 Templestowe Rd, Bulleen\n\nUntil July 13\n\nEmily Floyd has a brilliant theme and a flawless technique. Her works are monumental, prolific and ambitious. They occupy space in a subtle way, both delicate and imposing. Her sculptures, wall objects and prints have a signature aesthetic presence in the same way that they have absorbing and sustaining subject matter.\n\nFloyd\u2019s exhibition at Heide effortlessly fills the enormous spaces but also has intimacy. Her vocabulary of simple geometric shapes reconciles a daunting modernist abstraction with the reassuring air of a nursery. The aesthetic comfort that she generates is congruent with her frame of reference, which is learning and teaching, especially in junior years.\n\nArtist/lecturer Emily Floyd. Photo: Chris Hopkins\n\nFloyd has a native gift for seamless manufacture and also a keen awareness of the pedagogical application of toys for learning. Her sculptures are often conceived as letterforms, suggesting that the elements could be rearranged to spell various words. Other works recall the imaginative and logical processes of putting blocks together toward an improvised purpose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNumerous works contain reflections on utopian educational theory that take you to fraught ideologies about minding children, organising labour and reforming gender relationships.\n\nMany works resemble posters and some reproduce archival records of social movements around childcare from the 1970s. An example reads like a manifesto, declaring that early childhood rearing should occur through collectives. It should not be left to private families, where traditional maternal roles are reinforced and female social inferiority is perpetuated.\n\nThis heroic epoch of radical thought has had some impact in educational practice, where alternative methods from the early 20th century - especially Steiner or Waldorf and Montessori schools - induced some of their active learning paradigms upon the old disciplinarian school system, which was dominated by fear rather than creativity.\n\nTo find these discourses in art is a thrill, with great historical resonance and contemporary relevance. I get a similar thrill from Damiano Bertoli\u2019s Associates at Neon Parc, which revives the typography of urban activism in Italy from the 1970s, spread out upon Memphis backdrops to represent all the public energy that we find so scarce today.\n\nThe only problem in Floyd\u2019s project is that sometimes her symbolic language loses coherence by translating too many references. Any given work might suffer from allegorical overload, where science fiction is mixed with art history and pedagogical archetypes and social movements, which clutter the meaning in contrast to the simplicity of the forms.\n\nAn example is Nomadic shepherds, which is analysed in an excellent essay by Sue Cramer. The overlapping circles and colours of the work \u201cbring to mind children\u2019s hoops, quoits and the interlocking circles of the Olympic Games logo\u201d. That\u2019s all good; but then \u201cthey also relate to Steiner\u2019s Eurythmy \u2026 in which participants wear single colour gowns and, through their flowing, often circular movements to music, create harmonious relationships.\u201d\n\nFinally, through the title of the work, we\u2019re referred to \u201ccollective forms of governance practised by nomadic shepherds in Rajasthan\u201d, as if a \u201cdiagrammatic model of social organisation\u201d and a network chart that reflects the work of American artist and educator Sister Mary Corita.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to take in. But, in spite of the multiplicity of references, the work is often too literal, as in Modern ladies. The impressive female forms draw from Picasso\u2019s Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon but within the language of sculptural abstraction, a la Barbara Hepworth, where the figures have no head but the breasts function a bit like eyes.\n\nSo far so good. But the semantic overload enters when piles of letters are plonked beneath the crutches. The artist is quoted: \u201cI replaced Picasso\u2019s bowl of rotting fruit near the women\u2019s sexual organs with piles of letters, to give the women a voice and to give the sense of something abject that disrupts the symbolic order in the way that feminism does\u201d.\n\nMaybe the letters themselves make a pun on the idea of being too literal. Floyd herself acknowledges a more poetic imperative, reflecting on Dostoevsky\u2019s preference for narrating experience over dialectic. To be poetic, a symbol has to lurk within the form, to stalk the form, to weigh upon it with a perverse inherence. To reach that level of semantic poignancy is Floyd\u2019s next challenge.\n\nrobert.nelson@monash.edu", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Art and Design", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Emily Floyd has a brilliant theme and a flawless technique.
