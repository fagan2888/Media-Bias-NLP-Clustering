Rosenblum, author of the report and deputy director of the United States immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute, refocusing enforcement policies on this select group \u201cwould effectively offer a degree of protection to the vast majority\u201487 percent\u2014of unauthorized immigrants now residing in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe report estimates that if Obama\u2019s November 2014 enforcement policies are followed, there will be a reduction of deportations from within the U.S. by about 25,000 cases annually.\n\nThe 13 percent of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. who are now considered \u201cenforcement priorities\u201d has dropped from the 27 percent who were the focus of deportation efforts under the 2010-2011 policy guidelines.\n\nObama\u2019s announcement of executive action on immigration in November of 2014 includes two key policy changes from which the results of the report come.\n\nFirst, the Department of Homeland Security issued new policy guidance on which categories of unauthorized immigrants and other potentially removable noncitizens are priorities for enforcement.\n\nThe top deportation priorities, as outlined by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, include illegal immigrants who are national security threats, gang members, convicted felons and recent border crossers.\n\nThe second major change in the administration\u2019s policies that the report addresses is the replacement of the Secure Communities information-sharing program with the new Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which focuses on targeting individuals convicted of significant criminal offenses.\n\nHomeland Security had to shut down the Secure Communities program after federal courts ruled that its requests to local police departments to detain immigrants were unconstitutional.\n\nRepublican lawmakers are not satisfied with the Priority Enforcement Program as its replacement, saying that it undermines agents\u2019 ability to enforce immigration laws since it authorizes the transfer of individuals only in specific, limited circumstances.\n\nIf these new federal programs are carried out efficiently, Rosenblum said, \u201c[i]mmigrants who have long been living in the U.S. and are not committing crimes will receive a degree of protection and likely will not be facing deportation.\u201d\n\nThe report clarifies that removals at the U.S.-Mexico border remain a top priority under the 2014 guidelines. Rosenblum speculated that \u201cfalling interior removals may be offset to some extent by increases at the border.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, another new study shows that the number of people emigrating from Mexico to the U.S.\u2014both legally and illegally\u2014has dropped sharply in recent years.\n\nDemographers at the University of Texas-San Antonio and the University of New Hampshire found that the number of immigrants coming from Mexico peaked in 2003 and has fallen off by more than half since then.\n\nThere were 1.9 million people migrating from Mexico to the U.S. between 2003 and 2007, but only 819,000 did so from 2008 to 2012. According to U.S. Census figures that do not differentiate between legal and illegal immigration, this is a 57-percent drop in people coming to the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nRogelio Saenz, dean of the College of Public Policy at UTSA and lead author of the study, listed three explanations for the drop in immigration: there are fewer construction jobs in the U.S. due to the 2007-2009 recession, Mexico\u2019s economy is growing and there is a falling birth rate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The majority of illegal immigrants who are in the U.S. will not be the focus of deportation operations, according to the results of two studies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The majority of illegal immigrants who are in the U.S. will not be the focus of deportation operations, according to the results of two studies.", "title": "Under Obama's Plan, Most Illegal Immigrants Will Stay in US", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150723_Immigration-Studies_Scism.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-27T14:39:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1etXPjl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The majority of illegal immigrants who are in the U.S. will not be the focus of deportation operations, according to the results of two studies.", "title": "Under Obama's Plan, Most Illegal Immigrants Will Stay in US", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150723_Immigration-Studies_Scism.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-07-27T13:00:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T14:39:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "immigration, deportation, illegal, unauthorized, migrating, Mexico, Obama, guidelines"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1b3\"", "article_summary": "A new study has found that of the unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. already, most of them will be spared from deportation under Obama\u2019s recent executive actions.\nFirst, the Department of Homeland Security issued new policy guidance on which categories of unauthorized immigrants and other potentially removable noncitizens are priorities for enforcement.\nThe top deportation priorities, as outlined by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, include illegal immigrants who are national security threats, gang members, convicted felons and recent border crossers.\nUnder the Obama administration\u2019s new deportation guidelines, announced in November and put into effect July 1, these individuals will be a priority for deportation.\nObama\u2019s announcement of executive action on immigration in November of 2014 includes two key policy changes from which the results of the report come."}
