Trust is the key word.\n\n\n\nJohn Kasich can be summed up with three C's. Character. Competence. Conservative principles.\n\n\n\nJohn Kasich and I served together in Congress and fought for Ronald Reagan's programs. I admired him then, and my admiration has only grown during the five years he's served as governor of Ohio, where he cut taxes, created 300,000 jobs, and produced a budget surplus.\n\n..\n\nJohn was raised in McKee's Rocks, Pa., a blue-collar, industrial town on the Ohio River near Pittsburgh. His grandfather was a coal miner; his father, a letter carrier. Growing up in a small, working-class town imbued John with the values of faith, honesty, hard work, and optimism.\n\n..\n\nMcKee's Rocks is much like Dixon, Ill., Ronald Reagan's boyhood home. Small towns produce great men, men with empathy for the struggles of ordinary Americans.\n\n\n\nAfter seven years of gross incompetence in the White House, we desperately need a capable President who needs no training and who can actually get the job done. No other Republican candidate can match John Kasich's broad experience and repeatedly demonstrated competence.\n\n..\n\nJohn served for 18 years in Congress, all of them on the Armed Services committee, where he helped Reagan rebuild our national defenses. At the same time, he took on the Pentagon bureaucracy and saved billions by helping to root out wasteful spending. In a dangerous world, he has the experience \u2014 and the temperament \u2014 we need in a commander-in-chief. No other candidate can come close to his superb national security credentials.\n\n..\n\nJohn chaired the Budget Committee and was architect of the Budget Act of 1997, producing the first balanced budgets in 29 years. Under John Kasich's budgets, the nation ran surpluses for three years in a row and actually paid down the national debt. Imagine getting Democrats and Republicans to agree on a budget. That's another testimony to John's competence. No candidate can match his knowledge of the budget.\n\n..\n\nChoosing to leave Washington, John worked for eight years in the business world, then was elected governor of Ohio in 2010.\n\n\n\nAs governor, John Kasich inherited a basket case. The state had lost 351,000 jobs, was 48th in job creation and was running an $8 billion annual deficit. John turned it around, reducing government employment, producing 300,000 private sector jobs, cutting taxes by $5 billion, and ringing up a budget surplus of $2 billion. That's the kind of competence we need in the White House.\n\n..\n\nWe can trust John Kasich to use those same conservative principles to make America's economy prosperous again. He knows that Washington is far too big and inefficient. He will trim down Washington to size by sending programs and funding back to the 50 states, making the states the masters and Washington the servant, as the Founders intended.\n\n..\n\nJohn will send most of the programs of the Department of Education back to the states, along with the funding. Imagine 50 states competing to produce the best quality education with the greatest efficiency, in place of the massive federal education bureaucracy and one-size-fits-all mentality.\n\n..\n\nThe same approach can be applied to transportation, job training, and Medicaid, improving performance and giving us more bang for our tax buck. Further, getting Washington bureaucrats out of the way eliminates rules and regulations that today stand between citizens' ambitions and success.\n\n..\n\nWe can trust John Kasich to repeal the nightmare of Obamacare and replace it with a sensible plan that gives patients incentives to remain healthy, choices when they are ill, and assurance of coverage for pre-existing conditions, all without a massive, meddling and grossly inefficient bureaucracy.\n\n..\n\nWe can trust John Kasich to remain faithful to his long-standing commitment to life. In Ohio, he's signed every pro-life bill reaching the governor's desk.\n\n\n\nWe can trust John Kasich to remain steadfast in his commitment to the Second Amendment.\n\n..\n\nWe can trust John Kasich to restore a clear, bold, and unapologetic foreign policy.We can trust him to rebuild our nation's defenses, embracing Ronald Reagan's philosophy of peace through strength.\n\n\n\nIn sum, John Kasich is superbly equipped to be the conservative President our nation urgently needs to trim government down to size, restore our economy, and make us respected again in the world. No other candidate even comes close.\n\n..\n\n\n\n\n\nGordon Humphrey was a U.S. senator for New Hampshire from 1979 to 1990. He lives in Chichester.\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "In endorsing John Kasich, I've extended not only my endorsement, but my trust.
