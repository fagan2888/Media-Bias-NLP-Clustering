Macy's Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular concert is a staple of Independence Day in America. This year, the concert featured some of the best in the music industry, including Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, Hunter Hayes, Lionel Richie, Miranda Lambert and more. With Nick Cannon as the host, onlookers were in for an epic celebration.







Grande, 21, proved that 2014 was her year; the "Problem" singer performed her hit song at the concert along with her first big hit, "The Way". Just last week, Grande took over MTV for a one-time revival of "Total Request Live," cleverly re-titled "Total Ariana Live" for the occasion, HollywoodLife.com reports.



Before the display of fireworks stretched across the East River in NYC, Grande brought down the house in an amazing performance. Grande pre-taped her performance for the show and looked incredible in a patriotic mini-skirt and white crop top.







In addition, Cyrus proved that you can't have a 4th of July without her hit "Party in the USA." Wearing a very patriotic leotard and white cowboy hat, Cyrus brought back her classic while in Barcelona, Spain for her Bangerz tour.



Country queen Miranda Lambert, 30, also rocked the stage for the concert. The singer performed her hit, "Platinum," in a show-stopping rendition of the song. Another country act, the Zac Brown Band, also took the stage with their song, "Let It Rain."



In addition to Grande and Lambert, Hunter Hayes, 22, Enrique Iglesias, 39, and Lionel Richie, 65, hit the stage as well.
