She dismissed the notion that the legislation would return.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the women of the GOP are going to change their mind about the same bill,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Franks, comparing the anti-abortion movement to the campaign to abolish slavery, said the issue cut to the heart of the founding principles of the GOP.\n\n\u201cThis party was born out of a commitment and conviction of hearts, of certain people that were dedicated to protecting a class of human beings the supreme court said were not human,\u201d he said. \u201cThat commitment sustained us in the crucible of a horrible civil war in this country.\u201d\n\nHe said if the GOP could turned its back \u201con protecting the children of God\u201d, the party would slide into \u201cmoral and political oblivion\u201d.\n\nAsked whether it was reasonable to compare his push to ban most late-term abortions to the movement to abolish slavery, Franks replied: \u201cThere\u2019s never a perfect comparison. But certainly the dynamics and the principles are identical.\u201d\n\nFranks said that the wording in his legislation requiring rape victims to report the crime to police in order to be eligible for an abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy was not written by him, but inserted by the party\u2019s leadership.\n\nThat provision proved particularly problematic for the bill\u2019s Republican opponents, who feared it would alarm female voters. The Justice Department estimates that 70% of rapes are unreported.\n\nFranks said GOP leaders inserted the wording to his bill because they were concerned that \u201cunscrupulous abortion providers\u201d, rather than women themselves, would falsify rape claims.\n\n\u201cThose who kill children for a living are not too concerned about other ethical considerations,\u201d he said.\n\nFranks said both the Republican-dominated House and Senate were both \u201cdecidedly in favour of the bill\u201d, although he conceded there was no chance of his bill becoming law with a Democrat in the White House.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama will take his place in history as the abortion president, so I am obviously not optimistic he will sign the bill,\u201d he said.\n\nFranks said he was not given any indication from GOP leaders about the timing for the return of his legislation, but added: \u201cI have every conviction that we will see it again in the relatively near future.\u201d\n\nThat would prolong a divisive fight in the so-called \u201cculture wars\u201d that moderate Republicans fear have tarnished the party\u2019s reputation in recent years.\n\n\n\nThe confrontation comes at a critical juncture for the GOP. The unofficial starting gun for the party\u2019s 2016 presidential contest will be fired in Iowa this weekend, as conservatives gather for the Iowa Freedom Summit. The event is hosted by the local congressman and rightwing firebrand Steve King, whose comments on abortion and rape have proved controversial in the past.\n\nModerate presidential hopefuls such as Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush are not attending, meaning the event will be dominated by potential candidates from the right such as Ted Cruz, Rick Perry and Mike Huckabee.\n\nAnother speaker will be Rick Santorum, a former candidate for the presidential nomination who is backed by evangelicals and who is weighing another run for the White House. He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the decision to pull the bill, but suggested party leadership would return to the issue when they could be confident they would have the votes to pass it.\n\nSantorum reportedly told an event held by the anti-abortion Family Research Council (FRC): \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anyone for any reason would oppose a bill that says we can\u2019t kill these little children.\u201d\n\nRelated: Republicans drop abortion vote after revolt by female House members\n\nSupporters of the bill had hoped it would be passed on Thursday to coincide with the March for Life, a huge anti-abortion gathering held on the Mall each year to mark the anniversary of the supreme court\u2019s 1973 ruling to legalise abortion, Roe v Wade.\n\nInstead, House Republicans passed another bill, voting 242-179 to permanently bar federal funds for abortion coverage and block tax credits for many people and businesses accessing abortion coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The White House has promised to veto the bill, which could nonetheless be taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe decision to abandon the Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act was privately welcomed by moderates within the party. Debates over abortion and rape harmed the Republicans during the 2012 elections and are widely believed to have led to its defeat in key Senate races. Two candidates, Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, lost after making controversial remarks about abortion and rape.\n\nThe GOP ran a far-more disciplined campaign in the 2014 midterms, side-stepping cultural debates and even embracing issues such as over-the-counter contraception, to appeal to a wider demographic.\n\nGOP strategists acknowledge that legislators are unlikely to change their position on abortion, but are pressing hard for the party to take a less activist stance on the issue.\n\nThis week\u2019s events have exposed the unresolved divisions in the party, and the determination in conservative ranks not to abandon an issue they believe is central to their cause.\n\nBy Friday the female Republican lawmakers who led the drive to persuade party leaders to shelve the Franks bill, Jackie Walorski of Indiana and Rene Ellmers of North Carolina, were being warned they would punished by conservative factions.\n\nThe FRC indicated it might support primary challenges against them. \u201cI believe in political retribution, otherwise you might as well close up shop,\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion Susan B Anthony List, told the Hill.\n\nFranks dismissed the suggestion that a concerted push on such a divisive social issue would harm the electoral prospects of the GOP.\n\n\u201cIf the Republican party \u2026 cannot make protecting pain-capable unborn babies from being dismembered, tortured and killed without anaesthesia a winning issue, then perhaps we need to rethink our entire platform.\u201d",
