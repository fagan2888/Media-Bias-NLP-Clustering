Hey, guess what guys! The House Republicans are going to have an Obamacare replacement plan! Soon, they say. And not so much a legislative plan, but you know, ideas and such.

Pitts also floated a tax credit to help people afford coverage and high-risk pools for people with pre-existing health conditions.

Those ideas are similar to a proposal put out by a group of senior Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate last year called the Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility and Empowerment (CARE) Act.

However, the coming plan will not take the form of legislative text but instead will be a "white paper," Pitts said. That means the plan will not actually be voted on by the House and won't be as specific as a bill would be, making it harder to assess factors like the cost of the plan or how it will affect the number of people with coverage.

The document of ideas is expected to be released "in the next couple weeks," House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said Wednesday at an event hosted by The Hill.
