Remember?\n\nWhen new GM Jeff Bridich said the Rockies\u2019 \u201ceyes and ears were open\u201d to trades for anyone \u2014 including Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez \u2014 that set the rumor mill churning.\n\nUsually, Bridich\u2019s words would simply qualify as \u201cGM speak.\u201d But in fact, it was a dramatic change of course regarding Tulo and CarGo, who were previously off the market at the behest of owner Dick Monfort.\n\nSo where does that leave the Tulo/CarGo situation as baseball\u2019s winter meetings open Monday in San Diego? I would be surprised if anything happens this week. As was one major-league executive told me, \u201cIf I was a betting man, I sure wouldn\u2019t put down money on a trade.\u201d\n\nThe conventional wisdom seems to be that any trade for Tulo or CarGo would not come until next spring or early summer after both of them have proven they\u2019re healthy after coming back from injuries that required surgery in August. However, there is still some interest out there right now and there will be discussions in San Diego.\n\n\u201cI think you could divide the interested teams into threes,\u201d a major-league source said. \u201cThere are those that no longer have an interest; those that are in a wait-and-see mode; and those that are still interested right now.\u201d\n\nSo, while I don\u2019t think the Rockies are going to pull off a blockbuster deal in San Diego, the situation regarding Tulo and CarGo bears watching.\n\nBridich is on the record saying his primary offseason goals are to add a starter to the rotation and beef up the bullpen. He\u2019s also acknowledged that the Rockies will listen to trade offers for catcher Wilin Rosario.\n\nBridich, however, stressed that he is not going to make a move just to make a move. In other words, even as a first-time GM, he doesn\u2019t feel compelled to \u201cmake a splash\u201d at the winter meetings.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember that this is just one week in time \u2014 a few days really,\u201d he last last week. \u201cWe have been working hard, laying things out. We will go into San Diego listening and open, but we will not force something. It has to fit our plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Carlos Gonzalez,Jeff Bridich,Troy Tulowitzki", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Chances are slight that the Rockies will trade either Carlos Gonzalez or Troy Tulowitzki at the winter meetings, but teams are still asking about the duo.", "title": "Trade talk for Rockies' Tulowitzki, Gonzalez still has a pulse", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/12/07/trade-talk-rockies-tulowitzki-gonzalez-still-pulse/19229/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Chances are slight that the Rockies will trade either Carlos Gonzalez or Troy Tulowitzki at the winter meetings, but teams are still asking about the duo.", "title": "Trade talk for Rockies\u2019 Tulowitzki, Gonzalez still has a pulse", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/12/07/trade-talk-rockies-tulowitzki-gonzalez-still-pulse/19229/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Chances are slight that the Rockies will trade either Carlos Gonzalez or Troy Tulowitzki at the winter meetings, but teams are still asking about the duo."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde631\"", "article_summary": "However, there is still some interest out there right now and there will be discussions in San Diego.\nIt was just a month ago that Rockies talk was a hot item at the GM meetings in Phoenix.\nSo where does that leave the Tulo/CarGo situation as baseball\u2019s winter meetings open Monday in San Diego?\nWhen new GM Jeff Bridich said the Rockies\u2019 \u201ceyes and ears were open\u201d to trades for anyone \u2014 including Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez \u2014 that set the rumor mill churning.\nWe will go into San Diego listening and open, but we will not force something."}
