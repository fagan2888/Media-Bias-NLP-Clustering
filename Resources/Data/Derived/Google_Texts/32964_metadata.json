Dionne works the night shift at a local gym for $8 per hour, and saw her premiums more than quadruple.\n\n\u201cI have asthma, ulcers, and mild cerebral palsy,\u201d Dionne wrote. \u201cObamacare takes my monthly rate from $75 a month for full coverage on my \u2018Young Adult Plan,\u2019 to $319 a month. After $6,000 in deductibles, of course.\n\n\u201cLiberals claimed this law would help the poor. I am the poor, the working poor, and I can\u2019t afford to support myself, let alone older generations and people not willing to work at all. this law has raped my future.\u201d\n\nDionne, as a 26-year-old working part-time, does not qualify for coverage from neither her parents nor her employer. And as a young person \u2014 whose enrollment is designed to offset the high cost of healthcare for the elderly \u2014 the spike in her premium is unfortunately the norm.\n\n\u201c[This law] will keep me and kids my age from having a future at all,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is the real face of Obamacare and it isn\u2019t pretty.\u201d\n\nThough Dionne does qualify for the subsidies President Obama praised throughout the Affordable Care Act\u2019s roll out, she calls herself an Objectivist, the philosophy made popular by Ayn Rand, and has economic objections to the credits.\n\n\u201cPeople keep saying, you\u2019re eligible for subsidies, and that\u2019s true,\u201d she told Yahoo!. \u201cI could get them. But I\u2019m an Objectivist \u2026 and I just don\u2019t want them. It\u2019s just a matter of my personal beliefs. I know I could get them, but I just don\u2019t want to have to.\u201d\n\nThe effects of the Affordable Care \u2014 demonstrated by Dionne \u2014 have reverberated nationwide, as many have found their premiums rise exponentially despite Obama\u2019s promises to the contrary.\n\nRead Dionne\u2019s full letter below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "One college graduate is whistling quite the different tune from Obamacare poster-boy Chad Henderson, saying the President's signature healthcare law \"raped\" her future.", "title": "College grad pens letter on the Affordable Care Act: Obamacare...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 348, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/10/Obamacare-Letter-348x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/10/10/college-grad-pens-letter-on-the-affordable-care-act-obamacare-raped-my-future/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "radical-for-capitalism", "published_time": "2013-10-10T12:53:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-10T14:45:02+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c33\"", "article_summary": "I am the poor, the working poor, and I can\u2019t afford to support myself, let alone older generations and people not willing to work at all.\nOne college graduate is whistling quite the different tune from Obamacare poster-boy Chad Henderson, saying the President\u2019s signature healthcare law \u201craped\u201d her future.\n\u201cI have asthma, ulcers, and mild cerebral palsy,\u201d Dionne wrote.\n\u201cObamacare takes my monthly rate from $75 a month for full coverage on my \u2018Young Adult Plan,\u2019 to $319 a month.\nDionne works the night shift at a local gym for $8 per hour, and saw her premiums more than quadruple."}
