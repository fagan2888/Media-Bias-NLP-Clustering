He is the author of the classic \u201cDebt: The First Five Thousand Years\u201d and played an important role in the launching of Occupy Wall Street. Last year, he wrote a much-discussed essay asking what happened to society\u2019s old promise of more leisure time for workers; for the tasks that have come to occupy the hours that were once promised to be ours, Graeber invented the delicate and slightly obscure label, \u201cbullshit jobs.\u201d\n\nI wanted to know exactly what he meant by that, and so we discussed the matter over email. The following conversation has been lightly edited.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning: Keynes\u2019 prediction, back in the 1930s, that before too long workers would have all sorts of leisure time because of improving productivity. Is there a history of this idea? I mean, others have argued this as well, correct?\n\nWell, radical elements in the labor movement began embracing such visions from quite early on. After the successful campaigns for the eight-hour day in the 1880s, people immediately started thinking, can we move this to seven, six, or less. Paul Lafargue, Marx\u2019s son-in-law, and author of \u201cThe Right to Be Lazy,\u201d was already calling for something along those lines in 1883. I have a Wobbly T-shirt with a turn-of-the-century style design that says \u201cjoin the IWW for a new dawn,\u201d it has a sun rising over the rooftops, and on the sun is written, \u201cfour-day week, four-hour day.\u201d I don\u2019t know how old the image really is but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s from the Teens or the \u201920s. In the 1930s, a lot of labor unions did move their industries to a 35-hour week. My mom was a garment worker at the time and that\u2019s how she ended up getting involved in the ILGWU musical review \u201cPins and Needles,\u201d because everyone had moved to a shorter week and the union started providing leisure activities.\n\nAnd when did this expectation finally start dying out?\n\nBy the \u201860s, most people thought that robot factories, and ultimately, the elimination of all manual labor, was probably just a generation or two away. Everyone from the Situationists to the Yippies were saying \u201clet the machines do all the work!\u201d and objecting to the very principle of 9-to-5 labor. In the \u201870s, there were actually a series of now-forgotten wildcat strikes by auto workers and others, in Detroit, I think Turin, and other places, basically saying, \u201cwe\u2019re just tired of working so much.\u201d\n\nThis sort of thing threw a lot of people in positions of power into a kind of moral panic. There were think-tanks set up to examine what to do\u2014basically, how to maintain social control\u2014in a society where more and more traditional forms of labor would soon be obsolete. A lot of the complaints you see in Alvin Toffler and similar figures in the early \u201870s\u2014that rapid technological advance was throwing the social order into chaos\u2014had to do with those anxieties: too much leisure had created the counter-culture and youth movements, what was going to happen when things got even more relaxed? It\u2019s probably no coincidence that it was around that time that things began to turn around, both in the direction of technological research, away from automation and into information, medical, and military technologies (basically, technologies of social control), and also in the direction of market reforms that would send us back towards less secure employment, longer hours, greater work discipline.\n\nToday productivity continues to increase, but Americans work more hours per week than they used to, not fewer. Also, more than workers in other countries. Correct?\n\nThe U.S., even under the New Deal, was always a lot stingier than most wealthy countries when it comes to time off: whether it\u2019s maternity or paternity leave, or vacations and the like. But since the \u201870s, things have definitely been getting worse.\n\nDo economists have an explanation for this combination of greater productivity with increased work hours? What is it and what do you think of it?\n\nCuriously, economists don\u2019t tend to find much interest in such questions\u2014really fundamental things about values, for instance, or broader political or social questions about what people\u2019s lives are actually like. They rarely have much to say about them if left to their own devices. It\u2019s only when some non-economist begins proposing social or political explanations for the rise of apparently meaningless administrative and managerial positions, that they jump in and say \u201cNo, no, we could have explained that perfectly well in economic terms,\u201d and make something up.\n\nAfter my piece came out, for instance, The Economist rushed out a response just a day or two later. It was an incredibly weakly argued piece, full of obvious logical fallacies. But the main thrust of it was: well, there might be far less people involved in producing, transporting, and maintaining products than there used to be, but it makes sense that we have three times as many administrators because globalization has meant that the process of doing so is now much more complicated. You have computers where the circuitry is designed in California, produced in China, assembled in Saipan, put in boxes in some prison in Nevada, shipped through Amazon overnight to God-knows-where\u2026 It sounds convincing enough until you really think about it. But then you realize: If that\u2019s so, why has the same thing happened in universities? Because you have exactly the same endless accretion of layer on layer of administrative jobs there, too. Has the process of teaching become three times more complicated than it was in the 1930s? And if not, why did the same thing happen? So most of the economic explanations make no sense.\n\nAll true, and very correct about the universities, but there\u2019s got to be an official\u2013if not economic\u2013explanation for why we didn\u2019t get this Truly Great Thing that everyone was expecting not all that long ago. Like: Keynes was all wet, or such a system just wouldn\u2019t work, or workers aren\u2019t educated enough to deserve that much vacation, or the things we make today are just so much better than the things they made in Keynes\u2019 day that they are worth more and take more work-hours to earn. There must be something.\n\nWell, the casual explanation is always consumerism. The idea is always that given the choice between four-hour days, and nine or ten-hour days with SUVs, iPhones and eight varieties of designer sushi, we all collectively decided free time wasn\u2019t really worth it. This also ties into the \u201cservice economy\u201d argument, that nobody wants to cook or clean or fix or even brew their own coffee any more, so all the new employment is in maintaining an infrastructure for people to just pop over to the food court, or Starbucks, on their way to or from work. So, sure, a lot of this is just taken as common sense if you do raise the issue to someone who doesn\u2019t think about it very much. But it\u2019s also obviously not much of an explanation.\n\nFirst of all, only a very small proportion of the new jobs have anything to do with actually making consumer toys, and most of the ones that do are overseas. Yet even there, the total number of people involved in industrial production has declined. Second of all, even in the richest countries, it\u2019s not clear if the number of service jobs has really increased as dramatically as we like to think. If you look at the numbers between 1930 and 2000, well, there used to be huge numbers of domestic servants. Those numbers have collapsed. Third, you also see that\u2019s what\u2019s grown is not service jobs per se, but \u201cservice, administrative, and clerical\u201d jobs, which have gone from roughly a quarter of all jobs in the \u201830s to maybe as much as three quarters today. But how do you explain an explosion of middle managers and paper-pushers by a desire for sushi and iPhones?\n\nAnd then, finally, there\u2019s the obvious question of cause and effect. Are people working so many hours because we\u2019ve just somehow independently conceived this desire for lattes and Panini and dog-walkers and the like, or is it that people are grabbing food and coffee on the go and hiring people to walk their dogs because they\u2019re all working so much?\n\nMaybe part of the answer is that people forgot about the expectation of more leisure time, and there\u2019s no political agency to demand it anymore, and hence no need to explain what happened to it. I mean, there\u2019s no wildcat strikes anymore.\n\nWell, we can talk about the decline of the union movement, but it runs deeper. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, one of the great divisions between anarcho-syndicalist unions, and socialist unions, was that the latter were always asking for higher wages, and the anarchists were asking for less hours. That\u2019s why the anarchists were so entangled in struggles for the eight-hour day. It\u2019s as if the socialists were essentially buying into the notion that work is a virtue, and consumerism is good, but it should all be managed democratically, while the anarchists were saying, no, the whole deal\u2014that we work more and more for more and more stuff\u2014is rotten from the get-go.\n\nI\u2019ve said this before, but I think one of the greatest ironies of history is how this all panned out when workers\u2019 movements did manage to seize power. It was generally the classic anarchist constituencies\u2014recently proletarianized peasants and craftsmen\u2014who rose up and made the great revolutions, whether in Russia or China or for that matter Algeria or Spain\u2014but they always ended up with regimes run by socialists who accepted that labor was a virtue in itself and the purpose of labor was to create a consumer utopia. Of course they were completely incapable of providing such a consumer utopia. But what social benefit did they actually provide? Well, the biggest one, the one no one talks about, was guaranteed employment and job security\u2014the \u201ciron rice bowl\u201d, they called it in China, but it went by many names. You couldn\u2019t really get fired from your job. As a result you didn\u2019t really have to work very hard. So on paper they had eight- or nine-hour days but really everyone was working maybe four or five.\n\nI have a lot of friends who grew up in the USSR, or Yugoslavia, who describe what it was like. You get up. You buy the paper. You go to work. You read the paper. Then maybe a little work, and a long lunch, including a visit to the public bath\u2026 If you think about it in that light, it makes the achievements of the socialist bloc seem pretty impressive: a country like Russia managed to go from a backwater to a major world power with everyone working maybe on average four or five hours a day. But the problem is they couldn\u2019t take credit for it. They had to pretend it was a problem, \u201cthe problem of absenteeism,\u201d or whatever, because of course work was considered the ultimate moral virtue. They couldn\u2019t take credit for the great social benefit they actually provided. Which is, incidentally, the reason that workers in socialist countries had no idea what they were getting into when they accepted the idea of introducing capitalist-style work discipline. \u201cWhat, we have to ask permission to go to the bathroom?\u201d It seemed just as totalitarian to them as accepting a Soviet-style police state would have been to us.\n\nThat ambivalence in the heart of the worker\u2019s movement remains. Growing up in a lefty, working class family, I felt it all the time. On the one hand, there\u2019s this ideological imperative to validate work as virtue in itself. Which is constantly being reinforced by the larger society. On the other hand, there\u2019s the reality that most work is obviously stupid, degrading, unnecessary, and the feeling that it is best avoided whenever possible. But it makes it very difficult to organize, as workers, against work.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about \u201cbullshit jobs.\u201d What do you mean by this phrase?\n\nWhen I talk about bullshit jobs, I mean, the kind of jobs that even those who work them feel do not really need to exist. A lot of them are made-up middle management, you know, I\u2019m the \u201cEast Coast strategic vision coordinator\u201d for some big firm, which basically means you spend all your time at meetings or forming teams that then send reports to one another. Or someone who works in an industry that they feel doesn\u2019t need to exist, like most of the corporate lawyers I know, or telemarketers, or lobbyists\u2026. Just think of when you walk into a hospital, how half the employees never seem to do anything for sick people, but are just filling out insurance forms and sending information to each other. Some of that work obviously does need to be done, but for the most part, everyone working there knows what really needs to get done and that the remaining 90 percent of what they do is bullshit. And then think about the ancillary workers that support people doing the bullshit jobs: here\u2019s an office where people basically translate German formatted paperwork into British formatted paperwork or some such, and there has to be a whole infrastructure of receptionists, janitors, security guards, computer maintenance people, which are kind of second-order bullshit jobs, they\u2019re actually doing something, but they\u2019re doing it to support people who are doing nothing.\n\nWhen I published the piece, there was a huge outpouring of confessionals from people in meaningless positions in private corporations or public service of one sort or another. The interesting thing was there was almost no difference between what they reported in the public, and in the private sector. Here\u2019s one guy whose only duty is to maintain a spreadsheet showing when certain technical publications were out of date and send emails to the authors to remind them it needed updating. Somehow he had to turn this into an eight-hour-a-day job. Another one who had to survey policies and procedures inside the corporation and write vision statements describing alternative ways they might do them, reports that just got passed around to give other people in similar jobs a chance to go to meetings and coordinate data to write further reports, none of which were ever implemented. Another person whose job was to create ads and conduct interviews for positions in a firm that were invariably filled by internal promotion anyway. Lots of people who said their basic function was to create tasks for other people.\n\nThe concept of bullshit jobs seems very convincing and even obvious to me\u2013I used to work as a temp, I saw this stuff first-hand\u2013but others might pull market populism on you and say, who are you to declare someone\u2019s else\u2019s job to be bullshit, Mr. Graeber? You must think you\u2019re better than the rest of us or something.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Graeber explains why the more your job helps others, the less you get paid", "title": "David Graeber: \u201cSpotlight on the financial sector did make apparent just how bizarrely skewed our economy is in terms of who gets rewarded\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "David Graeber explains why the more your job helps others, the less you get paid", "title": "David Graeber: \u201cSpotlight on the financial sector did make apparent just how bizarrely skewed our economy is in terms of who gets rewarded\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/01/help_us_thomas_piketty_the_1s_sick_and_twisted_new_scheme/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/david_graeber.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Graeber explains why the more your job helps others, the less you get paid", "title": "David Graeber: \u201cSpotlight on the financial sector did make apparent just how bizarrely skewed our economy is in terms of who gets rewarded\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/david_graeber.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thomas Frank", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, David Graeber, Editor's Picks, Keynes, marx, Occupy Wall Street, Thomas Frank", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Let\u2019s talk about \u201cbullshit jobs.\u201d What do you mean by this phrase?\nIn the 1930s, a lot of labor unions did move their industries to a 35-hour week.\nWhen I talk about bullshit jobs, I mean, the kind of jobs that even those who work them feel do not really need to exist.\nThe interesting thing was there was almost no difference between what they reported in the public, and in the private sector.\nSo on paper they had eight- or nine-hour days but really everyone was working maybe four or five."}
