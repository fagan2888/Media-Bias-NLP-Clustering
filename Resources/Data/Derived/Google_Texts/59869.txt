In a shocking video released on November 11, Project Veritas exposed Obamacare navigators in Dallas counseling applicants to lie on their applications in order to get lower premiums and higher subsidies.

The video showed Obamacare navigators telling a Project Veritas investigator to avoid reporting portions of his income to the IRS in order to avoid being audited and to remain eligible for HHS grants. Later, Obamacare navigators were shown telling a Project Veritas investigator to lie about being a not being a smoker in order to receive a lower premium, and one navigator even admitted to lying on her own application.

This video is the first in a series, and more revelations likely will be revealed soon. Stay tuned...
