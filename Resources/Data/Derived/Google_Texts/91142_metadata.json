One reason for the inauspicious launch of the Affordable Care Act, this narrative holds, is that Republicans have done everything in their power to sabotage it. And government is sharply polarized, the narrative asserts, because radical Republicans\u2014concentrated in the House of Representatives but prominently including senators such as Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul\u2014stubbornly refuse to see the wisdom of progressive ways.\n\nIn a weighty new book, \u201cWhy Government Fails So Often, And How It Can Do Better,\u201d author Peter Schuck exposes the flaws in this narrative. To be sure, the belief\u2014which public polls show is shared by a majority of Americans\u2014that the federal government wastes great quantities of taxpayer money and frequently fails to fulfill its promises is confirmed by reams of social science research. And polarization, particularly among political elites, is real and impedes effective governance. But Schuck, professor emeritus of law at Yale University, demonstrates that the problem goes to the core of big government. He shows that in the field of domestic public policy (to which his book is restricted), our unwieldy federal government is plagued by \u201cdeeply embedded defects.\u201d\n\nCombining an exhaustive review of the scholarly literature in political science and law with detailed case studies, Schuck concludes that government\u2019s failures \u201care not just random, occasional, or partisan; they are large, recurrent, and systemic.\u201d\n\nThey derive from what Schuck\u2014following the writings of political scientists John DiIulio and the late James Q. Wilson\u2014characterizes as the replacement of the Old System of American governance by the New System. The Old System recognized that proposals to expand government\u2019s agenda needed to fall within the limits of legitimate government power. The New System abandoned questions of constitutional limits and legitimacy in favor of the assumption that government possesses unlimited power to do what representatives deem beneficial to society.\n\nThe New System was brought into being in the late 19th century and early 20th century by progressivism, which criticized the Constitution as mechanical and hidebound and asserted that above and beyond protecting liberty, government was responsible for improving the quality of citizens\u2019 lives.\n\nThe modern Democratic Party embraced this approach in the Great Depression with the New Deal, which gave the New System institutional expression in a variety of domestic government programs aimed at restoring the economy and creating a basic social safety net. In the last third of the 20th century, Great Society programs extended such ambitions by dramatically enlarging government\u2019s responsibility for combating poverty, overcoming racial injustice, providing health care, promoting education, and generally establishing greater economic and social equality.\n\nThe New System has not gone unchallenged. A defining goal of post-World War II conservatism has been restoring the idea of limited government, a founding principle shared by both those who sought the Constitution\u2019s ratification and those who opposed it. A measure of the New System\u2019s entrenchment is that most conservatives today accept the legitimacy of New Deal and Great Society programs; instead of seeking to roll government back to pre-20th century size and scope, they concentrate on limiting its growth.\n\nNevertheless, Schuck shows that the structural sources of our sprawling federal government\u2019s endemic policy failures are numerous\u2014and explainable. He provides six major reasons.\n\nFirst, the incentives faced by officeholders\u2014and the citizens who vote them into office\u2014are often at odds with the public interest well understood. To win elections, politicians offer voters, who are often disengaged and ignorant of policy intricacies, short-term benefits while concealing long-term costs. In addition, small, determined, highly organized interest groups can win passage of legislation that benefits them but whose costs are borne but poorly perceived by the larger electorate.\n\nSecond, government suffers from inadequate information, rigidity, weak cooperation, and mismanagement. Information is expensive and time-consuming to obtain, understand, and keep current. Rigidity stems from politicians\u2019 restricted ability to sway public opinion, and the constitutional system of checks and balances, which creates hurdles both for the enactment of new policy and the repeal or reform of enacted programs. Cooperation is difficult to secure because private sector actors know that the next Congress can change the rules of the game. And mismanagement is the result of the massive fraud, waste, and abuse that inevitably afflict massive government programs.\n\nThird, officeholders routinely underestimate the impact of markets and overestimate the power of government to control them.\n\nFourth, the implementation of social engineering schemes is always cumbersome\u2014and frequently self-defeating. Government programs must pass through multiple levels of government agencies and actors with conflicting perspectives. At each level, decision makers push programs in different directions. The protracted process of rule-making and frequently fierce opposition from the private sector causes extended delays. And policymakers lack the training to grasp the variety of complex markets in which all major policies are embedded.\n\nFifth, government has steadily expanded the domain to which federal law applies and asked it to regulate ever more minute details of everyday life despite the inherent limits of law\u2014its generality, indeterminacy, ambiguity, reliance on elaborate formal procedures, and often disguised dependence on discretion. The result is to simultaneously extend law\u2019s reach and undermine its legitimacy.\n\nSixth, the federal bureaucracy, whose power has grown enormously, suffers from a variety of pathologies. Prominent among these are the fragmentation and conflicting imperatives arising from the contest between the Congress and the president over control of the bureaucracy; the multiplication of formal legal rules; the dearth of quality leadership; the proliferation of layers of political appointees; relatively poor compensation for high-level civil service employees; severe restrictions on the ability to fire, demote, or suspend employees; the difficulty of securing compliance of lower-level employees with the bureaucracy\u2019s mission; and the increasing propensity to contract out tasks, which reduces transparency and accountability.\n\nDespite these built-in reasons for policy failure, Schuck also highlights government successes, and the list is impressive: In the New System era, these include Social Security; the GI Bill; the interstate highway system; food stamps; the Voting Rights Act of 1965; the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965; the earned income tax credit of 1975; the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978; and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMoreover, Schuck appreciates that the overall achievements of American constitutional government are nothing short of remarkable. Over the course of 226 years, the United States has steadily extended the promise of freedom, equality, and opportunity to all citizens. Our toleration and pluralism are second to none. We have integrated huge numbers of immigrants. We have the highest standard of living in the world. We saved the free world in the 20th century and are looked to for leadership in the 21st.\n\nMuch remains to be done; Schuck argues for a \u201ccautious incremental approach\u201d to accomplish it. Consonant with America\u2019s overarching political principles and underlying political culture that favor individual freedom, his approach appeals to interests, concentrates on incentives, and seeks to alter circumstances rather than change character. \u201cPolicy environments,\u201d he writes, \u201care more tractable than the people who inhabit them.\u201d\n\nWhat he is suggesting could almost be called a conservative approach even to progressive policy goals. For instance, his approach emphasizes the use of vouchers\u2014insofar as possible and with appropriate safeguards\u2014where the federal government seeks to fund services, including education and health care.\n\nIt would require government agencies to publish reports establishing that they can provide a service more effectively and more cheaply than the private sector. It would, to the extent feasible, deregulate regulated activities, or subject them to competitive bidding, or privatize them or, if they produce harmful effects, tax them (either in a revenue-neutral or revenue-raising way). It would eliminate most tariffs and trade restrictions. It would expand requirements for Congress and the president to produce cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis. And it would restrict Congress\u2019s ability to pass omnibus legislation, which circumvents deliberation.\n\nWith pride and for good reason, Schuck declares himself a \u201cmilitant moderate\u201d and a \u201cmelioristic realist.\u201d He knows \u201cthat policymakers can have at best a severely limited knowledge of the opaque, complex social world that they seek to change, and meager tools for changing it.\u201d Although Schuck notes that except for a \u201cprotest vote\u201d in 1968 he has voted for Democrats for president, his compelling book will probably be more congenial to conservatives than progressives.\n\nBoth will be discomfited by aspects of his argument. Both stand to profit handsomely from studying it.\n\nConservatives can acquire a heightened appreciation of the necessity and means of reform; progressives can attain a better grasp of just why government policy should be \u201ctailored to its institutional means and capacities,\u201d which are necessarily limited and crude.\n\nAnd both conservatives and progressive should salute Peter Schuck, one of our master teachers of, in his words, the \u201cfacts of public life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to the dominant narrative\u2014advanced by President Obama, embraced by the Democratic Party, and disseminated by their many advocates in the prestige media\u2014the federal government...", "title": "Peter Schuck's Rx for Big Government's Ills | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/03/25/peter_schucks_rx_for_big_governments_ills_122035.html", "image": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/rcp-home-logo-ss.png", "type": "article", "description": "According to the dominant narrative\u2014advanced by President Obama, embraced by the Democratic Party, and disseminated by their many advocates in the prestige media\u2014the federal government...", "title": "Peter Schuck's Rx for Big Government's Ills | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Peter Schuck's Rx for Big Government's Ills | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "economy,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf395\"", "article_summary": "The Old System recognized that proposals to expand government\u2019s agenda needed to fall within the limits of legitimate government power.\nBut Schuck, professor emeritus of law at Yale University, demonstrates that the problem goes to the core of big government.\nNevertheless, Schuck shows that the structural sources of our sprawling federal government\u2019s endemic policy failures are numerous\u2014and explainable.\nAnd both conservatives and progressive should salute Peter Schuck, one of our master teachers of, in his words, the \u201cfacts of public life.\u201d\nIn a weighty new book, \u201cWhy Government Fails So Often, And How It Can Do Better,\u201d author Peter Schuck exposes the flaws in this narrative."}
