Forty-one board members held an AMC leadership position in 2012 and received a mean financial compensation of $312,564 for board membership, excluding six industry executives. Board members includes university presidents, deans, hospitals or health system executive officers and clinical department chairs or center directors.\n\n\"Based on data from surveys of department chairmen, other medical school leaders, physicians, medical students, and so on, the data show there's not a single aspect of medical education, medical research or the practice of medicine in which financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry are not ubiquitous,\" Eric G. Campbell, Ph.D., a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and research director for Mongan Institute for Health Policy in Boston, who's also done research on the subject, told Medscape Medical News.\n\nPotential conflicts of interest on boards are an ongoing concern. In February, National Quality Forum President and CEO Christine Cassel, M.D., announced she would resign from Premier and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals boards after medical ethics experts said payments for her work on those boards could create a conflict of interest, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nAnd in 2011, FierceHealthcare reported that the University of Colorado Denver and its teaching hospitals revamped conflict of interest policies after a ProPublica story revealed professors and physicians took large payoffs from major drug companies for speaking and consulting.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the JAMA article\n\n- read the Medscape article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNQF CEO payments raise conflict of interest concerns\n\nNQF CEO to leave Kaiser, Premier boards\n\nDocs fight for Stark exceptions, despite apparent conflicts of interest\n\nPhysicians advise of severing drug-industry ties\n\nColorado teaching hospitals overhaul conflict of interest rules", "article_metadata": {"description": "Academic medical center leaders who serve on\u00a0pharmaceutical company\u00a0boards could create a\u00a0conflict of interest\u00a0or foster competition between institutional oversight responsibilities and individual clinical and research practices, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Academic medical center leaders who serve on\u00a0pharmaceutical company\u00a0boards could create a\u00a0conflict of interest\u00a0or foster competition between institutional oversight responsibilities and individual clinical and research practices, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association.", "title": "Teaching hospital leaders-drug company affiliation raise conflict of interest concerns", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/teaching-hospital-leaders-drug-company-affiliation-raise-conflict-interest/2014-04-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Academic Medical Center,Christine Cassel,conflict of interest,Harvard Medical School,HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,National Quality Forum,Operations & Business Management,pharmaceutical companies,University of Pittsburgh Medical Center", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb393\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the JAMA article- read the Medscape articleRelated Articles:NQF CEO payments raise conflict of interest concernsNQF CEO to leave Kaiser, Premier boardsDocs fight for Stark exceptions, despite apparent conflicts of interestPhysicians advise of severing drug-industry tiesColorado teaching hospitals overhaul conflict of interest rules\nBoard members includes university presidents, deans, hospitals or health system executive officers and clinical department chairs or center directors.\nPotential conflicts of interest on boards are an ongoing concern.\nAcademic medical center (AMC) leaders who serve on pharmaceutical company boards could create a conflict of interest or foster competition between institutional oversight responsibilities, and individual clinical and research practices, according to an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nForty-one board members held an AMC leadership position in 2012 and received a mean financial compensation of $312,564 for board membership, excluding six industry executives."}
