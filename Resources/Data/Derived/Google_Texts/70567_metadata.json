It is a misnomer. There is nothing new about nonbelief. All of us, without exception, are born knowing nothing of God or gods, and acquire notions of religion solely through interaction with others \u2013 or, most often, indoctrination by others, an indoctrination usually commencing well before we can reason. Our primal state is, thus, one of nonbelief. The New Atheists (most prominently Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and the late Christopher Hitchens) have, in essence, done nothing more than try to bring us back to our senses, to return us to a pure and innate mental clarity. Yet their efforts have generated all manner of controversy. Far outnumbered, and facing a popular mindset according kneejerk respect to men (yes, mostly they are men) of faith \u2014 reverends, priests, pastors, rabbis, imams and so on \u2013 the New Atheists have by necessity explained their views with zeal, which has often irked the religious, who are accustomed to unconditional deference. Even some nonbelievers who, again thanks to custom, consider religion too touchy a subject to discuss openly have been riled.\n\nWe atheists, however, need to buck up, assert our rationality, and change the way we deal with the religious, with everyday affronts delivered (at times unknowingly) by believers, with the casual presumptions that historically have tended to favor the faithful and grant them unmerited respect. A lot is at stake. Religion is a serious matter, reaching far beyond the pale of individual conscience and sometimes translating into violence, sexism, sexual harassment and assault, and sundry legal attempts to restrict a woman\u2019s right to abortion or outlaw it altogether, to say nothing of terrorism and war. Now is the time to act. Polls \u2013 see here and here \u2013 show the zeitgeist in the United States is turning increasingly godless, that there are more atheists now than ever before (surely thanks in part to the efforts of the New Atheists). Most of Europe entered the post-faith era decades ago. Americans need to catch up.\n\nI propose here a credo for atheists \u2013 concrete responses to faith-based affronts, to religious presumption, to what Hitchens called \u201cclerical bullying.\u201d (I\u2019ll deal below with the three monotheistic, Abrahamic religions, but what I say applies to other confessions as well.) The faithful are entitled to their beliefs, of course, but have no inherent right to air them without expecting criticism. Religion should be subject to commonsense appraisal and rational review, as openly discussible as, say, politics, art and the weather. The First Amendment, we should recall, forbids Congress both from establishing laws designating a state religion and from abridging freedom of speech. There is no reason why we should shy away from speaking freely about religion, no reason why it should be thought impolite to debate it, especially when, as so often happens, religious folk bring it up on their own and try to impose it on others.\n\nHerewith, some common religious pronouncements and how atheists can respond to them.\n\n1. \u201cLet\u2019s say grace!\u201d\n\nNo, let\u2019s not. When you\u2019re seated at the family dinner table and a relative suggests clasping hands, lowering heads and thanking the Lord, say \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m an atheist. So I\u2019ll opt out.\u201d Nonbelievers have every right to object when being asked to take part in superstitious rituals; in fact, if children are present, they are morally obliged to do so. Courteously refusing to pray will set an example of rational behavior for the young, and contribute to furthering the atheist zeitgeist.\n\n2. \u201cReligion is a personal matter. It\u2019s not polite to bring it up.\u201d\n\nNo, religion is fundamentally collective, and since time immemorial has served societies in fostering union, but also in inciting xenophobia and violence (especially against \u201cunchaste\u201d women and \u201cimpure\u201d minorities), often on a mass scale. Nonbelievers need to further advance the cause of rationality by discussing it openly; doing so, as uncomfortable as it may be at times, will help puncture the aura of sanctity surrounding faith and expose it for what it is.\n\n3. \u201cYou\u2019re an atheist? I feel sorry for you.\u201d\n\nNo, please rejoice for me. I fear no hell, just as I expect no heaven. Nabokov summed up a nonbeliever\u2019s view of the cosmos, and our place in it, thus: \u201cThe cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.\u201d The 19th-century Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle put it slightly differently: \u201cOne life. A little gleam of Time between two Eternities.\u201d Though I have many memories to cherish, I value the present, my time on earth, those around me now. I miss those who have departed, and recognize, painful as it is, that I will never be reunited with them. There is the here and now \u2013 no more. But certainly no less. Being an adult means, as Orwell put it, having the \u201cpower of facing unpleasant facts.\u201d True adulthood begins with doing just that, with renouncing comforting fables. There is something liberating in recognizing ourselves as mammals with some fourscore years (if we\u2019re lucky) to make the most of on this earth.\n\nThere is also something intrinsically courageous about being an atheist. Atheists confront death without mythology or sugarcoating. That takes courage.\n\n4. \u201cIf you\u2019re an atheist, life has no purpose.\u201d\n\nA purpose derived from a false premise \u2013 that a deity has ordained submission to his will \u2013 cannot merit respect. The pursuit of Enlightenment-era goals \u2014 solving our world\u2019s problems through rational discourse, rather than though religion and tradition \u2013 provides ample grounds for a purposive existence. It is not for nothing that the Enlightenment, when atheism truly began to take hold, was also known as the Age of Reason.\n\n5. \u201cIf you abolish religion, nothing will stop people from killing, raping and looting.\u201d\n\nNo, killing, raping and looting have been common practices in religious societies, and often carried out with clerical sanction. The catalogue of notorious barbarities \u2013 wars and massacres, acts of terrorism, the Inquisition, the Crusades, the chopping off of thieves\u2019 hands, the slicing off of clitorises and labia majora, the use of gang rape as punishment, and manifold other savageries committed in the name of one faith or another \u2014 attests to religion\u2019s longstanding propensity to induce barbarity, or at the very least to give it free rein. The Bible and the Quran have served to justify these atrocities and more, with women and gay people suffering disproportionately. There is a reason the Middle Ages in Europe were long referred to as the Dark Ages; the millennium of theocratic rule that ended only with the Renaissance (that is, with Europe\u2019s turn away from God toward humankind) was a violent time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Atheists need to assert ourselves!
