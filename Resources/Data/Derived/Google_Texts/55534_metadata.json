An infectious disease once fatal to most humans, plague is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacteria.\n\n\u201cPlague is not common east of the Mississippi, but it commonly occurs west of the Mississippi,\u201d Marlene Gaither, environmental health program manager for Coconino County Public Health Services District (CCPHSD), told Medical Daily. What is unusual, then, is not the occurrence of plague in northern Arizona, but the fact that plague, which is enzootic \u2014 endemic in animals \u2014 occurs in the rodent population only above 4,500 feet in this southwestern state.\n\nAsked why this is so, Gaither laughed. \u201cYour guess is as good as anyone\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cThe environment, the rodent population, possibly the season may explain this, but so far nobody \u2026 I haven\u2019t seen any scientific study that explains why in Arizona it only exists above 4,500 feet.\u201d\n\nNow that plague has been confirmed, the County has begun to warn the public in part by flagging infected burrows, yet also by warning people to de-flea their pets. Cats are sensitive to plague and become sick, but dogs do not succumb to the disease themselves. In either case, dogs and cats both carry fleas that, if infected, may spread the plague to their owners and others. Infected, we humans will develop a high fever, headache, and weakness, while one (or more) of our lymph nodes, called buboes, may swell painfully.\n\nRather than being forced to react or respond to plague incidents in humans, the idea is to \u201ckeep it in the animal population,\u201d Gaither said. \u201cIt\u2019s about prevention.\u201d Certainly, plague is easily treated with antibiotics, but patients can become very sick if not attended after first showing signs of illness.\n\nHow does surveillance work?\n\n\u201cWe found the perfect rodent population to monitor for plague \u2014 prairie dogs,\u201d Gaither told Medical Daily. While prairie dogs typically live near or around residents, they also colonize in pretty good-sized groups. \u201cThe one unique thing to them is they are highly sensitive to plague,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day you see them, and the next, where did they go?\u201d In other words, when a prairie dog colony is hit by plague, they die off pretty quickly. At this point, public health officials who actively monitor the population of colonies will notice a sudden drop in rodent numbers and so begin the process of capturing animals and testing fleas. In some cases, it is a community member who notices the sudden disappearance of prairie dogs and raises the alarm.\n\n\u201cIn the past \u2014 I\u2019ve been living in the county for 32 years \u2014 we saw plague occur every five years,\u201d Gaither said. In recent years, though, health officials have been finding it more frequently. \u201cEvery other year, or back to back. But we look every year for it,\u201d she said. Gaither believes this is a positive sign of better surveillance.\n\nThe Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics at Northern Arizona University conducted the tests on behalf of the county, an act of generosity, says Gaither, because these DNA tests are quite expensive. Possibly due to warmer temperatures, the plague infestation occurred earlier than usual this year; typically the season is late summer. \u201cIt\u2019s been unusually warm and dry here in northern Arizona. March was unusually warm,\u201d Gaither said.\n\nThe Coconino County health department urges people who live, work, or visit areas of plague to take these precautions:\n\nDo not handle sick or dead animals\n\nDe-flea pets routinely, prevent them from roaming loose\n\nAvoid rodent burrows and fleas\n\nUse insect repellents when visiting or working in areas of active plague\n\nWear rubber gloves and other protection when cleaning and skinning wild animals\n\nDo not camp next to rodent burrows and do not sleep directly on the ground\n\nTake any sick cat directly to a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment\n\nSee your physician immediately if you become sick or feverish\n\n\u201cA lot of people ask why don\u2019t we get rid of prairie dogs so we\u2019d get rid of the plague, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Gaither said. The pesky bacteria simply would migrate to another animal group. At least for now, the pretty prairie dogs, though relentlessly pursued by fleas, remain safe from humans.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bubonic plague, arizona, fleas, infectious disease, prairie dogs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Public health officials in Arizona say fleas collected in Picture Canyon, a popular hiking area northeast of Flagstaff, have tested positive for bubonic plague.", "title": "Bubonic Plague Found On Fleas Of Arizona Prairie Dogs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bubonic-plague-confirmed-fleas-arizona-prairie-dogs-328332", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/07/prairie-dogs-carrier-fleas-infected-plague.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Public health officials in Arizona say fleas collected in Picture Canyon, a popular hiking area northeast of Flagstaff, have tested positive for bubonic plague.", "title": "Bubonic Plague Found On Fleas Of Arizona Prairie Dogs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bubonic-plague-confirmed-fleas-arizona-prairie-dogs-328332", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/07/prairie-dogs-carrier-fleas-infected-plague.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/07/prairie-dogs-carrier-fleas-infected-plague.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-07T14:50:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-07T14:50:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Public health officials in Arizona say fleas collected in Picture Canyon, a popular hiking area northeast of Flagstaff, have tested positive for bubonic plague."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd96\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe found the perfect rodent population to monitor for plague \u2014 prairie dogs,\u201d Gaither told Medical Daily.\nAt least for now, the pretty prairie dogs, though relentlessly pursued by fleas, remain safe from humans.\nIn some cases, it is a community member who notices the sudden disappearance of prairie dogs and raises the alarm.\nWhile prairie dogs typically live near or around residents, they also colonize in pretty good-sized groups.\nPublic health officials in Arizona say fleas collected in Picture Canyon, a popular hiking area northeast of Flagstaff, have tested positive for bubonic plague."}
