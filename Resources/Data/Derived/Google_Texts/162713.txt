A fed-up Ohio father decided to air his frustration’s over his kid’s fourth-grade Common Core math curriculum, by writing the school a check they’ll have to figure out before cashing.

Instead of a dollar amount, the father used a cryptic series of “X’s” and “O’s” accompanying eight boxes with more “O’s” to indicate the amount on the check, Buzzfeedreported.

The confusing series of letters is in line with controversial Common Core long-form math curriculum that is implemented in 46 states.

Officials at Melridge Elementary in Painesville, Ohio, will likely have to teach the bank teller how to calculate the cash amount using the Common Core method if they want to cash the check, or find a student to help them figure it out, said CBS-affiliate WTSP 10 News in Tampa Bay.
