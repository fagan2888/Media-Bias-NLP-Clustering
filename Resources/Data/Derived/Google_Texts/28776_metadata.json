By 10:15 p.m., both had been found and Caitlyn was safe.\n\nTimothy Virts faces a charge of first-degree murder in the slaying of 36-year-old Bobbie Jo Cortez, Caitlyn's mother. Cortez's body was found at her Dundalk home Thursday morning, and Timothy and Caitlyn Virts were missing.\n\n\"We have had a violent scene that has left a woman dead. We are not sure what (his) involvement in that may have been, and we know he is not supposed to have this child,\" Elise Armacost, of the Baltimore County Police, said Thursday. \"So we have good reason to be concerned about her safety.\"\n\nCBS Baltimore said he has an extensive criminal record that dates back to 1999 and includes charges of domestic violence.\n\nCaitlyn's twin sister and Cortez's young son, as well as two other adults, were also living at the home. Armacost said Timothy Virts had been staying there too, for the past several weeks.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-03-07 14:49:00", "description": "A Maryland man and his daughter were found in South Carolina Friday night, almost two days after the child, 11-year-old Caitlyn Marie Virts, was the subject of an Amber Alert.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-03-07 22:29:49", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13459641|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Maryland man and his daughter were found in South Carolina Friday night, almost two days after the child, 11-year-old Caitlyn Marie Virts, was the subject of an Amber Alert.", "title": "Maryland man arrested, child found safe :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/maryland-man-arrested-child-found-safe/13459641/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/03/07/13460592/13460592-1394246649-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-07T14:49:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "A Maryland man and his daughter were found in South Carolina Friday night, almost two days after the child, 11-year-old Caitlyn Marie Virts, was the subject of an Amber Alert.", "title": "Maryland man arrested, child found safe :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/maryland-man-arrested-child-found-safe/13459641/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/03/07/13460592/13460592-1394246649-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb60f\"", "article_summary": "Timothy Virts faces a charge of first-degree murder in the slaying of 36-year-old Bobbie Jo Cortez, Caitlyn's mother.\nCaitlyn's twin sister and Cortez's young son, as well as two other adults, were also living at the home.\nArmacost said Timothy Virts had been staying there too, for the past several weeks.\nCortez's body was found at her Dundalk home Thursday morning, and Timothy and Caitlyn Virts were missing.\nOn Friday, authorities expanded the Amber Alert on a suspicion that Timothy Virts and his daughter might have been in Garysburg, N.C.
