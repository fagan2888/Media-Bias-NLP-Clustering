Thomas, JD, counsel to the O&P Alliance and general counsel to the National Association for the Advancement of Orthotics & Prosthetics (NAAOP), told O&P News.\n\n\u201cIt is more like a mandate to have health insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether that is from a public program like Medicare or Medicaid, or coverage through a separate, private insurer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was put in place to help those who are uninsured have options for care,\u201d Dennis Clark, LCPO, president of the Orthotic and Prosthetic Group of America (OPGA) in Iowa, added. \u201cNot just in O&P, but in the health care system overall.\u201d\n\nImage: \u00a9 Shutterstock\n\nIt seems as if the law is doing that. As of 2015, 11.9 million Americans are newly insured, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts that number could rise to 30 million in the coming year.\n\nThe way it works is through health insurance exchanges. An exchange is a federal- or state-based marketplace where consumers can compare coverage options, Thomas said.\n\n\u201cThey can go onto websites or even into brick and mortar buildings to review different insurance plans,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent plans have different levels of cost sharing, but as long as they meet certain requirements, they can be sold on these exchanges.\u201d\n\nOne of those requirements is \u201cessential health benefits.\u201d The ACA mandates the Department of Health and Human Services delineate 10 categories of benefits in every insurance plan, which include \u201crehabilitative and habilitative services and devices.\u201d\n\nAlthough orthoses and prostheses are not specifically defined in the regulation, it is generally assumed that they fall under that category, Thomas said.\n\n\u2018Racing to the bottom\u2019\n\nWith more individuals having access to care, it stands to reason that O&P providers would gain more patients and dollars, Thomas said.\n\n\u201cBut, that is not necessarily the sense I get from people in the field,\u201d he added.\n\nBruce \u201cMac\u201d McClellan\n\nPeople like Bruce \u201cMac\u201d McClellan, CPO, LPO, FISPO, FAAOP, private practice owner in Texas and representative to the O&P Alliance. McClellan said the expansion of Medicaid to cover millions of additional Americans \u201ccould be detrimental in the long term.\u201d\n\nClark agreed.\n\n\u201cIt causes funding concerns. Some of us [independently owned practices] do not have the cash flow to take on those numbers,\u201d he said, adding that more patients mean tighter reimbursement levels and more restrictive coverage policies.\n\nRebecca Hast\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to documentation and demonstrating medical necessity, payers, who have always had rules in place, are now following them more strictly,\u201d Rebecca Hast, president of Linkia, a Hanger company, told O&P News. \u201cInsurers who may not have paid much attention to ancillary services such as O&P [before] are now looking at every provider relationship for how they can get value.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt adds layers of administrative costs on top of providing the prosthesis or orthosis,\u201d Clark said. \u201cSo you find people racing to the bottom to find cheaper ways to care for their patients.\u201d\n\nIt also increases insurance churn, Scott Williamson, MBA, CAE (Ret.), president of Quality Outcomes in Virginia, told O&P News.", "article_metadata": {"page_type": "Document", "site_name": "healiotwo", "description": "O and P News | The total number of amputees in the United States could reach 2.4 million by 2020; the total number of orthosis users could nearly triple that the same year, the American Orthotic & Prosthetic Association has found.Although the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was designed to make care more accessible and cost-effective, local and national providers are seeing the opposite effect.", "og": {"image": "http://i3.wyanokecdn.com/healio_safe_image.png"}, "VIcurrentDateTime": 635998440972839551, "ModifiedDate": "2015-06-29", "content_type": "News Article", "content_version": 1, "msvalidate.01": "AB0F11E889D663098DB556BB5ACBB719", "google-site-verification": "TCYGZWR7Qscjc3GO_imiutAfXMSCFLpchm8rXzIk-5M", "pageid": "{2EA9E189-4695-4EEB-9B73-9B8B88F625BC}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "PostedDate": "2015-06-29"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda02\"", "article_summary": "Cover StoryAs the Affordable Care Act reshapes the face of health care, unintended challenges are facing O&P.\nDefining the lawThe ACA was drafted to reform the American health care system by providing low-cost health insurance, new rights, benefits and protections for consumers.\n\u201cNot just in O&P, but in the health care system overall.\u201dImage: \u00a9 ShutterstockIt seems as if the law is doing that.\n\u201cIt is more like a mandate to have health insurance,\u201d he said.\nAlthough the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was designed to make care more accessible and cost-effective, local and national providers are seeing the opposite effect."}
