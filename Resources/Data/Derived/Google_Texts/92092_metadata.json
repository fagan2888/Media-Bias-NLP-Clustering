This is a pretty big deal.\n\nWe\u2019ve had many opportunities to meet and talk to each of the candidates, and we\u2019ll have a few more before Aug. 12.\n\nAll seem very competent and informed. All have extensive law enforcement experience. All have been with Portage County a good amount of time. All have various members of the law enforcement community endorsing them.\n\nAll are good, dedicated men and have the best interest of Portage County in mind.\n\nThat makes for a tough decision. I\u2019m making my choice with a little \u201cinsider\u201d perspective. Serving on County Board has given me the opportunity to see firsthand what it takes to work with the team that is local government. I want a sheriff who is able to be approachable. Someone who can connect, not only with the deputies and the community, but the various entities they will be working with in the area.\n\nFor me, that person is Mike Lukas. Mike have proven to me that he can work efficiently, respectfully and logically with a diverse cross-section of our community. As a negotiator, he listens to every side and helps people come to a reasonable conclusion without dictating how it must be.\n\nMike is also firm when the situation calls for it, but never in a condescending way. This is very important when it comes to running a department the size of the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nJoin me, on Aug. 12, in voting for Mike Lukas.\n\nMike has the experience, the tenure, the support and the dedication it takes to wear that badge. What puts him over the top is the way he is able to work with community members of all ages, all walks of life, treating everyone with respect and fairness.\n\nMike Wiza,\n\nStevens Point\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1mxhD1P", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sheriff candidates are strong, but in my work with him, Lukas stands out.", "og": {"site_name": "Stevens Point Journal Media", "description": "Sheriff candidates are strong, but in my work with him, Lukas stands out.", "title": "Mike Wiza: Why I\u2019m voting for Mike Lukas", "url": "http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/opinion/2014/07/21/mike-wiza-voting-mike-lukas/12961417/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/stevenspointjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sheriff candidates are strong, but in my work with him, Lukas stands out.", "creator": "@StevensPointJRL", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/43cd973388c1d97578c66e4ba702ff719662b2eb/c=0-70-417-487&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/StevensPoint/2014/07/21/lukas.jpg", "title": "Mike Wiza: Why I\u2019m voting for Mike Lukas", "site": "@StevensPointJRL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884242174", "fb": {"app_id": 116784471723374}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c71\"", "article_summary": "Mike LukasEDITOR: On Aug. 12, we\u2019ll be casting our votes for a new sheriff, the top law enforcement officer of the county.\nJoin me, on Aug. 12, in voting for Mike Lukas.\nAll have various members of the law enforcement community endorsing them.\nAll have extensive law enforcement experience.\nMike have proven to me that he can work efficiently, respectfully and logically with a diverse cross-section of our community."}
