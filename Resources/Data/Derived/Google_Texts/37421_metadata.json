I\u2019m single, and have no kids. In 2012, I made less than $25,000. Based on my income, will my premiums be affected?\n\nCalculating Buyer\n\nDear Calculating Buyer,\n\nAt $25,000 in earnings for a single-person household, you are at around 250% of federal poverty. Therefore, you will qualify for government subsidies to purchase a plan on your state\u2019s health insurance exchange (also called \u201cmarketplace\u201d). The subsidies will reduce your cost for health coverage to between 6.3 and 8.05% of your income. You would spend between $1,575 and $2,012 for your coverage for the year. You will also qualify for help paying the plan\u2019s deductible and co-pays. The amount of these (called \u201ccost sharing subsidies\u201d) depends upon the type of plan you choose.\n\nYou can use one of the online subsidy calculators; Kaiser Family Foundation has one and there are plenty of others. Keep in mind that these calculators are estimating how much your plan will cost. Starting October 1, you will be able to visit www.healthcare.gov find your state\u2019s exchange, and then get actual numbers.\n\nAnd kudos to you for buying your own plan, earning $25k a year. Plenty of people would love to know how you made all of those ends meet!\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Health Unsurance", "description": "I pay for my own health insurance. \u00a0I\u2019m single, and have no kids.\u00a0 In 2012, I made less than $25,000.\u00a0 Based on my income, will my premiums be affected?
