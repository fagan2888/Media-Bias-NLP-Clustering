President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner had a rare one-on-one meeting at the White House this week, their first such gathering in more than a year.

At his weekly news conference today, Boehner was asked what he and the president agreed on the most.

"Immigration," Boehner said. "We had a very healthy conversation on immigration."

When asked to elaborate, Boehner gave a long pause and finally said: "You asked a question and I gave you the answer."

The rare common ground reached by the president and the House Speaker is unlikely to yield any reforms in the short term, given the resistance from congressional Republicans to move forward on immigration this year.

But it was a reminder that the door isn't closed entirely on immigration reform. Boehner has repeatedly said this is a chief priority of his - either this year or down the road.

Boehner could have taken the easy way out of the question by saying that he and the president agreed on supporting the troops, or something similarly general. But he decided to say immigration. And inside the Beltway, one word often speaks volumes.
