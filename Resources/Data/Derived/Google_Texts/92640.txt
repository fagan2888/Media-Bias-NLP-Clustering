Bob Stewart is what you would call a “handy man.” After 21 years of masonry work, his family knows who to go to when something breaks. When Bob’s wife Michelle found out her kidneys were failing, Bob was faced with a situation that he could not fix, but that didn’t stop him from doing everything in his power to help.

"If something breaks in the house, I can fix it," Bob told KUSA-TV. “When it comes to health, it's like I can't fix this. Sometimes I'll be alone and I'll just start, you know, crying about it.”

Michelle, who suffers from systematic lupus, has battled pain, fatigue, and even comas over the past 30 years as her condition has continually attacked all of her vital organs. After finding out about her failing kidney, Michelle and her family began shopping their options for a kidney transplant. Those options included waiting five to six years to receive a deceased kidney in Colorado — five to six years that could be longer than Michelle has — or find their own living donor.

The search for a living donor started out a little rocky. Bob was unable to grab anyone’s attention with flyers and fundraisers. With an admittedly limited understanding of social media, Bob decided to turn his truck into the family’s very own Facebook post. The post got straight to the point:

“TYPE O BLOOD, WIFE NEEDS KIDNEY, Michelle Stewart, 720-848-0855.”

While driving around last Friday, someone caught a quick photo of Bob’s truck and posted it to Reddit. By Tuesday, the photo had already garnered over three million views. Although finding a match could take months with the help of the University of Colorado, Bob and Michelle are more than thankful for the fighting shot kind-hearted strangers have granted them.

"It's amazing. It just puts a lump in your throat," Bob explained. "We were thinking that we would find one person," Michelle added. "We had no idea that it would become so big."
