South Korea\u2019s defense ministry said Thursday it was trying to determine if the projectiles were missiles, artillery, or rockets. The UN resolution, considered the toughest sanctions on the regime in more than two decades, prohibits the export of coal, iron, and iron ore being used to fund North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and bans exports of gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, and rare earth minerals. The sanctions also require inspections of cargo leaving and entering North Korea by land, sea, or air.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "World News", "tags": "topic:world", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "After UN announces tougher sanctions against Pyongyang.", "title": "N.
