Engaging in artistic expression, crafts and other forms of creation are certainly considered healthy when facing depression, anxiety or any other troubling disturbance in mental and emotional wellness. What science is now discovering is that the use of these techniques is helpful for anyone at any time\u2014even when we aren\u2019t in the midst of emotional turmoil or stress.

It was discovered that 30 to 50 percent of participants were less likely to develop mild cognitive impairment, a first step to dementia. This response was also seen in animal testing and researchers believe it is because these activities all activate multiple areas of the brain\u2014including those responsible for planning, spatial navigation, visual processing, interpreting meaning and precision of movement.\n\nIn another study, women hospitalized for anorexia were given a survey after knitting for 20 minutes to an hour per day. 74 percent reported having less fear or preoccupation with their disorder and others noted feeling pride and a sense of accomplishment. Project Knitwell works with caregivers of all kinds and notes how knitting can be an especially powerful relief for families of premature infants who cannot yet hold their babies.\n\n\u201cTextile therapy\u201d is being studied more and more as we further our understanding of the brain and its functions. The reward center of the brain, responsible for reinforcement of activities ranging from eating, exercise, sex and taking recreational drugs, may play a role in the enjoyment of knitting and other hands-on crafts.\n\nNot only is knitting a powerful tool for managing daily stressors and life\u2019s more significant hardships, it can serve as a preventative measure against future health conditions. Compared to other activities, it\u2019s also affordable for many people and just about anybody can learn. To get started with learning how to knit, here are some resources and fun patterns. It\u2019s time knitting becomes less of an aged stereotype and more of a daily health practice!\n\nRelated\n\nEssential Oils Show Promise for Regulating Blood Pressure\n\nBoost Your Immunity by Eating These Foods\n\n7 Ways to Keep Your Knees Strong and Healthy", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arts and crafts can be fun stress relievers, but did you know they can also be part of preventative treatment for serious health conditions?", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/greenliving/1374/1373330.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "knitting,arts and crafts,knitting health effects,textile therapy,quilting,knitting and health,coping skills,recreation", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f1d\"", "article_summary": "According to The Washington Post, a survey conducted in 2013 showed how 81.5 percent of those who responded said they felt happier and healthier after knitting.\nIn another study, women hospitalized for anorexia were given a survey after knitting for 20 minutes to an hour per day.\nOne study revealed quite an impact on seniors who practiced knitting, quilting, playing games, computer activities and reading books regularly.\nAnd activities such as knitting can even provide long-term health benefits!\nIt\u2019s time knitting becomes less of an aged stereotype and more of a daily health practice!"}
