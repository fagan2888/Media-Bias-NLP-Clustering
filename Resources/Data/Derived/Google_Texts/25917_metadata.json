It was a move that appeared to be in the works from the moment Fox said goodbye. And it was one that quickly won over many longtime Broncos fans.\n\nWATCH: Mike Klis talks about John Elway\u2019s view of Gary Kubiak\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad move,\u201d said Lee Wasserman, a Broncos fan since 1983 who now lives in Atlanta. \u201cObviously as far as anything goes with coaching is you got to kind of wait to see how it pans out and see who he hires on his staff. It\u2019s going depend upon how things come together.\u201d\n\nKubiak\u2019s history with the Broncos reaches back to 1983, when they drafted him in the eighth round (197th overall) to be Elway\u2019s backup. He hung up his cleats after nine seasons and grabbed a clipboard to begin a coaching career that has extended over two decides and with four NFL teams, including the Broncos, whom he helped to back-to-back Super Bowl titles in 1997 and \u201998.\n\nOn Monday, Denver welcomed Kubiak \u201chome.\u201d Elway greeted him on the tarmac of Centennial Airport. Former players, including Joel Dreessen and Ed McCaffrey, applauded the hire. And fans across the country re-pledged their allegiance to the Orange and Blue.\n\nCharles Anderson was one of them. A native of Grand Rapids, Mich., he has been a Broncos fan since 1984, when he watched a rookie Elway attempt to escape the wrath of Pittsburgh\u2019s Steel Curtain. The hiring of Kubiak, he said, was the right move.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited because I think he\u2019s going to have the team prepared,\u201d said Anderson, who admitted he takes grief from his family of Lions loyalists for cheering on the Broncos. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have a little bit of an edge. They\u2019re going to be a little more tough-nose, and I think that\u2019s what Elway was looking for.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Mike Klis talks about Alex Gibbs\u2019 connection to the Broncos\n\nThe Broncos, coming off four consecutive AFC West titles and regular-season records of 13-3, 13-3, and 12-4 the past three years with Fox, have handed Kubiak a solid foundation, but a bevy of questions.\n\nThe biggest, of course, centers around Peyton Manning, the 17-year veteran who has yet to decide if he\u2019ll make it 18. If he does return, many are already concerned his style won\u2019t mesh with Kubiak\u2019s zone-blocking offense and stretch-run plays.\n\n\u201cGuys like (Manning) and almost any pro athlete obviously have huge egos and I don\u2019t think the way the season ended, I don\u2019t think he wants to be remembered as that being his last game,\u201d Wasserman said of Manning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how (Kubiak) works with Manning. I think that\u2019s going to be a year, maybe two at the most. He\u2019s not going to be around too much longer. So I do think that the way his offense is centered, as far as the stretch plays and those different kinds of things, if they decide to stick with Brock (Osweiler) it could be a good move. I think the league is moving toward that anyway, more of the mobile quarterbacks.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gary Kubiak is on board, and so are Broncos fans", "title": "Gary Kubiak is on board, and so are Broncos fans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/19/gary-kubiak-is-on-board-and-so-are-broncos-fans/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T17:51:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-19T17:51:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Less than a week after the Broncos parted with coach John Fox, they hired Elway\u2019s former backup and coordinator, Gary Kubiak, to take the reins.\nWATCH: Mike Klis talks about John Elway\u2019s view of Gary Kubiak\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad move,\u201d said Lee Wasserman, a Broncos fan since 1983 who now lives in Atlanta.\nThe people have spoken: They still trust in John Elway.\nOn Monday, Denver welcomed Kubiak \u201chome.\u201d Elway greeted him on the tarmac of Centennial Airport.\nAnd it was one that quickly won over many longtime Broncos fans."}
