Rex Brothers on Saturday threw just the 76th immaculate inning in baseball history — nine pitches, nine strikes, three outs — in the Rockies’ come-from-behind victory over the Giants.

“I didn’t really think about it until I came off the field. I started thinking about the inning and thought, ‘Well, that went well,’” Brothers said.

It was the fifth immaculate inning in MLB this season, tying a record.

His perfect eighth inning went like this:

Struck out Michael Morse looking

1. 90 mph fastball, called strike

2. 85 mph slider, foul

3. 92 mph fastball, called strike

Struck out Brandon Crawford looking

1. 84 mph slider, swinging strike

2. 85 mph slider, foul

3. 91 mph fastball, called strike

Struck out Gregor Blanco swinging

1. 90 mph fastball, called strike

2. 83 mph slider, called strike

3. 86 mph slider, swinging strike

The Giants fouled off just two pitches. They looked at five called strikes. They swung and missed twice.

“Momentum swings are big, especially in this place. I think that plays, definitely, to their advantage,” Brothers said. “And any time you can have a shutdown inning and get your team back in the dugout as quick as possible, that’s obviously going to be for the betterment of the team.”

Brothers earned the win to move to 3-4 and dropped his ERA to 4.85. He also increased his season strikeout total to 30 and tipped the scales in his K-to-walk ratio from 1.69 to 1.88 (30 to 18).

“That’s a good ball club over there. It seems like it’s always a battle, whether it’s here or there,” Brothers said. “Very proud of what we’ve done to this point, especially at this point in the year and how we’re still battling.”

The Rockies, with a win Sunday in the series finale, can earn their first sweep of the Giants in San Francisco since 2008.

“We have to keep our noses to the grind and keep playing hard,” Brothers said.
