Apparently, Lendas was taking pictures of his bride when he took a few steps back and stumbled off the edge of the cliff, said army spokesman Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera. Fortunately, a tree broke the man's fall and prevented him from suffering from further injuries, added Jayaweera.\n\n\"He was extremely lucky because he fell on top of a tree about 130 feet from the top,\" Jayaweera told AFP. \"He is the first person to survive a fall from World's End.\"\n\nThe Dutch honeymooner was rescued by about 40 Sri Lankan troops who used rope to slide down the brush-covered cliff and get him to safety. The soldiers then carried him on their shoulders for a few miles until they reached a location to drive him to a hospital.\n\nAuthorities also reported that was in stable condition.\n\n\"His condition is stable, and he is out of danger,\" said a police official.\n\n\"It was very scary and very painful as well,\" Lendas told reporters after being discharged from the hospital, according to The Telegraph. \"[At] the time, I was taking pictures and I had a misstep and I fell down backwards, two times, and then I sat in bushes for like three and a half hours and ... [it was] the longest three and a half hours of my life.\"\n\nHis wife, Linda, also thanked a Canadian man who helped her husband while he was trapped on the side of the cliff face.\n\n\"He just talked to him for hours, and we want to say thank you to him and his wife. She helped me very much,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "A Dutch man miraculously survived after falling off the World's End, a 4,000-foot cliff and tourist attraction located in central Sri Lanka.", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "A Dutch man miraculously survived after falling off the World's End, a 4,000-foot cliff and tourist attraction located in central Sri Lanka.", "title": "Dutch Man First Person to Survive Fall from 4,000-Foot World\u2019s End Cliff in Sri Lanka", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/39156/20150222/dutch-man-first-person-to-survive-fall-from-4-000-foot-world-s-end-cliff-in-sri-lanka.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/37546/worlds-end-cliff.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "A Dutch man miraculously survived after falling off the World's End, a 4,000-foot cliff and tourist attraction located in central Sri Lanka.", "title": "Dutch Man First Person to Survive Fall from 4,000-Foot World\u2019s End Cliff in Sri Lanka", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/39156/20150222/dutch-man-first-person-to-survive-fall-from-4-000-foot-world-s-end-cliff-in-sri-lanka.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/37546/worlds-end-cliff.jpg", "creator": "@latinpost", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/39156/20150222/dutch-man-first-person-to-survive-fall-from-4-000-foot-world-s-end-cliff-in-sri-lanka.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Title": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22"}, "news_keywords": "dutch, man, first, person, to, survive, fall, from, 4, 000, foot, world, s, end, cliff, in, sri, lanka", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Subject": "Latin Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc295\"", "article_summary": "A Dutch man miraculously survived after falling off the World's End, a 4,000-foot cliff and tourist attraction located in central Sri Lanka.\n\"It was very scary and very painful as well,\" Lendas told reporters after being discharged from the hospital, according to The Telegraph.\n\"He is the first person to survive a fall from World's End.\"\n\"He just talked to him for hours, and we want to say thank you to him and his wife.\nThe Dutch honeymooner was rescued by about 40 Sri Lankan troops who used rope to slide down the brush-covered cliff and get him to safety."}
