Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said.\n\nThe Senate version has not moved in committee this year. Walden said \u201chopefully this year they will take it up.\u201d\n\nThe legislation calls for the commission to write rules within a year to establish clear timelines when writing rules and to make it easier for the public to know what is before the commission. The bill would make it easier for commissioners to hold nonpublic meetings and make more information available on the FCC website, including a consumer complaint database.\n\nThe bill would also force the commission to explore whether it would be possible to publish the text of regulations before they are approved \u2014 but no mandate would be set.\n\nThe initial legislation that passed out of committee in June included stronger language, requiring the FCC to publish the actual text of rules three weeks before a vote. It would also have required the commission to quickly publish the final text of the rules after a vote.\n\nThose provisions gained steam this year with Republicans, who rallied against the FCC\u2019s vote on net neutrality regulations over the Internet.\n\nThey unsuccessfully pressed the commission to break precedent and release the actual text of the document ahead of a vote. They used the issue as a cudgel, arguing that the FCC was voting on a long and complex item of national importance that only a few had seen.\n\nThat provision did not make it onto the floor Monday. It was removed in order to get Democratic support to get the bill through the House with a suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds majority of those voting.\n\n\u201cWe worked in a bipartisan manner to craft the language that we take up today,\u201d said ranking Democrat of the Energy and Commerce Committee Frank Pallone (N.J.), noting that three Democratic amendments were added.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Some provisions were removed to win Democratic support.", "description": "Some provisions were removed to win Democratic support.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Some provisions were removed to win Democratic support.", "title": "House approves FCC reform bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260329-house-approves-fcc-reform-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260329-house-approves-fcc-reform-bill", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-16T18:03-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-16T18:03:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/260329-house-approves-fcc-reform-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Some provisions were removed to win Democratic support.", "card": "summary", "title": "House approves FCC reform bill"}, "dcterms.title": "House approves FCC reform bill"}, "article_summary": "The legislation, approved by voice vote, is similar to a reform bill passed by the House last Congress that never made its way through the upper chamber.\nThe House on Monday approved a bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to take another look at its rule-making procedures.\nThe bill would make it easier for commissioners to hold nonpublic meetings and make more information available on the FCC website, including a consumer complaint database.\nIt was removed in order to get Democratic support to get the bill through the House with a suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds majority of those voting.\nIt would also have required the commission to quickly publish the final text of the rules after a vote."}
