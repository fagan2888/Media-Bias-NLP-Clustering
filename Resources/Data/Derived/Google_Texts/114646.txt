Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, is back in the majority after the GOP recaptured the Senate. But he says that doesn’t mean his party can relegate Democrats – Coats says, on the contrary, the first priorities of the new session should be bipartisan efforts.

“If we’re going to get the President to sign a bill, it needs to have Democrat names on it,” Coats says.

He says that includes a bill pushing forward the Keystone Pipeline and efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s medical device tax.

Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana, says he’s spoken with newly-minted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, about working together.

“You bring solid legislation that makes sense for our country, that creates jobs, creates opportunity, lowers the deficit, I’m with you every step of the way,” Donnelly says.

Donnelly’s first major bill of the session, redefining a full-time work week under the ACA, is cosponsored with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
