Term limits, for example, are in place for the Florida Legislature and the Sarasota County Commission. But amending the U.S. Constitution to impose term limits on members of Congress has been more difficult. Bills are introduced year after year and go nowhere.\n\nWith Congress unwilling to impose term limits on itself, Blumel is taking the unusual step of trying to convince state leaders to establish a constitutional convention with the sole purpose of establishing congressional term limits. Article 5 of the U.S. Constitution allows the states to force a convention if two-thirds vote in favor.\n\nBlumel knows it sounds like a herculean task to convince lawmakers in 34 states to pass legislation calling for a convention, but he\u2019s convinced it will work, and his group is putting serious money behind the effort.\n\n\u201cU.S. Term Limits is not an organization prone to grand philosophical pronouncements or gestures,\u201d Blumel told a group of Venice Republicans last week. \u201cWe do see that path (to victory) and we\u2019re going down it.\u201d\n\nThe organization is targeting a handful of states for \u201cserious\u201d lobbying efforts in 2016 and plans to spend up to $2 million on the campaign next year. Legislation already has been introduced in Florida. The Senate bill (SM 630) is up for its first committee vote Tuesday.\n\nCritics of term limits say they deprive governments of valuable experience and enhance the power of outside interest groups. Some state lawmakers complain that lobbyists hold more sway in Tallahassee because there are so many inexperienced elected officials.\n\nBlumel and others say it\u2019s just the opposite: That elected officials become more entwined with lobbyists the longer they stay in office and are more independent when they first arrive. They also argue that term limits allow new ideas to proliferate and elevate community service over collecting a paycheck.\n\n\u201cI hope it might take some of the profit motive out of it,\u201d said Barbara Vaugh, a Venice Republican who participated in a lawsuit that sought to enforce Sarasota County\u2019s term limits.\n\nBlumel expects the convention push to quickly gain steam. He pointed to a Gallup poll from 2013 showing 75 percent of U.S. adults support congressional term limits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s immensely popular with both parties,\u201d he said.\n\nFiring up the base\n\nThere are fewer Democrats in Congress than at any time in the last 65 years, but one of the party\u2019s top leaders told a crowd on Longboat Key last week that the problem is more about complacency among voters and how the party is selling itself than the policies espoused.\n\n\u201cWe have delivered mightily for the America people,\u201d U.S. Rep. James Clyburn told the 225 Democrats gathered at the Longboat Key Club and resort. \u201cWe have been on the right side of history on all of these issues but in too many instances people are not aware of where the credit is due.\u201d\n\nA 22-year veteran of Congress from South Carolina, Clyburn is the third-highest ranking Democrat in the House. He said in an interview before his speech that Democrats must embrace the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a law that inspires great enmity on the right \u2014 and partially faulted President Barack Obama for not doing enough to explain its benefits.\n\n\u201cHe let the other side define what we\u2019d done,\u201d Clyburn said.\n\nClyburn recently was put in charge of a new Democratic \u201cOutreach and Engagement Taskforce\u201d designed to fire up Democrats in advance of the 2016 election. He hopes to engage voters by selling them on some of the Obama administration\u2019s achievements, from expanded health care coverage to improved veteran\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cWe as Democrats need to go out and make a little more noise about what we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe congressman was on Longboat Key promoting a new book \u201cBlessed Experiences: Genuinely Southern, Proudly Black.\u201d A longtime civil rights activist who met his wife in jail after a demonstration, Clyburn said recent controversies over the Confederate flag and other racially-charged incidents show \u201cwe have to be vigilant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country is always moving like a pendulum on a clock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought all these battles had been won and would never be fought again, but that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nSenate money chase\n\nState Rep. Greg Steube raised $45,910 in October and extended his fundraising advantage over the two other Republicans seeking the state Senate seat covering Sarasota County.\n\nSteube, R-Sarasota, has $171,779 in cash on hand compared with $100,044 for former Sarasota state Rep. Doug Holder and $78,204 for former Sarasota County Commissioner Nora Patterson.\n\nPatterson raised $14,461 last month and Holder collected $2,500.\n\nSteube is trying to build up a large war chest now because he will be prohibited from raising money during most of January, all of February and part of March when the Legislature is in session. The other two candidates do not face such restrictions.\n\nEvents\n\n\u25a0 The Anna Maria Island Democratic Club meets Monday at 11:30 a.m. at the Seafood Shack.
