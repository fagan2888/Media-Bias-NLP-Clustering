But there\u2019s much public speculation around the 28-year-old\u2019s arrest, death, and its subsequent investigation. Bland was held for three days by the Texas Department of Public Safety for a routine traffic stop \u2014 allegedly for not using a signal when changing lanes. Before her death, Bland was expecting to start a new job and attempted to post bail, raising doubt that she would want to harm herself. Also, tampering is suspected regarding police dash cam footage from the arrest.\n\nThe YouTube video uploaded by the Texas Department of Public Safety depicts a tow truck driver leaving his vehicle and approaching the Texas Department of Public Safety trooper Brian Encinia\u2019s car. The video then shows seconds later the same interaction without digital interruption and Encinia can be heard recalling the traffic stop with Bland encounter. Later in the video, a white car appears and disappears twice before reentering the frame to make a left turn. Encinia\u2019s voice audio continues throughout the scenes without interruption.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where many minority communities for so long have felt that law enforcement was coming in essentially to enforce laws against them, not to protect them.\u201d Lynch said Sunday. \u201cI do think that what has been a important part of the debate in Miss Bland\u2019s death has been the discussions that we\u2019ve seen from community members and police leaders alike\u2026about the importance of training and deescalating incidents.\u201d\n\nDespite Congress delaying her appointment and only being in office a few months, Lynch has wasted no time to bring about change to the DOJ at a time when tensions between police and civilians are running high. She\u2019s been vocal about police tactics and taking a different approach by boosting morale and finding a healing ground between police and marginalized communities of color. In May, Lynch spearheaded an investigation into Baltimore Police Department over the death of Freddie Gray, a black teen who died in police custody. She also took on several FIFA officials, soccer\u2019s international governing agency, for corruption.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"We have a situation where many minority communities for so long have felt that law enforcement was coming in essentially to enforce laws against them, not to protect them.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"We have a situation where many minority communities for so long have felt that law enforcement was coming in essentially to enforce laws against them, not to protect them.\"", "title": "DOJ Head Says Sandra Bland\u2019s Death Epitomizes Police\u2019s Broken Relationship With Black Community", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/07/26/3684554/lynch-comments-on-sandra-bland/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP216249778853.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"We have a situation where many minority communities for so long have felt that law enforcement was coming in essentially to enforce laws against them, not to protect them.\"", "title": "DOJ Head Says Sandra Bland\u2019s Death Epitomizes Police\u2019s Broken Relationship With Black Community", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP216249778853-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@lalaurenista", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP216249778853.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AP216249778853.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T15:09:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/laurencwill"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The YouTube video uploaded by the Texas Department of Public Safety depicts a tow truck driver leaving his vehicle and approaching the Texas Department of Public Safety trooper Brian Encinia\u2019s car.\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch said Sandra Bland\u2019s death while in police custody earlier this month taps into deep-seated fears within the black community: that interactions with law enforcement too frequently end fatally.\nBland was held for three days by the Texas Department of Public Safety for a routine traffic stop \u2014 allegedly for not using a signal when changing lanes.\nIn May, Lynch spearheaded an investigation into Baltimore Police Department over the death of Freddie Gray, a black teen who died in police custody.\nBut there\u2019s much public speculation around the 28-year-old\u2019s arrest, death, and its subsequent investigation."}
