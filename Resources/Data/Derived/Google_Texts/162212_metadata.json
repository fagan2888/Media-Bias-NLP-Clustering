Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc...\u201d\n\nAs devout Roman Catholics, Autocam President and CEO John Kennedy and his family argued the \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act\u201d allowed them to waive the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement to provide contraceptives as part of their company\u2019s private health care coverage.\n\nThough the Kennedy\u2019s lost their claim before U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker and their appeal to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals last year, lawyers for Hobby Lobby won a similar claim when their appeal was heard before the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a 5-4 decision announced June 30, the high court ruled that Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners were protected by the \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act\u201d from fulfilling Obamacare\u2019s mandate to provide birth control and sterilization drugs as part of their health care coverage.\n\nTom Ciesielka, a spokesman for The Thomas More Society, said their nonprofit group asked the high court to review and reverse the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals\u2019 decision on Autocam\u2019s behalf.\n\nCiesielka said their lawyers expect the 6th Circuit Court will act on the Supreme Court ruling rather than sending the case back to Jonker\u2019s courtroom, where it was first rejected.\n\nAlthough Autocam has since sold its automotive business to a publicly-held company that will be required to comply with the Obamacare mandates, Kennedy has said he will continue to seek the exception for the Autocam medical device business his family has retained.\n\nRELATED: Autocam's lawyers headed back to court after Supreme Court affirms their stance in Hobby Lobby ruling\n\nJim Harger covers business for MLive/Grand Rapids Press.
