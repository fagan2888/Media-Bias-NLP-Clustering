The GOP-controlled House of Representatives decided to shut down the government rather than pass a spending bill that funds the Affordable Care Act,\" reads the petition, started by CourageCampaign Executive Chairman Paul Song. \u201cCongress should take responsibility for their own inaction and lose their paychecks until they come to a resolution.\"\n\nWhile over 800,000 federal workers are currently furloughed without pay \u2014 and no guarantee of receiving back pay \u2014 rank-and-file members of Congress will continue to earn their $174,000 annual salaries throughout the impasse. Congressional pay is protected by the 27th Amendment, which states that no law changing the rate of compensation for members may take effect until after an election in the House of Representatives.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.) introduced the \"No Government \u2014 No Pay Act,\" which would stop members from being paid until the government is back up and running.\n\n\"The inability of this Congress to collaborate, compromise, and get things done has led me to introduce legislation to prohibit Members from being paid when failure to do their job results in a government shutdown,\" Nolan said in a statement. \"It\u2019s time for Congress to start living in the real world \u2013 where you either do your job, or you don\u2019t get paid.\"\n\nMany lawmakers have decided to either forfeit or donate their compensation until a solution is reached.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 2013 Government Shutdown Protests 2013 Government Shutdown Protests\n\n1 of 65 'Hands Off My Obamacare' Activists with the California Alliance for Retired Americans hold placards while gathered for a die-in to protest the government shutdown and possible effects on senior citizens in front of the Federal Building in Los Angeles on October 16, 2013.
