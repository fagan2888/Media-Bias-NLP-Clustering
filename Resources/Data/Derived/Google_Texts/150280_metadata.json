If you're looking at how many folks are insured, yes.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was signed into law almost six years ago, and the White House seems pretty content with how it\u2019s been going.\n\nSo just how well is the ACA \u2014 or, Obamacare \u2014 really doing? If you\u2019re only looking at it terms of how many Americans have health insurance, not bad.\n\nAfter the law came into effect, nearly 23 million people gained health insurance \u2014 although about 6 million lost their insurance in same period. The net positive was 17 million more people with insurance.\n\nSince 2016\u2019s enrollment period began in November, more than 8.5 million people signed up for or renewed their coverage through the federal insurance marketplaces.\n\nThe total number of uninsured Americans is decreasing, too. For the first time since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been keeping records, the amount of uninsured Americans has fallen below 10 percent.\n\nBut the number of insured Americans isn\u2019t the only number going up \u2014 some costs are too.\n\nThe cost of premiums for the ACA\u2019s most popular \u201csilver\u201d plan is expected to rise by double digits. That\u2019s not a trend unique to government health care, though \u2014 individual premiums have been on the rise for years.\n\nAnd the penalty for not having insurance is jumping to $695 or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is higher.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act is getting close to being six years old \u2014 but is it working?
