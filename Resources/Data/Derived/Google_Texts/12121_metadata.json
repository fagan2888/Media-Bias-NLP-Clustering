Florida has passed similar legislation that is waiting to be signed by Gov. Rick Scott (R), although Florida\u2019s resolution process is voluntary. Other states will likely soon follow.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, both providers and insurers are under pressure from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to resolve this issue and CMS is warning that the government may intervene if they don\u2019t. \u201cThe industry can solve this problem without our help, but with a lot of strong encouragement, and I think they would be wise to do that,\u201d Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of CMS, told The Huffington Post. \u201cI refuse to believe that this is as difficult as people say it is.\u201d\n\nPotential solutions\n\nIn The Huffington Post article, Slavitt offered are a number of potential solutions that will keep patients from being hit with surprise medical bills, including:\n\nRequiring providers to disclose upfront that they aren\u2019t in-network\n\nCreating blanket exceptions for emergency care\n\nDesigning health insurance plans that limit patient exposure to out-of-network charges\n\nInstituting new payment models under which a hospital receives a lump sum and distributes the money to anyone who participated in the patient\u2019s care.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be seeing me playing a very visible, public role trying to bring people to make progress on this issue on their own, and if they don\u2019t, we have regulatory tools,\u201d Slavitt said. \u201cThis is a personal passion of mine.\u201d\n\nWhat some insurers are doing\n\nIn an article for Modern Healthcare, Bob Herman said that although the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to pay out-of-network emergency providers at network rates, patients in many states still receiving surprise medical bills. According to Herman, UnitedHealthcare has announced it will reduce reimbursement for out-of-network emergency physicians who practice at in-network hospitals because the company believes some physicians are seeking \u201cexcessively high reimbursement levels.\u201d This will leave UnitedHealthcare members with potentially large out-of-pocket bills.\n\nBut other insurers are working to resolve the problem to avoid public outrage. For example, Jill Syracuse, chief engagement officer at Independent Health, a not-for-profit insurer in Buffalo, N.Y., told Modern Healthcare that it has staff in its cost-containment division who are solely responsible for handling members' concerns about surprise medical bills. Staff members negotiate with providers on behalf of patients with the goal of coming up with a payment that is based on reasonable and customary rates. \u201cWhen a member has followed every rule, they should be held harmless from any consequences,\u201d Syracuse said. \u201cIt's the right thing to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Julie Henry", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/b8/f4/b8f4126a289cea805f2d2f158b276b43.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Payer", "category": "News Post", "sailthru.item_featured": 1, "title": "Surprise medical bills: Who should cover the costs?", "pub_date": "apr 19, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-19T15:43:42", "content_boost": 5, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Tuesday, April 19, 2016, 03:43 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-04-07T15:43:42", "teaser": "<p>Parties disagree as to whether insurers should cover the extra costs or providers should bill at in-network rates.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-19", "sailthru.description": "Parties disagree as to whether insurers should cover the extra costs or providers should bill at in-network rates.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Parties disagree as to whether insurers should cover the extra costs or providers should bill at in-network rates.", "title": "Surprise medical bills: Who should cover the costs?", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/surprise-medical-bills-who-should-cover-the-costs/417711/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Young-couple-reviewing-their-bills.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/fc/92/fc920d3896c2904629a0604129a52038.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Surprise medical bills: Who should cover the costs?\nAlthough all parties involved tend to agree consumers shouldn\u2019t be subjected to surprise medical bills, they disagree as to whether the insurers should cover the extra costs or the providers should bill at in-network rates.\nResults of a 2015 Consumer Reports survey show over a two-year period, 30% of Americans who were privately insured received a surprise medical bill (a medical bill in which the health plan paid less than was expected).\nFor example, Jill Syracuse, chief engagement officer at Independent Health, a not-for-profit insurer in Buffalo, N.Y., told Modern Healthcare that it has staff in its cost-containment division who are solely responsible for handling members' concerns about surprise medical bills.\n\u201cThis is a personal passion of mine.\u201dWhat some insurers are doingIn an article for Modern Healthcare, Bob Herman said that although the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to pay out-of-network emergency providers at network rates, patients in many states still receiving surprise medical bills."}
