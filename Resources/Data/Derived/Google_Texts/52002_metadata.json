The main effect of the company\u2019s decision was that moderate-income Iowans could not choose Wellmark insurance if they wanted to purchase policies that qualified for new federal subsidies to help pay premiums.\n\nOther insurers have participated in the marketplace, also known as an exchange. Three carriers are selling policies statewide for 2016. Wellmark announced Monday that it will start selling policies on the marketplace for 2017, because the online system has become more reliable and because the legality of the federal subsidies has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said from day one we\u2019d be there, and we meant it,\u201d Wellmark Chairman John Forsyth said in an interview Monday.\n\nMost other Blue Cross plans nationally have participated in their states\u2019 exchanges, and Iowa\u2019s governor and insurance commissioner encouraged Wellmark to do so. But Forsyth correctly predicted in 2013 that the Obamacare website wasn\u2019t going to work well. Wellmark leaders also said existing policy holders could be harmed if the company lost money in a new market with unclear financial risks.\n\nForsyth said he supports the idea of having the government subsidize premium payments of moderate-income Americans. But Wellmark saw before the launch that the electronic marketplaces were poorly designed, he said.\n\n\u201cWe were convinced it was going to be an awful experience\u201d for consumers, he said.\n\nThe Obamacare website routinely crashed or froze in its first months of service, embarrassing the Obama administration and frustrating consumers and insurance agents.\n\nThe front end of the website, which consumers see, has gotten much better since then, Forsyth said. But there still are serious problems in the back end of the site, which insurers must use to fulfill orders, he said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it took as long as it did to fix it.\u201d\n\nHe expressed confidence that the whole system would be running well by next fall, when 2017 policies go on sale.\n\nWellmark is the best-known health insurer in Iowa, where it sells more than three-quarters of individual policies. Critics have said Wellmark\u2019s reluctance to join the Obamacare exchange discouraged Iowans from checking out their options and realizing they might qualify for subsidies. Just 18 percent of Iowans who might qualify for such subsidies obtained them for this year, according to a report from the Kaiser Health Foundation.\n\nForsyth said some customers left Wellmark to purchase other companies\u2019 policies and obtain the subsidies. But he said overall, the company is selling more individual policies now than before the Affordable Care Act took effect.\n\nThousands of longstanding Wellmark customers have been able to retain plans that predate implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Some of those people are slated to lose access to those policies in October 2016, Forsyth said. They might gain an incentive to consider other companies\u2019 plans, but he said that possibility was not a major factor in Wellmark\u2019s decision to join the exchange.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1RqRbZo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The health-insurer, which is Iowa's largest by far, has declined to participate in subsidy-eligible marketplace.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "The health-insurer, which is Iowa's largest by far, has declined to participate in subsidy-eligible marketplace.", "title": "Wellmark to sell policies on Obamacare exchange for 2017", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2015/10/05/wellmark-sell-policies-obamacare-exchange-2017/73376498/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The health-insurer, which is Iowa's largest by far, has declined to participate in subsidy-eligible marketplace.", "title": "Wellmark to sell policies on Obamacare exchange for 2017", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a32cd2d332dee4b15a4932b0702ecb472569bdf/r=x643&c=640x640/http/assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/fd07c0935a195c9a2e71f6e5df50a28abd104de0/c=0-68-263-331/local/-/media/DesMoines/2013/12/18/forsythmugshot.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "title": "Wellmark to sell policies on Obamacare exchange for 2017", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/6d7c886ec903df791e7fdd039bf7d1a3cf2206fa/c=0-24-263-375/local/-/media/DesMoines/2013/12/18/forsythmugshot.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/fd07c0935a195c9a2e71f6e5df50a28abd104de0/c=0-68-263-331/local/-/media/DesMoines/2013/12/18/forsythmugshot.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/d2cd71c92695e425c2548ceee0832971131a2460/c=0-102-263-299/local/-/media/DesMoines/2013/12/18/forsythmugshot.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/78e13c4d25b51143781572f7873d63f3fa38723d/r=x633&c=1200x630/http/assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/baa83d475e3d29210024d16e1cd392beba965383/c=0-126-263-274/local/-/media/DesMoines/2013/12/18/forsythmugshot.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-10-05T16:50:21.460000-05:00", "shorthed": "Wellmark to sell on exchange for 2017", "articleid": 73376498, "image-16-9": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/baa83d475e3d29210024d16e1cd392beba965383/c=0-126-263-274/local/-/media/DesMoines/2013/12/18/forsythmugshot.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/ce2a5967c0d6fe095b0d56b3397f71cd1a80db9d/c=19-0-244-400/local/-/media/DesMoines/2013/12/18/forsythmugshot.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1da\"", "article_summary": "John ForsythIowa\u2019s dominant health insurer has agreed to start selling policies a year from now that qualify for Obamacare subsidies.\nThree carriers are selling policies statewide for 2016.\nWellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield has not participated in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online health insurance marketplace, which launched in the fall of 2013.\nBut Forsyth correctly predicted in 2013 that the Obamacare website wasn\u2019t going to work well.\nThe Obamacare website routinely crashed or froze in its first months of service, embarrassing the Obama administration and frustrating consumers and insurance agents."}
