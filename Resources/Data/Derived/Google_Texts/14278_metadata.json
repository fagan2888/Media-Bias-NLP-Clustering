From Europe and around the world came pleas that the U.S. not squander this global goodwill. I recall the words of my brother John, a French-American Medieval scholar and co-author of \u201cEurope and Islam: Fifteen Centuries of History,\u201d who wrote then from France: \u201cThis massive unity of public opinion and political will provides the United States with a tremendous opportunity and risk: the chance to capitalize on this good will and the danger of taking action that will splinter the forces that stand with us now.\u201d\n\nOf course, we blew it, instead pursuing a foolhardy war under false pretense and prompting a 14-year ongoing nightmare: half a million Iraqi civilians dead, by one estimate, a deep and abiding rage against America and its occupation, and a mighty vacuum in the wake of Saddam Hussein that prompted the rise of ISIS and the biggest global refugee crisis since World War II.\n\nNow, the fury has exploded, again: 129 people dead in Paris at the hands of a twisted ideology forged in a cauldron of rage, disenfranchisement, perverse religious interpretation and cool military calculation. And again, the West is faced with a choice: lash out in vengeance, stigmatize certain immigrants, and seal off the borders, or devise a more measured response in keeping with values that for centuries have led refugees to Western shores.\n\nClearly ISIS prefers a Western response grounded in vengeance and xenophobia. In early 2015, an article in Dabiq, the ISIS magazine, described an apocalyptic war between good and evil. The article celebrated the Charlie Hebdo massacre and \u201cthe blessed operations of September 11th,\u201d endorsing a \u201ccall to Muslims everywhere \u2026 to carry out attacks against the crusaders wherever they may be found, with money and weapons so as to call to jih\u0101d \u2026 to further bring division to the world \u2026\u201d This emerging world is \u201cdivided into two camps,\u201d the article proclaimed, quoting Osama bin Laden\u2019s ironic endorsement of the words of George W. Bush: \u201cBush spoke the truth when he said, \u2018Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.\u2019 Meaning, either you are with the crusade or you are with Islam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greater the hostility toward Muslims in Europe and the deeper the West becomes involved in military action in the Middle East, the closer ISIS comes to its goal of creating and managing chaos,\u201d write Scott Atran and Nafees Hamid in \u201cThe War ISIS wants,\u201d an article in the New York Review of Books. Indeed the ISIS vision is already playing out across devastated landscapes in Iraq and Syria, in flotillas of rubber dinghies in the Mediterranean, and in the streams of refugees moving north into the heart of Europe. Now, as anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment builds, hard-right nativists in Europe and America are operating precisely as ISIS hoped they would.\n\nThe Dabiq article foresaw increasing repression against Muslims in the West, which could eventually lead to a Muslim repatriation \u201cto the Islamic State\u2026thereby escap[ing] persecution of the crusader government and citizens.\u201d What ISIS calls the \u201cgrayzone\u201d \u2013 the Western landscape where Muslims can seek safety and live peaceably with their secular neighbors \u2013 is \u201con the brink of extinction.\u201d Thus do the Islamic State and the empowered global right \u2013 from France\u2019s National Front to Austria\u2019s Freedom Party to the Republican Congress and presidential candidates in the U.S. \u2013 forge common cause. President Obama mocked Republicans this week, saying they were afraid of \u201cwidows and orphans,\u201d and adding, \u201cWe are not well served when, in response to a terrorist attack, we descend into fear and panic.\u201d The remarks prompted Donald Trump to label Obama a threat to the nation, and Ted Cruz to challenge the president to \u201cinsult me to my face.\u201d The next day, by a landslide the House voted to drastically tighten screening for Syrian refugees, even though it already takes 18 to 24 months to process them \u2014 hardly a procedure terrorists would submit to.\n\n\u201cAmerican politicians just don\u2019t have a basic understanding of the threat that we face,\u201d Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy, told Al Monitor. ISIS, he said, \u201cwants to provoke a clash of civilizations. That\u2019s the intent. So when we use similar language, we\u2019re falling into their trap.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, amid Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s pledge of a \u201cmerciless war\u201d and GOP-led efforts to ban Syrian refugees (unless they are Christian), a small chorus of dissenting voices has urged calm. \u201cAn event like this cannot shake the foundations of society unless we let it,\u201d Harvard professor of international relations Stephen Walt argues in Foreign Policy. \u201cIf the Islamic State can get France and other countries to crack down on their Muslim citizens and also get the West to reoccupy large swaths of the Middle East, then its false narrative about the West\u2019s deep and intrinsic antipathy to Islam will gain more credence, as will its carefully cultivated image as the staunchest defender of Islam today.\u201d\n\nWalt, while taking pains to underscore that he is \u201cmost certainly not defending, excusing, or rationalizing\u201d terrorism, nevertheless declares: \u201cAt the same time, to pretend that American and European actions have nothing whatsoever to do with this problem is to bury one\u2019s head in the sand and ignore the obvious.\u201d He adds:\n\nDecades of misguided U.S. and European policies have left many people in the Arab and Islamic world deeply angry at and resentful toward the West. Those policies include the West\u2019s cozy coddling of various Arab dictators, its blind support for Israel\u2019s brutal policies toward the Palestinians, and its own willingness to wage air campaigns, employ sanctions, or invade Middle Eastern countries whenever it thinks doing so suits its short-term interest.\n\nIn the days after 9/11 in America, when fear gripped the nation and mainstream news anchors began to wear American flag lapel pins during their broadcasts, such sentiments \u2013 from Susan Sontag in the New Yorker and Bill Maher on \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d \u2013 were viciously attacked. In France in 2015, according to close observers, there is a similar resistance to look within. Most if not all of the Paris attackers, after all, were not refugees fleeing Syria, but the European-born sons and grandsons of Arab and North African migrants to France and Belgium.(Which makes suspending the entry of Syrian refugees to the U.S. all the more senseless.) In France, their homes are in the banlieues, the marginalized, neglected suburbs (sometimes called \u201czones of banishment\u201d) at the edge of Paris, and other like communities.\n\nJust after the attacks, a friend of mine, an American-born businessman based for two decades between Asia and France who worked and was educated in Paris (and who requested anonymity because of his business dealings), wrote a letter to a Paris-based friend. The attackers, my friend wrote,", "article_metadata": {"description": "We had global goodwill after 9/11 and squandered it in Iraq.
