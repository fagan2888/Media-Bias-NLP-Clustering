Key findings in the 2014 Telemedicine Survey Report include:\n\nExecutives are Embracing Telemedicine\n\nIndustry leaders believe telemedicine has arrived. Why? For the majority of respondents, it\u2019s simple \u2013 they believe telemedicine will keep patients healthier.\n\nNine out of 10 report that their organizations have already begun developing or implementing a telemedicine program\n\n84% say that offering meaningful telemedicine services will be central to the success of their organizations\n\nThe majority of respondents already offer remote patient monitoring services (64%), store and forward technology (54%) and real-time interaction capabilities (52%)\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is Driving Telemedicine Advancements\n\nAs health care providers move from a fee-for-service model to one that reimburses based on positive patient outcomes, executives face increased financial pressure to keep patients healthy. Given that the Affordable Care Act penalizes hospitals for excessive numbers of readmissions and hospital-acquired conditions, remote touch points may be more profitable.\n\n50% of respondents said the potential to improve quality of care was the primary motivator in adopting telemedicine\n\n18% ranked reaching new patients as their top motivation, demonstrating the potential for telemedicine to counsel and treat patients despite their physical location\n\n\u201cIn the post-Obamacare paradigm, providers bear a much greater responsibility for the sustained wellness of their patients,\u201d said Nathaniel Lacktman, a partner and health care lawyer at Foley. \u201cTelemedicine offers new ways for providers to manage this new level of risk and keep their patients healthy, happy and out of the hospital.\u201d\n\nReimbursement is the Primary Obstacle to Implementation\n\nLeaders were less confident about telemedicine\u2019s imminent adoption, primarily due to reimbursement issues. Regulators and insurers have made it challenging to get paid for medicine practiced outside of traditional interactions.\n\n41% of respondents said they do not get reimbursed at all for telemedicine services\n\n21% reported receiving lower rates from managed care companies for telemedicine than for in-person care\n\nreported receiving lower rates from managed care companies for telemedicine than for in-person care Nearly half (48%) expressed concern about educating physicians on telemedicine as a credible avenue for care\n\nView Foley\u2019s 2014 Telemedicine Survey Report here.\n\nAbout Foley & Lardner LLP\n\nWith approximately 900 attorneys in 20 offices, Foley & Lardner LLP provides award-winning business and legal insight to clients across the country and around the world.
