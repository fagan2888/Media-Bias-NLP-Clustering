Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neurobiological disorder that neither society nor mental health professionals fully understand, finds TED Ed. In a recent video, TED Ed aims to debunk the myths of OCD in order to make it easier for potential sufferers to seek help.

The first myth is the idea OCD is synonymous with repetitive, or ritualistic, behaviors. There are two aspects of OCD: intrusive thoughts, images, and impulses, as well as the behavioral compulsions to relieve their intrusions. While the commonly given example is excessive hand-washing, this isn’t necessarily a symptom of OCD. This, instead, could be an obsessive tendency.

Someone with OCD, which TED Ed cites is actually a rare disorder, will have little or no control over their intrusive thoughts and compulsions, ultimately impeding their work, school, and social life. And something like excessive hygiene is hardly the “main symptom” of the disorder; obsessions and compulsions can manifest as fears of contamination or illness.

Experts believe the brains of OCD sufferers are hardwired to function a certain way. The three affected regions — the orbitofrontal, caudate nucleus, and cingulate gyrus — play respective roles in social behavior, as well as emotional and motivational responses. OCD is also associated with lower levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which the brain regions use to help regulate vital processes.

If someone is diagnosed with OCD, there are effective treatments available, from medication to behavioral therapy. The National Institute for Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health has found OCD "usually responds well to treatment." As TED Ed concludes, "With knowledge and understanding comes the power to seek help."
