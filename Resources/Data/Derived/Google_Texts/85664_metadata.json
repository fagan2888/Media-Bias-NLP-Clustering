Since 2005 Florida has had a waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid establishing a Low Income Pool, which last year provided about $2 billion in funds to support Florida\u2019s 15 safety net hospitals. But the centers have said that waiver, which expires at the end of June, will not be renewed,\n\nThe Florida Senate released a budget proposal Thursday that includes nearly $2.2 billion for the continuation of the Low Income Pool program.\n\nState Sen. Aaron Bean, R-Fernandina Beach, chairman of the Senate\u2019s Committee on Health Policy, said that while the Legislature has no plan to expand Medicaid in Florida under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the Senate plan would greatly expand the number of people covered by Medicaid in Florida, extending it to anyone whose household income is below 138 percent of the poverty level.\n\nIn exchange, the recipients would be required to work, volunteer or go to school. Negotiations between the state Agency for Health Care Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid are ongoing, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the federal government could make that work,\u201d said Bean, who works for UF Health as relationship development officer. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to close hospitals.\u201d\n\nIf the Legislature doesn\u2019t maintain UF Health Jacksonville funding, the resulting shortfall can\u2019t be erased with budget cuts, said Kevin Hyde, who led a UF Health Task Force for the Civic Council. The Civic Council hired the accounting firm Dixon Hughes Goodman to audit UF Health Jacksonville\u2019s operations. What the audit found is that UF Health is a very efficient operation, Hyde said.\n\n\u201cIn fact it\u2019s amazing they operate as well as they do with the resources they have, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few safety net hospitals that does not have taxing authority.\u201d\n\nBean noted that UF Health Jacksonville gets paid 19 cents for each dollar of health care it provides, which is why its needs funding from state and federal sources.\n\nDuring the news conference, UF Health Jacksonville\u2019s CEO Russell Armstead was asked if the new Northside medical facility UF Health North, which recently opened an emergency room and medical office building on Max Leggett Boulevard and will eventually include a hospital, could offset a funding loss. He said while UF Health North should eventually generate some profit, it\u2019s not going to happen soon enough to make a difference during the next fiscal year. The letter from the Civic Council noted that UF Health has only 55 days of cash reserves available.\n\nIn addition to serving as the area\u2019s safety net hospital and trauma center, UF Health Jacksonville, with about 5,000 employees, is Jacksonville\u2019s sixth-largest employer and largest minority employer. It is also a major academic health center with about 350 University of Florida faculty physicians and 350 resident physicians.\n\nCharlie Patton: (904) 359-4413", "article_metadata": {"description": "UF Health Jacksonville, Northeast Florida\u2019s only trauma center and only safety net hospital, could be forced to close its doors if the Florida Legislature doesn\u2019t act to maintain its current funding level, officials of the JAX Chamber and the Jacksonville Civic Council warn.\u201cAny reduction in its current funding will put the hospital at risk of failure,\u201d said a letter sent to the Senate president, the speaker of the House and the eight members of the Duval Legislative Delegation by the Civic Council, which represents about 70 CEOs and business leaders in Northeast Florida.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "UF Health Jacksonville, Northeast Florida's only trauma one center and only safety net hospital, could be forced to close its doors if t he Florida Legislature doesn't act to maintain its current funding level, officials of the JAX Chamber and the Jacksonville Civic Council warn.", "title": "Looming funding crisis for UF Health Jacksonville could lead to 'catastrophe,' officials warn", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/news/health-and-fitness/2015-03-20/story/looming-funding-crisis-uf-health-jacksonville-could-lead", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/met_12TraumaCenter_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Health and Fitness, Metro, News", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"msm-image150": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense150x111/met_12TraumaCenter_0_0.jpg", "msm-image319": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense319x185/met_12TraumaCenter_0_0.jpg", "articleid": 642067, "publishtime": "2015-03-20T15:27:37Z", "msm-image320": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense320/met_12TraumaCenter_0_0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeca3\"", "article_summary": "UF Health Jacksonville has about 90,000 patient visits to its emergency department annually, including 4,000 trauma patients, many of those visits from people who are uninsured or underinsured.\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the federal government could make that work,\u201d said Bean, who works for UF Health as relationship development officer.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to close hospitals.\u201dIf the Legislature doesn\u2019t maintain UF Health Jacksonville funding, the resulting shortfall can\u2019t be erased with budget cuts, said Kevin Hyde, who led a UF Health Task Force for the Civic Council.\nAbout $95 million in funding, which represents about 17 percent of UF Health Jacksonville\u2019s $550 million annual budget, is at risk.\nThe letter from the Civic Council noted that UF Health has only 55 days of cash reserves available."}
