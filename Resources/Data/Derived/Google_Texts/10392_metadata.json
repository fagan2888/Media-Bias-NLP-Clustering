(Photo: Staff Photographer )Buy Photo\n\nA controversial proposal to build a 312-unit apartment complex in the township is at a standstill.\n\nThe township Zoning Board of Adjustment met Wednesday to hear more testimony from attorneys representing the Tinton Falls-based developer Hovsons and Friends of Neptune LLC but did not reach a decision.\n\nThe hearing is expected to continue on Dec. 3 when the board likely will decide whether to approve the proposal, officials say.\n\nResidents in Neptune Manor for the past 18 months have been contesting Hovson\u2019s proposal to construct a luxury apartment community called Victoria Gardens on Route 33 and Hovchild Boulevard. They maintain that the three-story complex would tower over their neighborhood of mostly ranch-style homes and create traffic, noise and drainage issues.\n\nTwo residents, Christina Schuetz and Tom Argentieri, formed Friends of Neptune LLC last year and hired Red Bank attorney Ronald Gasiorowski to represent them.\n\nOcean Township attorney Jennifer S. Krimko is representing Hovsons.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s never ending, but that\u2019s the process,\u201d said Schuetz, who lives on Oakcrest. \u201cWe never envisioned that we\u2019d still be here 18 months later.\u201d\n\nThe board has held at least nine special meetings most of which involved testimony from expert witnesses and cross examination. Members of the public and the board also had a chance to question the witnesses.\n\nOn Wednesday, both parties brought professional planners to the witness stand.\n\nHovsons planner Andrew Janiw addressed a number of questions from local residents dealing with the height of the apartment buidings and the demographics of potential residents.\n\nJaniw insisted that three stories would not be too high for the neighborhood and that the developer had studied similar apartment complexes in Neptune such as the Avalon Tinton Falls.\n\nHe said the developer is targeting young professionals and empty nesters for the complex who are not likely to be a disturbance to the neighborhood.\n\nFriends of Neptune LLC planner Peter Steck said during his testimony that the Victoria Gardens proposal should not qualify for a use variance, which the developer needs because the land is zoned for commercial use.\n\n\u201cThis may be too big, too intense to be a variance,\u201d Steck said. \u201cThis is really too big for an exception of the law.\u201d\n\nKrimko and Janiw declined to comment outside of what was discussed publicly during the hearing.\n\nMartha Applegate, who lives in Roberts Drive, said she believes the land would be better suited for a low-level yoga studio or a health foods store.\n\n\u201c(The apartment complex) is going to tower and shadow over the neighborhood,\u201d Applegate said.\n\nNicquel Terry; nterry@app.com; 732-643-4023\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1tEAi15", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Zoning Board postpones next meeting for December.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Zoning Board postpones next meeting for December.", "title": "No decision on controversial Neptune apartment plan", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/eatontown-asbury-park/2014/09/11/decision-neptune-apartment-proposal/15488781/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Zoning Board postpones next meeting for December.", "title": "No decision on Neptune apartment proposal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/80cc77df6bd2b90b80cbaf11940ac46d9743175d/c=0-297-2790-3087&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/09/11/-jacschl061814d.jpg20140618.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/nicquel.terry"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c52\"", "article_summary": "Two residents opposed to a 312-unit apartment complex formed Friends of Neptune LLC last year and hired Gasiorowski to represent them.\n(Photo: Staff Photographer )Buy PhotoA controversial proposal to build a 312-unit apartment complex in the township is at a standstill.\n\u201c(The apartment complex) is going to tower and shadow over the neighborhood,\u201d Applegate said.\nResidents in Neptune Manor for the past 18 months have been contesting Hovson\u2019s proposal to construct a luxury apartment community called Victoria Gardens on Route 33 and Hovchild Boulevard.\nTwo residents, Christina Schuetz and Tom Argentieri, formed Friends of Neptune LLC last year and hired Red Bank attorney Ronald Gasiorowski to represent them."}
