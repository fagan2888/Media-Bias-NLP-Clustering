He brought with him a backpack full of tools and electronic parts: a soldering iron, some fuses, a jeweler\u2019s loupe.\n\nI had summoned him to work his magic on a turntable and an integrated receiver/amp, legacy hi-fi stereo components that had emerged from a couple of years of storage in a state of severe dysfunction. The local repair shop in Berkeley that I depended on for years for things like this had gone out of business. But their Web page pointed me to Gene, who looked to be pushing 70, but was still doing good business making house calls across the greater San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nHe took apart my receiver, socketed his loupe in his left eye, and started eyeballing the exposed circuit boards. He explained to me that he was looking for spots where the soldering welds were starting to crack \u2014 a frequent cause of degradation in aging stereo equipment, but something he could easily fix with some fresh solder or a judicious application of heat.\n\nI marveled at the sight. There was something deliciously old-school artisanal in his ability to diagnose silicon woes simply by looking at circuit boards. Where I saw inscrutable mystery, he perceived the mundane.\n\nGene spent a couple of hours repairing my equipment. But even as he brought my hi-fi back to life, I felt as if I was witnessing the last nails in the coffin of a passing era. My amp wasn\u2019t built to last forever; eventually its sustenance would be beyond human help. Gene too would be gone. Strive as I might to maintain my nostalgic atavism in the face of onrushing obsolescence, I know that this too shall pass. My children find the whole charade very quaint.\n\nI was reminded of Gene\u2019s visit earlier this week when I read a lovely essay in The Atlantic by Adrienne LaFrance investigating the relentless decay and degradation of our old compact disks. It\u2019s true: The \u201990s are already fading into dust! Too soon! Too soon!\n\nLaFrance writes:\n\nYes, the ubiquity of a once dominant media is again receding. Like most of the technology we leave behind, CDs are are being forgotten slowly. Eventually, even the fragments disappear. No more metallic shards of broken discs glinting from the gutter. No more old strands of tape cassette tangled in tree branches like tinsel. We stop using old formats little by little. They stop working. We stop replacing them. And, before long, they\u2019re gone.\n\nLook on my CD collection, ye mighty, and despair! True enough. True enough. All things must go.\n\nAnd yet: Vinyl record sales rose to a 15-year-high in 2013. In May, the largest vinyl pressing plant in the U.S. announced it was expanding operations.\n\nThe total dollar figure of vinyl sales in the U.S. in 2013 was only $177 million; which, in the context of the entire music industry, represents little more than hipster affectation. But here\u2019s something to ponder: Will compact disks ever see a similar resurgence? I\u2019m guessing no. There\u2019s no point to it. CDs, as objects, have no cultural heft, no analog quirks to savor. They were merely the cheapest way, at the time, to deliver a package of ones and zeroes. Once you\u2019ve ripped your old CDs, or switched to a streaming music service, there\u2019s zero reason to keep them around.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the 1990s recede from view, their most important cultural artifacts are collecting \u2014 and turning into \u2014 dust", "author": "Andrew Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As the 1990s recede from view, their most important cultural artifacts are collecting \u2014 and turning into \u2014 dust", "title": "Why the \u201990s are literally disappearing from history", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/17/why_the_90s_are_literally_disappearing_from_history/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/saved_by_the_bell_tv.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the 1990s recede from view, their most important cultural artifacts are collecting \u2014 and turning into \u2014 dust", "creator": "@koxinga21", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/saved_by_the_bell_tv.jpg", "title": "Why the \u201990s are literally disappearing from history", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why the \u201990s are literally disappearing from history", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1990s, CDs, Editor's Picks, Music, Pop Culture, the nineties", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefcc\"", "article_summary": "Once you\u2019ve ripped your old CDs, or switched to a streaming music service, there\u2019s zero reason to keep them around.\nWe stop using old formats little by little.\nHe took apart my receiver, socketed his loupe in his left eye, and started eyeballing the exposed circuit boards.\nHe brought with him a backpack full of tools and electronic parts: a soldering iron, some fuses, a jeweler\u2019s loupe.\nThe local repair shop in Berkeley that I depended on for years for things like this had gone out of business."}
