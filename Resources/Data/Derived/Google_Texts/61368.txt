Q: Do all whole grains contain dietary fiber? What are other sources of fiber?

A: Your questions are important because they focus on two healthful eating goals: 1) Eat more whole grains and 2) Eat more dietary fiber.

Whole grains contain the essential parts and naturally occurring nutrients of the entire grain seed — the bran, germ and endosperm. Oats and barley are whole grains. Whole-wheat flour is a whole-grain ingredient in bread and pasta.

Over 40 percent of Americans never eat any whole grains. Surprising? Not with all the bread, baked goods and pizza made with refined flour that we eat.

Dietary fiber includes the portions of plant-based foods that are not digested plus beneficial fibers added by manufacturers. Our foods contain hundreds of fibers — some help with digestion and regularity, others improve blood fats and others help with weight control. You need all types.

Dietary fiber is found in whole grains, legumes (beans and peas), fruits and vegetables. To eat enough, get it from all food sources.

Most Americans get nowhere close to the 25 grams per day recommended for adults.

To eat more whole grains:

• Get to know the whole grains and which ones contain lots of fiber.

• Choose brown rice over white rice (even in restaurants) and whole-wheat over white pasta.

• Select whole-grain (and high-fiber) cereals. For hot cereal, try oatmeal, oat bran or quinoa. With dry cereals, look for a whole-oat or whole-grain cereal that's also high in fiber.

• Select whole-grain bread, rolls or pizza crust. If there's no stamp or claim, check the ingredients. It needs to say whole-grain, whole wheat, whole or stone-ground whole.

To eat more fiber:

• Educate yourself about fiber content by checking labels or looking them up with a food nutrient app.

• Eat 2 1/2 cups each of fruit and vegetables per day — more if you've got the calories to spare.

• Eat more legumes — dried, frozen or canned.
