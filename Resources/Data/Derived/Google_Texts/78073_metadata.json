More than two million people in the U.S. develop drug-resistant infections each year and at least 23,000 of them die as a result. Yet most antibiotic resistant infections are only identified long after a patient has left the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nThe diagnostic hitch is how long it takes for bacteria to grow in the laboratory. The standard method for identifying drug resistance is to take a sample from a wound, blood or urine and expose resident bacteria to various drugs. If the bacterial colony continues to divide and thrive despite the presence of a normally effective drug, it indicates the microbes are drug-resistant. The wait time for such answers, however, is typically between 16 and 20 hours.\n\nNew innovations in engineering are allowing scientists to speed up that diagnostic process by sidestepping the need to watch for bacterial division altogether. A novel approach involves observing how the structure of individual bacterial cells changes in response to such antibiotic exposure, and only takes three to four hours. This rapid test could help clinicians to more quickly identify the best antibiotic and switch patients over to the correct treatment course, the study\u2019s lead author Sunghoon Kwon of Seoul National University wrote via e-mail. The new findings were published in the December 17 Science Translational Medicine.\n\nDeveloping such diagnostic advances is exactly what the World Health Organization called for this year in a sobering global analysis of antibiotic resistance. In too many cases, WHO noted, available tests take too long to run so physicians forgo them and simply prescribe broad-spectrum drugs. Developing faster tests that would lead to more targeted drug treatments would be a crucial step to help safeguard medications, the report said. If the new method makes its way into treatment centers it would be a step in the right direction. \u201cThe ability to determine changes in the structure of the single cell makes this unique among rapid-type analyses and it is an optimistic sign that this could be the beginning of a new area of study,\u201d says Stuart Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nAs a matter of course, a clinician will typically prescribe a drug to treat a patient\u2019s suspected infection but only receives definitive lab results confirming whether the clinician\u2019s best guess was correct a day or two after the patient started taking the drugs. That delay causes patients to take too many unnecessary antibiotics and inches us ever closer to a world where essential treatments are no longer effective.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new test could slash the wait time for diagnoses and eliminate ineffective prescriptions", "title": "Science scores major victory in fight against antibiotic resistance", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new test could slash the wait time for diagnoses and eliminate ineffective prescriptions", "title": "Science scores major victory in fight against antibiotic resistance", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/01/science_scores_major_victory_in_fight_against_antibiotic_resistance_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/shutterstock_202698757.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new test could slash the wait time for diagnoses and eliminate ineffective prescriptions", "title": "Science scores major victory in fight against antibiotic resistance", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/shutterstock_202698757.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dina Fine Maron", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, antibiotic resistance, Korea, pandemic, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: antibiotic resistance, Korea, pandemic, Scientific American, Life NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanAntibiotic resistance, which transforms ordinary microbes into menaces that cannot be easily controlled, is exacting a growing toll on the human population.\nDeveloping such diagnostic advances is exactly what the World Health Organization called for this year in a sobering global analysis of antibiotic resistance.\nThe standard method for identifying drug resistance is to take a sample from a wound, blood or urine and expose resident bacteria to various drugs.\nYet most antibiotic resistant infections are only identified long after a patient has left the doctor\u2019s office.\nMore than two million people in the U.S. develop drug-resistant infections each year and at least 23,000 of them die as a result."}
