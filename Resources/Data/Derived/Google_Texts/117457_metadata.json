Futsal is a modified version of soccer, typically played indoors with five players on each team.\n\n\"Futsal is one of the fastest growing sports in the world and it's time to make it even bigger in the U.S. market. We are ready to introduce the best global brands and the world's best players to our growing fan base and I'm thrilled to be part of the PFL,\" Cuban said in a statement.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban to Young Millennials: Live Cheap \u2013 Clothes, Cars Don\u2019t Matter\n\nThe PFL did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Cuban, the outspoken billionaire and \"Shark Tank\" investor, payed for his stake.\n\nAn estimated 30 million people play futsal worldwide, according to the PFL. It often features more scoring and is played at a faster pace than traditional soccer. PFL exhibition games will start in the United States next year, followed by the first full season in 2018.\n\nMajor League Soccer, the top professional soccer league in the United States, has failed to gain the following enjoyed by the NBA, National Football League or Major League Baseball.\n\nCuban's futsal investment is not his first in non-traditional sports.
