Otten's daughter Chris Geerdes said Wilder has prolonged the need to put her mom in a nursing home, and that her mom looks forward to going there three days a week. (Pioneer Press: Holly Peterson)\n\nST. PAUL -- When Judy Otten moved in with her daughter, Chris Geerdes, and her family in St. Paul last December, she had lost the homemaking skills she had honed over a lifetime.\n\nSuffering from memory loss, Otten, 74, a lifelong cook, could no longer follow a recipe and had difficulty cleaning her house and using a telephone.\n\n\u201cAll she\u2019d do is sit and watch TV,\u201d Geerdes said. It was time to start thinking about a nursing home.\n\nBut Geerdes was familiar with the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation\u2019s Adult Day Health program at its Community Center for Aging, just down Marshall Avenue from her home. The center helps older adults remain independent by providing socialization, creative arts and recreation programs, and health, nutrition and other services.\n\nOtten was reluctant to try Wilder, but after participating in a three-day-a-week program for a few weeks, Geerdes and her family \u201cnoticed a brightening in her.\u201d\n\nHer mother started talking more, paid more attention to the way she dressed and learned how to paint, draw intricate pencil designs and even dance.\n\n\u201cMom is always learning something new, something that catches her fancy,\u201d Geerdes said last week as her mother watered plants in the center\u2019s garden.\n\nShe said she believes the changes will enable Otten to live in her family\u2019s home \u2014 and out of a nursing home \u2014 \u201cfor a long time.\u201d\n\nAnd now Geerdes has been able to return to work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been life-changing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Aging in place\u2019\n\nThe vast majority of older Minnesotans strongly desire to stay at home as they age. Nearly nine in 10 Minnesotans older than 65 own their homes, and 80 percent of them have no plans to move, according to a Minnesota Board on Aging survey.\n\nBut in order to stay in their homes, many will need a wide range of services \u2014 from lawn mowing and housekeeping to transportation, home modifications and memory care.\n\n\u201cTen or 15 years ago, when people needed services, they moved into a nursing home,\u201d said Jean Wood, the Board on Aging\u2019s executive director. \u201cNow, the market has made it clear people want to stay in their homes.\u201d\n\nTo make that possible, a vast array of government agencies, nonprofits, civic organizations, faith groups and private businesses are driving an \u201caging in place\u201d movement.\n\nAging in place, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is defined as \u201cthe ability to live in one\u2019s own home and community safely, independently and comfortably, regardless of age, income or ability level.\u201d\n\nWith a wave of baby boomers sweeping over the state and nation, the demand for housing options and services is soaring.\n\nThe number of Minnesotans age 65 or older is expected to double to 1.4 million from 2010 to 2035, according to the Minnesota State Demographic Center. By then, more than one in five Minnesotans will be a senior, including all the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1965).\n\nWood and other specialists on aging issues contend that with some relatively modest changes in services and housing options, most older adults can stay in their homes and out of nursing facilities for months and even years.\n\nThat would provide huge cost savings for families \u2014 and taxpayers. The average cost of nursing home care in Minnesota is $180 a day. By comparison, Wilder\u2019s fee is $79 per day for adult day care, and assisted-living facilities, which house about 70,000 older Minnesotans, cost $115 a day on average.\n\nSome 27,500 Minnesotans, or 3.7 percent of the state\u2019s seniors, live in nursing homes on a typical day, the state Department of Human Services reports. Minnesota spends more than $2 billion a year on nursing homes; about two-thirds of the bill is paid by public sources, such as Medical Assistance and Medicare.\n\nThe growing emphasis on home- and community-based services has sharply cut use of nursing homes. The Department of Human Services reported a 39 percent reduction in the state\u2019s nursing home industry since 1987.\n\n\u201cHelping homeowners, especially those with very low incomes, stay where they are and get the services they need can be an incredibly good investment for the state,\u201d said Mary Tingerthal, commissioner of the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.\n\nAging boomers want more housing options. Couples with big homes in the suburbs will look to downsize to easier-to-maintain houses, townhouses and apartments. Lower-income seniors will seek affordable housing.\n\nBut a lot of them won\u2019t be able to find it.\n\nWood said housing officials tell her that \u201cwith the coming of the baby boomers, we can\u2019t build our way out of this.\u201d She said they don\u2019t have enough time in the next 10 to 15 years to build all the affordable housing boomers will need.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the emphasis is on people staying in their own homes,\u201d Wood said.\n\nConnecting with services\n\nThere is a huge number of services available, but the tricky part is connecting seniors with the services they need, said Jess Luce, program manager for the Dakota County Communities for a Lifetime initiative.\n\nHis program brings together residents, local businesses, community groups and city and county staff to create networks to make services more accessible. They help with transportation, sidewalks and paths, housing options, access to services for older adults and caregivers and work and volunteer opportunities.\n\nLuce said a program known as Living Longer and Stronger in West St. Paul is the oldest and most active community effort under the county\u2019s initiative to meet the needs of its aging population.\n\nUp and running for four years, the program provides a wide array of services. This year, for instance, it launched \u201cthe Loop,\u201d a free circulator bus service that shuttles shoppers to and from businesses along South Robert Street.\n\nAmong other projects, Living Longer and Stronger publishes an extensive resource directory for older adults and provides \u201cboomer bags\u201d with information for new retirees.\n\nLuce also is starting a project to create \u201cneighborhood networks\u201d to link neighbors through a \u201cvirtual world online,\u201d he said.\n\nHis program has surveyed residents in a Mendota Heights neighborhood to find out what their interests are and to encourage them to get involved by offering to shovel a sidewalk, take care of a cat while the owner is out of town or post security alerts.\n\nHe hopes to test the idea in other neighborhoods soon.\n\nIn the Board on Aging\u2019s biennial surveys of service gaps for older adults, transportation always ranks No. 1, Wood said.\n\nMany options exist, such as Metro Transit, Metro Mobility and shuttle services, but they often don\u2019t match seniors\u2019 needs.\n\nDakota County has a number of transportation providers, each with a different target population and separate funding sources. Luce said the county has organized a transportation coordinating council to \u201cget the providers on the same page\u201d to look for efficiencies and identify service gaps and overlaps.\n\nDakota County cities also need to address a \u201cwalkability gap,\u201d by providing more sidewalks and paths, he said.\n\n\u201cWalking on streets is not safe for older adults, little kids or mothers with strollers,\u201d Luce said. \u201cMy hope is that in the next five years, as more boomers get older, they will realize that their communities are not age-friendly, and they will want to do something about it.\u201d\n\nIn St. Paul, the mayor\u2019s advisory committee on aging is conferring with city officials who are drafting a 10-year comprehensive plan on housing, land use, transportation, parks, water and related issues.\n\n\u201cWe want the needs of older adults to be imbedded in everything that we do in planning for the city\u2019s future,\u201d said Nancy Homans, Mayor Chris Coleman\u2019s policy director.\n\nThat involves recognizing the changing wants and needs of older residents.\n\n\u201cFor instance, it used to be that senior programming was just having craft classes,\u201d Homans said. \u201cBut now, active seniors want to bike, walk, run and play tennis. We want our park system to meet their needs.\u201d\n\nIn the Twin Cities area, the Metropolitan Area Agency on Aging is the main source of information about services delivered in homes.\n\nOne of seven regional aging agencies in Minnesota funded largely under the federal Older Americans Act, the metro agency does pre-admission screenings to determine if seniors are eligible for public programs. It provides links for all older adults to dozens of public, private and nonprofit services available in their homes.\n\nLast year, the agency granted $6.6 million to its \u201ccommunity partners\u201d for services to help seniors age in place.\n\nThe most popular services funded by the agency include meals, support for caregivers who care for family members and friends, and household services such as cleaning, grocery shopping and yard maintenance.\n\n\u201cOlder adults might not live in their same residence, but what\u2019s important is they\u2019re in the community they choose so they\u2019re close to their faith community, their clinic, dentist and the retailers and restaurants they like,\u201d said agency executive director Dawn Simonson.\n\nThe agency\u2019s main point of contact with older adults is the Senior LinkAge Line, the Board of Aging\u2019s free phone line that bills itself as a \u201cone-stop shop for Minnesota seniors.\u201d\n\nIt also has \u201cstrong linkages\u201d with county social service agencies, clinics, hospitals and other health care providers, Simonson said.\n\n\u201cYounger older adults find (the services they need) on the Internet,\u201d she said.\n\nHousing shortage\n\nFor low-income seniors, the greatest unmet need is affordable housing, said Tingerthal, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency commissioner. \u201cAnd with the age wave, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d\n\nNearly one in four Minnesota households pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing, she said, \u201cand it\u2019s worse for renters.\u201d With housing costs rising and incomes stagnant, she predicted that number would rise.\n\n\u201cSeniors cannot find affordable housing,\u201d said Barbara Dacy, executive director of the Washington County Housing and Redevelopment Authority. Citing a survey commissioned by a coalition of Minnesota HRAs, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a zero percent vacancy rate.\u201d\n\nTo provide more places to live, an association of state HRA officials has asked the Legislature to allow state bonds to be used to finance senior housing. It will seek $40 million for that purpose in a bonding bill that lawmakers are expected to pass next year, Dacy said.\n\nBut, she said, that would only finance 400 apartments, a \u201cvery small part of the need.\u201d\n\nSince most low-income older adults own their homes, the Housing Finance Agency focuses on providing rehabilitation loans to help older homeowners finance repairs and improvements, Tingerthal said.\n\nThe agency has provided 200 to 300 rehab loans a year since 1976, but it typically runs out of money nine months into each year, so it falls short of meeting the demand, she said.\n\nThe good news for senior homeowners is most of them own their homes free and clear without a mortgage, resulting in lower housing costs.\n\nSeniors ages 65 to 74 are the least likely of any age group to move, according to MHFA data. But when the boomers start to reach age 75 in five years, the risk of becoming disabled increases, and people with disabilities are likely to move to rental properties. Two-thirds of households with a person older than 85 have someone who is disabled.\n\nThe age wave will wash hardest over Greater Minnesota. In 23 outstate counties, seniors will comprise 30 percent to 50 percent of the population by 2035, according to the state demographer\u2019s office.\n\nIn the seven-county metro area, Washington and Dakota counties will see the fastest growth in older residents. The proportion of their population ages 65 or older will jump from 15 percent or less now to from 25 percent to 30 percent in 20 years.\n\nThe Washington County HRA is partnering with private developers to build affordable senior housing, Dacy said, but \u201cmore tools\u201d are needed to meet the demand.\n\nShe estimated the county would need 5,000 additional housing units by 2030, including nearly 1,000 affordable dwellings. But a 2013 HRA study projected the county would produce less than one-fourth of the affordable units needed.\n\nThe challenge for Washington County and most of the rest of the state, she said, is to find ways to provide more affordable housing at reasonable costs.\n\nHow will Minnesotans pay for housing and related services for boomers?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has figured that out yet,\u201d said Jocelyn Schowalter, director of Wilder\u2019s aging services.\n\nTo learn more\n\nLooking for information about how aging adults can stay in their homes and communities?
