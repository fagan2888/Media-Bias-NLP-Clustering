Twenty-seven states had done so by the end of 2014.\n\nNeed Medicare Info?

Other studies that have looked at the population overall also have shown deeper cuts in the uninsured rate in states that expanded Medicaid.\n\nMany people in the older 50-to-64 age group have employer-sponsored insurance, Skopec says. But until the health law passed, \u201cthose who didn\u2019t have access to employer-sponsored coverage didn\u2019t have very good options.\u201d\n\nGet discounts on prescriptions, health exams, eye care and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages \u00bb\n\nIn addition to expanding Medicaid coverage, the health law prohibits insurers from charging older people premiums that are more than three times higher than those for younger people. The law\u2019s prohibition against insurers\u2019 refusing to cover people because they have pre-existing medical conditions has also helped many older people gain coverage, Skopec says.\n\nPlease contact Kaiser Health News to send comments or ideas for future topics for the Insuring Your Health column.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health-policy news service.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "The health law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes over the poverty line was key to reducing the uninsured rate among 50- to 64-year-olds from nearly 12 percent to 8 percent in 2014, according to a new analysis. \u201cClearly most of the gains in coverage were in Medicaid or non-group coverage,\u201d says study coauthor Jane Sung, a senior strategic policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute, which conducted the study with the Urban Institute.
