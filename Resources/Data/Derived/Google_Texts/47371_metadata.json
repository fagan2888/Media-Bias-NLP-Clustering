Linder College of Business is responsible for the study that delves into cyber breaks. While previous studies have focused on such things as off-job-hours breaks and traditional \u201coffline\u201d breaks and their effects on workers, Kim opted to delve into this understudied topic that has become such a common issue in today\u2019s technologically advanced workplace.\n\nFor this study, Kim conducted one-on-one interviews with 33 professionals representing different fields. Researchers looked into four aspects of online breaks:\n\nTriggers that prompt online breaks\n\nThe conditions that prompt online breaks instead of traditional offline breaks\n\nDifferent online activities performed during breaks\n\nConsequences of taking such breaks\n\nAbout the Findings\n\nPreliminary study findings in the four areas examined include:\n\nTriggers \u2013 Online breaks are often prompted when employees feel frazzled or suffer a loss of energy. They can also be trigged by boredom, anger, frustration or a desire to check-in with personal or home life.\n\nOnline breaks are often prompted when employees feel frazzled or suffer a loss of energy. They can also be trigged by boredom, anger, frustration or a desire to check-in with personal or home life. Conditions that prompt online breaks \u2013 Researchers found that people who spend a great deal of time online as part of their work tended to find online breaks less refreshing. Employees with public-facing jobs and those on their feet a lot were more likely to enjoy the quiet time afforded during an online break. Researchers also discovered that organizational policies could impact a worker\u2019s decision to take online breaks. Older workers were also less inclined to take breaks online.\n\nResearchers found that people who spend a great deal of time online as part of their work tended to find online breaks less refreshing.

Activities \u2013 Employees who take online breaks tended to use the time to either seek pleasure (reading, checking on game scores, listening to music, watching videos), or they took care of non-work-related business, such as checking in on family, bill paying, schoolwork and so on.\n\nEmployees who take online breaks tended to use the time to either seek pleasure (reading, checking on game scores, listening to music, watching videos), or they took care of non-work-related business, such as checking in on family, bill paying, schoolwork and so on. Consequences \u2013 Researchers discovered three main consequences for those who took online breaks: recovery, learning and satisfaction.\n\nKim found that employees who use online breaks to balance their home and work responsibilities were often able to better focus on work after completing a break. Those who chose to go online to research or read industry news felt they were helping their careers and gained satisfaction as a result.\n\nWhile undisciplined online breaks can lead to a loss of productivity, temporary respites in the online world can rejuvenate workers while enhancing focus, researchers found.\n\nAlthough Kim says there is more research to be done, the study has revealed positive benefits can result from enabling employees to take online breaks.\n\nGet Free Updates!
