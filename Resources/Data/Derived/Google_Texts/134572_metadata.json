Wilmington Police turned over evidence to the state Department of Justice. No specific timeline from the Department of Justice, but a DOJ spokesman said the response would be prompt.Wilmington Police responded to a large fight Thursday along the 100 block of South Franklin in which an 18-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman suffered puncture wounds; then, officers raced to a second fight nearby near South Harrison and Chestnut Streets. Teenaged girls were attacking one another. In the aftermath of that fatal incident at Howard High School, seems like some teen-aged girls are out of control. Are social media fueling these brawls?A convicted drug dealer from Claymont is one of 58 people receiving commutations of prison sentences from President Obama. Leonard Mason had been sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2011 after his conviction in Pennsylvania federal court for distributing cocaine, and conspiracy.As reported on our stations, Wilmington's mayoral hopefuls - with the notable exception of the incumbent, Mayor Dennis Williams - appeared at a candidates' forum at mid-week. I say \"candidates' forum\" rather than a debate, because, by all accounts, the candidates didn't really debate. Too bad. How are we to get a grasp as to why one candidate believes he/she has the better plan, and would be more effective, without the give-and-take? And how many times can Mayor Williams avoid these debates entirely? Or has Williams made a calculation that, despite his unpopularity in many circles, he's likely to prevail over such a crowded field, and there's no point in elevating his opponents by showing up?More discord and acrimony in State College, PA, as new information surfaces in the Paterno/Sandusky case. Pennsylvania State University paid settlements to end claims that head Penn State football coach Joe Paterno and other coaches KNEW - as early as the 1970s - that Jerry Sandusky was sexually abusing children, according to court filings and a person said to be familiar with the payouts. The accusations never came out, let alone were proven, at trial. But these allegations indicate, for the first time, that Sandusky's sexual assaults were already known at Penn State decades before Sandusky first attracted police scrutiny. Of course, Paterno's family denies it all.Convulsions reverberate through the Republican Party following Donald Trump's effective capture of the Republican Presidential nomination. The country's highest-ranking Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, declared he was \"not ready\" to endorse Trump as the Republican nominee. That came only days after Trump said he aimed to unify the party. Indeed, within a hour of Ryan's rebuke to Trump, Trump responded in kind, saying he was \"not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda.\" But Ryan says Republicans want \"a standard-bearer that bears our standards.\"I am utterly fascinated how Trump's apparent capture of the G.O.P. Presidential nomination has created such a deep divide between - should I say - most of the conservative world's intellectual columnists vs. many of the nationally syndicated talk-show radio / TV hosts.Someone like Fox News' Sean Hannity is now spending most of his airtime berating conservatives who are not prepared to fall in line behind Trump. In fact, Hannity declared he was no longer \"ready to support\" Paul Ryan. Bring back Newt Gingrich, who is a big Trump supporter?But someone like conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer - always a good read whether you agree or disagree with him - continues to regard Trump as a charlatan and ideologically an unreliable chameleon.In his latest column, Krauthammer discusses the seeming paradox of a majority of G.O.P. primary voters feeling \"betrayed\" by Republican Party leaders whom many of these voters regard as RINO's, then choosing arguably the LEAST conservative candidate from the original field of 17 Republican Presidential hopefuls.Krauthammer writes:\"If insufficient resistance to Obama's liberalism created this sense of betrayal, why in a field of 17 did Republican voters choose the least conservative candidate? A man who until yesterday was himself a liberal. Who donated money to those very same Democrats to whom the GOP establishment is said to have caved, including Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid and Hillary Clinton.Trump has expressed sympathy for a single-payer system of socialized medicine, far to the left of Obamacare. Trump lists health care as one of the federal government's three main responsibilities (after national security); Republicans adamantly oppose federal intervention in health care. He also lists education, which Republicans believe instead be left to the states.As for Planned Parenthood, the very same conservatives who railed against the Republican establishment for failing to defund it now rally around a candidate who sings the praises of its good works (save for the provision of abortion).More fundamentally, Trump has no affinity whatsover for the central thrust of modern conservatism -- a return to less and smaller government. If the establishment has insufficiently resisted Obama's Big Government policies, the beneficiary should logically have been the most consistent, indeed most radical, anti-government conservative of the bunch, Ted Cruz.Cruz's entire career has consisted of promoting tea-party constitutionalism in revolt against party leaders who had joined 'the Washington cartel.' Yet when Cruz got to his one-on-one with Trump at the Indiana OK Corral, Republicans chose Trump and his nonconservative, idiosyncratic populism.Which makes Indiana a truly historic inflection point. It marks the most radical transformation of the political philosophy of a major political party in our lifetime. The Democrats continue their trajectory of ever-expansive liberalism from the New Deal through the Great Society through Obama and Clinton today. While the GOP, the nation's conservative party, its ideology refined and crystallized by Ronald Reagan, has just gone populist.It's an ideological earthquake. How radical a reorientation? Said Trump last week: 'Folks, I'm a conservative. But at this point, who cares?'\"I have an answer to Krauthammer's bewilderment: When Nixon and Reagan brought in droves of white culturally conservative Democrats, repelled by the Dems' leftward lurch on civil rights and cultural issues, these folks didn't necessarily embrace everything about the conservative \"gospel\", particularly on business/free trade. They didn't necessarily worship at the altar of conservative intellectuals, nor did they read conservative magazines such as NATIONAL REVIEW; HUMAN EVENTS; and The WEEKLY STANDARD. Then came the implosion of traditional U.S. industry, especially in the Rust Belt, and the Great Recession. This discontent bubbled up before, with Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot. But, Donald Trump tapped into that vein of discontent with a vengeance. Add the aftermath of 9/11, seemingly endless wars to respond to those terrorist attacks, the arrival of Spanish-speakers and non-European immigrants even in small-town America...And we already know from polling that even the white males in Trump's corner, who self-identify as evangelical Christians, don't necessarily go to church most Sundays, let alone listen to the statements of church leadership. So it's no great shock that Trump's failure to denounce Planned Parenthood without equivocation has not necessarily repelled these folks. [The one area where I thought Trump showed unusual tone deafness to his core constituency was his initial defense of transgender bathrooms - on which he quickly backpedaled.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.wdel.com", "image": "http://delmarvabroadcasting.com/logos250/wdel.png", "type": "website", "description": "WDEL 101.7FM - Your source for news and information in Wilmington, DE and surrounding communities.", "title": "WDEL 101.7FM, Wilmington, DE - News Talk Radio"}, "KEYWORDS": ", WDEL, 101.7, FM, 1150, AM, radio, internet radio, broadcast, news, talk, Traffic, TrafficWatch, SnoWatch, Snow Watch, politics, business, weather, AccuWeather, interview, opinion, DE, Delaware, Wilmington, Newark, Hockessin, Greenville, Bear, New Castle, Claymont, Middletown, Dover, Georgetown, Smyrna, Odessa, Townsend, Elsmere, Newport, Stanton, Pike Creek, Christiana, Rick Jensen, Susan Monday, Allan Loudell", "fb": {"app_id": 333335353411644}, "description": "WDEL 101.7FM - Your source for news and information in Wilmington, DE and surrounding communities."}, "article_summary": "Indeed, within a hour of Ryan's rebuke to Trump, Trump responded in kind, saying he was \"not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda.\"\nOf course, Paterno's family denies it all.Convulsions reverberate through the Republican Party following Donald Trump's effective capture of the Republican Presidential nomination.\nWhile the GOP, the nation's conservative party, its ideology refined and crystallized by Ronald Reagan, has just gone populist.It's an ideological earthquake.\nThe country's highest-ranking Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan, declared he was \"not ready\" to endorse Trump as the Republican nominee.\nWilmington Police turned over evidence to the state Department of Justice."}
