The president often advocates for the kind of educational system we should have \u2026 Ben Carson, who defers to his religious faith in the face of scientific evidence, does not seem like a strong advocate for quality education \u2026 A Carson presidency would also be a direct attack on the health of African-Americans: he equated the Affordable Care Act to a form of slavery \u2026 This is a matter of life and death, not political posturing \u2026 Actually, poverty is the form of slavery that is most insidious in America, and it is perpetuated by institutional racism, which Ben Carson seems to deny exists \u2026 He praises blacks in history who have pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps to make something of themselves despite harsh circumstances \u2026 What makes this rallying cry so disingenuous is the fact that his mother received government assistance while he was growing up, which he acknowledges was crucial \u2026 These are the times when all Americans need a champion willing to fight hard to fix the problems that affect people from all walks of life, not deny or ignore them. Ben Carson is not that champion.\n\nYou can read the entire op-ed over at Time.\n\nFollow Datoc on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Christian Datoc", "description": "'Would his presidency be an unmitigated disaster?
