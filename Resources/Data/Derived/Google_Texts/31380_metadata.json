The bill, introduced Thursday by a bipartisan coalition of senators including Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, proposes to reduce mandatory minimums for drug offenses, expand the \u201csafety valve\u201d to allow judges to exempt people charged with non-violent drug offenses from mandatory minimums, build out anti-recidivism and need assessment programs, and limit the use of solitary against juveniles, among other reforms.\n\nThe measure is also being hailed as something of a political miracle given the hyper-partisan divisions in this Congress. But its bipartisanship, while also a tremendous selling point, doesn\u2019t mean total agreement on its central provisions.\n\nThe left-most members of the six-member coalition acknowledge that they would have liked to see aspects of the bill go farther: the measure amends, rather than eliminates, mandatory minimums, and only deals with low-level and non-violent offenders.\n\n\u201cI would have liked to see the dials turned more. But I think that the way to think about this is that a lot of dials were turned, and that\u2019s a start,\u201d Booker told the Washington Post. \u201cWith all of the cynicism about Washington, this is a really a sign of how the place can work.\u201d\n\nGrassley, a conservative Republican who heads the Senate\u2019s Judiciary Committee, agreed that the bill, while a powerful show of cooperation between parties, also had fracture points. \u201cThere are things in here that each of us like,\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday. \u201cThere are items that each of us would rather do without. This is how the process works in the Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is certainly not the solution to all of the ills that are impacting and causing mass incarceration, but [the Senate bill] is a very smart place to start making reforms,\u201d Austin-Hillery said of the limits of the proposal.\n\n\u201cIs there a lot more to be done? Yes. We have to start to deal with other types of crimes, we have to start to deal with offenders at other levels,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe also have to start looking at what kinds of reforms need to be put in place in the states. Everyone needs to be clear that this is a federal reform agenda. A majority of people who are incarcerated in this country are in state prisons.\u201d\n\nEven if the Senate proposal passes as is, there are factors feeding people into our country\u2019s jails and prisons that remain outside its purview. As Austin-Hillery noted\u2014and Booker himself seemed to acknowledge\u2014untangling the knot of America\u2019s mass incarceration epidemic will take much more than a single bill.\n\n***\n\nThis is where the talk of bipartisan consensus on criminal justice reform gets more complicated. Because while Republicans and Democrats have, to a certain extent, come to agree on the fact that the United States incarcerates way too many people, the question of why that is, and the expansive reforms that will be required to change that system, brings the debate back into a partisan land mine.\n\n\u201cThere are [policy] discussions about the other variables that impact individuals in the criminal justice system: economic and racial disparities, educational opportunities, housing, drug treatment,\u201d Austin-Hillery said of the wide-ranging conversations happening in Congress about reform. \u201cAll of these things are being discussed.\u201d\n\nThose issues may be on the table, but, unlike the emerging consensus on sentencing reform, agreement seems harder to come by. And healthcare is one of the clearest dividing lines.\n\nMike Lee, a Utah Republican who was instrumental in developing the Senate\u2019s current reform package, is among the most vocal opponents of the Affordable Care Act in Congress. And Koch Industries, which has bankrolled its own initiatives related to criminal justice reform, has also been throwing millions at efforts to dismantle the new healthcare law, a policy that, among other things, expanded Medicaid eligibility for millions, including people coming out of the criminal justice system.\n\nAround 35% of the people who are newly eligible for Medicaid under the new healthcare law are people who have been involved with the criminal justice system, whether that means spending time in prison or jail or being on probation. \u201cFor those newly covered, it will open up treatment doors for them,\u201d Dr. Fred Osher, director of health systems and services policy for the Council of State Governments Justice Center, recently told the New York Times.\n\nAnd under the new healthcare law, states can suspend, rather than terminate, a person\u2019s Medicaid benefits while they are incarcerated. This provision of the Affordable Care Act is a response to data showing that uninterrupted access to healthcare goes a long way toward helping people reintegrate into their communities, get the care they need, and, in the long run, stay out of the system. Repealing Obamacare would mean dismantling these expanded networks of access.\n\n\u201cThere are many issues with having people get access to Medicaid and healthcare services [after release],\u201d KiDeuk Kim, a senior researcher at the Urban Institute and visiting fellow at the U.S. Department of Justice, told me over the summer. \u201cThere are studies that look at the impact of affordable healthcare on recidivism. After some initial evaluations and analysis, we know that [access] provides needed services to returning prisoners. They do better. They have a much more successful life, getting back into society. It\u2019s critical.\u201d\n\nKim is the co-author of a report from the Urban Institute that found that formerly incarcerated people with mental illness have higher recidivism rates than those who don\u2019t experience those issues, causing them to \u201ccycle through the criminal justice system without the appropriate care to address their mental health\u201d and leading to what the report calls a \u201crevolving door\u201d into the system.\n\nThere is real need at the national level as well, Kim explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way to go, but we definitely need to extend healthcare programs [within the system]. The Bureau of Justice conducted a study in 2006 and the study found that only 1 in 3 state prisoners and 1 in 6 jail inmates who suffer from mental health problems reported receiving treatment. There is evidence that our system is lacking in healthcare services.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Kim back in July about what was then the unreleased Senate proposal and bipartisan cooperation on the issue, he was optimistic about the consensus on sentencing reform, but offered a wait-and-see approach when it came to finding the same level of agreement on public and community health policy.\n\n\u201cA lot of focus right now is on undoing the harm that\u2019s done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to fix the sentencing structure in a way that we don\u2019t increase the prison population. How far it gets pushed beyond that remains to be seen, [though] I really hope they take preventative measures\u2014rehabilitation and providing services to people who need services\u2014but that remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nBut this bill is an encouraging beginning to what needs to be a longterm and wide-ranging push to end mass incarceration in the U.S., Austin-Hillery said. \u201cAll the various stakeholders would agree this is a starting point, not where we\u2019re going to end in the struggle for reform,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the ceiling\u2014I would call this the floor where we start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "The bipartisan proposal to limit mandatory minimums includes an unprecedented package of reforms.
