Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wants to pledge American resources to clean up the Chinese, Indian, and Russian environments.\n\nFlanked by environmental activists Wednesday on the Capitol\u2019s East Lawn and joined by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the Vermont senator touted the pair\u2019s legislation to prohibit all new fossil fuel developments on federal land, a measure aimed at fighting climate change.\n\nAlthough there is little chance the legislation would receive a vote in the Republican-controlled chamber, Sanders said the bill signals renewed American commitment to \u201ca clearly international crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to be leading by making the transformations that we need in this country and using our technology to help China, to help Russia,\u201d he told reporters:\n\nChina has enormous environmental problems, thousands\u2014millions of their people are dying from pollution. We\u2019ve got to work with China. We\u2019ve got to work with India. We\u2019ve got to lead the world. And by the way, we can create a huge amount of good-paying jobs in this country.\n\nSanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, didn\u2019t provide specifics on the international clean-up effort, and his office did not respond to several requests by The Daily Signal.\n\nHis proposed Keep It in the Ground Act would prohibit all new leases for the production of coal, gas, and oil on federal lands. The legislation also would ban offshore drilling in both the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.\n\nTo avoid a global warming catastrophe, according to Merkley\u2019s office, 80 percent of the world\u2019s fossil fuels must not be tapped. Although the United States accounts for only 10 percent of the world\u2019s reserves, his office said, the nation should take the first step by transitioning from \u201ca fossil fuel economy to a clean energy economy.\u201d\n\nBill McKibben, leader of the environmental group 350.Org, told reporters any \u201cpowerful legislation\u201d on the issue is likely impossible in the current political environment.\n\nA senior aide to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, told The Daily Signal the Sanders-Merkley legislation is dead on arrival.\n\nThe staffer, Robert Dillon, criticized the measure as \u201cshortsighted,\u201d noting that the U.S. has the \u201ctoughest environmental standards in the world\u201d and warning that the legislation in effect would export pollution to countries with lower standards.\n\n\u201cWhy would we want people with less stringent environmental standards producing our energy for us,\u201d Dillon asked, \u201cwhen they\u2019re going to do more ecological damage than we would?\u201d\n\nBut Merkley\u2019s strategy seems to be to go around Congress and rely instead on leaders of other nations. This also has been President Obama\u2019s approach on the issue, critics charge.\n\nAt the press conference, Merkley confirmed that the bill\u2019s timing was \u201cdesigned to help fuel the conversation in Paris,\u201d referring to the upcoming treaty-making climate conference known as the Paris Protocol.\n\nGlobal leaders will gather in Paris late this month for the United Nations Climate Change Conference to hammer out a new universal agreement on environmental pollution and regulation.\n\nNick Loris, an economist and Morgan fellow at The Heritage Foundation, warned that the conference could have the unintended consequence of keeping the lights off for a billion of the world\u2019s poor.\n\n\u201cThere are huge costs to restricting global energy production through decarbonizing the world\u2019s energy economy,\u201d Loris told The Daily Signal. \u201cIt will prevent the poorest citizens of the world from accessing reliable, baseload energy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Vermont senator cosponsors a climate change bill to stop developing fossil fuels on federal land and help other nations clean up their environments.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Vermont senator cosponsors a climate change bill to stop developing fossil fuels on federal land and help other nations clean up their environments.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Says US Should Clean Up Russia, China", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151104_KeepItInTheGround.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-06T13:37:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MMZMay"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Vermont senator cosponsors a climate change bill to stop developing fossil fuels on federal land and help other nations clean up their environments.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151104_KeepItInTheGround.jpg"}, "title": "Bernie Sanders Says US Should Clean Up Russia, China", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "climate change", "published_time": "2015-11-06T11:11:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-06T13:37:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley, Climate Change, Fossil Fuels, Keep It In The Ground Act, Paris Protocol, U.N. climate change"}, "article_summary": "Sen.
