And they\u2019ll have plenty to chew on in that regard when they hear the latest Obamacare case Wednesday.\n\nBut striking down the federal subsidies at the heart of the law would have a huge impact on millions of Americans. That could give pause to some of the justices.\n\nIn Texas alone, 1.4 million residents could lose newly acquired health insurance if the Supreme Court sides against the administration.\n\nWith 1 in 4 Texans lacking coverage, the state still has more uninsured residents than any other.\n\n\u201cObviously that\u2019s extremely discouraging,\u201d said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin group that advocates for low-income Texans. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be guaranteed to stay solidly in last place in terms of uninsured for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nA ruling in the case, known as King vs. Burwell, is expected by the end of June. If the court sides with King and against the administration, it will have profound implications in the 34 states with marketplaces run or facilitated by the federal government.\n\nThe case hinges on four words in a complex law that, among other things, authorized subsidies for people who buy insurance through marketplaces \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Texas and other states refused to create their own marketplaces, so the federal government stepped in.\n\nConservatives contend that under the letter of the law, that wasn\u2019t enough to trigger federal subsidies.\n\nObamacare defenders say Congress never meant to exclude residents of three-quarters of the states.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for Congress saying we\u2019ll subsidize something in a bunch of states and not in others,\u201d said Alice Rivlin, White House budget director in the Clinton administration. Even if the court does read the law that way, she said, \u201cthe necessity of finding a way to keep the subsidies going is pretty clear, because otherwise the thing falls apart.\u201d\n\nA recent Urban Institute study showed that the average subsidy lost in Texas would top $2,700 annually for individuals.\n\nMore than 85 percent of marketplace enrollees would find themselves having to pay full price. Most would drop coverage, health care experts say. Nationwide, the number of uninsured would rise by 8.2 million.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the direct impact. With subsidies gone, a disproportionate number of people who drop coverage would be young and relatively healthy. Obamacare was crafted to entice or coerce such low-risk customers into the insurance pool to help offset the cost of older policyholders with more health issues.\n\nWith the risk pool transformed, premiums would rise for everyone, whether they buy through a marketplace or not. People who bought insurance at full price could see premiums spike from 35 percent (the Urban Institute\u2019s projection) to 47 percent (per the Rand Corp. projection).\n\nSome would drop coverage. Others would shift to cheaper plans that cost more and cover less.\n\nMichele Jawando, a vice president at the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank, called it a \u201cmeltdown. \u2026 Everyone will be impacted by the chaos and the disruption to the health care system.\u201d\n\nThomas Miller, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and critic of Obamacare, called gloom and doom warnings overblown. But at a forum with health care reporters, he predicted that only about six to 10 states would try to protect their residents\u2019 subsidies by modifying their marketplaces.\n\nEven some critics of the law are concerned about the potential disruption if the court strikes down the subsidies. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Thursday, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., argued that Congress must plan for transitional coverage to protect the millions at risk of losing insurance on short notice if \u2014 as he hopes \u2014 the Supreme Court sides with King.\n\nSasse noted that the fine print in the Affordable Care Act lets insurers \u201cdump Obamacare patients midyear\u201d if subsidies are struck down, creating a real possibility that chemotherapy or dialysis patients lose access to treatment.\n\n\u201cThe horror stories will be real,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd Texas will have more than other states.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@toddgillman", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The nine most powerful jurists in the land are supposed to focus on the law of the land.
