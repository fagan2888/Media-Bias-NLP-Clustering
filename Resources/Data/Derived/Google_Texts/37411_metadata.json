Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the influential Judiciary Committee, declared Tuesday that the House won\u2019t pass legislation unless it contains a controversial provision requiring prosecutors to prove that certain criminal suspects knowingly intended to break the law.\n\nA day after Goodlatte, R-Va., roiled debate on the issue, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, assured that the dispute over the criminal intent requirement\u2014known as \u201cmens rea,\u201d the Latin phrase for \u201cguilty knowledge\u201d or \u201cguilty mind\u201d\u2014could be resolved \u201crelatively easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a difference, but it\u2019s a relatively minor difference [between] the mens rea element that\u2019s in the House version and not in the Senate version,\u201d said Lee, who spoke Wednesday with reporters at The Heritage Foundation to reflect on President Barack Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about sweeping, drastically different bills,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt could be worked out relatively easily.\u201d\n\nAs expected, Obama in his State of the Union specified a deal on criminal justice reform as a main priority for 2016. Both Goodlatte and Lee share that ambition, and they\u2019ve helped their respective judiciary committees pass bills reforming the criminal justice system.\n\nThe full House and Senate have not yet taken up legislation on the issue.\n\nBut a piece of the House legislation contains a controversial provision that would change the U.S. criminal code to make more laws subject to proof of criminal intent, meaning it would require prosecutors to prove that certain criminal suspects knowingly intended to break the law.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s reform legislation, co-authored by Lee, does not add such requirements.\n\nIn addition, the White House is opposed to expanding the requirement to prove criminal intent, arguing it would make it harder to prosecute corporations that commit fraud, taint food, or pollute the environment because the accused could simply say they didn\u2019t intend to break the law.\n\nWhile the centerpiece of the criminal justice reform effort is a bipartisan effort to reduce mandatory minimum prison sentences for low-level drug offenders, Goodlatte suggested that many of his colleagues won\u2019t agree to ease drug penalties unless the bill contains the provision requiring prosecutors to prove criminal intent.\n\n\u201cI think a deal that does not address this issue is not going anywhere in the House of Representatives,\u201d Goodlatte said during an event at The Atlantic.\n\n>>> House Republicans Not Backing Down From \u2018Criminal Intent\u2019 Addition to Prison Reform Debate\n\nThe remark rankled advocates, who hope Congress will agree on a criminal justice reform early this year so they can send it to Obama before the 2016 presidential campaign heats up.\n\nLee sought to calm the angst.\n\n\u201cIf we could get both chambers to put [a] bill on the floor, it would pass,\u201d the Utah Republican said. \u201cAnd we could work that out [the differences] in a conference committee [between the House and Senate].\u201d\n\nAnd in an old-fashioned nod to the White House, Lee signaled that Obama is proving flexible as a way to find common ground on an issue both the legislative and executive branches want to address.\n\n\u201cOn this issue, he [Obama] has expressed an interest with working with Congress, and I think he means it,\u201d Lee said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seeking to settle a dispute over \"mens rea\" and criminal justice reform, Sen.
