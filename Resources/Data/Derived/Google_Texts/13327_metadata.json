Edwin Edwards (D) drummed up support for his newly-announced Congressional bid on MSNBC's \"The Daily Rundown\" Tuesday by explaining his political leanings in his typically candid fashion.\n\nEdwards, who spent eight years in prison after being convicted on extortion and racketeering charges, launched his campaign Monday for Louisiana's Sixth Congressional District.\n\nThe 86-year-old candidate told host Chuck Todd that he couldn't vote for President Barack Obama in 2012, though not because of ideological differences.\n\n\"Well I'm sorry to say, where I was there were no voting machines,\" Edwards said.\n\n\"Would you have supported him?\" Todd asked, to which Edwards clarified: \"I was in prison.\"\n\n\"I probably would have voted for him,\" Edwards continued. \"I've voted for Republican presidents before ... I would have probably voted for Obama because I, like the rest of the nation, was caught up in his rhetoric and his promise of the bright future that should be available to us in this country.\"\n\nEdwards then explained that he's disappointed Obama hasn't yet announced support for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.
