The eclipse begins at 9:40 PM (Arizona time) Saturday night, peaks at 11:52 PM, and ends at 2:05 AM Sunday morning.\n\nSince we can't see it live in the sky here in Arizona, the next best thing will be watching it live online. Slooh.com will start an eclipse broadcast from Cape Town, Africa at 9:30 PM (Arizona time) Saturday night.\n\nThe below image (click here to see on mobile devices) shows the path of the eclipse over Earth. EarthSky.org writes \"only those places within the moving shaded circle (southern Africa, Antarctica and the ocean between them) can look in the sky to see the new moon taking a bite out of the sun\u2019s disk. Since Antarctica is so sparsely populated, most who see this partial solar eclipse will be in southern Africa, where the eclipse will occur in the early morning hours of Sunday, September 13. In fact, the far western portion of the eclipse viewing area \u2013 such as Windhoek, Namibia and Cape Town, South Africa \u2013 will see the sun already partially eclipsed as it rises over the eastern horizon on September 13.\"\n\nA solar eclipse occurs when the moon is between the Earth and Sun. When the sun, moon, and Earth are aligned perfectly in a straight line a total eclipse occurs. But when that alignment is off a little bit, a partial eclipse occurs.
