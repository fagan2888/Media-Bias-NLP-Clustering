"In response to this potential threat, the U.S. Embassy Kabul is advising American citizens to avoid the Star Hotel and to remain vigilant when visiting hotels in Kabul, especially during large gatherings," the embassy said on Twitter.

The warnings follow at least two rockets attacks in the diplomatic zone of Kabul on Saturday just hours after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held meetings with Afghan government leaders in the capital.

The Taliban has stepped up its insurgency since most foreign troops withdrew from Afghanistan at the end of 2014, although Kabul has enjoyed a period of relative calm during the harsh winter months.
