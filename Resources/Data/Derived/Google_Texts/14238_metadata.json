That strong statement is all the more striking because it comes from a man who knows how much progress has been made in digital health.\n\nFarzad Mostashari, MD, was the national coordinator for Health IT from 2011 to 2013. And he told the audience at the HIMSS15 session \u201cNational Perspective on Evolving and Emerging Healthcare Delivery and Payment Models \u201c that the efforts to engage the patient in their own healthcare are not working.\n\n\u201cA lot of health plans pledged to the Blue Button. But it\u2019s not operational. You really can\u2019t get the data,\u201d he said. The heart of the problem, Mostashari said, is that health records are not being shared widely among providers and healthcare systems.\n\n\u201cIf you want to share risk with anyone, you need to share data, so they can be prepared to take that risk,\u201d he said. \u201cPayers and providers need to share incentives with patients; the patient needs to have a more active role in how the decisions are made. \u201c\n\nMostashari believes that the efforts to engage the patient are fundamentally misguided: \u201cThe standard trope is you put all this pressure on hospitals to create public report measures and patients don\u2019t care and it doesn\u2019t change patient behavior. But they\u2019re the wrong measures. They\u2019re payer measures. They\u2019re not patient measures.\n\n\u201cUnless we understand the need to change the payment system the opportunity to improve care through technology will lie latent.\u201d\n\nMostashari said the industry should learn from history. The reason there was a backlash against managed care, was because patients got the idea that everyone was making money by stinting on their care. And there was a backlash against insurance companies that resulted in bad policy. \u201cPatients called their legislators and you end up with payment being approved for treatments like bone marrow treatments for cancer that don\u2019t actually help the patient.\u201d\n\nThe solution is that payers and providers need to share incentives with patients. The patient needs to have a more active role in how the decisions are made.\n\n\u201cTransparency is going to be key. Not just around cost but also around quality. People prioritize cost unless they know something about quality and that is made understandable to them. The standard trope is you put all this pressure on hospitals to create public report measures and patients don\u2019t care and it doesn\u2019t change patient behavior. But they\u2019re the wrong measures. They\u2019re payer measures they\u2019re not patient measures.\u201d\n\nWithout adequate information on quality, patients are left only with information on cost. One example of this is that \u201c60 to 70 percent of people choose the wrong Medicare Part D plan.\u201d\n\nAt heart of the problem is that independent providers \u201ccan\u2019t get clinical data out of their health records without paying usurious fees. You need to be able to get that data out of those systems and right now there are a whole bunch of business practices that are closing population health. Access to the data is absolutely essential to have a functioning market.\u201d\n\nIn spite of the problems, Mostashari said he is optimistic. He believes there is a lot of momentum to align the incentives among payers, providers and patients for the first time.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of investors willing to take risk,\u201d he explained. \u201cAll of the capital needed to take the risk doesn\u2019t need to come from hospitals.\u201d\n\nBut, he cautioned, there will be no shared risk, without shared data.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The progress being made by deploying new technology will be lost unless healthcare payment models change.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "The progress being made by deploying new technology will be lost unless healthcare payment models change.", "title": "Limited data sharing blocks progress in cost reduction", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/limited-data-sharing-blocks-progress-cost-reduction", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/digital_data_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-12T20:32:02-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/limited-data-sharing-blocks-progress-cost-reduction", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/digital_data_0.jpg"}, "description": "The progress being made by deploying new technology will be lost unless healthcare payment models change.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Limited data sharing blocks progress in cost reduction"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-12T20:32:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-12T20:32:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca039\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019re payer measures they\u2019re not patient measures.\u201dWithout adequate information on quality, patients are left only with information on cost.\nThey\u2019re not patient measures.\n\u201cPayers and providers need to share incentives with patients; the patient needs to have a more active role in how the decisions are made.\n\u201cIf you want to share risk with anyone, you need to share data, so they can be prepared to take that risk,\u201d he said.\nHe believes there is a lot of momentum to align the incentives among payers, providers and patients for the first time."}
