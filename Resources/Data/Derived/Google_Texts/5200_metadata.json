The bill now goes to the Ohio Senate.\n\nThe bill would prohibit the sale of crystalline alcohol. It was sponsored by state Reps. Ron Gerberry, D-Austintown, and Jim Buchy, R-Greenville, who claimed the substance was easy to abuse.\n\n\u201cThe public health risk of powdered alcohol is too great for our state to ignore,\u201d Buchy said in a press release announcing the bill. \u201cWe have to do our part in putting forth reasonable laws that protect our children and prevent the availability of drug forms that have a higher potential for abuse.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, those concerns mirror those of U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who asked the Food and Drug Administration to ban it.\n\nIn April, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates taxing and labeling of alcohol products, approved seven flavors of the commercially produced Palcohol. The agency then temporarily rescinded those approvals because of a technical issue with the package fill levels. Palcohol made some changes and resubmitted the labels for approval.\n\nAccording to the product website, founder Mark Phillips does a lot of camping, hiking and biking, but he didn\u2019t want to lug around heavy bottles of alcohol.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great to have alcohol in powder form so all one had to do is add water?\u201d he asked.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t anything like that on the market, so Phillips invented it. He is not granting any media interviews while his product is awaiting federal approval.\n\nDespite being the only product affected by the bill, no one from Lipsmark, the maker of Palcohol, was asked to testify during the House committee hearings.\n\nTraditionally, when a bill is assigned to committee, sponsor and proponent testimony is given, opponent testimony is given, and then the committee votes on the measure.\n\nRep. Mike Dovilla, R-Berea, the chairman of the committee, didn\u2019t return phone calls asking about the lack of opponent testimony.\n\nBecause of an editing error, earlier versions of this story said the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is an Ohio agency. It is a federal agency.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ohio House has passed a measure that would ban crystalline, or powdered alcohol, in the state.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ohio House has passed a measure that would ban crystalline, or powdered alcohol, in the state.", "title": "Why One State Wants to Ban Powdered Alcohol", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10269638_759930897373077_5993851730920010320_n.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-23T00:08:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xtDqkI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ohio House has passed a measure that would ban crystalline, or powdered alcohol, in the state.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10269638_759930897373077_5993851730920010320_n.jpg"}, "title": "Why One State Wants to Ban Powdered Alcohol", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "public health", "published_time": "2014-11-22T03:01:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T00:08:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ohio, powdered alcohol, palcohol"}, "article_summary": "A measure that would ban crystalline, or powdered alcohol, is a step closer to becoming law in Ohio.\n\u201cThe public health risk of powdered alcohol is too great for our state to ignore,\u201d Buchy said in a press release announcing the bill.\nIn April, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates taxing and labeling of alcohol products, approved seven flavors of the commercially produced Palcohol.\nBecause of an editing error, earlier versions of this story said the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is an Ohio agency.\nIt was sponsored by state Reps.
