Fresh off his "Obamacare vs. Affordable Care Act" triumph earlier in the week, Jimmy Kimmel went considerably softer and cuddlier Tuesday night with his interview with 4-year-old Marvel superheroes expert Mia Grace.

The sweet-faced, soft-spoken girl from Albany, N.Y., answered Kimmel's questions with calm and poise, rattling off the name of her favorite Marvel character (Scarlet Witch) and her favorite TV shows ("Superhero Squad").

But then things got strange, as the little girl was tasked with answering Marvel trivia questions against Captain America, Spider-Man and Iron Man. OK, they weren't the real Marvel heroes, but the Hollywood Boulevard impersonators. What's the difference, you ask? Well, the Hollywood Boulevard Spider-Man wears red Chuck Taylors and has a blue toy gun tucked into his waistband. You never saw Tobey Maguire or Andrew Lincoln packing heat.

It looked like a totally lopsided competition at first, but little Mia quickly smoked her competition, answering such questions as "What is Captain America's shield made of?" and "Name a member of Spider-Man's enemy group, the Sinister Six." What made it even more impressive is that not even Hollywood Boulevard Spider-Man could name a member of the Sinister Six.

Final tally: Mia Grace: 9. Marvel heroes: 0.

Mia's prize? Her very own Captain America shield emblazoned with the words "Captain Mia." She also got a trip to Disneyland (she's a kid, after all).
