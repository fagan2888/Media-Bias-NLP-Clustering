Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has won Puerto Rico's Republican primary, his second win of the race for the GOP presidential nomination.

It wasn't clear how many delegates the contest awards him.

The U.S. territory's three super-delegates have committed to Rubio.

If a candidate gets more than half the votes, he gets all the delegates. If no one gets half, the delegates are divided proportionally.

In addition officials say the votes that some 6,000 inmates cast on Friday won't be available until Wednesday.

Rubio also won Minnesota.
