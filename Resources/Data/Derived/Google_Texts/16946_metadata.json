JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) - There were moments last season when the Chiefs\u2019 De\u2019Anthony Thomas resembled the player that rapper Snoop Dogg nicknamed \u201cBlack Mamba,\u201d a shifty do-everything star renowned for his speed and elusiveness on the Pop Warner playing fields.\n\nThere were also moments that he looked like a lost NFL rookie.\n\nNow a year wiser and stronger, Thomas is hoping to build on that debut entering Year 2 with Kansas City. He\u2019s made the switch from running back to wide receiver, but the reality is the spot amounts to semantics - versatility remains a big part of his game.\n\n\u201cI learned the running back stuff last year, now I\u2019m learning the receiver stuff also,\u201d he said. It\u2019s just all about learning the whole offense, and I feel like the more valuable I can be to the team, the more time I can be on the field.\u201d\n\nThomas only played in 12 games last season, and his numbers on offense were modest: 14 carries for 113 yards and a score, and 23 catches for 156 yards.\n\nIn fact, he was more valuable as a kick and punt returner, even taking one punt for a touchdown against Oakland.\n\nBut the Chiefs expect more of the former fourth-round draft pick this season, especially given how thin they are at wide receiver.\n\nJeremy Maclin is the unquestioned leader of the position group, and Jason Avant is the elder statesman. But beyond that, players such as Albert Wilson are big on potential but short on proven ability.\n\n\u201cHe is still taking the ball-handling, still doing stuff in the running back position, but the majority of his snaps were from that receiver position,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said, when asked to explain the switch to wide receiver.\n\n\u201cSo we said, \u2018You know what? Let\u2019s just put him there. We know he can get back there - he does ball-handling, so he works on the runs, but we put the major emphasis on him getting to know those routes better as a receiver.\u2019\u201d\n\nThomas has already turned some heads in training camp. He made such a stunning cut to get open against cornerback Phillip Gaines that the defender went toppling to the ground, captured on a video that quickly went viral.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a whole lot different from Thomas\u2019 days in college, when he would seemingly snap the ankles of a woebegone defender while racing around the field for Oregon.\n\n\u201cI just see myself as a contributor,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSpecial teams is very big for us also. Doing stuff on special teams, and then coming in certain plays and certain formations to get the defense to where I\u2019m at on the field - and how we can beat them.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs have had gadget-type players in the past, such as Dexter McCluster, who played a similar role before Thomas\u2019 arrival.\n\nBut the youngster from Los Angeles possesses a wholly unique combination of speed and quickness that makes him a matchup nightmare.\n\nIn fact, Thomas admits his eyes light up when a bigger cornerback lines up on him.\n\n\u201cReal big. Just making that one move to open his hips up, and that\u2019s the only thing I need. The next is attacking him,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, just letting ability take over. Just being patient and having fun out there.\u201d\n\nIn an interview setting, Thomas punctuates many of his answers with \u201cjust having fun out there,\u201d and for good reason. When you have the ability to make defenders look silly - whether it\u2019s a teammate in training camp or an AFC rival in the regular season - it\u2019s hard not to have fun.\n\n\u201cQuickness and speed, that\u2019s what he\u2019s got. And he\u2019s really strong. For being small, he\u2019s strong,\u201d Reid said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss with him. He is one of those guys you put in that category if you\u2019re a defensive corner or safety and he\u2019s playing on the inside, you do not want to miss if you\u2019re playing press coverage on him. You\u2019re probably not going to catch him.\u201d\n\nNOTES: There were several scuffles in Sunday\u2019s practice, including punches thrown between WR Jeremy Maclin and DB Marcus Cooper. RB Charcandrick West and CB Jamell Fleming got into it, as did WR Albert Wilson and CB Steven Nelson. \u2026 OLB Dee Ford did not practice after going through the concussion protocol following Saturday\u2019s workout.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "There were moments last season when the Chiefs' De'Anthony Thomas resembled the player that rapper Snoop Dogg nicknamed \"Black Mamba,\" a shifty do-everything star renowned for his speed and elusiveness on the Pop Warner playing fields.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There were moments last season when the Chiefs\u2019 De\u2019Anthony Thomas resembled the player that rapper Snoop Dogg nicknamed \u201cBlack Mamba,\u201d a shifty do-everything star renowned for his speed and elusiveness on the Pop Warner playing fields.", "title": "Chiefs\u2019 De\u2019Anthony Thomas hoping to shine at wide receiver", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/9/chiefs-deanthony-thomas-hoping-to-shine-at-wide-re/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/4ee1bdf5f03c43227e0f6a706700d286.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/4ee1bdf5f03c43227e0f6a706700d286.jpg", "description": "There were moments last season when the Chiefs' De'Anthony Thomas resembled the player that rapper Snoop Dogg nicknamed \"Black Mamba,\" a shifty do-everything star renowned for his speed and elusivenes", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Chiefs\u2019 De\u2019Anthony Thomas hoping to shine at wide receiver"}, "Author": "DAVE SKRETTA", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca421\"", "article_summary": "But the Chiefs expect more of the former fourth-round draft pick this season, especially given how thin they are at wide receiver.\nNow a year wiser and stronger, Thomas is hoping to build on that debut entering Year 2 with Kansas City.\n\u201cI learned the running back stuff last year, now I\u2019m learning the receiver stuff also,\u201d he said.\nHe\u2019s made the switch from running back to wide receiver, but the reality is the spot amounts to semantics - versatility remains a big part of his game.\n(AP) - There were moments last season when the Chiefs\u2019 De\u2019Anthony Thomas resembled the player that rapper Snoop Dogg nicknamed \u201cBlack Mamba,\u201d a shifty do-everything star renowned for his speed and elusiveness on the Pop Warner playing fields."}
