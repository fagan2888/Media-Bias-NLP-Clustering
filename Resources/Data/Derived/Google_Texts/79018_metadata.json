Fletcher was injured about a minute later. He also hurt his left knee, although CU has never revealed the specific injury.\n\nDinwiddie, the Buffs\u2019 standout junior point guard, is out for the season. Fletcher, a true freshman reserve, was originally expected to miss six-to-eight weeks, but it\u2019s possible he could be back sooner than that.\n\n\u201cWe hope so,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cA lot of that will depend on the rehab and how it goes. We\u2019re hoping four-to-six weeks on him.\n\n\u201cSpencer\u2019s surgery went well and the doctors expect a full recovery. Good news on both of them.\u201d\n\nFor the past week, the Buffs have been adjusting to life without both players, but without Dinwiddie in particular. Dinwiddie had started 86 consecutive games and he leads the team in scoring (14.7 points per game), assists (3.8 per game) and minutes played (31.1 per game). He also led the team in free throw attempts (119) and had the highest free-throw percentage on the team, at 85.7 percent.\n\nIncluding Monday afternoon\u2019s practice, the Buffs have now had four full practices and two games without their star.\n\n\u201cI think the guys understand now that he\u2019s not here; Fletch isn\u2019t here,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cI think we\u2019re past that mental hurdle. The shock value has worn off.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his stellar statistics, Dinwiddie brought exceptional leadership. Boyle said this week\u2019s road trip to No. 1 Arizona and Arizona State will tell where the Buffs are in that regard.\n\n\u201cLeadership is tested when things aren\u2019t going good. Against UCLA (last Thursday), I\u2019m not sure it was as good as it needed to be,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out on this road trip when we\u2019re tested and our backs are against the wall. It\u2019s going to continue to be a challenge.\u201d\n\nFletcher averages just 3.5 points and 10.2 minutes per game, but had been developing into a key defender off the bench.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that one less perimeter guy,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cIt\u2019s put a lot more pressure on Xavier Johnson and Jaron Hopkins defensively, because (Fletcher) is that extra big wing that defensively was getting better.\n\n\u201cThat length on the defensive end at the wing position is where we really miss Tre\u2019Shaun. As long as Xavier Johnson is playing well and Jaron is playing well defensively it won\u2019t hurt us.\u201d\n\nDropping out\n\nAfter six straight weeks of being in the national Top 25 rankings, the Buffs dropped out on Monday.\n\nIn addition to losing Dinwiddie, the Buffs lost two games in a row, both by double figures before recovering to beat Southern Cal last Saturday.\n\nOn Monday, the Buffs received 26 points in the Associated Press poll, good for 30th. They dropped from No. 21 a week earlier. CU came in with the 28th-most points in the USA Today Coaches\u2019 poll, dropping from No. 22 a week ago.\n\nNotable\n\nMonday wasn\u2019t a stellar practice for the Buffs. \u201cIt might have been our worst,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cThank God we didn\u2019t play today.\u201d \u2026 Despite their drop from the national polls, the Buffs are holding strong in the RPI rankings. CU was at No. 18 on Monday, according to realtimerpi.com.\n\nContact BuffZone.com Writer Brian Howell at howellb@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/brianhowell33.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado basketball players Spencer Dinwiddie, Tre\u2019Shaun Fletcher underwent successful knee surgeries", "title": "Colorado basketball players Spencer Dinwiddie, Tre\u2019Shaun Fletcher underwent successful knee surgeries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/20/colorado-basketball-players-spencer-dinwiddie-treshaun-fletcher-underwent-successful-knee-surgeries/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140112__spencer-dinwiddie-cubuffs-011214p1-2.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140112__spencer-dinwiddie-cubuffs-011214p1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-20T18:26:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:59:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2689\"", "article_summary": "Colorado men\u2019s basketball players Spencer Dinwiddie and Tre\u2019Shaun Fletcher both underwent successful knee surgeries on Monday in Lone Tree.\nGood news on both of them.\u201dFor the past week, the Buffs have been adjusting to life without both players, but without Dinwiddie in particular.\nDinwiddie tore the ACL in his left knee on Jan. 12, during the first half of a 71-54 loss at Washington.\nFletcher, a true freshman reserve, was originally expected to miss six-to-eight weeks, but it\u2019s possible he could be back sooner than that.\nDinwiddie, the Buffs\u2019 standout junior point guard, is out for the season."}
