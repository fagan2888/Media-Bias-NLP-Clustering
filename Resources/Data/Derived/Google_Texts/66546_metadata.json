But Michael Cleveland was doing all of these things, and a doctor still declared him dead. He was wrong, and the upstate New York man ended up \u201cdying\u201d twice \u2014 the first time, when he was mistaken for dead, and a second time, for real.\n\nCleveland\u2019s wife Tammy is now filing a lawsuit against two doctors and two hospitals involved with her husband\u2019s treatment after he collapsed from a heart attack. Tammy claims that a doctor at DeGraff Medical Hospital declared her husband dead, then ignored the family\u2019s urges that he was still alive. According to the lawsuit, doctors assured Tammy three times that her husband was dead, and that any movement was because he \u201chad a lot of energy to expel from his body.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctor told me that it would appear like he was breathing, but he really wasn\u2019t,\u201d Tammy told the Democrat & Chronicle. \u201cI said, \u2018but he\u2019s responding to me\u2026he (tried) to hug me.\u2019\u201d\n\nTammy claims that she called Dr. Gregory Perry and nurses back into the room multiple times, but they \u201cdid not touch [Cleveland] or check his vitals but told the family members this was normal, and they again left the room,\u201d according to the lawsuit. It was not until the fourth time that Perry entered the room that he finally checked Cleveland's pulse.\n\n\u201cMy God, he has a pulse!\u201d he said, according to Tammy.\n\nOne hundred minutes had passed since the first declaration of death. Cleveland was then transferred to Buffalo General Medical Center for further care. Once there, it was determined that he was in danger not because of the heart attack, but because of respiratory issues caused by a collapsed lung. Tammy said that the doctor told her her husband would have most likely lived if the lung had been treated sooner. Michael Cleveland instead died in the early morning hours.\n\nThe family is seeking damages from both doctors and both hospitals that treated him. The lawsuit says the doctors\u2019 actions \u201ctranscend the bounds of human decency and constitute shocking and outrageous conduct.\u201d\n\nTammy Cleveland\u2019s attorney said that the case is more about accountability and closure than money, a sentiment that Tammy echoed.\n\n\u201cI want him to apologize,\u201d she said of Perry. \u201cI want him to apologize to my family, I want him to apologize to Mike. And I want to make sure it\u2019s never going to happen again to anyone else.\u201d\n\nThe next hearing for the case will take place on Feb. 24, and Tammy will appear in court alongside the doctor she is suing.\n\n\u201cI wonder if this guy sleeps at night,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I sure don\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "back, dead, man, dies, twice, heart, attack, wife, sues, doctor", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An upstate New York man was declared dead, but almost two hours later, he had a pulse.", "title": "A Heart Attack Killed This Man\u2026 Twice", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/back-dead-man-dies-twice-heart-attack-wife-sues-doctor-357408", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/15/hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An upstate New York man was declared dead, but almost two hours later, he had a pulse.", "title": "A Heart Attack Killed This Man\u2026 Twice", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/back-dead-man-dies-twice-heart-attack-wife-sues-doctor-357408", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/15/hospital.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/15/hospital.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-10-15T13:45:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-15T13:45:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An upstate New York man was declared dead, but almost two hours later, he had a pulse."}, "article_summary": "Tammy said that the doctor told her her husband would have most likely lived if the lung had been treated sooner.\nTammy claims that a doctor at DeGraff Medical Hospital declared her husband dead, then ignored the family\u2019s urges that he was still alive.\nCleveland\u2019s wife Tammy is now filing a lawsuit against two doctors and two hospitals involved with her husband\u2019s treatment after he collapsed from a heart attack.\nBut Michael Cleveland was doing all of these things, and a doctor still declared him dead.\nHe was wrong, and the upstate New York man ended up \u201cdying\u201d twice \u2014 the first time, when he was mistaken for dead, and a second time, for real."}
