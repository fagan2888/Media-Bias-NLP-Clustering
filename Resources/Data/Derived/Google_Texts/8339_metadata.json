He\u2019s not afraid to say that we\u2019ve lost our good character.\u201d\n\nMartin\u2019s comment about Trump\u2019s choice of words when describing complex issues echoes linguistic analysis conducted on the texts of his speeches, with another placing him in the third grade.\n\nAccording to long time Republican Martin, she recently grew disenchanted with the GOP and \u2013surprisingly \u2014 compared Trump\u2019s style to President Obama.\n\n\u201cThey [the GOP] did nothing on Obamacare, nothing on cutting spending, nothing on restoring honesty. They hate us, so now I\u2019m done with Republicans,\u201d she explained. \u201cTrump is not one of them. He doesn\u2019t hate us. He really believes we can make America great again, and I\u2019m not an optimistic person, but I think he can, because he\u2019s got a built-in ability to use the media, just like Obama.\u201d\n\nSaying he first began \u201claughing at this Trump guy like everyone else,\u201d Joe McCoy said he has come around to appreciating Trump, going so far as to describe him as a \u201cmoderate,\u201d despite the candidate\u2019s anti-immigrant views.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a rigid tea partier,\u201d the 31-year-old explained. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of government paying for roads and the fire department. Social Security is a great thing. But I don\u2019t think Trump is really much of a conservative; he\u2019s definitely more moderate than the others.\u201d\n\nWhat makes a candidate \u201cmoderate\u201d may be in the eyes of the beholder, with McCoy complaining about undocumented immigrants and \u201cletting kids go into whichever bathroom they want to in school.\u201d\n\nFor 70-year-old Steve Trivett, Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cmake America great again\u201d warrants a \u201c\u2018Hallelujah!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen America was great, our economy was strong. Our economy\u2019s been shipped off to other countries. Can Donald Trump solve that? Hell, I don\u2019t know. Somebody not as flamboyant or egomaniacal might be more effective, but I\u2019m not sure anybody can bring us back. At least Trump gets things done,\u201d Trivett rationalized. \u201cThe last Democrat I voted for was Jimmy Carter. He was a good, honest man, and the system ate him up. So maybe we need a guy like Trump.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Trump-CPAC-photo-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Trump volunteer: \u2018He sounds like a fourth-grader\u2019 but I\u2019ll vote for him anyway"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Holly Martin, a 57-year-old freelance technology writer who is doing volunteer work for the Trump campaign in Winchester, Virginia, admits her favorite candidate has his faults, but that hasn\u2019t stopped her from supporting him.\n\u201cThe way he talks is just silly sometimes \u2014 he sounds like a fourth-grader,\u201d she said before adding that Trump, \u201c\u2026 talks like a regular guy, and he actually loves this country.\nSo maybe we need a guy like Trump.\u201d\nAccording to long time Republican Martin, she recently grew disenchanted with the GOP and \u2013surprisingly \u2014 compared Trump\u2019s style to President Obama.\nSomebody not as flamboyant or egomaniacal might be more effective, but I\u2019m not sure anybody can bring us back."}
