The passing of Justice Scalia leaves the Court without its most entertaining voice and with only eight justices for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile Congress argues over Scalia\u2019s successor, the prospect of a 4-4 tie hangs over the Court\u2019s most controversial cases, including issues such as abortion, affirmative action, and the ACA\u2019s contraception mandate. Because while Justice Scalia\u2019s loss was significant, the work of the Court must continue.\n\nClarence Thomas Speaks\n\nWhile Justice Clarence Thomas may not be able to fill the shoes of his Conservative colleague, he did ask his first question during oral argument in a decade. In fact, Justice Thomas asked nearly ten questions in a discussion with the assistant solicitor general representing the federal government in a Second Amendment case.\n\nJustice Thomas questioned whether a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence should prevent two Maine men from possessing firearms. \u201cThis is a misdemeanor violation. It suspends a constitutional right,\u201d Thomas stated. \u201cCan you give me another area where a misdemeanor violation suspends a constitutional right?\u201d\n\nThomas famously avoids participating in oral arguments, preferring to allow the lawyers to argue their cases. With regard to the significance of the question in Justice Scalia\u2019s absence, Adam Liptak of The New York Times wrote:\n\nJustice Scalia\u2019s death was a sort of passing of the baton, leaving Justice Thomas as the only member of the court fully committed to the mode of constitutional interpretation known as originalism, which seeks to apply the understanding of those who drafted and ratified the Constitution.\n\nIt will be interesting if Justice Thomas becomes more vocal in future cases or more motivated to speak given the significance of the Constitutional question at issue.\n\nOral Arguments in February\n\nThe Court did not issue any opinions in February. However, the justices did hear oral arguments in several key cases. In Utah v. Strieff, the Court addressed whether evidence seized incident to a lawful arrest on an outstanding warrant should be suppressed because the initial investigatory stop was later found to be unlawful. The Court also heard oral arguments in another death penalty case. The issues in Williams v. Pennsylvania centered on judicial bias, notably whether the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments are violated where a state judge declines to recuse himself in a capital case in which he had personally approved the decision to pursue capital punishment as the former prosecutor.\n\nBusiness interests will be closely watching the Court\u2019s decision in Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc. The key question in the intellectual property case is when higher damages should be awarded in patent infringement cases.\n\nOn Tap for March\n\nSeveral potential landmark cases are on the docket for March. Most notably, Justice Scalia\u2019s absence will likely influence the Court\u2019s decision in its first significant abortion case in nearly ten years. The case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, involves whether abortion restrictions imposes by the State of Texas are legitimate health regulations or simply a means to shutter a large majority of the state\u2019s abortion clinics.\n\nThe Court will also consider its third challenge to the Affordable Care Act. The issue this time around is whether the statute\u2019s contraceptive-coverage mandate and its \u201caccommodation,\u201d which requires religiously affiliated nonprofit corporations that object to birth control coverage to notify their insurance company, third-party benefits administrator, or federal government about their objection, violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The case is also predicted to divide the Court among liberals and conservatives and could result in a 4-4 tie.\n\nDonald Scarinci is a managing partner at Lyndhurst, N.J. based law firm Scarinci Hollenbeck.
