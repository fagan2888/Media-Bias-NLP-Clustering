â€” A driver from Raleigh faces charges of speeding and driving without a license for causing the crash that closed northbound lanes of Interstate 95 Wednesday afternoon east of Fayetteville.

According to the state Highway Patrol, Rashad Ja-Phori Muldrow, 22, of 830 Peyton St., lost control of his Ford F-150 as he entered the interstate from N.C. Highway 24. Muldrow's truck crossed the median and rolled in front of a UPS truck driven by Romondt Taylor, 54, of North Chesterfield, Va.

Both trucks caught fire, and the highway was shut down for about an hour, troopers said. Traffic in the area was restricted to the service lane for about 5 hours. For a short while, N.C. 24 was closed where it crosses I-95.

Both men were injured. Muldrow had a broken arm and Taylor a hip injury, although neither required overnight hospitalization, troopers said.
