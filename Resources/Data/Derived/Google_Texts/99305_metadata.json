It\u2019s a snapshot that illustrates how Adams, now a senior guard at Wyoming, has used the perpetual chip on his shoulder to transform himself into a monster on the basketball court.\n\nTwo weeks before that state title game, Chaparral hosted Dakota Ridge in the second round. With a talented, senior-laden roster, it was supposed to be a brief pit stop on the way to a state title. But with 2\u00bd minutes to go, Adams and the Wolverines were down by 10 points, and their dream of a state title was about to end before the run truly started.\n\n\u201cWe call a timeout, and as soon as we sit down, Josh takes over the huddle,\u201d Johnson recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t say one word. Josh looked every kid in the eye, and when he looked them in the eye, they knew he meant what he was saying, that there was no way we were going to go out like this. And that we were going to dominate those last 2\u00bd minutes.\u201d\n\nThe inspired Wolverines stormed out of the huddle on fire, and one minute later the score was tied. They won on a last-second shot to begin a dream run that ended with Adams\u2019 memorable play in the championship game.\n\nFour years later, Adams is again trying to grab a team by the collar and drag it up to his level, one that spews competitiveness and an edge few prep players coming out of Colorado have matched.\n\nAdams entered Friday averaging 25.7 points per game, good for fourth-best in the country. Along the way he has helped a Wyoming team depleted by the mass exodus of seniors from last season\u2019s NCAA Tournament team to an 8-8 record.\n\nAt 6-foot-2, with eye-popping leaping ability and athletic burst, Adams no doubt has been bestowed his fair share of physical gifts. But it\u2019s his relentless, us-against-the-world mentality that has made him a fan favorite in Laramie.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s part of my family\u2019s DNA,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe\u2019re all very fiery. That\u2019s where I get my competitive edge, and I think I\u2019m probably one of the more competitive and more fiery people in my family. I\u2019ve never really been talked about or very highly recruited. People have always said, \u2018He can do this, but he can\u2019t do that.\u2019 So I\u2019ve always had that chip on my shoulder. And no challenge is too big for me.\u201d\n\nWhat has impressed Johnson most is the way Adams has learned to channel the inferno that burns inside him. As a freshman at Chaparral, Johnson remembers seeing Adams on the bench after making a mistake. His hands would shake. His face would be flushed red with anger.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t console him,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou felt like if you put him back in there, he would have swallowed someone whole. That\u2019s how fierce he was.\u201d\n\nThat edge remains for Adams, but he has grown. Heading into this season, he devoured books on leadership and had long talks with Wyoming coach Larry Shyatt about how to press the right buttons to get the most out of teammates.\n\nIt\u2019s a role Adams has relished with typical zeal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d Adams said. \u201cYou learn how to say things, when to say things, when guys like to be approached. \u2026 It\u2019s about coming together and building trust.\u201d\n\nNick Kosmider: nkosmider@denverpost.com or @NickKosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kosmider: Josh Adams eager to lead Wyoming basketball this season", "title": "Kosmider: Josh Adams eager to lead Wyoming basketball this season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/kosmider-josh-adams-eager-to-lead-wyoming-basketball-this-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__a3432cb1456ed4018c0f6a706700db42p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__a3432cb1456ed4018c0f6a706700db42p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T17:30:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:43:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With a talented, senior-laden roster, it was supposed to be a brief pit stop on the way to a state title.\nTwo weeks before that state title game, Chaparral hosted Dakota Ridge in the second round.\nAs a freshman at Chaparral, Johnson remembers seeing Adams on the bench after making a mistake.\nAlong the way he has helped a Wyoming team depleted by the mass exodus of seniors from last season\u2019s NCAA Tournament team to an 8-8 record.\nAnd no challenge is too big for me.\u201dWhat has impressed Johnson most is the way Adams has learned to channel the inferno that burns inside him."}
