(Tom Fox/AP Photo/Dallas Morning News)\n\nDALLAS \u2014 Hunt the black rhino to save the black rhino.\n\nThat's the Dallas Safari Club's approach to a fundraiser for efforts to protect the endangered species. The group hopes to raise more than $200,000 Saturday by auctioning off the right to shoot and kill a black rhinoceros in the African nation of Namibia.\n\nBut the auction has drawn howls from critics, including wildlife and animal rights groups, and the FBI earlier this week said it was investigating death threats against members of the club.\n\nBen Carter, executive director of the Safari Club, defended the auction. He said all money raised will go toward rhino conservation efforts. He also said the rhino that the winner will hunt is old, male and nonbreeding \u2014 and that the animal was likely to be targeted for removal anyway because it was becoming aggressive and threatening other wildlife.\n\nCarter added that wildlife experts say culling a herd is an acceptable habitat management practice.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, this animal is detrimental,\u201d Carter said. \u201cHe's past his prime.\u201d\n\nBut critics have questioned that logic. Officials from the Humane Society and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have said that while culling can be appropriate in abundant animal populations, all black rhinos should be protected, given their endangered status.\n\nAn estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 are in Namibia, according to the safari club.\n\nCritics have also said any hunting of a rhino sends a bad message to the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis auction is telling the world that an American will pay anything to kill their species,\u201d Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director of the Massachusetts-based IFAW, said earlier this week. \u201cThis is, in fact, making a spectacle of killing an endangered species.\u201d\n\nThe auction was to take place Saturday night in downtown Dallas under tight security and behind closed doors. Organizers hoped to at least break the previous high bid for one of the permits in Namibia, which is $223,000, and had said the amount could be as high as $1 million. The winning bidder could come from anywhere in the world, and at least some bidders are expected to enter by phone.\n\nProtesters were expected to rally against the auction Saturday.\n\nCarter said he and Safari Club members were deluged in the days before the auction by angry messages, including the death threats.\n\n\u201cIt appears to be an orchestrated series from people who are strongly anti-hunting,\u201d Carter said.\n\nPoachers long have targeted all species of rhino, primarily for its horn, which is valuable on the international black market. Made of the protein keratin, the chief component in fingernails and hooves, the horn has been used in carvings and for medicinal purposes, mostly in Asia. The near-extinction of the species also has been attributed to habitat loss.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2014-01-12T06:02:29-0700", "modificationDate": "2014-01-12T06:02:36-0700", "byline": "By Michael Graczyk", "sailthru.author": "By Michael Graczyk and Nomaan Merchant, The Associated Press", "description": "Hunt the black rhino to save the black rhino.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:24896118:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site67/2014/0112/20140112__e1305513-4b95-46d6-ae50-c4cc72730dbb~l~soriginal~ph.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hunt the black rhino to save the black rhino.", "title": "Is hunting an endangered species the best way to save it?"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Hunt the black rhino to save the black rhino.", "title": "Is hunting an endangered species the best way to save it?", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site67/2014/0112/20140112__e1305513-4b95-46d6-ae50-c4cc72730dbb~l~soriginal~ph.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-12T06:02:29-0700", "endDate": "2024-01-12T06:02:29-0700", "sailthru.title": "Is hunting an endangered species the best way to save it?", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-01-12T06:02:59-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a89\"", "article_summary": "(Tom Fox/AP Photo/Dallas Morning News)DALLAS \u2014 Hunt the black rhino to save the black rhino.\nThat's the Dallas Safari Club's approach to a fundraiser for efforts to protect the endangered species.\nPoachers long have targeted all species of rhino, primarily for its horn, which is valuable on the international black market.\nNearly 1,800 are in Namibia, according to the safari club.\nCarter said he and Safari Club members were deluged in the days before the auction by angry messages, including the death threats."}
