Despite several missing data points, the applicants were all allowed to keep their coverage this year.\n\n- This post was updated at 5:14 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Some people may not have been qualified for the benefits they received.", "description": "Some people may not have been qualified for the benefits they received.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Some people may not have been qualified for the benefits they received.", "title": "Audit: Not all healthcare customers fully vetted by HealthCare.gov", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250736-audit-not-all-healthcare-customers-fully-vetted-by-healthcaregov", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/obamacare_121514getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250736-audit-not-all-healthcare-customers-fully-vetted-by-healthcaregov", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-10T13:17-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-10T13:17:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250736-audit-not-all-healthcare-customers-fully-vetted-by-healthcaregov", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Some people may not have been qualified for the benefits they received.", "card": "summary", "title": "Audit: Not all healthcare customers fully vetted by HealthCare.gov"}, "dcterms.title": "Audit: Not all healthcare customers fully vetted by HealthCare.gov"}, "article_summary": "Some people who signed up for healthcare through ObamaCare may not have been qualified for the benefits they received, according to a government audit released Monday.\nThe audit also found that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was not always tough enough on applicants.\nADVERTISEMENTFor several months after the rollout of HealthCare.gov, the government\u2019s website was unable to verify important parts of a customer\u2019s application, such as household income, citizenship status and family size.\nThe report comes less than one month after another government investigator found that HealthCare.gov had approved 11 fictitious applications in its first year.\nThe audit, which was completed by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s inspector general, tracked sample applicants to determine weaknesses with the system's internal controls."}
