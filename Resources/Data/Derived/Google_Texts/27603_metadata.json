That suggests there is more downward pressure on the loonie to come.\n\n\"Everything is taking cues from crude prices, and nothing more strongly so than the Canadian dollar,\" said Adam Cole, head of G10 currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe poll of 45 foreign exchange strategists forecast the currency to weaken to C$1.42 in a month from Tuesday's close of C$1.4051, a downgrade from C$1.39 expected in January's poll.\n\nFrom there, the loonie will likely recover modestly to C$1.40 in six months and C$1.37 in a year versus C$1.37 and C$1.34 predicted in the previous survey. That is about 30 percent below C$1.067, where it was trading when oil prices plummeted.\n\nCrude oil is down more than 70 percent since mid-2014.\n\nThe poll's 12-month forecasts were in a particularly wide range, from a 7 percent drop to a gain of 11 percent. Saxo Bank, the most bearish on the Canadian dollar in the poll, expects C$1.55 in six months and C$1.50 in a year.\n\nThe other unknown is what the Bank of Canada will do with rates. It cut them twice last year in an attempt to offset the oil price shock that eventually pushed the economy into recession.\n\nAnd while many in financial markets expected it to cut again, it left rates unchanged at 0.50 percent at its latest policy meeting on Jan. 20.\n\nBut with barely any economic growth, some economists expect the central bank to reduce rates further, perhaps as early as March.\n\nThat would keep the Bank of Canada on a very different path from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December.\n\nThe deeper the drop in crude prices, the more likely it will be that U.S. and Canadian monetary policy diverges further, said RBC's Cole.\n\nBearish bets on the Canadian dollar rose to their highest in five months last week, according Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\n\nHowever, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has continued to pin hopes on an export-led recovery in Canada driven by a weaker Canadian dollar and stronger U.S. demand.\n\nBut that hasn't happened yet.\n\n\"So far the story has been one of disappointments,\" said Cole.\n\nU.S. economic growth braked sharply in the fourth quarter, casting doubts not only on its ability to lift Canadian export growth, but also on whether the Fed will soon follow up on its December hike with another.\n\nHendrix Vachon, currency strategist at Desjardins Group, said it will be \"trouble for the Canadian economy\" if a boost to export growth doesn't materialize, especially when the economy is reeling under the double-barrelled blow of weak domestic demand and collapsing investment in oil production.\n\nBut Vachon, who forecasts the dollar at C$1.37 in a year, expects a U.S.-led recovery in exports in the coming months and oil prices to pick up by the end of the year.\n\n(Polling by Shrutee Sarkar and Kailash Bathija; Editing by Ross Finley and Meredith Mazzilli)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - The battered Canadian dollar is expected to weaken even more, tied to the", "title": "Canadian dollar to resume losing streak in months ahead: Reuters poll", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/03/Canadian-dollar-resume-losing-streak-months-ahead-Reuters-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-canada-forex_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/03/Canadian-dollar-resume-losing-streak-months-ahead-Reuters-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-canada-forex_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "(Reuters) - The battered Canadian dollar is expected to weaken even more, tied to the", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Bearish bets on the Canadian dollar rose to their highest in five months last week, according Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\nSaxo Bank, the most bearish on the Canadian dollar in the poll, expects C$1.55 in six months and C$1.50 in a year.\n\"Everything is taking cues from crude prices, and nothing more strongly so than the Canadian dollar,\" said Adam Cole, head of G10 currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\nThat is about 30 percent below C$1.067, where it was trading when oil prices plummeted.\n(Reuters) - The battered Canadian dollar is expected to weaken even more, tied to the ill fortunes of depressed oil prices and the prospect of another interest rate cut, a Reuters poll showed."}
