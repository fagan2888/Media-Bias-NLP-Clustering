Reverend Hayley Young was diagnosed as HIV-positive following a non-sexual attack in 2013. However, it was only until this month that she revealed her status to her congregation following growing concerns over her progressive hair loss. Now, the heartwarming video has had thousands of views on YouTube and is helping to break the stigma still placed on HIV-positive individuals.

Prior to the recent release of her video on May 10, Young had shared her HIV status with only a handful of close family and friends, the BBC reported. Now her health is international news. Young, however, is happy for the newfound fame, as she hopes it will help to counter any myths and misconceptions surrounding those with the HIV infections.

In her video, in which she creatively writes on cardboard cutouts to communicate, Young tells of how some came to view her as “dangerous” and “a risk” once they learned of her diagnosis, but she insists that she continues to laugh and joke despite the struggle.

"I think people were worried about me being around children, how they can contract it," she told British TV host Victoria Derbyshire, as reported by the BBC. "People just don't know unfortunately."

Along with clarifying how one can and cannot contract the disease, Young sheds light on some of the inner struggles that HIV-positive individuals deal with.

"I’m scared of: not being in control, not getting old, being judged,” and “people’s perceptions of me,” Young writes.

Despite the criticism, the overwhelming majority of viewers describe being both inspired and encouraged by Young’s video.

"On the whole, the congregation have been amazing and [they're from] a variety of ages and a variety of backgrounds, so I've been humbled by their positivity," she says.
