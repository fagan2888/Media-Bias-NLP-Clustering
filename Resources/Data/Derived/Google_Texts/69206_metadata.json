Nevertheless, the NRMA opposed the bill \u201con the grounds that Federal legislation is not needed, that the added cost to administer such a law is unnecessary, and that an equitable law would be complex, confusing and difficult to enforce.\u201d Ad Policy\n\nFifty-one years later, the conservative, anti-feminist Independent Women\u2019s Forum has this to say about the Paycheck Fairness Act, which expands on the 1963 legislation and will likely succumb this week to a Republican filibuster in the Senate: \u201cClearly, sex-based wage discrimination is wrong. Furthermore, it\u2019s already illegal\u2026This latest legislation\u2014the Paycheck Fairness Act\u2014won\u2019t lead to more fairness or better pay. It will lead to more lawsuits, more red tape and fewer job opportunities for women and men.\u201d\n\nNot as much has changed since 1963 as one might have hoped, either in the workplace or in politics. Back then opponents of the Equal Pay Act said states were adequately addressing the issue of of equal pay. Others made excuses for the fact that women made 59 cents for every dollar their male colleagues earned, arguing, as Council of Economic Advisers chair Walter Heller did, that the \u201cadded costs\u201d of hiring women were to blame. Skepticism about labor protection for women wasn\u2019t strictly partisan; the Democratic chairman of the House subcommittee on labor reportedly kept documents related to the Equal Pay Act filed under B, for \u201cBroads.\u201d\n\nNo one says now that the 1963 law was unnecessary or insignificant, though as its supporters acknowledged at the time of its passage, it was only a first step. Today, women make 77 cents to a man\u2019s dollar\u2014or just 64 cents and 55 cents for black and Hispanic women, respectively\u2014and Republicans are dusting off arguments from last century to block updated legislation, claiming that while they still support its underlying principles, today\u2019s pay really is equal, or else the work is not.
