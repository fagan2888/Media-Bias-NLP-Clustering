As an excuse, asking for pardon (as in \u201cpardon, me\u201d) is rather commonplace in our everyday lives.\n\nBut in law a pardon has a much more dire meaning, as release from the actual penalty of an offense, or a remission of a crime by some authority \u2013 be it a governor, president or even the pope. Indeed, this involves forgiveness of a far more serious sort.\n\nThis idea of release from penalty originated in the 13th century with the papal indulgences and the Old French \u201cpar don\u201d or Latin \u201cperdonare\u2019 to give a remit. Pardons became a big business; they were sold and traded.\n\nToday our presidents can circumvent the justice system by issuing official pardons of their choosing, granting clemency, as it is known. Such acts cannot be altered by Congress, cannot be reviewed, blocked or overturn. The most controversial pardons in U.S. history have included: the whiskey rebels, Brigham Young, confederate soldiers, Eugene Debs, Jimmy Hoffa, Richard Nixon, Patty Hearst and Marc Rich.\n\nFast forward to the American political scene in the present frame. Candidate Hillary Clinton, the ultimate Washington insider and Democratic Party front-running candidate to be the next president, is both asking for and needs numerous pardons. Will the American people give her a pass? Will the justice system overlook possible criminal violations?\n\nShe is saying, \u201cPardon me for my slightest of mistakes or oversights. I did not mean any harm when, as I told the congressional committee, we were just trying to deal with the complex Benghazi events. I never meant to hurt anyone \u2013 not the ambassador, nor the security guards, and certainly not poor Susan Rice, whom I knowingly sent onto the weekend television shows to tell a falsehood to cover my tracks.\u201d\n\nA fascinating, can\u2019t-put-it-down memoir describing the power cabal from the inside, Theodore Roosevelt Malloch\u2019s new book, \u201cDavos, Aspen & Yale: My Life Behind the Elite Curtain as a Global Sherpa\u201d\n\nHillary\u2019s request to be pardoned does not stop there.\n\n\u201cPardon me for Libya and for the birth of ISIS,\u201d she says, noting that she is not allowed to call it Islamic terrorism, as that would offend many Muslims.\n\n\u201cI never imagined such could flow from the Arab Spring,\u201d Hillary continues. \u201cThat was supposed to go, oh so differently. It was always intended to be a democracy movement, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can always blame it on David Cameron or the Europeans, as President Obama, the anointed One, did recently in The Atlantic magazine,\u201d she pleads. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault or his! Besides, it was Bush that started this whole mess. When in doubt I always blame Bush. It\u2019s so easy to have a scapegoat that you almost don\u2019t need to ask for a pardon at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Obamacare, remember, I am the original author and chair of the task force that devised the plan \u2018Hillarycare,\u2019 as my detractors called it officially the Health Security Act of 1993, during my husband\u2019s presidency. That led to our massive congressional defeat in 1994 and the \u2018Contract with America,\u2019 which changed American politics, shifting power in the House of Representatives to the Republicans after a long 40 years in the dark. Thank you, Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey for that disservice.\u201d\n\nHillary continues, asking for even more pardons.\n\n\u201cPardon me for not being harder on my predator and sex-addicted husband, Bill, who, as we know from the television drama \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 is wedded to me not as a betrothed marriage partner, so much as a political partner,\u201d she argues. \u201cI stood by my man on \u20186o Minutes\u2019 long ago so he could win. Now, he will do the same for me so I can win.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am no feminist, so I guess you will have to excuse all my actions in the war on women,\u201d she reasons. \u201cReally, Bill can\u2019t help himself, as we know from the sordid intern-affair with what\u2019s her name \u2013 but I did look the other way to enable him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask your pardon as well for an embarrassing defeat in 2008 in the primaries to that black candidate I tried to smear,\u201d she notes. \u201cEven Bill calling Barack a fantasy came to no avail. Look, we did not mean any racial slur. You see, I supported Barack in victory and even served his administration for four years.\n\n\u201cBut it is the legal sense of pardon that I now plead, so I can advance to my lifelong dream of capturing the White House,\u201d she concludes.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I need a pardon in that strictest sense from both Attorney General Lynch and from my former boss, President Obama, as soon as possible and certainly before November\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cI need it to get me off the hook for my HUGE violation of U.S. laws regarding the use of a private email server routed through my private residence, violating numerous federal laws, where classified information was compromised,\u201d she insists, expressing determination.\n\n\u201cJust in case the FBI calls for my imminent indictment, I, Hillary Clinton, need to cash in a big IOU with President Obama. Please, pretty please, do pardon me,\u201d she asks, showing real emotion. \u201cI promise, Mr. President, that after this one last pardon, I\u2019ll never need to ask again. After all, once I\u2019m president, I can pardon myself whenever I need to do so.\u201d\n\nThen she paused, having one last thought.\n\n\u201cAnd when I leave office,\u201d she says, with glee, \u201cI grant my self a future pardon, for any and all crimes and misdemeanors I might commit some time, or any time, in the future. If I\u2019m really clever, I\u2019ll pardon myself into eternity, making it a whole lot easier when finally I encounter St. Peter there, waiting at the Pearly Gates to allow me entry.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Stop Hillary\u2019 campaign is on fire!
