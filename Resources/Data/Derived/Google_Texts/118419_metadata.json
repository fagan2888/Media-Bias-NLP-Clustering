That's true, the company said, even if they are eligible for tax credits to offset the cost of coverage.\n\n\"It isn't just a 'young and reckless; mentality keeping so-called young invincibles from signing up,\" NerdWallet said. \"Many young adults will follow a logical financial rationale for remaining uninsured in 2014.\"\n\nThat view conflicts with claims by federal officials, who this week said they expect a significant jump in the percentage of young adults buying plans by the March 31 deadline for open enrollment.\n\n(Read more: Obamacare blitz woos the young with star power)\n\n\n\nAs of Dec. 28, just 24 percent of the 2.2 million enrollees were adults between 18 and 34, versus the 40 percent target officials are eyeing. They want more young adults in the risk pool to balance insurers' costs from older, sicker participants.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that health insurance\u2014even with subsidies' discounts\u2014will be a tough sell to the healthy majority of young adults who would otherwise have very few health expenses,\" said Christina LaMontagne, health vice president at NerdWallet, which launched a health insurance buyer's guide this week.\n\n\"Many young, healthy adults will skip insurance in 2014, as their expected health needs won't justify insurance,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obamacare could present too much expense and too few benefits for the percentage of healthy young-adult enrollees to rise, according to a new analysis.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Obamacare could be too expensive and offer too few benefits for many more healthy young adults to enroll, according to a new analysis.", "title": "Obamacare math may not add up for the young", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/17/obamacare-math-may-not-add-up-for-young-invincibles-study.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/03/05/101469351-458901735.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare could be too expensive and offer too few benefits for many more healthy young adults to enroll, according to a new analysis.", "title": "Obamacare math may not add up for 'young invincibles': Study", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/17/obamacare-math-may-not-add-up-for-young-invincibles-study.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/03/05/101469351-458901735.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Obamacare, Obamacare, Health Care, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-01-17T14:56:10-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2014-03-05T15:11:22-0500", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 101343022, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20a6\"", "article_summary": "\"Many young, healthy adults will skip insurance in 2014, as their expected health needs won't justify insurance,\" she said.\nThey want more young adults in the risk pool to balance insurers' costs from older, sicker participants.\n\"It isn't just a 'young and reckless; mentality keeping so-called young invincibles from signing up,\" NerdWallet said.\n\"Many young adults will follow a logical financial rationale for remaining uninsured in 2014.\"\nThat view conflicts with claims by federal officials, who this week said they expect a significant jump in the percentage of young adults buying plans by the March 31 deadline for open enrollment."}
