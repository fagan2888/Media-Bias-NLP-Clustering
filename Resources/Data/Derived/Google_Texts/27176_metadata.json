Statewide, the average increase is 5.1 percent. And Dallas-Fort Worth actually made it out OK, when looking at other major metro areas in the state. Austin, for instance, will see an average spike of 10.1 percent. Houston\u2019s is 4.9 percent.\n\nDespite notching 1.2 million registrants at the end of the last enrollment period, Texas remains the state with the worst uninsured rate\u201419.1 percent, according to recent data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. So it is perhaps no surprise that two of its largest cities are among the five that Burwell will visit on her promotional trip. She was in Houston on Wednesday, and will visit Miami, Chicago, and New Jersey.\n\nDuring the trip here, she gathered with about a dozen stakeholders (including Parkland CEO Fred Cerise and Mayor Pro-Tem Monica Alonzo) for a roundtable about the efforts and progress being made in getting Texans, particularly North Texans, signed up for the Affordable Care Act. Parkland, which Cerise said spends 48 percent of all its care on uninsured residents, and the taxpayers benefit when its patients get enrolled in healthcare, she said.\n\nDespite the increase in average plan costs, Burwell still defended the marketplace plans as affordable. The analysis found that eight of 10 customers can buy a plan with premiums less than $100 a month after tax credits. Seven of 10, the analysis found, will find an available plan for less than $75 a month. Last year, the analysis found, about 53 percent of returning customers shopped around and saved an average of close to $400 on the new, same-tiered plan.\n\n\u201cPeople knowing that this is something they can afford and we know that eight of 10 folks that were enrolled last year can come back into the marketplace and with the financial assistance they can find premiums that are $100 or less,\u201d Burwell said.\n\nShe brought forward Shaun Hubbard, a PHD student at the University of Texas at Dallas who is married to a hairstylist at a small salon. He told the room that she was expecting, and that they purchased health insurance on the exchange. The baby had to be born early and suffered complications, which required surgery\u2014surgery that, he says, quickly rang up to about $3 million.\n\n\u201cOur premiums were approximately $500 a month with a $6,000 deductible,\u201d he said. \u201cI get people all the time telling me, \u2018$6,000, that\u2019s a lot of money.\u2019 But if you look at it compared to the nearly $3 million in medical bills he\u2019s had since he was born, it doesn\u2019t seem like so much. Without the ACA, we\u2019d be bankrupt.\u201d\n\nWhat comes next for the ACA? Burwell says education remains a challenge, both for enrollees and those who have yet to buy coverage. So the feds are tweaking its offering to be more user friendly and explanatory, she added. There\u2019s now an estimator tool on the website that allows the user to see how much their out-of-pocket costs would be with each plan. Previously, volunteer organizations and the insurance companies had to help customers get into the more granular cost aspects. Healthcare.gov is now making moves to help in that process. Advertisements are plastered on buses and broadcast in unusual settings, like Laundromats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that people get the insurance, but once they get it we need them to use it to impact their health,\u201d she said.\n\nAn aside: Burwell acknowledged that the Obama administration was keeping an eye on the state of Texas\u2019 attempt to remove Planned Parenthood from the Medicare program. Earlier this month, the Office of Inspector General notified its state affiliates that alleged safety violations shown in videos taken undercover at their offices warranted a patient risk, which is enough to get booted from the program. Days later, the state announced it was also investigating whether Planned Parenthood billed for procedures that are not eligible for federal reimbursement.\n\nWhen asked, Burwell spoke of the preventive and wellness services offered at Planned Parenthood locations and said HHS is \u201caware\u201d of the \u201cfunding issues\u201d but hasn\u2019t taken any action.\n\n\u201cI would just add that HHS right now is doing what we\u2019ve done with other states, which is communicating with the state about our concerns to make sure that people are obeying what are traditional Medicaid statutes in terms of access to providers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that we, as we have with others states, that we\u2019re communicating clearly about the standards of being able to go to qualified providers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "Sylvia Burwell, the secretary of U.S. Health & Human Services, visited Parkland Memorial Hospital Tuesday to highlight Dallas as one of her top enrollment targets for the Affordable Care Act ahead of the upcoming open period, which begins Nov. 1.
