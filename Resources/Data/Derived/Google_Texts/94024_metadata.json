Tom Corbett (R)\n\nThis week, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) had a run-in with one of his constituents as he was leaving a fundraising event. Scot Rosenzweig \u2014 who identified himself as a fellow Republican \u2014 showed Corbett a large photograph of his fiancee, Dina Nelson, who died at the age of 41 because she was uninsured and couldn\u2019t afford a liver transplant. \u201cI think maybe we should consider accepting the Medicaid expansion,\u201d Rosenzweig told his governor, explaining that people like Nelson need access to lifesaving health treatment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d Corbett responded.\n\nCorbett is one of 25 governors who have declined to accept Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion, a move that is preventing an estimated 700,000 low-income Pennsylvanians from accessing public health insurance. Rather than accepting the federal funds designated for expanding his state\u2019s Medicaid pool, Corbett is trying to win federal approval for an alternate plan, called \u201cHealthy Pennsylvania,\u201d that would give low-income people subsidies to buy private coverage. But Corbett\u2019s plan has been sharply criticized by anti-poverty advocates, who say it could actually reduce benefits for the state\u2019s neediest constituents.\n\nIn his exchange with Rosenzweig, Corbett reiterated his desire to implement \u201cHealthy Pennsylvania,\u201d which he hopes to put in place by 2015. He said he can\u2019t both accept Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and fix the existing problems he sees with the Medicaid program. But that didn\u2019t satisfy Rosenzweig.\n\n\u201cHow many people have to die while we work on the problems?\u201d he asked Corbett.\n\nWatch it, courtesy of SEIU Healthcare PA:\n\nRosenzweig was one of several activists protesting outside of the closed-door luncheon that Corbett attended on Tuesday with representatives from the Chamber of Commerce. Press was not allowed at the event. The handful of Pennsylvania residents \u2014 all of whom knew Nelson, and some of whom were involved in the Homecare Workers Union with her \u2014 protested for a chance to have a seat at the table and discuss Medicaid expansion with the governor.\n\n\u201cIf Dina had access to good, preventative healthcare services when she needed it, her life would have been saved,\u201d Rosenzweig told the Sun Gazette. \u201cGov. Corbett needs to hear more stories like Dina\u2019s about the real impact of his decision to delay Medicaid expansion. How many lives lost are enough?\u201d\n\nPennsylvania residents have been pushing for Medicaid expansion for months. This past summer, health care advocates staged a \u201csick-in\u201d outside the governor\u2019s mansion to pressure Corbett to consider the human cost of neglecting to expand the public program. One activist was arrested after chalking a message on the sidewalk \u2014 \u201cGovernor Corbett has health insurance, we should too\u201d \u2014 because local law enforcement claimed it was a \u201cderogatory remark\u201d about the Pennsylvania leader.\n\nAcross the country, an estimated five million low-income Americans will be unable to access affordable health coverage because of their governors\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid. The resistance to this particular Obamacare provision has a disproportionate impact on people of color. It also has the potential to put a financial strain on businesses and hospitals.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "One of Gov.
