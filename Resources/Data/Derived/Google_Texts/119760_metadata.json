The HIPAA privacy rules prohibit the disclosure of an individual's PHI, including images, in circumstances such as the ones filmed by the television crew, the OCR said.\n\nFurthermore, the OCR found that the hospital failed to safeguard PHI by allowing the film crews \"virtually unfettered access to its healthcare facility, effectively creating an environment where PHI could not be protected from impermissible disclosure to the ABC film crew and staff.\"\n\nIn addition to the financial aspect of the settlement, OCR will monitor the hospital for two years to ensure it remains compliant with its HIPAA obligations while clinicians provide care to patients.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the announcement\n\n- read the resolution agreement (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nReality TV controversy reignites patient-privacy debate\n\nNY bill takes patient privacy to the next level after reality TV show flak\n\nNurse's firing over Instagram photo spurs social media debate\n\nSocial media abuse: Clinicians reveal patient info online", "article_metadata": {"description": "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital will fork over $2.2 million to\u00a0settle\u00a0a case that involved an \"egregious disclosure\" of two patients' protected health information during filming of a reality TV series.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital will fork over $2.2 million to\u00a0settle\u00a0a case that involved an \"egregious disclosure\" of two patients' protected health information during filming of a reality TV series.", "title": "NewYork Presbyterian Hospital pays big price for unauthorized filming of reality TV show", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/newyork-presbyterian-hospital-pays-big-price-unauthorized-filming-reality-t/2016-04-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "HHS Office Of Civil Rights,HIPAA,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Privacy,Reality Tv,settlement", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "\"We take seriously all complaints filed by individuals, and will seek the necessary remedies to ensure that patients' privacy is fully protected.\"\nNew York legislators were so appalled they took action to impose stricter patient privacy protections.\nNewYork-Presbyterian Hospital will fork over $2.2 million to settle a case that involved an \"egregious disclosure\" of two patients' protected health information (PHI) during filming of a reality TV series.\nThe HIPAA privacy rules prohibit the disclosure of an individual's PHI, including images, in circumstances such as the ones filmed by the television crew, the OCR said.\nThe hospital blatantly violated the HIPAA rules, the OCR said, by allowing members of the media to film individuals receiving urgent medical care without their authorization."}
