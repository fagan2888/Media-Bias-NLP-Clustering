Fortunately, that didn't happen. Despite his penchant for hyperbole, Patrick was relatively calm - dare we say statesmanlike? - throughout the session. The Senate under his leadership got its work done efficiently while showing respect for the process.\n\nMost of the tea-party noisemakers were in the House, but the noisiest of them, state Rep. Jonathan Stickland, R-Bedford, proved to be too much even for his super-conservative colleagues. Like a horse shuddering a fly off its hide, Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, was able to treat Stickland and his fellow blusterers as minor irritants, while serving as a moderating influence on the Legislature throughout the session. Thanks to Straus's temperance and his experience, some of the more controversial items on the tea-party agenda either fell by the wayside or were amended to make them slightly less objectionable. So-called \"campus-carry\" legislation is one example.\n\nDemocrats in both chambers, acutely aware of their perennially diminished status, were able to use the clock in the waning days to fend off some objectionable legislation, but for the most part they went along with priorities laid out in the $209.4 billion state budget. State Sen. Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston, was one of the few who refused to go along simply for the sake of getting along, and we applaud her obstinacy. She's right to insist that lawmakers should have been more responsive to the state's investment needs - in education, transportation and infrastructure, health care, the environment, among others.\n\nLawmakers leaving town on the wings of self-satisfaction will arrive back home knowing that the Lone Star State still ranks at or near the bottom in addressing the needs of poor children, the mentally ill, the elderly and others. That awareness, however, wasn't enough to prompt them to budget enough money for Medicaid, the joint state-federal insurance program for the poor and disabled. And it wasn't enough for them to relax their irrational opposition to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which means they continue to ignore billions of dollars in federal aid and continue to turn their backs on several million uninsured Texans.\n\nGreg Abbott, the state's new Republican governor, got most of what he wanted from the Legislature, including more money for pre-kindergarten. It's not enough money, but at least it's a start.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers gave him too much money for another of his priority issues: border security. Both chambers were eager to spend millions of Texas taxpayers' money to keep Department of Public Safety troopers and the National Guard milling around on the border at a time when illegal crossings are at their lowest level in 20 years and the federal government is spending millions to combat drug and human trafficking.\n\nOn another of his signature issues, ethics reform, the governor got stiffed. In his State of the State address in January, Abbott noted that \"rejection of ethics reform will rightfully raise suspicions about who we truly serve - ourselves or the people of Texas.\"\n\nWe are, indeed, suspicious, after lawmakers couldn't end an impasse between those who wanted Texans to know the origins of so-called dark money in campaigns and those who insist that donors have a right to be anonymous. Pressure from the radical right killed any chance at compromise.\n\nTom \"Smitty\" Smith, director of Public Citizen Texas, noted the last time lawmakers enacted meaningful ethics reform that Ann Richards was governor. Abbott, Smith charged, did little to end the impasse, despite his avowed interest in the issue.\n\nThe governor, the lieutenant governor and the speaker all promised tax cuts - Patrick was the most vociferous - but the tax cut result was more modest than the politicians promised. Businesses that pay the state's franchise tax will see a 25 percent reduction in rates. Most taxpayers won't be getting any cuts at all, although lawmakers did agree to increase the size of property tax homestead exemptions by $10,000, if voters approve. For the average homeowner, that would amount to about the price of a family Astros outing, $126. Renters are out of luck.\n\nAmong the legislation that ended up in the ditch, fortunately, was a Patrick proposal for school choice that would have given businesses a tax cut for contributing to a scholarship fund to help schoolchildren attend private schools. Enough lawmakers saw the proposal for what it was- an end run around public support for public schools - to scuttle it.\n\nAlso biting the dust, fortunately, were immigration proposals that would have made Texas resemble Sheriff Joe Arpaio's Arizona. Efforts to require local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws failed to pass, as did cold-hearted attempts to repeal in-state tuition at Texas colleges and universities for so-called Dreamers, immigrants brought to this country illegally as children.\n\nTea-party efforts to legalize discrimination against LGBT Texans also failed.\n\nBills that should have failed included the ban on anti-drilling ordinances prompted by Denton's effort to control fracking operations within city boundaries. State leaders were more eager to please the oil and gas industry than they were to stand up for their professed belief in local control.\n\nAt least, they didn't undercut local control to the extent that the governor wanted. He hoped the state would prevent towns and cities from implementing such local initiatives as bans on plastic bags; to the governor, that was a step toward \"California-izing\" Texas.\n\nPerhaps the most confounding piece of legislation to pass this session is Senate Bill 11, the so-called \"campus carry\" bill that lawmakers were hellbent on passing despite opposition from university administrators, campus police, students, parents and faculty. Open carry was pretty much a done deal from the beginning, but campus carry, in the words of state Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, \"is a solution in search of a problem. With so many priorities left unaddressed, it's a shame that the Legislature has spent so much time and energy on an unneeded law that will cost millions of dollars and result in unintended consequences for years to come.\"", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "In his rookie legislative session as lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick and his red-hot tea-party minions, armed with a mandate and a super-majority, could have taken possession of the pink-domed Capitol and tried to run roughshod over those of a more moderate mien.
