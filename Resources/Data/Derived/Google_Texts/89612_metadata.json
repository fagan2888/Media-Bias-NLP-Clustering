According to an article in the online publication NJ Spotlight, the decline in charity care is \u201clargely due to an expansion in Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, which led the state to cover 390,000 more residents under the NJ FamilyCare program in 2014.\u201d\n\nLooking at the individual hospital figures released by the state, a number of hospitals would see significant decreases in funding while others would see a minimal increase. For example, consider these two Newark hospitals that would see significant decreases: University Hospital would see a nearly $20 million decline while St. Michael\u2019s Medical Center would see a 44 percent reduction. University was slated for future expansion into \u201ca state-of-the-art regional medical center\u201d while St. Michaels is being sought for purchase by a for-profit California company.\n\nThe increased funding for some hospitals is often attributable to a greater need for graduate-level medical education, which may align to the shift in healthcare. New Jersey Health Commissioner Mary E. Dowd stated that the budget reflects the \u201ctransformation of the healthcare system\u2026shifting from payments based on the amount of healthcare services provided toward a focus on improving patients\u2019 health while controlling costs\u201d with \u201cless need for inpatient services and increased need for outpatient services and wellness initiatives.\u201d\n\nWhile there is a shift underway from charity aid to Medicaid because of the ACA, some are saying it\u2019s too soon to make drastic cuts in state aid. The CEO of the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, Suzanne Ianni, believes it \u201cunwise to cut charity care aid when the federal government hasn\u2019t cut its dollar-for-dollar match to states, and while it\u2019s still not clear how the Medicaid expansion will affect hospitals\u2019 bottom lines.\u201d Others, like Richard Pitman, who heads the Fair Share Hospitals Collaborative, were simply happy that the cuts were not as deep as feared, giving thanks to Governor Christie for the cuts not being more drastic.\n\nAs the budget goes through further analysis, and as the numbers become more real to healthcare providers, more reactions are sure to come. One of those looking to do more analysis is Kerry McKean Kelly of the New Jersey Hospital Association, stating, \u201cWe need time to look at all of those numbers, in the entirety of this budget, to see how it balances out and to determine the full impact on hospitals and their patients.\u201d Kelly believes that with the cuts in charity aid, the state must ensure that other funding supports, including Medicaid expansion, will cover the bill, fulfilling the \u201cimportant missions of our hospitals to provide care to all, regardless of their ability to pay.\u201d\u2014John Brothers", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey cuts state subsidies in the wake of Medicaid changes from Obamacare.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/03/11/state-cuts-on-charity-care-at-nj-nonprofit-hospitals/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "New Jersey cuts state subsidies in the wake of Medicaid changes from Obamacare.", "title": "State Cuts on Charity Care at NJ Nonprofit Hospitals", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-07-15T17:12:20+00:00", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/03/11/state-cuts-on-charity-care-at-nj-nonprofit-hospitals/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "description": "New Jersey cuts state subsidies in the wake of Medicaid changes from Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "State Cuts on Charity Care at NJ Nonprofit Hospitals - Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/03/11/state-cuts-on-charity-care-at-nj-nonprofit-hospitals/", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "state budgets", "published_time": "2015-03-11T13:59:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-15T17:12:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Policy,  budget cuts,  charity care,  health care,  healthcare providers,  New Jersey Hospital Association,  NJ FamilyCare,  nonprofit healthcare,  Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8988\"", "article_summary": "March 9, 2015; NJ SpotlightIn New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s latest budget, hospitals in the state would see a 23 percent decrease in direct state subsidies for what is called charity care.\nThe increased funding for some hospitals is often attributable to a greater need for graduate-level medical education, which may align to the shift in healthcare.\nAs the budget goes through further analysis, and as the numbers become more real to healthcare providers, more reactions are sure to come.\nUniversity was slated for future expansion into \u201ca state-of-the-art regional medical center\u201d while St. Michaels is being sought for purchase by a for-profit California company.\nFor example, consider these two Newark hospitals that would see significant decreases: University Hospital would see a nearly $20 million decline while St. Michael\u2019s Medical Center would see a 44 percent reduction."}
