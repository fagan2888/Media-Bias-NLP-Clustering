They\u2019ll try to chip away at the taxes that support it and abolish the mandates that make its insurance markets work.\n\nThey might even stand on their heads and stop breathing if that would do the trick.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame they are approaching matters this way. Various provisions of the Affordable Care Act have helped well over 100 million Americans, including about 20 million who gained coverage or got new insurance under the law.\n\nIn a rational republic, both parties might try to figure out how to improve the law. Why wreck it? But elections have consequences. So if Republicans invest a lot of energy in attempting to kill the thing \u2014 well, this is exactly what they told the voters they\u2019d do.\n\nIt\u2019s something else again if another part of the conservative power structure does a lot of the dirty work in undermining the law before Congress has to. I refer here to the hyper-activist conservative justices on our Supreme Court.\n\nTo the shock of many neutral legal analysts, four justices decided to take up an absurd legal challenge to the health-care law even before a lower court can rehear the case and before there is a conflict that typically triggers the high court\u2019s involvement.\n\nAt issue is one phrase in the law that, in the worst possible construction, is a drafting error. It declares that subsidies to help people buy insurance will be available to those who were enrolled \u201cthrough an exchange established by the State under [section] 1311.\u201d\n\nConservative legal beagles, ignoring every other word in the statute, claim that the words \u201cby the State\u201d mean that any state that chose not to establish a health insurance exchange deprives its citizens of the federal subsidies they\u2019re entitled to under the act. Since 37 states are expected to rely this year on the federal exchange envisioned by the law rather than establish their own, a ruling of this sort could deprive millions of their subsidies \u2014 and make a mess of the law.\n\nNow let\u2019s be clear: Not even the most conservative Supreme Court justices seemed to think this language was a problem before the conservative lawyers went to work.\n\nIn their dissent from the 2012 decision upholding the law, Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito read the law exactly as its supporters do. They wrote: \u201cCongress provided a backup scheme; if a State declines to participate in the operation of an exchange, the Federal Government will step in and operate an exchange in that State.\u201d And they noted of the law\u2019s structure: \u201cThat system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies are invalidated.\u201d\n\nFive of the law\u2019s lead architects, two senators and three House members, wrote Oct. 31 in The Post: \u201cNone of us contemplated that the bill as enacted could be misconstrued to limit financial help only to people in states opting to directly run health insurance marketplaces.\u201d Conservatives are supposed to care about \u201coriginal intent.\u201d Well, here it is.\n\nThere\u2019s another conservative legal school called \u201ctextualism,\u201d which, as the name suggests, involves paying close attention to the actual text of a statute. Abbe Gluck, a Yale Law School professor, has written a very helpful article on SCOTUSblog that not only points to the straightforward reading of the law that the conservative justices offered in that earlier dissent but also cites none other than Justice Scalia to guide us as to what textualism demands.\n\nTextual interpretation, Scalia insisted, should be \u201cholistic\u201d and \u201ccontextual,\u201d not \u201cwooden\u201d or \u201cliteral.\u201d Courts, he said, should adopt the interpretation of a law that \u201cdoes least violence to the text,\u201d declaring that \u201cthere can be no justification for needlessly rendering provisions in conflict if they can be interpreted harmoniously.\u201d\n\nIf Scalia wants to be true to his own principles, can he possibly side with a convoluted reading of the law that apparently never occurred to him before?\n\nHere\u2019s a hypothetical for you: First, the Supreme Court issues a ruling that installs a conservative president. Then, he appoints two conservative Supreme Court justices who then join with three of their colleagues to make mincemeat of the greatest achievement of a progressive president elected by a clear majority. If such a thing happened in any other country, would we still call it a democratic republic?\n\nRead more from E.J.
