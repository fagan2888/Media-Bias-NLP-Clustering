Bobby Jindal will try to counter a pro-Planned Parenthood rally scheduled to take place outside his mansion on Thursday by running a loop of the secretly recorded videos that they plan to protest.\n\nJindal announced Thursday that he is setting up an outdoor movie screen and speakers outside the governor\u2019s mansion to show the controversial videos, which he said too many of Planned Parenthood\u2019s supporters have refused to watch.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe showing will take place at the exact time of a scheduled protest by Planned Parenthood supporters.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood has a right to protest today, but Governor Jindal\u2019s office will ensure that anyone who shows up will have to witness first-hand the offensive actions of the organization they are supporting,\u201d Jindal, who is also a Republican presidential candidate, wrote in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe hope the protesters will take a minute to watch them so they'll have an opportunity to see first-hand our concerns with Planned Parenthood\u2019s practices,\u201d he added.\n\nPlanned Parenthood dismissed Jindal's move as a political \"stunt.\"\n\n\u201cGovernor Jindal isn\u2019t even in Louisiana today, but he\u2019s made sure to prove that he\u2019s always ready to put politics before Louisianan\u2019s health. This stunt is proof he doesn\u2019t have any real answers for the people of Louisiana,\" Melissa Flournoy, the Louisiana state director for Planned Parenthood, wrote in a statement.\n\nLouisiana is one of 11 states that have launched investigations into Planned Parenthood in light of undercover video footage from an anti-abortion-rights group that scrutinizes the health provider\u2019s fetal tissue donation program.\n\nThe group says the footage shows Planned Parenthood illegally profiting from fetal tissue donations, among other claims. Planned Parenthood has countered that each of the allegations is falsely manufactured from highly edited footage.\n\nSome of the footage, taken from inside clinics, is gruesome, showing aborted late-term fetuses and fetal organs in petri dishes. Several top Republicans have called the videos difficult to watch, including Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who said the footage made him \u201cwant to vomit.\u201d\n\nThe group behind the videos, the Center for Medical Progress, put out its seventh video this week. Each is about 10 minutes long.\n\nThat amounts to more than an hour of material to be screened.\n\nThis story was updated at 2:02 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The showing takes place at the same time as a scheduled pro-Planned Parenthood protest.", "description": "The showing takes place at the same time as a scheduled pro-Planned Parenthood protest.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The showing takes place at the same time as a scheduled pro-Planned Parenthood protest.", "title": "Jindal to screen Planned Parenthood videos outside mansion", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/251567-jindal-to-screen-planned-parenthood-videos-outside-mansion", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/jindalbobby_031414gn6_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-20T14:02:15-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-20T14:02-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/251567-jindal-to-screen-planned-parenthood-videos-outside-mansion", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-20T12:19-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bobby Jindal,Planned Parenthood", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-20T12:19:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T14:02:15-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/251567-jindal-to-screen-planned-parenthood-videos-outside-mansion", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The showing takes place at the same time as a scheduled pro-Planned Parenthood protest.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jindal to screen Planned Parenthood videos outside mansion"}, "dcterms.title": "Jindal to screen Planned Parenthood videos outside mansion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd364b\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTThe showing will take place at the exact time of a scheduled protest by Planned Parenthood supporters.\nPlanned Parenthood dismissed Jindal's move as a political \"stunt.\"\nThe group says the footage shows Planned Parenthood illegally profiting from fetal tissue donations, among other claims.\nThis stunt is proof he doesn\u2019t have any real answers for the people of Louisiana,\" Melissa Flournoy, the Louisiana state director for Planned Parenthood, wrote in a statement.\nPlanned Parenthood has countered that each of the allegations is falsely manufactured from highly edited footage."}
