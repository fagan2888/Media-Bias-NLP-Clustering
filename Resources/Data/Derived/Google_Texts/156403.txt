A motorcyclist traveling north Sunday on U.S. 285 near Parmalee Gulch struck a guardrail and was thrown roughly 100 feet into a creek below the highway.

The accident happened about 1:30 p.m. as the man was traveling with three other motorcyclists, according to Dan Hatlestad, deputy chief of the Inter Canyon Fire Department.

The rider, who sustained moderate injuries, was tossed into Turkey Creek, which runs below the highway.

Firefighters from Indian Hills, West Metro and Inter Canyon responded to extricate the patient from the creek, using ropes to reach the man.

The rider was conscious when extricated and was taken to a hospital, Hatlestad said.

Fire crews were reporting delays in the area after officials closed and reopened the road during the rescue.
