Delay of Obamacare\u2019s out-of-pocket caps\n\nThe Labor Department announced in February that it was delaying for a year the part of the healthcare law that limits how much people have to spend on their own insurance. This may have been sensible\u2014insurers and employers need time to comply with rapidly changing regulations\u2014but changing the law requires actual legislation.\n\n2. Delay of Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate\n\nThe administration announced via blogpost on the eve of the July 4 holiday that it was delaying the requirement that employers of at least 50 people provide complying insurance or pay a fine. This time it did cite statutory authority, but the cited provisions allow the delay of certain reporting requirements, not of the mandate itself.\n\n3. Delay of Obamacare\u2019s insurance requirements\n\nThe famous pledge that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it\u201d backfired when insurance companies started cancelling millions of plans that didn\u2019t comply with Obamacare\u2019s requirements. President Obama called a press conference last month to proclaim that people could continue buying non-complying plans in 2014\u2014despite Obamacare\u2019s explicit language to the contrary. He then refused to consider a House-passed bill that would\u2019ve made this action legal.\n\n4. Exemption of Congress from Obamacare\n\nA little-known part of Obamacare requires Congressmen and their staff to get insurance through the new healthcare exchanges, rather than a taxpayer-funded program. In the quiet of August, President Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management to interpret the law to maintain the generous congressional benefits.\n\n5. Expansion of the employer mandate penalty through IRS regulation\n\nObamacare grants tax credits to people whose employers don\u2019t provide coverage if they buy a plan \u201cthrough an Exchange established by the State\u201d\u2014and then fines employers for each employee receiving such a subsidy. No tax credits are authorized for residents of states where the exchanges are established by the federal government, as an incentive for states to create exchanges themselves. Because so few (16) states did, however, the IRS issued a rule ignoring that plain text and allowed subsidies (and commensurate fines) for plans coming from \u201ca State Exchange, regional Exchange, subsidiary Exchange, and federally-facilitated Exchange.\u201d\n\n6. Political profiling by the IRS\n\nAfter seeing a rise in the number of applications for tax-exempt status, the IRS in 2010 compiled a \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d (\u201cBOLO\u201d) list to identify organizations engaged in political activities. The list included words such as \u201cTea Party,\u201d \u201cPatriots,\u201d and \u201cIsrael\u201d; subjects such as government spending, debt, or taxes; and activities such as criticizing the government, educating about the Constitution, or challenging Obamacare. The targeting continued through May of this year.\n\nRead the full top 10 list at Forbes.com here.\n\n(H/T: Weasel Zippers)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "In an op-ed for Forbes.com, Ilya Shapiro outlines President Barack Obama's \"top 10 constitutional violations of 2013.\" The list includes everything from the the delay of Obamacare's \"out-of-pocket caps\" to political profiling by the IRS.  \"Unfortunately, the president fomented this upswing in civic interest not by talking up...", "creator": "@jason_howerton", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/12/27/forbes-president-obamas-top-10-constitutional-violations-of-2013/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/600x39979.jpg", "title": "Forbes: \u2018President Obama\u2019s Top 10 Constitutional Violations of 2013\u2032", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "forbes, president, obamas, top, 10, constitutional, violations, 2013", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama, constitution, obamacare, politics, us, author-jason-howerton, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 23523, "gplus-count": 46, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/731918", "categories": "barack-obama,constitution,obamacare,politics,us", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 142, "description": "In an op-ed for Forbes.com, Ilya Shapiro outlines President Barack Obama's \"top 10 constitutional violations of 2013.\" The list includes everything from the the delay of Obamacare's \"out-of-pocket caps\" to political profiling by the IRS.  \"Unfortunately, the president fomented this upswing in civic interest not by talking up...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 7, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "In an op-ed for Forbes.com, Ilya Shapiro outlines President Barack Obama's \"top 10 constitutional violations of 2013.\" The list includes everything from the the delay of Obamacare's \"out-of-pocket caps\" to political profiling by the IRS.  \"Unfortunately, the president fomented this upswing in civic interest not by talking up...", "title": "Forbes: \u2018President Obama\u2019s Top 10 Constitutional Violations of 2013\u2032", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/12/27/forbes-president-obamas-top-10-constitutional-violations-of-2013/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/600x39979.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 399}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2013-12-27T16:00:18+00:00", "twitter-count": 662}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad2b\"", "article_summary": "In an op-ed for Forbes.com, Ilya Shapiro outlines President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201ctop 10 constitutional violations of 2013.\u201d The list includes everything from the the delay of Obamacare\u2019s \u201cout-of-pocket caps\u201d to political profiling by the IRS.\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s been most frustrated with the separation of powers, which doesn\u2019t allow him to \u2018fundamentally transform\u2019 the country without congressional acquiescence.\u201dHere\u2019s the top six \u201cconstitutional violations,\u201d according to Shapiro:1.\nPresident Obama called a press conference last month to proclaim that people could continue buying non-complying plans in 2014\u2014despite Obamacare\u2019s explicit language to the contrary.\nIn the quiet of August, President Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management to interpret the law to maintain the generous congressional benefits.\nThis may have been sensible\u2014insurers and employers need time to comply with rapidly changing regulations\u2014but changing the law requires actual legislation."}
