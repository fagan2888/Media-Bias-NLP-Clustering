The only reason the unemployment rate is 7 percent, which is high by historical standards in the U.S., is that people gave up looking for jobs,\" he said.\n\n\"I just don't think we have come out of (recession) very well,\" he said.\n\nFama, who argued in 1970 that markets are efficient and that prices reflect all publicly available information, said he will give his prize money to the University of Chicago, where he is a professor.\n\nAsked what he thought of current high prices in the stock market, Fama said he believed companies had become much more efficient after the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\n\n\"The response of companies after the recession was to slim down, get much more effective and they got very profitable, so their prices continue to appreciate,\" he said.\n\nFama's theory implied that one cannot systematically outperform the market. He said he keeps his personal investments entirely in index funds, a type of mutual fund that tracks the performance of a market index such as the S&P 500.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "One of the three Americans whowon this year's Nobel prize for economics said bloated publicdeficits on both sides of the Atlantic meant that recessionremained a real risk for 2014.", "title": "Nobel economics winner Fama says risk of global recession in 2014", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - Markets", "sailthru.tags": "SWEDEN, NOBEL/ (TV, PIX)", "sailthru.title": "Nobel economics winner Fama says risk of global recession in 2014", "keywords": "SWEDEN,NOBEL/ (TV, PIX),Employment / Unemployment,United States,Sweden,Financials (TRBC),Europe,Funds,Labour / Personnel,Nordic States,Banking and Investment Services (TRBC),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Corporate Events,Western Europe,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,Economic Events,Economic Indicators,Financials (Legacy),National Government Debt,Americas", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "SWEDEN;NOBEL/ (TV;
