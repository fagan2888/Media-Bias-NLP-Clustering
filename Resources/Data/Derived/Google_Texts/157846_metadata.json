Avanir shares jumped on the announcement and were at $16.93, up $1.93, or 12.8% in midsession Nasdaq trading.\n\nThe proposed merger would combine Otsuka's expertise in treating mental illness with Avanir's research and development of drugs dealing with neurological disorders. Otsuka makes the drug Abilify, used to treat depression, bipolar disorder and other conditions. Under the terms of the deal, Avanir will operate as an independent unit of Otsuka's American subsidiary.\n\nThe Avanir deal comes on the heels of the much larger acquisition of Botox maker Allergan Inc. in Irvine last month by Irish drug maker Actavis for about $66 billion.\n\nThe healthcare sector this year has rung up merger and acquisition deals totaling more than $440 billion, 13% of all such transactions so far on Wall Street.

Other large healthcare deals include Actavis' $28-billion agreement in February to buy rival Forest Laboratories Inc. of New York and Minneapolis medical device maker Medtronic Inc.'s $47-billion deal for Ireland's Covidien in June.\n\nWhile the general deal wave is being pushed mostly by low interest rates, analysts said health-related mergers also are driven, in part, by the Affordable Care Act as providers seek more clout for negotiations with cost-conscious insurers.\n\nAmong pharmaceutical companies, in particular, the key reason behind transactions is the expiration of patents on leading drugs and the need to hone product portfolios to build \u201cfranchises in key treatment categories,\u201d according to a report by accounting firm KPMG.\n\nTwitter: @deanstarkman", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Japanese firm to buy Avanir Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Aliso Viejo said Tuesday that it has agreed to be acquired by Japanese drug giant Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. for about $3.5 billion in cash, the latest in a string of mergers sweeping the healthcare sector.", "title": "Japanese firm to buy Avanir Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-avanir-merger-20141202-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-547e051f/turbine/la-fi-avanir-merger-20141202", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "healthcare, mergers, acquisitions, pharmaceuticals", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82153951", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-12-02", "Description": "Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Aliso Viejo said Tuesday that it has agreed to be acquired by Japanese drug giant Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. for about $3.5 billion in cash, the latest in a string of mergers sweeping the healthcare sector.
