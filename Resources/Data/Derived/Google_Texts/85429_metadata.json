He also notes that her lawyers have suggested that her religious objections could be accommodated by \u201cmodifying the prescribed Kentucky marriage license form to remove the multiple references to Davis\u2019 name.\u201d\n\nWrites Mr. Volokh:\n\nKentucky, like about 20 other states, has a state Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) statute that requires government agencies to exempt religious objectors from generally applicable laws, unless denying the exemption is the least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest [If ] Davis sues in state court, seeking a declaration that she can issue licenses and certificates without her name \u2014 as a Kentucky RFRA-based exemption from the Kentucky statutory requirements for what must go on her license \u2014 I think she\u2019d have a good case\u2026. But though I agree that her religious convictions can\u2019t excuse her from issuing marriage licenses altogether.. [if] Davis believes that it\u2019s religiously wrong for her to issue licenses with her name on them, ordering her to do that indeed burdens her religious beliefs, enough to trigger the Kentucky RFRA. And giving her the more modest exemption from the include-the-court-clerk\u2019s-name requirement might therefore indeed be required by the Kentucky RFRA\u2026 So if Kim Davis does indeed go through the state courts, and ask for a modest exemption under the state RFRA \u2014 simply to allow her to issue marriage licenses (opposite-sex or same-sex) without her name on them \u2014 she might indeed prevail.\n\nLaw Blog reached out to an attorney for Ms. Davis for comment.\n\nDeputies in the Rowan County clerk\u2019s office, meanwhile, have begun to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Ms. Davis\u2019s absence, sparking more legal controversy. One of her lawyers, Mat Staver, speaking to reporters outside the detention center holding Ms. Davis, charged that the marriages weren\u2019t valid because they were signed without her authority.\n\n\u201cThey are not worth the paper they\u2019re written on,\u201d he said, according to the Washington Post.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A prominent First Amendment expert studying her case says jailed Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis may be fighting a battle in the wrong court.", "title": "Is Kim Davis Fighting Her Battle in the Wrong Court?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/09/04/is-kim-davis-fighting-her-battle-in-the-wrong-court/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Is Kim Davis Fighting Her Battle in the Wrong Court?", "description": "A prominent First Amendment expert studying her case says jailed Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis may be fighting a battle in the wrong court.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Jacob Gershman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "A prominent First Amendment expert studying her case says jailed Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis may be fighting a battle in the wrong court.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-09-04T22:35:02-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/09/04/is-kim-davis-fighting-her-battle-in-the-wrong-court/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-52058", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A prominent First Amendment expert studying her case says jailed Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis may be fighting a battle in the wrong court.", "title": "Is Kim Davis Fighting Her Battle in the Wrong Court?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/09/04/is-kim-davis-fighting-her-battle-in-the-wrong-court/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-52058", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-09-04T22:35:02-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c61\"", "article_summary": "A prominent First Amendment expert studying her case says Ms. Davis may be fighting a battle in the wrong court.\nLegal scholars have taken a dim view of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis\u2019s contention in federal court that she should get a religious exemption from having to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.\nMs. Davis, he observes, refuses to issue same-sex couple licenses that bear her name.\nDeputies in the Rowan County clerk\u2019s office, meanwhile, have begun to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Ms. Davis\u2019s absence, sparking more legal controversy.\nAnalyzing her claims, he says her chances could improve in state court."}
