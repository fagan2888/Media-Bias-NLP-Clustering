Bloomberg Business has just put out an interesting report on the behind-the-scenes politics of the pizza industry, and they lean very conservative. If you\u2019re a progressive like me, that\u2019s bound to leave you experiencing something that you don\u2019t normally expect when eating a pizza: a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? In a nutshell, pizza is a big business in the United States, and the Republican party is the one that cozies up to businesses. Each day, 12 percent of Americans consume at least one slice of pizza, generating billions annually. With recent pushes to improve nutrition standards and promote healthier eating across the country, the pizza industry is getting proactive politically.\n\nThis corporate civic engagement consists primarily of campaign donations. In the 2012 and 2014 elections, the pizza industry gave $1.5 million to candidates and PACs, 88 percent of which went to Republicans. That doesn\u2019t leave a big slice for Democrat/Independent politics. The pizza chain with the heftiest pockets is Pizza Hut, which gave $685,000 in political campaigns, with only 1 percent of that going to Democrats. Papa John\u2019s threw in nearly $117,000, as well. The fact that 87 percent of that money went to Republicans is a hardly a surprise to those who remember when the company\u2019s owner famously took a controversial stand against Obamacare.\n\nPizza companies have even created their own lobbying group. Pizza chains that normally consider one another competitors have formed the American Pizza Community (APC). Generally, restaurant chains join larger food industry groups, but the APC has chosen to go it alone to advocate specifically for pizza. While the APC is nowhere near as powerful as a group like the NRA, it still wields a lot of influence and has scored some significant victories for pizza, including the way nutrition labels are applied to pizza menus. Previously, companies were expected to list the caloric content of an entire pizza, but now restaurants are allowed to list it by slice.\n\nOne of the main \u201cenemies\u201d of the pizza industry is First Lady Michelle Obama. Her agenda to improve the nutrition of school lunches has come at pizza\u2019s expense; currently, school cafeterias sell half a billion dollars worth of pizza. For years, the government has deemed a piece of pizza to have a \u201cserving of vegetables\u201d thanks to its tiny amount of tomato paste, thereby incentivizing schools to serve it. For a while it looked like these rules would change, but the pizza industry has prevailed and kept its \u201cvegetable\u201d status intact.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, most liberals probably wouldn\u2019t be too opposed to APC\u2019s pro-pizza agenda. The problem isn\u2019t what the pizza industry is hoping to accomplish, it\u2019s that by giving money to help conservative candidates get elected, their ensuring far worse, non-pizza-related issues get promoted by lawmakers. While you might be able to live with a politician who keeps pizza in school cafeterias, can you say the same about politicians who try to strip a woman of her right to choose or block attempts to raise the minimum wage?\n\nSo what\u2019s a liberal mozzarella lover (by which I mean a political leftie, though extra cheese is great, too) to do? Give up pizza?? Yeah right \u2013 you\u2019ll have to pry these stuffed crusts from my cold, dead hands. Instead of purchasing pies from large chains, I\u2019ll choose mom-and-pop pizza restaurants that are less likely to be involved in donating money to federal politicians.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberals love pizza as much as the next person, but they may be surprised to learn that some of their pizza money is donated to conservative candidates.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3134/3133126.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "pizza,pizza hut,dominos,papa john\\'s,conservative,republicans,politics,campaign donations,cafeterias,nutrition", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3eaf\"", "article_summary": "Bloomberg Business has just put out an interesting report on the behind-the-scenes politics of the pizza industry, and they lean very conservative.\nPizza chains that normally consider one another competitors have formed the American Pizza Community (APC).\nFor a while it looked like these rules would change, but the pizza industry has prevailed and kept its \u201cvegetable\u201d status intact.\nOne of the main \u201cenemies\u201d of the pizza industry is First Lady Michelle Obama.\nWith recent pushes to improve nutrition standards and promote healthier eating across the country, the pizza industry is getting proactive politically."}
