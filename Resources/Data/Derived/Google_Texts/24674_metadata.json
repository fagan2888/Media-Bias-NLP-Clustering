Three of them were enrolled in Medicaid by default because their policies were deemed \u201cnot ACA compliant.\u201d Access to providers in Medicaid is even worse than in the private plans available in the exchanges.\n\nOur Patients First now has representatives in 15 states and hopes to expand significantly next year. It has been sponsoring radio and television ads in five congressional districts where the newly elected incumbents won by fewer than 10,000 votes and could be vulnerable in the next election.\n\nThe ads detail the fiasco surrounding Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, who was caught on video calling Americans who backed the reform \u201cstupid\u201d and saying details were hidden in the massive bill or no one would have supported it.\n\n\u201cGruber is actually guilty of candor, but he said it in an offensive way,\u201d Singer said. \u201cHe was saying that the general public is too dumb to know what\u2019s good for them, so we have to disguise what we are doing because if they knew, they wouldn\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\nThe dangers of Obamacare will become even more apparent after Jan. 1, Singer said, when several mandates that were tabled will become reality. For example, the employer mandate to offer insurance in companies that employ more than 50 people will start being enforced. Cancellations that were postponed will happen and premiums will rise.\n\n\u201cAll these things are churning and its imperative that the subject of the ACA come up (in Congress), Singer said. \u201cThe ACA is not sustainable. We want to play a role in influencing the agenda to make sure patients are first.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Our Patients First ran their television ad the weekend of Dec. 12 in Iowa because it is one of the key primary states and gets a lot of political attention. The radio ads are running through Dec. 28 on five news/talk radio stations in the following areas: central California; north of New York City; the Florida Panhandle; Omaha, Neb; and northeast Arizona.\n\n\u201cThese districts all have Democratic incumbents who were just narrowly reelected,\u201d Singer said. \u201cWe are letting them know that so many of their colleagues are packing up and leaving because they supported Obamacare. They better fix it because we are watching.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A new PAC of doctors and surgeons has formed to target members of Congress who continue to support Obamacare, which will wreak more havoc in 2015", "title": "Obamacare now has a new enemy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/Gruber-Dec-9-AP.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-12T18:17:04+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/190186/anti-obamacare-pac/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Arizona", "tag": "Democrats,doctor PAC,doctors,Gruber,Jeffrey Singer,Jonathan Gruber,Obama,ObamaCare,Our Patients First PAC,PAC,Tori Richards", "published_time": "2014-12-23T04:00:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T18:17:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A new PAC of doctors and surgeons has formed to target members of Congress who continue to support Obamacare, which will wreak more havoc in 2015", "title": "Obamacare now has a new enemy", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/Gruber-Dec-9-AP.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A new PAC of doctors and surgeons has formed to target members of Congress who continue to support Obamacare, which will wreak more havoc in 2015"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are letting them know that so many of their colleagues are packing up and leaving because they supported Obamacare.\n\u201cAll these things are churning and its imperative that the subject of the ACA come up (in Congress), Singer said.\n\u201cA lot of the Democrats in Congress have gotten the message in this past election of people\u2019s unhappiness with Obamacare,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Singer, a co-founder of Our Patients First PAC.\nThe radio ads are running through Dec. 28 on five news/talk radio stations in the following areas: central California; north of New York City; the Florida Panhandle; Omaha, Neb; and northeast Arizona.\nFor example, the employer mandate to offer insurance in companies that employ more than 50 people will start being enforced."}
