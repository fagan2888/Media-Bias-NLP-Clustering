But where Catts, the Prohibition Party nominee, had been cheated out of the Democratic nomination before he criss-crossed the state in a battered Ford, Scott darted about Florida in his personal jet forcing himself on the Republican Party of Florida.\n\nA half-century ago, Claude Kirk became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction with no prior public office. But he had headed Democrats for Nixon in 1960 and was the unsuccessful GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1964. And Jeb Bush had only the most fleeting government experience \u2013 a couple years as secretary of the old Commerce Department \u2013 before running for governor.\n\nBut politics is the Bush family business and he was born into it.\n\nScott\u2019s business is business, and he shrewdly assessed the political market in the anti-incumbency Tea Party fervor of 2010. He narrowly beat then-Attorney General Bill McCollum, then edged Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink in the general election \u2013 financing his rise with about $70 million of his own fortune.\n\nFive years later, re-elected by another slim margin, Scott remains an enigma as he heads into the 2016 legislative session. His program remains unchanged \u2013 jobs, jobs and more jobs \u2013 with about $1 billion in tax cuts and some $250 million in financial incentives for attracting new business to Florida.\n\n\u201cA lot of his success has been in keeping his focus on the economic climate of Florida,\u201d said Susan MacManus, a nationally known political science professor at the University of South Florida.\n\nIt\u2019s a sort of trickle-down economics that trickles up just enough popular support to keep the Republican-controlled Legislature sufficiently supportive of Scott. Business organizations would back any conservative Republican, but MacManus said Scott\u2019s sunny optimism about job creation goes down well with the average Floridian \u2013 who may not love him, but hopes his plans will work.\n\n\u201cTax cuts and business incentives are the economic messages he continues to talk about, and that resonates with the business community,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who are not doing as well as they think they should, economically, will take hope from that.\u201d\n\nRepeating his basic campaign speech at quarterly Republican Party conferences, Scott used to joke about what a friendly reception he received, compared to his largely ignored visits in 2010, when the party establishment was flocking around McCollum. In office, he has had uneven relations with the party \u2013 which rejected his choice of former Chairman Leslie Dougher in favor of state Rep. Blaise Ingoglia, the current state GOP chairman.\n\nWhere other governors have surrounded themselves with top legislative leaders for budget matters, Scott announced his first budget at one Tea Party rally in 2010 and signed it \u2013 with line-item vetoes \u2013 at another such gathering. Last summer, he enraged Republican lawmakers with a record $461 million in budget vetoes, including some big-ticket items sought by Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, and other top legislative leaders.\n\nScott\u2019s disdain for politics and government as usual was amply illustrated by the departure of Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, who was implicated in an investigation of \u201cInternet Caf\u00e9\u201d gambling, but never accused of any wrongdoing. He left the office vacant for a year.\n\nSimilarly, Scott badly bungled the ouster of Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey in late 2014, initially claiming the highly respected chief wanted to retire \u2013 which came as news to Bailey. Scott also said the three Cabinet officers concurred in his decision \u2013 which came as news to them.\n\nFinally, Scott conceded the matter \u201ccould have been handled better,\u201d the closest he has come to admitting a mistake in office.\n\nScott sometimes tells audiences of his poor roots \u2013 how he started school in public housing, how his trucker father got laid off just before Christmas some years, how he started a small doughnut business when he got out of the Navy. He and his wife of 43 years, Ann Scott, saved and invested over the years and Scott cofounded Columbia/HCA Hospitals.\n\nThe international hospital chain paid $1.8 billion in federal fraud penalties, but Scott was not criminally charged in the case. He left the company with a vast fortune and continued investing in health care businesses \u2013 as well as a \u201cConservatives for Patients\u2019 Rights\u201d campaign against Obamacare in the early days of the Obama administration.\n\nThat led Scott into politics, starting at the very pinnacle of state government. The unknown Naples business executive picked just the right time for it.\n\nUnknown former House speaker Marco Rubio was inching upward in a tortoise-and-hare Republican race against Gov. Charlie Crist in the U.S. Senate campaign \u2013 winning straw ballots at county GOP conclaves while the well-financed Crist counted on the party establishment \u2013 and Scott hired some of the best available political consultants to do the same in overtaking McCollum.\n\nAtlanta-based consultant David Johnson, head of Strategic Vision LLC, said 2010 \u201csaw a change within the Republican Party. Anti-establishment Republicans captured the GOP nominations for various offices\u201d in several states. In addition to Rubio, outsiders such as Sens. Ted Cruz in Texas and Rand Paul in Kentucky were elected that year \u2013 and are trying to out-outsider Donald Trump for the presidential nomination now.\n\n\u201cHe represents where the Republican Party is going, with the rise of anti-establishment candidates,\u201d Johnson said of Scott. \u201cBefore it is all over, he could be the party\u2019s most successful anti-establishment candidate ever.\u201d\n\nAlthough he was upside-down in polls through most of his first term \u2013 rated the nation\u2019s least-popular, most-vulnerable governor at one point \u2013 Scott defeated Crist, now a Democrat, for a second term. He can\u2019t run for a third, but Scott\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Get to Work\u201d campaign committee has collected about $4 million in 2015 \u2013 more than any other candidate\u2019s political fund \u2013 and he is widely expected to use it in a bid for the U.S. Senate in 2018.\n\nSen. Bill Nelson, the last Democrat remaining in statewide office in Florida, will be ending his third term in Washington that year. Nelson will be 76 \u2013 middle age by congressional standards \u2013 and probably far more formidable than any Democrat Scott has faced before.\n\nFlorida State University public-administration professor Lance deHaven-Smith, said Scott could be a strong candidate for the Senate in 2018.\n\n\"He's kind of shaken the bad image that he had, initially, when he first started,\" he said. \"He's doing a good job now and there hasn't been much controversy or corruption in his administration -- at least, not since he fired the FDLE commissioner.\"\n\nBill Cotterell has covered Florida\u2019s Capitol for 45 years.
