The purchase was an agenda item at a November City Council meeting but the police hadn\u2019t sought public discussion.Hober said the unmanned aerial system hadn\u2019t been used since it was acquired in January and explained that its primary use wouldn\u2019t be for surveillance but would \u201cprovide another tool for bomb technicians to utilize when dealing with suspicious items.\u201dThe $6,965 drone weighs one-and-a-half pounds and measures three-feet wide and one-and-a-half feet tall. An attached GoPro camera provides downlinked video footage, and the drone has a limited flying time of approximately 15 to 20 minutes, controlled by manual radio controls, Hober said.\n\nCommunity members\u2019 responses were mixed.\n\nDistrict 10 Commissioner Nick Labosky said that while he could see how helpful cameras may be to law enforcement, there has to be more transparency. \u201cYou have to do more than the outreach you\u2019re describing, perhaps a demonstration out in the community.\u201dSameena Usman from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group, seemed concerned about drones being used for surveillance on specific groups within the community, citing a New York Police Department incident where Usman said the police was using remote-operated cameras for surveillance on the Muslim community.\u201cWe just have to make sure that if indeed the drone is kept, we have these policies in place to ensure that it would not be used to single out particular communities,\u201d she said.Charlotte Casey from the San Jose Peace and Justice Center \u2014 a South Bay activist group concerned with peace and justice issues \u2014 handed a petition to Hober with more than 1,600 signatures insisting that the surveillance drone \u201cbe sent back.\u201d Casey said owning a drone is a distancing technology in a society where the community hopes to build closer ties with the police.\u201cPolice are there to protect and serve, not to spy on us,\u201d she said.The San Jose police department has planned another meeting for Dec. 6 to solicit more community input.\n\n\n\nCommunity voices from the meeting:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "After quietly purchasing what's believed to be the first police drone in the Bay Area, the San Jose Police Department has apologized for lack of transparency.", "title": "San Jose police's surveillance drone has community concerned - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/20141113__SJDRONE-11141.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-20T11:56:42+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/11/15/san-jose-police-department-drone/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Crime", "tag": "San Jose Police Department", "published_time": "2014-11-15T10:10:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-20T11:56:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "After quietly purchasing what's believed to be the first police drone in the Bay Area, the San Jose Police Department has apologized for lack of transparency.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/20141113__SJDRONE-11141.jpg", "title": "San Jose police's surveillance drone has community concerned - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb7a\"", "article_summary": "San Jose police have apologized for not seeking community input before acquiring a drone in January.\nCommunity voices from the meeting:\nAn attached GoPro camera provides downlinked video footage, and the drone has a limited flying time of approximately 15 to 20 minutes, controlled by manual radio controls, Hober said.\nDistrict 10 Commissioner Nick Labosky said that while he could see how helpful cameras may be to law enforcement, there has to be more transparency.\nAfter quietly purchasing what\u2019s believed to be the first police drone in the Bay Area without seeking community input, Deputy Chief Dave Hober said the San Jose Police Department aimed to engage in a more transparent discussion about its new equipment at a neighborhood commission meeting at City Hall Wednesday.Hober apologized to about 50 concerned community members about the lack of transparency."}
