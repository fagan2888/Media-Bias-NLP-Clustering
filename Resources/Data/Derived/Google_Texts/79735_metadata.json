Another man was shot and killed in Loveland Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cAny time someone\u2019s window is shattered, we go through the car with a fine-toothed comb. You never know,\u201d he said.\n\nThis practice began after a woman was shot in the neck in April, he said. She survived. \u201cWe treat every single one like a crime scene. We lock it down.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, investigators worked over a car after a woman driving with a friend reported that her driver side window shattered as she drove and that she suspected it had been shot out. No injuries were reported.\n\nThat incident occurred at mile marker 250 on I-25, around 10 a.m., the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\n\u201cDriver reported her window may have been shot out at 10 a.m., driver side window, no injuries,\u201d a country tweet report said.\n\nThe friend told 7News, asking that he not be identified, that he heard what sounded like an \u201cexplosion\u201d as the window shattered.\n\n\u201cThere was just a big explosion. I mean, a real loud bang,\u201d the man said. \u201cThe window just disintegrated. I was in shock at the time.\u201d\n\nMany drivers have called in reports of shattered windows on moving vehicles since the 20-year-old Milliken woman was shot in the neck April 22 through her front driver\u2019s side window while driving southbound on I- 25 through Larimer County.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Weld sheriff technicians find no bullet after car window shattered on I-25", "title": "Weld sheriff technicians find no bullet after car window shattered on I-25", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/07/weld-sheriff-technicians-find-no-bullet-after-car-window-shattered-on-i-25/", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150607__cdxxDIGGINS_HR_864p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150607__cdxxDIGGINS_HR_864p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-07T13:56:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:03:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Weld County Sheriff investigators combed through a vehicle with a shattered window on Interstate 25 Sunday and found no bullet.\nThe friend told 7News, asking that he not be identified, that he heard what sounded like an \u201cexplosion\u201d as the window shattered.\nDuring April, the sheriff\u2019s office received reports of 22 broken windshields, about 13 of those along I-25, sheriff\u2019s spokesman Sean Standridge said.\n\u201cAny time someone\u2019s window is shattered, we go through the car with a fine-toothed comb.\n\u201cDriver reported her window may have been shot out at 10 a.m., driver side window, no injuries,\u201d a country tweet report said."}
