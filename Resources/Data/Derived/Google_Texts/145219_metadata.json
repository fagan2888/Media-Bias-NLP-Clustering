Inclusive Communities Project did not change the interpretation of the Fair Housing Act. To the contrary, it affirmed a longstanding principle of the act by allowing challenges to race-neutral policies that have a disproportionate impact on minorities if those policies are not otherwise justified by a legitimate government purpose. This is consistent with HUD's long-held interpretation of the statute and that of every court of appeals that has considered the matter.\n\nThere is no reason to believe the continued application of the Fair Housing Act in cases of unjustified disparate impact will hurt Mayor Bill de Blasio's housing plan in any way. HUD will continue to support the city's ambitious housing goals while ensuring that all Americans are on equal footing in their search for safe, affordable homes.\n\n\u2014Holly Leicht\n\nRegional administrator\n\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\nGet Crain's Daily Alert Sign up for our FREE daily email newsletter.
