Some were hurt in the melee, it said in a statement.\n\n\"Murderer (President Tayyip) Erdogan\", \"murderer police\", the crowd chanted in Sihhiye square, as riot police backed by water cannon vehicles blocked a main highway leading to the district where parliament and government buildings are located.\n\nThe government denies any suggestion of involvement. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, exposing a mosaic of domestic political perils, said Islamic State, Kurdish militant factions or far-leftist radicals could have carried out the bombing.\n\nSome have suggested militant nationalists opposed to any accommodation with Kurds seeking greater minority rights could have been responsible.\n\nTurkish investigators worked on Sunday to identify the perpetrators and victims of the attack. Newspaper headlines reflected the mixture of grief and anger.\n\n\"We are in mourning for peace,\" said the front-page headline in the secularist Cumhuriyet newspaper as three days of national mourning declared by the prime minister got underway. \"Scum Launch attack in Ankara,\" said the Haberturk newspaper. \"The goal is to divide the nation,\" said the pro-government Star.\n\nDEATH TOLL COULD RISE\n\nOne of the bombers had been identified as a male aged between 25-30 after analyzing bodies at the scene and taking fingerprints, the pro-government Yeni Safak said.\n\nThere were no claims of responsibility for the attack, which came as external threats mount for NATO member Turkey, with increased fighting across its border with Syria and incursions by Russian warplanes on its air space over the last week.\n\nDavutoglu's office named 52 of the victims overnight and said autopsies were continuing. It said 246 wounded people were still being treated, 48 of them in intensive care.\n\n\"The necessary work is being conducted to identify those behind the attack and quickly bring them to justice,\" a statement said.\n\nRelatives and friends of the casualties waited anxiously on Sunday morning outside the hospitals where the wounded were being treated.\n\nThe two blasts happened seconds apart on Saturday morning as crowds, including pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) activists, leftists, labor unions and other civic groups, gathered for a march to protest over the deaths of hundreds since conflict resumed between security forces and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the mainly Kurdish southeast.\n\nHDP leader Selahattin Demirtas blamed the government in blunt terms. He said on Saturday the attack was part of the same campaign as the bombing of an HDP rally in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on the eve of June elections and a suicide bombing blamed on Islamic State in Suruc near the Syrian border in July, which killed 33 mostly young pro-Kurdish activists.\n\nHours after the bombing, the PKK, as widely expected beforehand, ordered its fighters to halt operations in Turkey unless they faced attack. It said it would avoid acts that could hinder a \"fair and just election\" on Nov. 1.\n\n(Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by Nick Tattersall)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Thousands of people, many chanting anti-government slogans, gathere", "title": "Protesters gather at scene of Ankara bombings; 95 dead", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/11/Turkey-mourns-bomb-blast-victims-seeks-identify-attackers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/turkey-explosion_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/11/Turkey-mourns-bomb-blast-victims-seeks-identify-attackers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/turkey-explosion_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Thousands of people, many chanting anti-government slogans, gathere", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, exposing a mosaic of domestic political perils, said Islamic State, Kurdish militant factions or far-leftist radicals could have carried out the bombing.\nANKARA (Reuters) - Thousands of people, many chanting anti-government slogans, gathered in central Ankara on Sunday near the scene of bomb blasts which killed at least 95 people, mourning the victims of the most deadly attack of its kind on Turkish soil.\nThe pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), a major presence at Saturday's march, said police attacked its leaders and members as they tried to leave carnations earlier at the scene.\nHours after the bombing, the PKK, as widely expected beforehand, ordered its fighters to halt operations in Turkey unless they faced attack.\nRelatives and friends of the casualties waited anxiously on Sunday morning outside the hospitals where the wounded were being treated."}
