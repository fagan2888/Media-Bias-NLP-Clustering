(Published Thursday, May 14, 2015)\n\nJeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams has halted production and will temporarily close its shops, after listeria was found once again in its production facility.\n\nThe ice cream company said it stopped production earlier this week and began investigating where the listeria came from and how it re-entered the facility.\n\nJeni\u2019s CEO John Lowe said the company has a theory that is being tested, but it\u2019s not clear when production will resume.\n\n\u201cSince resuming production in our kitchen on May 13, 2015, we have been testing every batch of ice cream we have made and holding it until we learned that the testing did not detect any Listeria,\u201d Lowe said in a statement. \u201cSo it is with complete confidence that I can say all of the ice cream that has been served in our shops since reopening on May 22 has been safe and is 100% Listeria-free.\u201d\n\nJeni\u2019s Ice Cream Closes Chicago Shop, Recalls All Products\n\nJeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams has closed their North Side Chicago shop and recalled all of their products after a listeria contamination was found. NBC Chicago's Katie Kim reports. (Published Thursday, April 23, 2015)\n\nThe company said it plans to temporarily close its shops \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have enough ice cream to keep them stocked.\u201d It\u2019s not clear when stores will reopen.\n\n\u201cWhile we would most certainly prefer that Listeria never enter our facility, we do take solace in the fact that our protocols and testing have worked: we found the Listeria before it got into ice cream we served,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nJeni\u2019s closed all stores and recalled all retail products in April after listeria was discovered in some pints and later in the factory. The company later said the source of the listeria was traced to a spout on its pint-filling machine at the Ohio production facility.\n\nThe ice cream shops reopened Memorial Day weekend with their signature \u201cSalty Caramel\u201d ice cream and other flavors, but some of the usual flavors weren\u2019t immediately available as the ice cream makers had to start from scratch.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Cream says it has once again found Listeria in its production facility.", "title": "Listeria Found at Jeni's Ice Cream Production Facility Once Again", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Chicago", "description": "Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Cream says it has once again found Listeria in its production facility.", "title": "Jeni's Ice Cream Finds Listeria Again", "url": "http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/health/Listeria-Found-at-Jenis-Ice-Cream-Production-Facility-for-Second-Time-307132331.html", "image": "http://media.nbcchicago.com/images/1234*675/jeni%27s+ice+cream+sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Cream says it has once again found Listeria in its production facility.", "title": "Jeni's Ice Cream Finds Listeria Again", "url": "http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/health/Listeria-Found-at-Jenis-Ice-Cream-Production-Facility-for-Second-Time-307132331.html", "image": "http://media.nbcchicago.com/images/1234*675/jeni%27s+ice+cream+sign.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcchicago", "site": "@nbcchicago", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 187516345314}, "keywords": "jenis ice cream, listeria, jeni's splendid ice cream listeria, jeni's ice cream plant", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nbcchicago"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "jenis ice cream, listeria, jeni's splendid ice cream listeria, jeni's ice cream plant"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd6b\"", "article_summary": "The ice cream shops reopened Memorial Day weekend with their signature \u201cSalty Caramel\u201d ice cream and other flavors, but some of the usual flavors weren\u2019t immediately available as the ice cream makers had to start from scratch.\nThe ice cream company said it stopped production earlier this week and began investigating where the listeria came from and how it re-entered the facility.\n(Published Thursday, May 14, 2015)Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams has halted production and will temporarily close its shops, after listeria was found once again in its production facility.\nJeni's Splendid Ice Creams has set a date to reopen following a listeria outbreak that forced them to close all stores in April.\nThe company later said the source of the listeria was traced to a spout on its pint-filling machine at the Ohio production facility."}
