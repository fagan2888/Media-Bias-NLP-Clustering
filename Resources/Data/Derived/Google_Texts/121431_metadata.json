According to the study, the funding designated for states accepting the expansion is so substantial that it will be, on average, more than double the amount that states currently receive for transportation funds.\n\nBut since Medicaid is financed through general tax revenue, all Americans \u2014 irrespective of whether or not they live in a state participating in the expansion \u2014 will pay into the system. Consequently, Texas residents will see over $9 billion flow out of their state in 2022 to help fund the expansion in states that accept it; Georgia taxpayers will lose out on nearly $3 billion; and Florida\u2019s rejection of the expansion will cost residents over $5 billion:\n\n\n\nThe Medicaid expansion is fully funded by the federal government for the next three years. But even in 2022, when expansion states will have to begin footing 10 percent of the program\u2019s bill, researchers estimate that those states\u2019 costs will be less that a sixth of the amount they spend on a yearly basis to attract private businesses.\n\n\u201cFederal funding provides direct benefits and bolsters local economies. The opportunity to participate in the Medicaid expansion has potentially important benefits to states,\u201d concluded the study authors. \u201cEven states that do not value the health and health system benefits of expanding Medicaid may value the expansion as a source of funds that benefits the state economy.\u201d\n\nIf all states expanded Medicaid, over 21 million of the poorest Americans would have access to basic health benefits by 2022.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "GOP-led states refusing Obamacare's Medicaid expansion will force their residents to pay billions into a system from which they'll receive no benefits, according to a new study.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "GOP-led states refusing Obamacare's Medicaid expansion will force their residents to pay billions into a system from which they'll receive no benefits, according to a new study.", "title": "STUDY: States Rejecting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion Will Cost Taxpayers Billions", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/05/3023851/medicaid-expansion-states-cost-taxpayers-billions/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/obamacare-e1369854297108.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP-led states refusing Obamacare's Medicaid expansion will force their residents to pay billions into a system from which they'll receive no benefits, according to a new study.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/obamacare-e1369854297108-300x214.jpg", "title": "STUDY: States Rejecting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion Will Cost Taxpayers Billions", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/obamacare-e1369854297108.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/obamacare-e1369854297108.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-05T09:03:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25b7\"", "article_summary": "Health STUDY: States Rejecting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion Will Cost Taxpayers Billions CREDIT:Texas, Florida, Georgia, and other GOP-led states rejecting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion are costing their residents billions of dollars by making them pay taxes into a system from which they won\u2019t benefit, according to a new study by the Commonwealth Fund.\nThe opportunity to participate in the Medicaid expansion has potentially important benefits to states,\u201d concluded the study authors.\nObamacare gives states general federal funding to expand their Medicaid programs to all residents making up to 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).\nAccording to the study, the funding designated for states accepting the expansion is so substantial that it will be, on average, more than double the amount that states currently receive for transportation funds.\nBut even in 2022, when expansion states will have to begin footing 10 percent of the program\u2019s bill, researchers estimate that those states\u2019 costs will be less that a sixth of the amount they spend on a yearly basis to attract private businesses."}
