Amgen Inc. said Wednesday that it has agreed to buy Netherlands-based Dezima Pharma BV and struck a research and license agreement with Xencor Inc., as the biotech company aims to expand both its cardiovascular and immuno-oncology portfolio.

Amgen AMGN, +1.87% will pay $300 million in cash upfront and up to $1.25 billion in milestone payments for cholesterol-drug maker Dezima. The deal, which could be valued at more than $1.5 billion, is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

Dezima is currently developing TA-8995, an oral drug that reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by up to 48% in a mid-stage trial. In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved Amgen’s cholesterol-lowering Repatha, teeing up a rivalry with a similar treatment that was approved just weeks earlier.

The agreement with Xencor XNCR, +2.26% covers six programs for which Amgen will be fully responsible for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization.

The collaboration, which includes molecular engineering by Xencor and preclinical development of bispecific molecules for five programs proposed by Amgen, brings together Amgen’s capabilities in target discovery and protein therapeutics with Xencor’s XmAb antibody engineering technology platform, the companies said.
