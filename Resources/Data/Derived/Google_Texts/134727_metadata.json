As someone who watches too many true-crime programs, I know well that many of those men are in prison for violent crimes. Yes, there are undoubtedly innocent people in prison right now. For the most part, however, violent offenders need to be kept away from the general public.\n\nOne solution to the problem of young people being incarcerated would be a Works Progress Administration-style program, based on the one FDR had back in the day. Maybe such a program could repair our decaying infrastructure, and at-risk men and women could feed their families without resorting to crime.\n\nYes, it would take firm will, money and perseverance. Didn\u2019t we in the U.S.A. once have those qualities? John Early\n\nWhere was Joe?\n\nOrange, N.J.: The Daily News rightfully reported how the Academy Awards broadcast totally snubbed icons such as Joan Rivers and Elaine Stritch in their \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d reel. However, I would like to cite another glaring New York-centric omission: The late, legendary Joe Franklin, though known primarily as a TV personality, occasionally made forays into motion pictures with cameos in films such as \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cBroadway Danny Rose\u201d and \u201cThe Aristocrats.\u201d At least Joe is in good company. Derek Tague\n\nHistory repeats\n\nFlanders, N.J.: What Rudy Giuliani said about the President is disgraceful. Ever since Obama was elected, I have never seen so much hate in this country, and Republicans like Giuliani are good examples of that. They talk about patriotism \u2014 but so did the Nazis, and we know what happened to the world then. Thomas Boyle\n\nRudy, Rudy, Rudy\n\nManhattan: To Rudy Giuliani: Thank you for your comments on President Obama. For many years, I have had to suffer through people who are not from New York telling me how great you are. By saying absolutely hateful things about the President, you have proven me right that you are nothing more than a bully. Mary Jo Pane\n\nTake it from Rudy\n\nBronx: Rudy Giuliani was completely right when he said President Obama does not \u201clove America.\u201d From his associations with America-hating far leftists (e.g., the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn), his apology tours about America overseas, his discourtesy to our allies (e.g., Benjamin Netanyahu), his disrespect for our Constitution, his lies about the Affordable Care Act, his doubling of the national debt, to his lack of interest in securing the borders to stop illegals from flooding this country, Obama has been a complete disaster as President. Thank you, Mayor Giuliani, for speaking the truth about this man. Geraldine Voelkel\n\nLittle big man\n\nManhattan: Linda Stasi got it right in \u201cRudy is one crude dude\u201d (column, Feb. 22). But she forgot one thing: Rudy ranted about how much he loves America, that he would fight for America anytime, anyplace. I guess six Vietnam deferrals don\u2019t count. Oh, well. You were just following the pattern of your uncles who dodged the draft in World War II. H.D. Kayne\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Rudy?\n\nManhattan: Linda Stasi\u2019s column on Rudy Giuliani\u2019s recent public statements was 100% on target \u2014 and this comes from someone who voted for the former mayor twice. His comments are not only out of line but seem to come from some dark and twisted recess of his psyche. Indeed, one has to wonder if the former mayor isn\u2019t suffering from some kind of brain damage or mental disease. Bruce Eder\n\nDump O\u2019Reilly\n\nFire Island Pines, L.I.: Linda Stasi\u2019s defense of Bill O\u2019Reilly is not convincing. Buenos Aires was not a combat zone . Descriptions of his experiences in El Salvador are also inaccurate exaggerations. Exactly when did he narrowly escape death three times, as he claims? He deserves the same fate as Brian Williams \u2014 suspension in contemplation of dismissal. Peter LeVasseur\n\nTake a hike, Mike\n\nMiller Place, L.I.: While reading Mike Lupica\u2019s column on Rudy Giuliani (\u201cHas-been making a pathetic bid to be relevant,\u201d Feb. 22), I couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the asinine hypocrisy. Lupica is \u201cnothing more than a crackpot member of the bullhorn media\u201d \u2014 with articles meant to enrage and embitter rather than enlighten and educate. Spencer Charles Clasper\n\nMike likes Mike\n\nNew Hyde Park, L.I.: I\u2019m a faithful reader of Mike Lupica\u2019s columns. About five years ago, I remember him being very critical of Mayor Mike Bloomberg. But now, he manages to praise him in every column \u2014 even when the subject is not Bloomberg. Anyone know the reason for his change of heart? Just wondering. John Viola\n\nHands off Andy\n\nManhattan: I am amused by Mike Lupica\u2019s decadeslong visceral hatred for Andy Pettitte (\u201cThe Liars Club,\u201d column, Feb. 22). It comes across as nothing more than inadequacy on Lupica\u2019s part. Andy made a mistake and owned it from day one. It\u2019s a classic case of a youngster \u2014 maybe not a particularly bright one \u2014 who became enthralled with his boyhood hero, Roger Clemens. When this \u201chero\u201d took him under his wing, Pettitte followed like a puppy dog \u2014 straight to the wrong side of the tracks. His unfortunate decision may cost him a spot in the Hall of Fame. But he can hold his head high knowing that he admitted his mistake \u2014 and moved on to set a fine example for young people everywhere. Carol Hopkins\n\nWinter of discontent\n\nManhattan: Will everyone please stop whining about the cold and snow? Soon enough, you\u2019ll be whining about the heat and humidity. Personally, I\u2019d rather deal with this weather than be dripping with perspiration and slogging through the horrible heat waves that beset us in the summer months. Marcia Epstein\n\nSay no to suicide\n\nBrooklyn: Re Voicer Donald Kerr: There is no reason whatsoever, given proper medical care, that his brother should have died an agonizing death. My father died of lung cancer. At no point was he ever in agony or even distress. Also, anyone who wants to die can just stop their treatment, medication, etc. That\u2019s different from the act of committing suicide, assisted or not, that Timothy Cardinal Dolan, given his religion, is against. Adelaide Verponi\n\nLegal vs. illegal\n\nBrooklyn: Voicer Jaclyn Garcia is correct on one point \u2014 the ancestors of Americans were all immigrants. My paternal grandparents were immigrants. They entered the United States legally. They had to be sponsored by an American citizen and ready for employment. My grandfather worked and supported his family with no help from the government, and there were 11 children in the family. Too many of today\u2019s immigrants show no respect for our laws by entering the country illegally. If they choose to break the immigration laws, how can they be trusted to abide by all the other laws of our country? Susan La Regina\n\nThe end of an era\n\nSt. Albans: I would like to offer my condolences to the family and friends of Bob Simon (\u201cOpera, tears at Simon farewell,\u201d Feb. 18). He will be missed by all of his adoring fans. In my opinion, he was the greatest investigative reporter of all time. God bless you, Bob. Rest in peace. I will miss your fantastic stories on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Leslie Langer\n\nWritten on her face\n\nHopewell Junction, N.Y.: I received my Ash Wednesday ashes in Hopewell Junction. When I looked in the mirror, I scared myself. My cross was stretched in high definition across my forehead. Well, it was good for people who were nearsighted. Amen. Celia Oliva\n\nLook both ways\n\nBronx: As a retired MTA bus operator , I say if the law makes failure to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk an \u201carrestable misdemeanor\u201d when the driver kills or injures a pedestrian, then all crosswalks should have crossing gates. At what point are pedestrians responsible for their actions? Cindi C.
