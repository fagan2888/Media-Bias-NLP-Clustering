She responded, \u201cWell, first of all, boo hoo Mrs. Clinton. I mean, Mrs. Clinton is the same person who compared Republicans to terrorists. For heaven\u2019s sakes, I actually wish Mr. Trump would throw a little more heat Hillary Clinton\u2019s way. I feel sometimes as though I\u2019m the only who\u2019s consistently been critical of her. The truth is, Mrs. Clinton has lied, as secretary of state, about Benghazi, about her emails, about her server. And, so, when she revives this war on women, and make no mistake, she will. This is her go-to line. And of course, we now know that Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t have a lot to do with women\u2019s health. It does have to do with the character of this nation. And I hope very much, that our leaders in Congress will once and for all, pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and defund Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carly Fiorina stated, \"boo hoo Mrs. Clinton\" in response to Hillary Clinton appearing to revise the war on women", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Carly Fiorina stated, \"boo hoo Mrs. Clinton\" in response to Hillary Clinton appearing to revise the war on women", "title": "Fiorina On Clinton War on Women Claims: 'Boo Hoo Mrs. Clinton' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Fiorina-824-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-07T11:32:56-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/07/fiorina-on-clinton-war-on-women-claims-boo-hoo-mrs-clinton/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carly Fiorina stated, \"boo hoo Mrs. Clinton\" in response to Hillary Clinton appearing to revise the war on women", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Fiorina-824-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Fiorina On Clinton War on Women Claims: 'Boo Hoo Mrs. Clinton' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Donald Trump, War on Women,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton,Fiorina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-07T11:32:18-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-09-07T11:32:56-07:00", "tag": "War on Women", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2669\"", "article_summary": "She responded, \u201cWell, first of all, boo hoo Mrs. Clinton.\nThe truth is, Mrs. Clinton has lied, as secretary of state, about Benghazi, about her emails, about her server.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina stated, \u201cboo hoo Mrs. Clinton\u201d in response to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton appearing to revise the war on women talking point against Republicans on Monday\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nI mean, Mrs. Clinton is the same person who compared Republicans to terrorists.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFiorina was asked [relevant exchange begins around 3:00] about Clinton criticizing Trump and other GOP candidates on the issue of women\u2019s health, and Clinton appearing to revive the war on women line."}
