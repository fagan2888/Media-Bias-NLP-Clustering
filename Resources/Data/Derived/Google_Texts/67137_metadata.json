But getting them to hang out? Not so much. As the mall approaches its 33rd birthday, officials are searching for ways to revitalize the 1\u00bc-mile corridor. It attracts thousands of people each day but scares away others because of its urban grittiness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an incredibly successful transit mall,\u201d said Brad Buchanan, executive director of Denver Planning and Community Development. \u201cBut the issue is how to create a sense of place that attracts people and gets them to linger.\u201d\n\nLingering, if not a part of every planner\u2019s lexicon, is viewed as a vital objective in improving the mall\u2019s economic health and social desirability.\n\nWhen city officials and a high-profile outside consultant began last year to study the mall, a surprising revelation came to light.\n\nWhile thousands of people traverse the mall each day on foot or via shuttle bus, an extraordinarily low number of them stop to enjoy their surroundings.\n\nAccording to the consultant \u2014 Copenhagen, Denmark-based Gehl Architects \u2014 vibrant urban corridors such as Broadway in New York City and Covent Garden in London have a common element: one-quarter to one-third of their pedestrians stop to converse, window-shop or even just sit for a few minutes on a bench.\n\nBut when researchers last summer observed one of the busiest sections of the 16th Street Mall, the block from Stout to Champa streets, they found that only 1 percent of pedestrians lingered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised there are not more people spending time on the mall,\u201d said Jeff Risom, a Denver native who manages Gehl\u2019s U.S. operations from a Copenhagen office. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important street in the city, but it is surprisingly underperforming in relation to its potential.\u201d\n\nGehl is working with the Denver planning office and the Downtown Denver Partnership under a $650,000 initiative called \u201cThe Mall Experience: The Future of Denver\u2019s 16th Street Mall.\u201d\n\nNo recommendations have been made or permanent actions taken. Yet planners are likely to push for \u201cpedestrianizing\u201d the mall, possibly by changing or restricting the use of RTD\u2019s Free MallRide shuttles along 16th Street.\n\nA preliminary report from Gehl states: \u201c16th Street is already a vital bus corridor. It is time to reimagine \u2026 opportunities for more freedom of mobility \u2014 walk, bike, car share, etc.\u201d\n\nA diagram in the report illustrating how downtown might be transformed shows buses running on 15th and 17th streets, but only pedestrians and bicycles on 16th.\n\nRisom of Gehl said recommendations to be offered this year won\u2019t necessarily change the way shuttles operate.\n\n\u201cEverything is on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need solutions that include all modes of transportation.\u201d\n\nBut the possibility of diverting shuttles is a concern to RTD officials, who fear that changes could cause problems for workers and visitors using transit to get downtown.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to experiment with our customers,\u201d said Bruce Abel, RTD\u2019s assistant general manager for bus operations.\n\nAbel noted that a cornerstone of RTD\u2019s commuter program is transporting passengers on the shuttle after they\u2019ve arrived via bus or light rail at the Union Station or Civic Center terminals.\n\nPart of the mall study involves the Downtown Denver Partnership\u2019s \u201cMeet in the Street\u201d program, in which the mall is closed to shuttle buses on five Sundays this summer while special events take place on sidewalks and bus lanes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just to see what happens to the mall when we pedestrianize it,\u201d said John Desmond, the partnership\u2019s executive vice president for Downtown Environment. \u201cWe need to get out of the box on how we perceive the mall. We think it can be a world-class destination.\u201d\n\nRTD agreed to the program on selected Sundays but turned thumbs-down on extending it to Saturdays or to Sundays when the Colorado Rockies are playing at home, when shuttle use is higher.\n\nPartnership officials said they\u2019ve been pleased with the turnout on the program\u2019s first two Sundays this year, although attendance figures haven\u2019t been disclosed. When the event was held on two Sundays last summer, pedestrian counts on the two busiest blocks \u2014 Glenarm to Welton and Champa to Curtis \u2014 increased by as much as 50 percent.\n\nMerchants reported mixed results from the first two shuttle-free Sundays this year.\n\nMichael Rosenbaum, an artist and owner of Sketchy Faces Caricature Co., said he logged record sales on June 28. But his sales were lower than average during the July 5 event.\n\nHe said a noticeable benefit of the program on both days was the reduction in noise with no shuttles running on the mall.\n\n\u201cWe definitely like the vibe with the buses not on the mall,\u201d he said.\n\nAppaloosa Grill general manager Johnny Qualley said sales soared 68 percent on June 28 compared with the Sunday a year earlier. But sales showed little change July 5.\n\nAppaloosa, at the corner of 16th and Welton streets, capitalized on the Sunday promotion by setting up a beer garden and live music stage on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Pedestrians who normally would use the sidewalk were able to walk in bus lanes.\n\n\u201cWhen the buses aren\u2019t running, (the mall) turns into a different organism, for sure,\u201d Qualley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great experiment. Maybe the days of buses running up and down the mall are done.\u201d\n\nPartnership CEO Tami Door said last week that the group has commissioned consulting and financial services firm KPMG for a plan \u201cto more efficiently address security issues on the mall and enhance consumer confidence in the space.\u201d\n\nLast year, the partnership and downtown business interests raised $175,000 in private funding to pay for three off-duty police officers to patrol sections of the mall 12 hours a day, in addition to regular police presence. This year, the extra officers are covered in the city budget.\n\nAnalyzing Denver\u2019s mall\n\nStout-Champa is one of the busiest blocks on the 16th Street Mall, with 28,000 pedestrians passing through from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. during analysis. One percent of people were estimated to spend time in that block, calculated during a peak hour that saw a total of 2,200 people pass through.\n\nIn comparison with other major cities:\n\nBroadway, New York City: post intervention\n\n45,000 average total weekly pedestrians\n\n52,000 average total weekend pedestrians\n\n23% spending time\n\nStroget, Copenhagen: post multi-year intervention\n\n72,000 average total weekly pedestrians\n\n81,000 average total weekend pedestrians\n\n35% spending time\n\nCovent Garden, London: no intervention, also not a 1-block radius\n\n40,000 average total weekly pedestrians\n\n70,000 average total weekend pedestrians\n\n27% spending time\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Study to revitalize Denver\u2019s 16th Street Mall seeks \u201clinger\u201d factor", "title": "Study to revitalize Denver\u2019s 16th Street Mall seeks \u201clinger\u201d factor", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/17/study-to-revitalize-denvers-16th-street-mall-seeks-linger-factor/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-18T00:22:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-18T00:22:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In comparison with other major cities:Broadway, New York City: post intervention45,000 average total weekly pedestrians52,000 average total weekend pedestrians23% spending timeStroget, Copenhagen: post multi-year intervention72,000 average total weekly pedestrians81,000 average total weekend pedestrians35% spending timeCovent Garden, London: no intervention, also not a 1-block radius40,000 average total weekly pedestrians70,000 average total weekend pedestrians27% spending time\u2014\u2014\u2014Information from: The Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com\nDENVER \u2014 Denver\u2019s 16th Street Mall is unparalleled in its ability to move people from one end of downtown to the other.\nAnalyzing Denver\u2019s mallStout-Champa is one of the busiest blocks on the 16th Street Mall, with 28,000 pedestrians passing through from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. during analysis.\nYet planners are likely to push for \u201cpedestrianizing\u201d the mall, possibly by changing or restricting the use of RTD\u2019s Free MallRide shuttles along 16th Street.\nA preliminary report from Gehl states: \u201c16th Street is already a vital bus corridor."}
