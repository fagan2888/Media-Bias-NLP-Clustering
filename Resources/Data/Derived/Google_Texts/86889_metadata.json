( Mark Leffingwell / Daily Camera )\n\nIn six weeks, traffic is expected to again be flowing in both directions along a portion of Arapahoe Avenue near downtown Boulder.\n\nAug. 15 can't come soon enough for some businesses along that stretch.\n\nThat date marks the scheduled completion of a $5 million reconstruction of Arapahoe from Folsom Street west to 15th Street.\n\nThe project \u2014 which involves replacing the rutted and crowning asphalt with concrete, improving underground utilities, reconstructing damaged sidewalks and performing minor landscaping \u2014 is the first major road reconstruction to occur there in 20 years and was funded by the $49 million Capital Improvement Bond approved by Boulder voters in 2011.\n\nThe concrete is less-susceptible to failures, pot holes and rutting, requires less maintenance and should last 25 to 30 years, said Noreen Walsh, a transportation planner for the city.\n\nThe project also will allow for better utilities and the installation of storm sewer lines \u2014 something the street lacked in the past, she said.\n\n\"Arapahoe Avenue is a major east-west corridor ... it was just an area that needed to be addressed,\" she said.\n\nAll lanes are expected to be open by Friday, Aug. 15, she said, noting that some landscaping work will continue through parts of the fall.\n\nBecause of the project's nature and the artery's proximity and necessity to the University of Colorado and Boulder High School, the construction was sliced into three phases, with the major overhauls of the road occurring in the summers of 2013 and 2014.\n\nBut for a seasonal business like Rocky Mountain Anglers, the timing is problematic.\n\n\"Could you imagine how gridlocked it would be if there was construction (during the school year)? I understand that,\" said Randy Hicks, owner of the fly shop at 1904 Arapahoe Ave. \"It's just a bummer for us to have it fall two years in a row when I'm supposed to be my busiest.\"\n\nHicks estimates that his store has taken a sales hit upward of 20 percent.\n\nBrian Harris, right, helps customer Jason Lynch pick out flies at Rocky Mountain Anglers in Boulder. Like other merchants on Arapahoe Avenue near downtown Boulder, the shop's owner says business is hurting thanks to the second straight summer of road construction on Arapahoe. (Mark Leffingwell / Daily Camera)\n\nIt's an easy situation to complain about, Hicks said, but he noted he's taken the approach that he would rather \"make lemonade from the lemons.\"\n\nHe extended the store's hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. \u2014 an hour on both ends \u2014 and has told his crew to put an even greater emphasis on customer service.\n\nHicks also launched an Intro to Fly Fishing course on Sundays for beginners, started doing a little grilling on Saturdays and also decided to cater to past requests and begin selling inner tubes.\n\n\"If these three to four little things can help keep me viable and put a little turn in the register, then I think the overall sting in the whole situation isn't that bad,\" he said. \"But don't get me wrong, I'm looking forward to Aug. 15. I'm looking forward to Aug. 15 for sure.\"\n\n'Out of business'\n\nOther neighboring businesses are biding their time as well.\n\nBusiness at the SnarfBurger shack at 2000 Arapahoe Ave. has been \"killed\" during the past two summers, said Jim Seidel, the Snarf's Sandwich Shop chief executive officer who opened the burger-based concept in April 2013.\n\n\"A lot of our customers come from all over; they just don't come when the road's closed or under construction like that,\" he said, noting the street's current state that includes eastward-only traffic between 17th and Folsom streets. \"I imagine if I was a small business owner, I would be out of business.\"\n\nTo endure the slower times, Seidel has not raised any prices to account for pricier ingredients. As the margins get lower, SnarfBurger has to eat the cost.\n\n'Nothing for us'\n\nRandy Leever, who has run the Boulder Stained Glass Studios at 1920 Arapahoe Ave. since 1976, said this two-summer stretch has been the most difficult time his operation has faced in its 38 years.\n\nThe stained glass business has seen a 50 percent drop in business, Leever said, noting the walk-in traffic has been essentially non-existent.\n\n\"People aren't out walking up and down the street,\" he said, noting the typical traffic of guests from the neighboring Quality Inn & Suites, visitors to the bed and breakfast and Saturday morning Farmers' Market traffic.\n\nLeever said he wishes that the city would install a large sign at 17th Street indicating the businesses just east to Folsom.\n\nHe said that while he understands the city has put attention and dollars to help businesses in the construction-riddled West End of Pearl Street, he was disappointed to not receive much attention.\n\n\"They get one-half and full-page ads for them, but nothing for us,\" he said.\n\nContact Camera Business Writer Alicia Wallace at 303-473-1332 or wallacea@dailycamera.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26088182/boulder-businesses-trying-wait-out-arapahoe-avenue-overhaul", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace ,  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26088182:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-06T18:28:06-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "In six weeks, traffic is expected to again be flowing in both directions along a portion of Arapahoe Avenue near downtown Boulder.
