Coming up Thursday evening at 9, CNN presents "Pandora's Promise," an original film dedicated to the debate over the viability and safety of using nuclear power as a way to combat climate change.

In advance of the premier, on Wednesday night "Piers Morgan Live" invited Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Robert Stone to offer their professional perspectives.

"On the cost issue, nuke just doesn't make sense. It's the most catastrophically expensive way to boil a pot of water that's ever been devised," said Kennedy Jr., an activist and attorney specializing in environmental law. "Not only do we have to pay $14 billion for the plant but then you have to store the waste for 30,000 years which is five times the length of recorded human history, and how that can ever be economic ... somebody's got to make that case."

Stone, who directed the film, respectfully disagreed:

"The cost thing, I really think is a red herring, because we haven't built nuclear plants in 30 years in this country. We got a few going up now," he allowed. "The future of nuclear energy is going to not be these one-off plants. They're going to be manufacturing components, modeler reactors on assembly lines, the same way we manufacture a commercial jet aircraft. Hi technology items, they are super safe, standardized, heavy regulation, that's the future. We've got to just start doing it."

Watch the clip for more of Morgan's interview with Kennedy Jr. and Stone, and for more on a film which "reveals a rift within the environmental movement as they describe their individual journeys of 'defection,'" check out CNN's exclusive web page. Then, tune in for the airing Thursday at 9p.
