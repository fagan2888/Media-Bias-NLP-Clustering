Jerry Brown, proposing a tax in his new budget that would tax all health plans, boasted, \u201cWe need the [managed care organization] tax now \u2014 this month. We\u2019re going to get it. We\u2019ve got to get it.\u201d\n\nBut now, prospects for Brown\u2019s proposal seem dim, as GOP legislators and even some Democrats are balking at raising taxes, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAssembly GOP leader Chad Mayes of Yucca Valley stated, \u201cWe will not support a tax that hurts consumers.\u201d Democratic Sen. Cathleen Galgiani, said she would not back a tax unless it was approved by voters.\n\nThe state will lose over $1 billion in federal dollars for Medi-Cal if it doesn\u2019t ensure all health plans are taxed, according to the Obama administration. Brown\u2019s plan would extend the current tax on managed care organizations that serve Medi-Cal patients to all managed care organizations\n\nThe Times reports that the tax rates would increase or decrease depending on how many Medi-Cal enrollees and non-Medi-Cal beneficiaries were covered in any given plan. The managed care plans would benefit from an elimination of their corporation and insurance taxes.\n\nBrown asserted in his State of the State address, \u201cThis is not a tax increase, no matter what anyone tells you.\u201d He released a statement in which he said, \u201cThe package provides a net reduction in taxes paid by the private health care industry, secures funding for General Fund Medi-Cal expenses and provides an opportunity for targeted rate increases for developmental disability services.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prospects for Brown\u2019s proposal seem\u00a0dim, as GOP legislators and even some Democrats are balking at\u00a0raising taxes, according to the\u00a0Los Angeles Times.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Prospects for Brown\u2019s proposal seem\u00a0dim, as GOP legislators and even some Democrats are balking at\u00a0raising taxes, according to the\u00a0Los Angeles Times.", "title": "Jerry Brown Struggles to Pass Obamacare Tax Hike - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3865, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Jerry-Brown-Sandy-Huffaker-Getty.jpg", "height": 2899}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/02/01/jerry-brown-struggles-to-pass-tax-hike-for-health-plans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prospects for Brown\u2019s proposal seem\u00a0dim, as GOP legislators and even some Democrats are balking at\u00a0raising taxes, according to the\u00a0Los Angeles Times.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Jerry-Brown-Sandy-Huffaker-Getty.jpg", "title": "Jerry Brown Struggles to Pass Obamacare Tax Hike - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jerry Brown, managed care, obamacare medi-cal, taxes,Breitbart California, Obamacare, Taxes,Jerry Brown", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2016-02-01T11:35:34-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California,Obamacare,Taxes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Jerry Brown, proposing a tax in his new budget that would tax all health plans, boasted, \u201cWe need the [managed care organization] tax now \u2014 this month.\nThe managed care plans would benefit from an elimination of their corporation and insurance taxes.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhat a difference three weeks make: three weeks ago, California Gov.\nThe state will lose over $1 billion in federal dollars for Medi-Cal if it doesn\u2019t ensure all health plans are taxed, according to the Obama administration.\nBrown\u2019s plan would extend the current tax on managed care organizations that serve Medi-Cal patients to all managed care organizationsThe Times reports that the tax rates would increase or decrease depending on how many Medi-Cal enrollees and non-Medi-Cal beneficiaries were covered in any given plan."}
