LONDON (AP) - It’s not every day that you see not just one, but two McCartneys on the front row.

Paul McCartney and his fashion designer daughter Stella caused a stir as they sat down to watch the catwalk show staged Saturday by Hunter Original, squeezing in next to pop star Rita Ora and Vogue editor Anna Wintour. The brand, best known for its rubber wellington boots, is headed by Stella McCartney’s husband Alasdhair Willis.

Hunter has only recently branched out into clothing - it was just the label’s second season on the London Fashion Week circuit - but it proved it can put on a fun and slick show to go with its display of sporty casualwear.

Saturday’s showcase, staged at a disused indoor pool, was the buzziest event so far since the five-day style spectacle kicked off Friday. There was no swimming, but a giant video backdrop showing bubbling water, floating submarines and cartoon sharks made up for it.

Boots, of course, featured prominently. Signature wellies, worn by both male and female models, came with buckles and were printed with eye-catching color blocks. There were also flat sandals and army boots, some with chunky platform heels.

Models sported rain jackets, parkas, shorts and culottes - many in low-key military greens and browns, though outfits in bright turquoise, lavender and vibrant graphic stripes provided a burst of color and style.

Paul McCartney arrived at the last minute, wearing a pink button-down shirt and a dark sports jacket. The former Beatle appeared cheerful, posing with his daughter and smiling mischievously for the cameras.

Did he like the show? “Terrific,” he said with a grin, before being whisked away by his security guards.
