Officials said columns of troops were already assembling there.\n\nAl Shabaab was behind the assault on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in 2013, in which 67 people were killed. They were also carried out attacks that killed about 100 people in Lamu county last year.\n\nKenya has beefed up security in Lamu county and Lamu town, a popular tourist destination where visitor numbers have dwindled over the past year. Local businesses say a dusk-to-dawn curfew has further hurt their struggling trade.\n\nThe United States often issues a warning to its citizens from traveling in the region.\n\n(Editing by Aaron Maasho and Tom Heneghan)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joseph Akwiri", "Author": "Joseph Akwiri", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Kenya plans to launch a military offensive against Islamist militants who have set up bases in a remote forest at the northern tip of its Indian Ocean coastline bordering Somalia, a police official said on Monday.", "title": "Kenya plans offensive against Islamist militants in coastal forest", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, KENYA, ATTACKS, SOMALIA", "sailthru.title": "Kenya plans offensive against Islamist militants in coastal forest", "keywords": "US,KENYA,ATTACKS,SOMALIA,Civil Unrest,Bombing (Non-Military),Conflicts / War / Peace,Defense,International / National Security,Crime / Law / Justice,Islam,Crime,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Somalia,Emerging Market Countries,Insurgencies,Government / Politics,Africa,Kenya", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;KENYA;ATTACKS;SOMALIA;Civil Unrest;Bombing (Non-Military);Conflicts / War / Peace;Defense;International / National Security;Crime / Law / Justice;Islam;Crime;Military Conflicts;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Somalia;Emerging Market Countries;Insurgencies;Government / Politics;Africa;Kenya", "WT.cg_n": "World", "sailthru.description": "Kenya plans to launch a military offensive against Islamist militants who have set up bases in a remote forest at the northern tip of its Indian Ocean coastline bordering Somalia, a police official said on Monday.", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-07T15:50:58+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;newsMaps;everything;asia;newsproHome;cfaglobal;aa48hours;africa;greenpeace;Intel;HP_Ad2one_Asia;PFG;TCS_IN;ABG_IN;CathayPacific_US;MOC_US;vbc_Tianjin_TEDA;Torrens_AU;DBS_SG", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Sep 07 15:50:58 UTC 2015", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Kenya+plans+offensive+against+Islamist+militants+in+coastal+forest", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKCN0R71S320150907", "WT.cg_s": "World", "description": "Kenya plans to launch a military offensive against Islamist militants who have set up bases in a remote forest at the northern tip of its Indian Ocean coastline bordering Somalia, a police official said on Monday.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Joseph Akwiri", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-worldNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Kenya plans to launch a military offensive against Islamist militants who have set up bases in a remote forest at the northern tip of its Indian Ocean coastline bordering Somalia, a police official said on Monday.", "title": "Kenya plans offensive against Islamist militants in coastal forest", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-attacks-somalia-idUSKCN0R71S320150907", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,KENYA,ATTACKS,SOMALIA,Civil Unrest,Bombing (Non-Military),Conflicts / War / Peace,Defense,International / National Security,Crime / Law / Justice,Islam,Crime,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Somalia,Emerging Market Countries,Insurgencies,Government / Politics,Africa,Kenya", "published_time": "2015-09-07T15:50:58+0000", "modified_time": "2015-09-07T15:50:58+0000", "author": "Joseph Akwiri"}, "type": "article"}, "DCSext.ContentID_worldNews": "USKCN0R71S320150907", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf1b\"", "article_summary": "Kenya has beefed up security in Lamu county and Lamu town, a popular tourist destination where visitor numbers have dwindled over the past year.\nMOMBASA Kenya plans to launch a military offensive against Islamist militants who have set up bases in a remote forest at the northern tip of its Indian Ocean coastline bordering Somalia, a police official said on Monday.\nThey were also carried out attacks that killed about 100 people in Lamu county last year.\n\"We want to ensure the forest is safe and that no criminals are using it as a hideout to plan evil against our people,\" Frederick Ndambuki, commissioner of Kenya's Lamu county, told Reuters.\nAl Shabaab was behind the assault on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in 2013, in which 67 people were killed."}
