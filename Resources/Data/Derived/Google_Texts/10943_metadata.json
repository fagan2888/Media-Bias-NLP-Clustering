Here\u2019s the transcript, since I know few people will have the time to watch the clip. This\u2019ll be compared endlessly to Rick Perry\u2019s speech attacking Trump two months ago but they\u2019re not all that similar apart from the target. Perry\u2019s speech was an ideological critique of \u201cTrumpism\u201d vis-a-vis conservatism; the parts about Trump were set amid much longer passages about why America needs real conservative leadership now more than ever. Perry was playing the role of a Republican statesman with a long record of success in Texas. He was purporting to excommunicate Trump from the movement.\n\nJindal\u2019s speech is nothing like that. There\u2019s little about conservatism here apart from the fact that eight years of Hopenchange and the dismal prospect of four more with President Hillary have given righties a golden opportunity next year. He\u2019s not playing the statesman either. His point is simple: It\u2019s time for someone to drop the same sort of emperor\u2019s-new-clothes truth bomb on Trump that Trump\u2019s known for dropping on others, and the truth in this case is that Trump\u2019s an egomaniac who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about on policy. He wants the presidency not because there\u2019s anything particular he wants to do with it but because that\u2019s what his ego requires. \u201c[I]t is now time for us to do what Donald would do,\u201d says Jindal, \u201cand say the thing that everyone is thinking, but is afraid to say out loud. So I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d And he does.\n\nDonald Trump is a narcissist and an egomaniac. That may sound like a serious charge to make, but it is also something that everyone knows to be true, and he knows it too, and he celebrates it. He told us the other day that he\u2019s likes Kanye West, why? \u201cBecause Kanye loves Trump.\u201d He may be an entertaining narcissist, but he is one nonetheless. Like all narcissists, Donald Trump is insecure and weak, and afraid of being exposed. And that\u2019s why he is constantly telling us how big and how rich and how great he is, and how insignificant everyone else is. We\u2019ve all met people like Trump, and we know that only a very weak and small person needs to constantly tell us how strong and powerful he is. Donald Trump believes that he is the answer to every question\u2026 The conservative cause deserves more than a power-hungry shark who eats whatever is in front of him\u2026because sooner or later, we will be his next meal.\n\nThe sharpest line: \u201c[H]e hasn\u2019t ever read the Bible. But you know why he hasn\u2019t read the Bible? Because he\u2019s not in it.\u201d What Jindal hopes to achieve with the speech, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s learned by now, I assume, that picking a fight with Trump to draw his attention doesn\u2019t lead to any movement in the polls, as Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul, and of course Perry could tell you. Maybe it\u2019s as simple as Jindal feeling sincerely disgusted by Trump and concluding he has nothing to lose by doing it. He\u2019s a long longshot as it is, barely registering in any poll apart from Iowa, where he\u2019s at three or four percent. The worst that can happen is that Trump will tweet some wisecrack about Jindal\u2019s poor polling \u2014 the alpha\u2019s favorite insult is to deride the lower status of others \u2014 and it\u2019ll blow over in a day. Who knows? Maybe Jindal\u2019s candidacy will transform into what Graham\u2019s candidacy was supposed to be with respect to Rand Paul, a platform for a guy with little chance of winning the nomination himself to hound a more credible candidate whom he regards as dangerous to the country\u2019s future.\n\nUpdate: As expected.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201c[W]e are flirting with nominating a non-serious, unstable, substance-free narcissist.\u201d", "title": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s speech: It\u2019s time for me to say what everyone else is thinking about Trump; Update: Trump responds", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/10/bobby-jindals-speech-its-time-for-me-to-say-what-everyone-else-is-thinking-about-trump/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Bobby Jindal, conservatism, Donald Trump,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-10T17:21:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-10T19:40:16+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s speech: It\u2019s time for me to say what everyone else is thinking about Trump; Update: Trump respondsposted at 1:21 pm on September 10, 2015 by AllahpunditAs promised last night.\nLike all narcissists, Donald Trump is insecure and weak, and afraid of being exposed.\n\u201c[I]t is now time for us to do what Donald would do,\u201d says Jindal, \u201cand say the thing that everyone is thinking, but is afraid to say out loud.\nDonald Trump is a narcissist and an egomaniac.\nThis\u2019ll be compared endlessly to Rick Perry\u2019s speech attacking Trump two months ago but they\u2019re not all that similar apart from the target."}
