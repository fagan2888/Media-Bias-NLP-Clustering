Sixty-five percent of East Palo Alto\u2019s population is Latino, a group seen as crucial to the success of the health law. Many lack health insurance and pose a lower financial risk because they are typically younger and healthier than others.\n\nYet California, with the greatest number of Latinos in the country, is far behind in reaching this population. And across the nation, the picture appears even worse.\n\nThose who primarily speak Spanish are largely being left out of the first wave of coverage under Obamacare. Many missed this week\u2019s deadline for enrollment in plans beginning Jan. 1.[Dec 24]. People who want to be covered for any part of 2014 must sign up by March 31.\n\nIn part, the lag in sign-ups among Spanish speakers reflects a digital \u2212 and a cultural \u2212 divide. Many are hesitant about handing over personal information to strangers over the Internet, advocates say. This group tends to be less educated, and have lower incomes and less access to technology than fluent English-speakers.\n\nWhen Elizabeth Gonzalez, 31, started getting migraines her doctor prescribed medicine that cost $300. She had health insurance provided through a San Mateo County program for low-income adults, but the medicine wasn\u2019t covered and she couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cI guess I don\u2019t need it,\u201d she remembers thinking. Then she started wondering whether the new health law might offer a better plan.\n\nGonzalez, a part-time library aide, started hunting for resources to help her decipher the Affordable Care Act. Though a Los Angeles native, she was raised in Morelia, Mexico and preferred to have the law explained to her in Spanish.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s health insurance marketplace, Covered California, has had a functioning Spanish-language website since Oct. 1 \u2013 which puts it ahead of most of the rest of the country. But Gonzalez couldn\u2019t access the site from home because she doesn\u2019t have Internet service or a smartphone.\n\n\u201cWith my budget, I don\u2019t have access to that,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI have to limit myself to the primordial.\u201d\n\nInstead, she relied on staff at the county\u2019s human services office, two floors up from the library where she works, to guide her.\n\nStaff members there told her she needed to fill out an application and to wait for up to a month to hear whether she was eligible for Medi-Cal \u2212 California\u2019s insurance program for the poor. Discouraged, she made repeated telephone calls to the hotline for Covered California.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one picking up, probably because there\u2019s not enough people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more information in poor communities and places to help you fill out forms so you know you\u2019re doing it correctly. There\u2019s not enough [information] in Spanish.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest data released by the state, less than 5 percent of California\u2019s roughly 110,000 signups in October and November were completed in Spanish.\n\nStatewide, Spanish-speaking operators at Covered California call centers, as well as navigators who can walk people through enrollment, are in short supply. The section on the Spanish version of Covered California for requesting help with enrollment still links to an English website.\n\nIn other parts of the country, Spanish speakers are worse off.\n\nIn the 36 states that rely on the federally run insurance exchanges, including Texas and Florida, Latinos until recently couldn\u2019t enroll online in Spanish. CuidadoDeSalud.gov \u2212 the Spanish-friendly version of the federal marketplace \u2212 wasn\u2019t fully working until Dec. 6, more than two months after its English counterpart, HealthCare.gov, launched on Oct. 1.\n\nOfficials decided to hold off opening enrollment on CuidadoDeSalud.gov until they addressed the technical glitches plaguing the English version. Even now, the Spanish website is rife with grammatical errors.\n\nFederal officials note they have bilingual call centers, but Spanish-only calls to the federal exchange\u2019s call centers barely totaled 180,000, or the equivalent of 3.5 percent of all calls, as of Dec. 10.\n\nUnlike English speakers, Latinos who speak Spanish still don\u2019t have the option to window-shop for plans before creating an account. The section in which customers can consult plans before signing up with a username and password is still non-existent in Spanish.\n\nWith many Latinos missing the deadline to be enrolled for coverage in the new marketplaces on Jan. 1, community organizers have shifted their attention to March 31, when the enrollment period for 2014 officially closes. Consumers who don\u2019t enroll by this date will face a penalty. Medi-Cal enrollment will remain open, however.\n\n\u201cMost of our community is going to be focused on that March 31 deadline, and that\u2019s where the big push will be,\u201d Jane Delgado, the president and CEO of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, an advocacy group based in Washington D.C., said earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m less concerned about getting everybody enrolled quickly than about getting people enrolled in plans that fit their needs. I have no doubt people will enroll. They just need better information and local navigators they can trust.\u201d\n\nAdding to their worries, Latinos living in households with undocumented relatives often fear that signing up for a government run program will lead to unwanted scrutiny and even deportations. Others are wary of getting cheated or having their personal information hacked online.\n\nMindful of the mistrust, Ravenswood has been careful to develop a bond with its patients.\n\nThe clinic has eight certified enrollment counselors to help clients determine what kind of insurance they need and can afford.\n\n\u201cThe majority of people coming in are people who we have to help 100 percent. We\u2019re both translating and explaining everything, even when they do speak English,\u201d said Ravenswood CEO Luisa Buada. \u201cIn general, everyone really, really wants someone to hold their hand through the whole process.\u201d\n\nMaria Garcia, 51, is among the roughly 200 people Ravenswood has screened or enrolled since October 1. Garcia, whose husband supports the family with his manufacturing job, went for help in part because she was concerned about fraud.\n\n\u201cLatinos \u2212 we don\u2019t trust easily,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be sure this wasn\u2019t a scam.\u201d\n\nGarcia doesn\u2019t speak English and though she has a computer at home, \u201cI haven\u2019t learned to use it,\u201d she said. She generally relies on her children to search the Web for her and to translate the information she needs.\n\nThis time, the staff at Ravenswood helped her. Starting in January, she\u2019ll be paying $36 a month for\n\ncoverage for her and her husband thanks to a government subsidy.\n\nAfter her discouraging experiences with the county office and the various hotlines, Gonzalez ended up at Ravenswood as well. It was just across the street from the library. Staffers quickly told her she qualified for Medi-Cal. Her migraine medication will now be covered.\n\n\u201cI was happy,\u201d she said.\n\nRavenswood\u2019s counselors are booked solid through the end of January. Buada and her staff have set up six enclosed booths, each with a small table, a chair, a Lenovo computer and a wrap-around black-and-white curtain, so that people who don\u2019t have a computer or Internet access at home can feel comfortable coming in.\n\n\u201cWe are very good with cellphones or email, but to use that website, you actually have to have access to a computer. That\u2019s a problem,\u201d said the National Alliance for Hispanic Health\u2019s Jane Delgado.\n\nEven with the possibility of federal subsidies, some Latinos can\u2019t afford coverage and will remain uninsured.\n\nThe median income for an East Palo Alto household is roughly $50,000, compared to a median income in the county of nearly $90,000. (On average, East Palo Alto households consist of four people compared to three countywide.) Often, 75 percent to 80 percent of a poor family\u2019s income is spent on housing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people come in interested,\u201d Buada says. But when they see how much it\u2019s going to cost, \u201cthey say, \u2018I can\u2019t pay for this,\u2019 and leave.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. \u2212 In Silicon Valley, the executives and engineers who\u2019ve helped build the Apple, Google and Facebook empires earn high salaries and enjoy a slew of perks, including stellar health benefits.

Gonzalez, a part-time library aide, started hunting for resources to help her decipher the Affordable Care Act. Though a Los Angeles native, she was raised in Morelia, Mexico and\u00a0 preferred to have the law explained to her in Spanish. California\u2019s health insurance marketplace, Covered California, has had a functioning Spanish-language website since Oct. 1 \u2013 which puts it ahead of most of the rest of the country. But Gonzalez couldn\u2019t access the site from home because she doesn\u2019t have Internet service or a smartphone. \u201cWith my budget, I don\u2019t have access to that,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI have to limit myself to the primordial.\u201d Instead, she relied on staff at the county\u2019s human services office, two floors up from the library where she works, to guide her. Staff members there told her she needed to fill out an application and to wait for up to a month to hear whether she was eligible for Medi-Cal \u2212 California\u2019s insurance program for the poor. Discouraged, she made repeated telephone calls to the hotline for Covered California. \u201cThere\u2019s no one picking up, probably because there\u2019s not enough people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more information in poor communities and places to help you fill out forms so you know you\u2019re doing it correctly. There\u2019s not enough [information] in Spanish.\u201d According to the latest data released by the state, less than 5 percent of California\u2019s roughly 110,000 signups in October and November were completed in Spanish. Statewide, Spanish-speaking operators at Covered California call centers, as well as navigators who can walk people through enrollment, are in short supply. The section on the Spanish version of Covered California for requesting help with enrollment still links to an English website. In other parts of the country, Spanish speakers are worse off. In the 36 states that rely on the federally run insurance exchanges, including Texas and Florida, Latinos until recently couldn\u2019t enroll online in Spanish. CuidadoDeSalud.gov \u2212 the Spanish-friendly version of the federal marketplace \u2212 wasn\u2019t fully working until Dec. 6, more than two months after its English counterpart, HealthCare.gov, launched on Oct. 1. Officials decided to hold off opening enrollment on CuidadoDeSalud.gov until they addressed the technical glitches plaguing the English version. Even now, the Spanish website is rife with grammatical errors. Federal officials note they have bilingual call centers, but Spanish-only calls to the federal exchange\u2019s call centers barely totaled 180,000, or the equivalent of 3.5 percent of all calls, as of Dec. 10. Unlike English speakers, Latinos who speak Spanish still don\u2019t have the option to window-shop for plans before creating an account. The section in which customers can consult plans before signing up with a username and password is still non-existent in Spanish. With many Latinos missing the deadline to be enrolled for coverage in the new marketplaces on Jan. 1, community organizers have shifted their attention to March 31, when the enrollment period for 2014 officially closes. Consumers who don\u2019t enroll by this date will face a penalty. Medi-Cal enrollment will remain open, however. \u201cMost of our community is going to be focused on that March 31 deadline, and that\u2019s where the big push will be,\u201d Jane Delgado, the president and CEO of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, an advocacy group based in Washington D.C., said earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m less concerned about getting everybody enrolled quickly than about getting people enrolled in plans that fit their needs. I have no doubt people will enroll. They just need better information and local navigators they can trust.\u201d Adding to their worries, Latinos living in households with undocumented relatives often fear that signing up for a government run program will lead to unwanted scrutiny and even deportations. Others are wary of getting cheated or having their personal information hacked online. Mindful of the mistrust, Ravenswood has been careful to develop a bond with its patients. The clinic has eight certified enrollment counselors to help clients determine what kind of insurance they need and can afford. \u201cThe majority of people coming in are people who we have to help 100 percent. We\u2019re both translating and explaining everything, even when they do speak English,\u201d said Ravenswood CEO Luisa Buada. \u201cIn general, everyone really, really wants someone to hold their hand through the whole process.\u201d Maria Garcia, 51, is among the roughly 200 people Ravenswood has screened or enrolled since October 1. Garcia, whose husband supports the family with his manufacturing job, went for help in part because she was concerned about fraud. \u201cLatinos \u2212 we don\u2019t trust easily,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be sure this wasn\u2019t a scam.\u201d Garcia doesn\u2019t speak English and though she has a computer at home, \u201cI haven\u2019t learned to use it,\u201d she said. She generally relies on her children to search the Web for her and to translate the information she needs. This time, the staff at Ravenswood helped her.\u00a0 Starting in January, she\u2019ll be paying $36 a month for coverage for her and her husband thanks to a government subsidy. After her discouraging experiences with the county office and the various hotlines, Gonzalez ended up at Ravenswood as well. It was just across the street from the library. Staffers quickly told her she qualified for Medi-Cal. Her migraine medication will now be covered. \u201cI was happy,\u201d she said. Ravenswood\u2019s counselors are booked solid through the end of January. Buada and her staff have set up six enclosed booths, each with a small table, a chair, a Lenovo computer and a wrap-around black-and-white curtain, so that people who don\u2019t have a computer or Internet access at home can feel comfortable coming in. \u201cWe are very good with cellphones or email, but to use that website, you actually have to have access to a computer. That\u2019s a problem,\u201d said the National Alliance for Hispanic Health\u2019s Jane Delgado. Even with the possibility of federal subsidies, some Latinos can\u2019t afford coverage and will remain uninsured. The median income for an East Palo Alto household is roughly $50,000, compared to a median income in the county of nearly $90,000. (On average, East Palo Alto households consist of four people compared to three countywide.) Often, 75 percent to 80 percent of a poor family\u2019s income is spent on housing. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people come in interested,\u201d Buada says. But when they see how much it\u2019s going to cost, \u201cthey say, \u2018I can\u2019t pay for this,\u2019 and leave.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "No bueno: Many Spanish speakers in America left behind in first wave of Obamacare - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,health insurance exchange, obamacare, Silicon Valley, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Silicon Valley", "published_time": "2014-01-03T05:33:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-12T11:47:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Many lack health insurance and pose a lower financial risk because they are typically younger and healthier than others.\nThose who primarily speak Spanish are largely being left out of the first wave of coverage under Obamacare.\nUnlike English speakers, Latinos who speak Spanish still don\u2019t have the option to window-shop for plans before creating an account.\nShe had health insurance provided through a San Mateo County program for low-income adults, but the medicine wasn\u2019t covered and she couldn\u2019t afford it.\nCalifornia\u2019s health insurance marketplace, Covered California, has had a functioning Spanish-language website since Oct. 1 \u2013 which puts it ahead of most of the rest of the country."}
