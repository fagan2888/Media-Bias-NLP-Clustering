Cops in Inkster, Michigan, were trawling an area believed by them to host drug activity when they say they saw Floyd Dent fail to make a full stop at a stop sign. That’s when they sprung into action, pulling him over and eventually pulling the man out of his car and pummeling him before charging him with fleeing police, resisting arrest, and possession of cocaine.

The incident was caught on tape, leading a judge to dismiss the fleeing police and resisting arrest charges. Watch it below, via Local 4:

The 57-year-old Dent has no prior criminal record and rejected a deal that would see him serve no jail time and have his record expunged in six months because he says he wasn’t in the possession of any drugs when he was arrested. Up to 10 police officers were involved in Dent’s arrest. At least one was previously charged with planting evidence and falsifying reports. He beat the rap and got to stay in law enforcement, because why would police departments try to accurately gauge the risk of hiring a new employee based on their work history when it’s the city’s taxpayers, not the departments themselves, that end up liable for anything that happens?
