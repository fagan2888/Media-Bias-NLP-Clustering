It requires political savvy, message discipline, and tenacious fundraising,\" the organization's mission statement says.\n\nThe filing papers also list Timothy Koch as the organization's treasurer. He pronounces his name differently than the Koch brothers and isn't related to them. He didn't return a call or email seeking comment.\n\nPhilp is a former staffer at the Republican National Committee and is the former president of Citizens for Sound Government, which the Washington Post reported spent more than $1 million in gubernatorial races in Connecticut and Nebraska in recent years.\n\nIn 2014, the group got involved in a GOP congressional primary, spending $45,000 and running one ad against a state senator looking to move up, alleging that he was \"not conservative,\" the Post wrote.\n\nThe Bluegrass Action Fund is organized as an unauthorized campaign committee and, according to its filing papers, plans to advocate for a candidate or candidates in an election but doesn't identify any. The filing says the organization will have ongoing activity in the state.\n\nThe group plans to raise money primarily in Kentucky but won't disclose donors.\n\nSources said the group expects to spend \"well into six figures\" but hasn't decided on its budget. It has hired McCarthy, Henning, Whalen Inc., U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell's media consultant, to make television ads.\n\nThe group is yet to report how much money it has raised but such an organization could be a boon to Heiner.\n\nHeiner already has put more than $4.2 million of his own money into the race and has carved out a lead in recent independent polls over state Agriculture Commissioner James Comer, Louisville businessman Matt Bevin and former Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott.\n\nIt would be especially helpful if the group attacks Heiner's opponents as Philp's has done in other states, allowing Heiner to spend his millions burnishing his own image rather than tearing down others. The group, however, will wait to see the race develop before deciding the content of its ads.\n\nThe group is likely to begin advertising early next month, sources say.\n\nMeanwhile, the pro-Comer PAC is up and running.\n\nKentuckians for Growth, Opportunity and Prosperity has begun airing the ad on radio. The group has bought about $22,000 in airtime in Bowling Green, Owensboro, Evansville, and Somerset over the next three weeks.\n\nKathryn Breiwa, who is running the organization, said the group plans to help Comer throughout the election but would give few details.\n\n\"Kentuckians for Growth, Opportunity and Prosperity believes James Comer is the best candidate for governor,\" she said in an interview. \"We feel we have a responsibility to let Kentuckians know of his experience and qualifications before the state votes on May 19.\"\n\nThe group's chairman is listed as Richard Knock, a Union businessman who founded AmeriGOP, another political action committee that focuses on conservative issues.\n\nBreiwa refused to say how much the organization plans to raise or where.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1bCR263", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "PAC backing Republican Hal Heiner has ties to the billionaire Koch brothers", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "PAC backing Republican Hal Heiner has ties to the billionaire Koch brothers", "title": "Koch brothers-related PAC in Kentucky gov race", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/03/27/pacs-james-comer-hal-heiner-set-go-kentucky-governors-race/70557638/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "PAC backing Republican Hal Heiner has ties to the billionaire Koch brothers", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db3a376a8888472d2f582e037e4f71b55ac4cf9f/c=250-0-1950-1700&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/27/B9316766630Z.1_20150327191144_000_G2MABIB59.1-0.jpg", "title": "Koch brothers-related PAC in Kentucky gov race", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Charles Koch", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Charles Koch", "title": "Koch brothers-related PAC in Kentucky gov race", "author": "Joseph Gerth", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f72adbd24b01ed4d94b593a04272924802d8497/c=462-0-1737-1700/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/27/B9316766630Z.1_20150327191144_000_G2MABIB59.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1da40e31d78bd8755819973767cdc0043fe851a2/c=250-0-1950-1700/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/27/B9316766630Z.1_20150327191144_000_G2MABIB59.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c2abf4dcb92cbc5c581eb1720ea9e1e9f4b7e3f5/c=0-25-2200-1675/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/27/B9316766630Z.1_20150327191144_000_G2MABIB59.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/61b58ef645220483831e10898fdf78470360b38f/c=0-231-2200-1469&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/27/B9316766630Z.1_20150327191144_000_G2MABIB59.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-03-28T11:48:13.597000-04:00", "shorthed": "Koch brothers-related PAC in Kentucky gov race", "articleid": 70557638, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b5d860397df160c91f059c712d89489d8373e5d/c=0-231-2200-1469/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/27/B9316766630Z.1_20150327191144_000_G2MABIB59.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b8206f94e9b5f0f82205c4c59fdc37cffd1cda8/c=622-0-1578-1700/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/27/B9316766630Z.1_20150327191144_000_G2MABIB59.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "James Comer, Hal Heiner, Joseph Gerth, Joe Gerth, Will T.
