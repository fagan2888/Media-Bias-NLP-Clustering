I am also genuinely grateful to him for changing the debate on immigration and starting a conversation about Muslim immigration that we should have had a long time ago. I don\u2019t believe a ban on Muslim immigrants would ever pass Congress nor do I think it\u2019s practical (How would you realistically implement it?), but I do think blocking future refugees and immigrants from countries where Al-Qaeda and ISIS hold sway is more doable because of Trump. That\u2019s a little ironic because he was initially in favor of bringing in Syrian refugees, but it\u2019s true. Additionally, after years of being ignored, scorned and poorly represented by Republican leaders in Congress, it\u2019s nice to have a politician who actually goes overboard to pander to conservatives.\n\nAdditionally, I find it OFFENSIVE when Trump is called a fascist or people attack his supporters. At the end of the day, to beat Trump you have to convince his supporters to go elsewhere. You don\u2019t do that by insulting people for their choice of candidates.\n\nThat being said, the support for Trump reminds me of an old Jeff Foxworthy joke that went something like this.\n\nKid: Look up in the sky, mama, it's a plane! It\u2019s a plane!\n\nMother: Oh, look, he knows that! He's just so smart, isn't he?\n\nJeff Foxworthy: Smart? He's 12 years old!\n\nWhen you have genuine affection for someone, it\u2019s easy to block out his faults. In Trump\u2019s case, this is being taken to such an extreme that it\u2019s starting to feel like we\u2019re in Jonestown a few days before the Kool-Aid is handed out. Tell me I\u2019m wrong if you like, but even Trump made reference to that when he said,\n\n\u201cAnd you know what else they say about my people? The polls! They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that? Where I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nSince when do conservatives engage in this type of blind loyalty towards ANY politician?\n\nSimilarly, Donald Trump talks incessantly about polls that are favorable to him, but the polls have also consistently shown that he loses to Hillary Clinton. Worse yet, his favorable/unfavorable ratings are 33/58. That\u2019s the same as Jimmy Carter in early 1980. It\u2019s WORSE than Walter Mondale. Trump even has a higher unfavorable rating with the general public than Nixon AFTER Watergate. It would be easier to rehabilitate Enron\u2019s image than to make Trump President with those poll numbers.\n\nSaying that a candidate with those poll numbers couldn\u2019t win an election without a miracle is something that anyone who knows something about elections would normally agree on. Yet, with Trump, many people seem unfazed. Basically, they think he\u2019s going to use some kind of \u201cTrump magic\u201d that will guarantee a victory.\n\nThe problem with that is that successful though Donald Trump may be, he fails all the time. He\u2019s had four bankruptcies. Then there\u2019s Trump steaks, Trump Vodka, Trump the Game, Trump Magazine, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airlines, Trump University, Trump Casinos, the New Jersey Generals and happily, he also lost a lawsuit and was unable to take a widow\u2019s home via eminent domain so he could build a limo parking lot. Trump has been a successful businessman, but an awful lot of investors who put money into his ill-advised projects because they just assumed he\u2019d find a way to win have gotten burned doing business deals with him. Again, barring a miracle, that\u2019s what would happen to all of his supporters if he becomes the GOP nominee in 2016. Many of them don\u2019t see it for the same reason Ron Paul\u2019s fans couldn\u2019t see it in 2012. Sure, Paul had a diehard following that voted for him in Internet polls and showed up at his events, but he alienated too many people to ever win a general election while he was building up his fanbase. Trump has done the same thing, except a little bigger and better.\n\nGetting beyond that, early on, I was willing to give Trump an opportunity to flesh out his policies and prove he\u2019s a conservative. Unfortunately, he never did that and there\u2019s little reason to think that a man who has switched political parties 5 times in his life and has never voted in a Republican primary suddenly became a diehard conservative in his mid-sixties. People who wouldn\u2019t buy this from any other politician are swallowing it hook, line and sinker with Trump even though his positions on some issues have switched from week-to-week.\n\nKeep in mind that the most consistent political position Donald Trump seems to have held over the last 15 years is that we need a full government takeover in healthcare, which incidentally, would be WORSE than Obamacare. Trump was still pushing that less than six months ago, but now says he supports a free market plan. Do you believe him? If so, why?\n\nIn 2013, Ted Cruz was leading the fight against Marco Rubio\u2019s gang-of-8 amnesty bill while Trump was talking up amnesty, the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform. Nobody with half a brain in his head would believe any other politician claiming to be tough on immigration if he was fighting for amnesty three years ago. So, why believe Trump?\n\nAfter having read several of his books, I can tell you that Trump has core principles that he believes in personally and in business, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with politics. Since Trump is first and foremost a dealmaker, what makes you think you\u2019d like the deals someone who doesn\u2019t share your principles would cut on your behalf any more than you liked the deals John Boehner made? What makes you think Trump would be any different than another celebrity like Arnold Schwarzenegger who talked a good game and then ended up governing from the left-of-center once he was in office?\n\nAlso, as entertaining and successful as Trump may be, he doesn\u2019t have the right temperament to be President. It\u2019s a serious, sober job and even if you like him, you have to admit that he\u2019s crude, mean-spirited, narcissistic, unpredictable and conspiratorial. Would you consider any other candidate who trashed POWs, \u201cI like people that weren't captured,\u201d made fun of the disabled (He\u2019s done this more than once), said he never asked God for forgiveness and keeps making creepy comments about how he\u2019d like to date his daughter, \"(Ivanka) does have a very nice figure. I\u2019ve said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her?\" Even if you\u2019re willing to overlook those comments because you love Trump so much, people who aren\u2019t Trump fans will not give him a pass. That will be doubly true after the Democrats hammer him with a billion dollars\u2019 worth of negative ads that he won\u2019t be able to effectively respond to because even Trump admits that he doesn\u2019t know how he would finance his campaign in a general election.\n\nTrump also spends an inordinate amount of time insulting people on Twitter. It amazes me that anyone complains about people hammering Trump when these are just some of the comments on his Twitter account over the last three days\u2026.\n\n\"@Rketeltas: Rubio isn't experienced enough to be Commander in Chief.

The American people have Trump!\"\n\n\"@WhiteGenocideTM: @realDonaldTrump Poor Jeb. I could've sworn I saw him outside Trump Tower the other day! \"\n\nTrump wants to be the GOP nominee, but he sounds like one of the mean kids running for third grade class President.\n\nIncidentally, the last tweet is from a white supremacist who spends a lot of time raving about Hitler and \u201cJewmerica.\u201d Despite the fact there were numerous articles criticizing Trump for retweeting a white power nut, he did not take down the tweet. If, let\u2019s say, you\u2019re black or Jewish, ask yourself how comfortable you are with Trump now that he\u2019s knowingly retweeting white supremacists?\n\nLook at all of this and tell me that you trust someone who is this petty, immature and erratic with the responsibility of handling the IRS, the DOJ, the DHS, our military and our nuclear codes. I certainly wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s fine to say that you don\u2019t trust Sanders or Hillary either, but if even many Republicans don\u2019t think he\u2019s together enough to handle it, why would the American people?\n\nIt\u2019s great to be supporting a candidate who you believe is winning, but I think back to the saying, \u201cPlay stupid games, get stupid prizes.\u201d The prize for getting Trump to the finish line as our nominee would be losing to whomever the Democrats nominate and then watching helplessly as Obamacare stays in place, all of Obama\u2019s executive orders stand and the Democrats pick four more Supreme Court Justices.\n\nIf we nominate Trump, we\u2019ll have our third straight lose/lose election where most conservatives will have a candidate who doesn\u2019t truly represent their views as the GOP nominee. Of course, if Trump is our nominee, I will vote for him and I will try to do what I can to help him win, but it would be easier to ski uphill than to get a wildly unpopular Rockefeller Republican like Trump into the White House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I understand why people like Donald Trump because I was a big fan of his as well..05/27/2016 3:26:09AM EST.", "author": "John Hawkins", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "I understand why people like Donald Trump because I was a big fan of his as well.", "title": "Why This Former Trump Fan Doesn\u2019t Support Him Anymore", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2016/01/26/why-this-former-trump-fan-doesnt-support-him-anymore-n2109815", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/23/0a0f0f5b-f1b5-4a46-a4e2-e072ef1020a8.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "I understand why people like Donald Trump because I was a big fan of his as well.", "title": "Why This Former Trump Fan Doesn\u2019t Support Him Anymore", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2016/01/26/why-this-former-trump-fan-doesnt-support-him-anymore-n2109815", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/23/0a0f0f5b-f1b5-4a46-a4e2-e072ef1020a8.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Why This Former Trump Fan Doesn\u2019t Support Him Anymore, John Hawkins, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Then there\u2019s Trump steaks, Trump Vodka, Trump the Game, Trump Magazine, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airlines, Trump University, Trump Casinos, the New Jersey Generals and happily, he also lost a lawsuit and was unable to take a widow\u2019s home via eminent domain so he could build a limo parking lot.\nSo, why believe Trump?\nBasically, they think he\u2019s going to use some kind of \u201cTrump magic\u201d that will guarantee a victory.\nAlso, as entertaining and successful as Trump may be, he doesn\u2019t have the right temperament to be President.\nThat being said, the support for Trump reminds me of an old Jeff Foxworthy joke that went something like this."}
