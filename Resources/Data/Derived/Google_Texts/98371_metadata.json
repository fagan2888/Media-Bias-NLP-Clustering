But not before once again detailing for another foreign audience some of the numerous things wrong with his country.\n\n\u201cThe United States has to have some humility,\u201d said the aloof one, \u201cbecause there have been times where we did the wrong thing. There have been times where we have problems in our own country. And so we will want to go tell other people what to do, but then back home we\u2019re not always doing what we say we should do.\u201d\n\nYes, he was unclear. But Obama had no teleprompter to feed him replies during that Malaysian town-hall with young people.\n\nThe Democrat who\u2019s presided over the slowest economic recovery in 70 years told students that thanks to his leadership, the U.S. economy \u201chas recovered faster than almost any other country\u201d since 2008.\n\nObama said due to his legislative initiative, millions of Americans willing to pay soaring premiums now have access to healthcare; he called it the Affordable Care Act. Apparently Obama didn\u2019t have time to go into the law\u2019s widespread unpopularity, court challenges and collapsing finances.\n\nObama informed these future Asian leaders that his country has several major problems. \u201cNumber One, in the United States, there is a growing inequality that I think is a real problem,\u201d said the man whose policies have produced ongoing wage stagnation, record numbers of Americans squeezed from the workforce and the greatest increase in economic inequality in decades.\n\nObama listed \u201cpitfalls\u201d to avoid in country-building. \u201cI would say, Number One,\u201d (Yes, yes, two Number Ones, but we told you he had no teleprompter), \u201cit is very important to avoid any political system where money overwhelms ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen politicians have to raise so much money all the time, then they\n\nstart listening a little bit more to the people who have money, as\n\nopposed to ordinary people,\u201d said the man who raised and spent more than a billion dollars of other people\u2019s money \u2014 two times \u2014 to become president. And he\u2019s still doing it, despite an inability to run again.\n\nObama also bemoaned the American political process, saying it\u2019s become \u201cso expensive and it lasts so long.\u201d This from the impatient freshman senator who announced his first presidential candidacy fully 21 months before the election, compared to Bill Clinton\u2019s 13 months and John F. Kennedy\u2019s 11 months.\n\nAlso, \u201cpolitics in the United States increasingly is defined by personal attacks and saying very sensational things in the media,\u201d said the president who\u2019s likened political opponents to Nazis and suggested Mitt Romney causes cancer.\n\nThen there\u2019s race, always on Obama\u2019s mind. \u201cHistorically, in the United States, the issue of race has been very prominent\u2026We\u2019ve struggled with this for over 200 years, but it\u2019s still an issue that comes up.\u201d\n\nAlthough Obama neglected to point out that those same Americans allegedly struggling so hard with race felt comfortable enough about that nagging old issue to elect him as the first black to hold the nation\u2019s highest office in more than two centuries \u2014 two times.\n\nObama offered the young people two \u2014 no, three \u2014 more pieces of advice. First, leaders must learn to prioritize. In Obama\u2019s case, for instance, the biggest national security threat clearly is global warming, not some ragtag army of terrorists.\n\nSecond, he said, a good leader must learn to delegate. That\u2019s easier for him because, Obama claimed modestly, \u201cI\u2019m good at surrounding myself with really smart people.\u201d For example, Joe Biden.\n\nObama\u2019s third \u2014 and perhaps most important \u2014 bit of advice to young Asians was the constant need in life for tough self-evaluation.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to be honest in evaluating what\u2019s worked and what doesn\u2019t work, and make adjustments\u2026. Sometimes you just have to realize, you know what, this path didn\u2019t work. We\u2019ve got to try something different. And so you have to be honest and constantly reevaluate and reassess what you\u2019re doing. And be open, then, to new information and criticism.\u201d\n\nLike, say, al Qaeda being on the run. Giving away the farm in the Iran nuclear deal. ObamaCare being a huge success. And the war against ISIS going so well.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe incredible shrinking president\n\nThank you, President Obama, for all you\u2019ve done to Democrats\n\nA-10 combat pilot urges \u2018coherent, aggressive\u2019 anti-ISIS strategy", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama returned from a nine-day, round-the-world tour early this morning.
