The father of a 2-year-old girl identified almost three months after her remains were found on a Boston-area beach says he doesn't believe the toddler's mother caused her death.

Joseph Amoroso says 40-year-old Rachelle Bond told him her boyfriend, 35-year-old Michael McCarthy, fatally injured Bella Bond. Amoroso told WHDH-TV and the Boston Herald he believes Rachelle Bond.

McCarthy is charged with murder and Bond as an accessory after the fact. Neither could be reached for comment. They are to be arraigned Monday.

Amoroso told WHDH-TV that Bond "would never, ever do anything to hurt anybody." The Associated Press could not locate a phone listing for Amoroso.

A composite image of the unidentified girl was viewed by millions before authorities released her name Friday.

Massachusetts officials have identified the little girl whose body was found in a trash bag earlier this summer as Bella Bond.

The body found on June 25 in Boston had been known as "Baby Doe" during an intense campaign to learn her identity. Her body was found by a woman walking her dog on a Boston Harbor beach.

House Speaker Robert DeLeo says it appears the girl's mother and her boyfriend are "sort of blaming each other in terms of who harmed the child." He says the boyfriend is hospitalized with drug issues, and that the case is before a grand jury.

Gov. Charlie Baker says the state's child protection agency was involved with the girl's family for several months in 2013, but the case was closed.

The discovery of the body sparked a massive social media campaign. Within two weeks, a composite image of the chubby-cheeked, brown-eyed girl had reached an estimated 47 million people on Facebook.
