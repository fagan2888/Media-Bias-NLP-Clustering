But what kind of message does it send to the world when we have such a rudderless bunch of idiots in government?\u201d Martinez said on CNN.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how angry I am. It\u2019s just awful, and no parent should have to go through this.\u201d\n\nElliot Rodger, 22, the son of a Hollywood director, fatally stabbed three people in his apartment before shooting three people dead near the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nHe then shot himself. All of those killed were students at the school.\n\nMichael-Martinez, described by his father as articulate and tough, was shot inside a deli. He was the last in the killing spree to die.\n\nMartinez said his son died because Congress had failed to act after a mentally ill gunman killed 26 people in December 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\n\u201cThese people are getting rich sitting in Congress. And what do they do? They don\u2019t take care of our kids,\u201d he said.\n\nLegislation after Sandy Hook to extend background checks for gun sales, ban assault weapons and limit magazines\u2019 capacities failed to clear the Senate in April 2013. Gun-rights advocates strongly opposed the measures.\n\nClasses canceled\n\nThe University of California at Santa Barbara, which is headed into its final exams, canceled classes on Tuesday for a day of mourning and reflection. It scheduled a memorial service for Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday we will remember and honor the victims of this horrible event, and come together as an academic community to reflect, talk with each other, and think about the future,\u201d Chancellor Henry Yang and interim Executive Vice Chancellor Joel Michaelsen said in a statement on the school\u2019s website.\n\nThe university also has set up counseling services and emergency housing for displaced students.\n\nAbout 200 people attended a memorial service late on Sunday at St. Mark\u2019s University Parish, pausing in front of poster boards dedicated to three of the dead, Veronika Weiss, Katie Cooper and Michael-Martinez.\n\nRodger killed two women and four men, aged 19 to 22, and wounded 13 people, including eight whom he shot as he sped through town in his black BMW, exchanging fire with police, authorities said.\n\nMinutes before opening fire, Rodger emailed his plans to some 30 people, including his mother, father and former teachers, said Cathleen Bloeser, whose son was a childhood friend of the shooter and received a copy.\n\nRodger stated his intention to kill his housemates, lure others to his home to continue the mayhem, slaughter women in a sorority and bring his spree to the streets of Isla Vista.\n\nFamily friend Simon Astaire told Reuters that Rodger\u2019s mother, Chin, received a phone call on the night of the shooting from his therapist alerting her to the manifesto. She called police and her ex-husband, Peter Rodger, and the two raced to Isla Vista, Astaire said.\n\nChin heard radio reports about the shootings as she drove.\n\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said that Rodger was seen by a variety of healthcare professionals and it was \u201cvery, very apparent he was severely mentally disturbed.\u201d\n\nBrown said his department had been in contact with Rodger three times. They included a welfare check at the request of his family in which deputies found him to be polite and courteous and not appearing to meet criteria for involuntarily incarceration.\n\nAstaire said Rodger had seen therapists off and on since he was 9.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times published portions of Rodger\u2019s roughly 140-page manifesto in which he detailed his fear that police would foil his plot when they visited him last month.\n\n\u201cI had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it,\u201d Rodger wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif. \u2014 With a California town grieving the deaths of six college students killed by a mentally ill man, one victim\u2019s father on Monday blamed the killings on politicians who failed to tighten gun laws after a mass school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.
