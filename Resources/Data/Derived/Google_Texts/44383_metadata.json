The banner the Conservative tags falls under is not so much a philosophy as an attitude. There is no single set of policies that are universally regarded as conservative.\n\nThe meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus, conservatives from different parts of the world uphold their respective traditions and may disagree on a wide range of issues.\n\nWho among us is a perfect human being? Better yet, who can spin it to their advantage that \u201cthey \u2013 not you\u201d are the truest of true conservatives? You can try to spin it however you want, he did this, or she didn\u2019t do that. She voted against that, he voted for that.\n\nAn all time favorite is \u201cHe or She is the closest thing we have to a true conservative\u201d Really?\n\nREAD ALSO: Eric Cantor, John Boehner and the House GOP Rebellion\n\n\n\nThe content of your character speaks volumes about who you truly are. Where do your motives lie and what is your driving force? It doesn\u2019t make your fight any more \u201cconservative\u201d than the next person claiming it.\n\nAre you a birther? Pro-Lifer? Gun clinger? Bible toter? Does it really have to come to blows on what is the most important? So, Joe Conservative doesn\u2019t jump on the birther bandwagon, you throw him under the bus.\n\nYou have a degree in Constitutional Law and now you\u2019re the self proclaimed \u201cthink tank\u201d for every representative in the United States. Your presidential candidate wasn\u2019t chosen and now you\u2019re on a personal mission to lash out at anyone who speaks against them running again in 2016?\u2019\n\nThe hate never ends. It is live and in our faces. The democrats never change their message. We Conservatives have too many chiefs , too many banners, too many self-appointed know it all\u2019s. Too many personal agendas and not enough people to stand together and take back our Republic.\n\nThe fight for our beloved Conservatism is vital to preserve our country for the next generation. But to do that, Conservatives need to recognize the my conservatism may not be exactly yours. GOP politicans need to recognize, before they speak, that what the stand to say, and that is picked up by news and social media, many not be the message that best represents an undefined Conservative message.\n\nREAD ALSO: GOP vs. GOP \u2013 The fight for the soul of the Republican Party\n\n\n\nAnd defining that message \u2013 the overall position of the GOP that does not pit one patriot against another \u2013 needs to be an immediate goal for the GOP. Say what you will about the Democrats, but you don\u2019t find them arguing over social issues like Marriage Equality, immigration, and abortion.\n\nThey don\u2019t have one politican, like Todd Akin, standing up with their personal social viewspoints that become viral sound bytes of derision for the party.\n\nOur main goal is the same. We have to stop the counter-productivity and gear up for the remainder of the 2014 elections and the next presidential election in 2016. No one is asking you to give up your personal stand, but there is too much at stake for things to continue down the road in opposite directions. Be the grown up.\n\nREAD ALSO: 2014 Elections: Three things the GOP must do to win\n\n\n\nStand up for the party, speak for the GOP and stop waterboarding the message. But first that message needs to be defined. Because if we don\u2019t know ourselves, how can we battle our opponent?", "article_metadata": {"description": "conservatives from different parts of the world uphold their respective traditions and may disagree on a wide range of issues.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Tanya Grimsley", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Conservatives from different parts of the world uphold their respective traditions and may disagree on a wide range of issues.", "title": "What does Conservative mean to you?
