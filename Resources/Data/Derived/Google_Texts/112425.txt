SAN BERNARDINO >> Darryl VandenBosch, who has been a top executive at St. Bernardine Medical Center, has been named the hospital’s president, officials said Friday.

VandenBosch, 50, replaces Steven Barron, who will focus full time on his role as senior vice president of operations for Dignity Health’s six Southern California hospitals, including St. Bernardine and Community Hospital of San Bernardino.

VandenBosch said he looks forward to challenges “in the most dynamic change for our industry” under the Affordable Care Act and for the influx of primary federal dollars to allow more residents the opportunity for health care.

Partially as a result of the ACA, hospitals are becoming more concerned with their patients’ care and health after their discharge, he said.

In recent years, VandenBosch’s duties have been expanded to include chief financial officer for sister hospital Community Hospital of San Bernardino and more recently he was named vice president/CFO for the six Dignity Health Southern California hospitals.

He is a certified public accountant with more than 25 years of experience in health care finance.

“Darryl has proven himself to be not only an outstanding financial strategist, but also a true leader, innovative thinker and major contributor to the overall successful implementation of our goals and fulfillment of our mission,” Barron said.

An interim chief financial officer would be named shortly, VandenBosch said.

Founded in 1931, St. Bernardine’s service area includes the High Desert, the San Bernardino Mountains, and south to include Temecula, VandenBosch said.

The 463-bed hospital offers services from family care to heart surgery, treating an average of 76,000 individuals in the Emergency Department, delivering 2,100 babies and admitting more than 16,000 patients for treatment each year.
