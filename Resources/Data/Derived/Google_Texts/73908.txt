A 46-year-old man is dead after a shooting outside Madison's Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel Saturday morning and authorities are searching for a suspect, according to Madison police.

Police continue to investigate the homicide as they search for a suspect driving a white 1998 Infinity QX4 Sport Utility Vehicle, according to a news release from the City of Madison Police Department.

Officials have not identified the victim because family members have not been notified of his death. Police said they do not think the man is from the Madison area.

According to the news release, officials responded at about 9:07 a.m. to the shooting outside of the hotel, located on the city's east side in the 3800 block of E. Washington Ave.

According to reports from Madison media, the victim was found with multiple gunshot wounds by the Madison Fire Department, who were first to arrive at the scene. He was declared dead following attempts by responders to provide lifesaving measures.

Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said the incident involved a dispute, but officials do not know if the victim and shooter knew one another, according to television station WKOW in Madison.

It's unclear if the shooting suspect and victim were staying at the Howard Johnson, but the hotel remains open, according to WKOW.

Officials have asked anyone who may have information or see the car to call police or Crime Stoppers at 266-4016 and not approach the vehicle.
