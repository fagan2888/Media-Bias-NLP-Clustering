Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\n\nJordan, a leader among conservatives and former chairman of the Republican Study Committee, emphasized the need to scrutinize the language and debate it thoroughly.\n\n\u201cI need to know that we have an existential threat,\u201d added Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho. \u201cIf [ISIS] is [a threat], I want to destroy it, not play footsie with them. We need to get in, take them out, and then get the hell out.\u201d\n\nRep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., predicted Obama\u2019s request wouldn\u2019t pass as written.\n\n\u201cIt limits the president\u2019s ability,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cThe language leaves it geographically open.\u201d\n\nDuncan was also critical of the AUMF from a constitutional and historical standpoint, saying he thought the measure was unconstitutional and, if passed, the result would be unsatisfactory.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see us micromanage another war from D.C.,\u201d he said, emphasizing that decisions need to be made by generals on the ground, not from Capitol Hill. \u201c[Micromanaging] failed us in Vietnam and it failed us in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Kurt Clawson, R-Fla., came out against the measure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of wars and seeing our men and women get killed,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into another war where we have one foot in and one foot out.\u201d\n\nClawson also stressed that if the troops were to be deployed, he would want help from the international community.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a coalition,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cIf we do this, we have to do it big, but we shouldn\u2019t be carrying the bulk. We need a coalition where everyone is doing their fair share.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative lawmakers are raising questions and voicing concerns about President Obama's request to use of military force against the Islamic State.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservative lawmakers are raising questions and voicing concerns about President Obama's request to use of military force against the Islamic State.", "title": "Conservatives Question Obama\u2019s Request for Military Force Against ISIS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polspphotos113954.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-12T17:05:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1AsVwW1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservative lawmakers are raising questions and voicing concerns about President Obama's request to use of military force against the Islamic State.", "title": "Conservatives Question Obama\u2019s Request for Military Force Against ISIS", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polspphotos113954.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-02-12T17:04:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-12T17:05:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Authorization for Use of Military Force, President Barack Obama, Congress, terrorism, ISIS, ISIL, intervention, foreign policy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab9c\"", "article_summary": "Conservative lawmakers are raising questions and voicing concerns about President Obama\u2019s request to use of military force against the Islamic State, otherwise known as ISIS or ISIL.\nWe need to get in, take them out, and then get the hell out.\u201dRep.
