Democrats describe the change involving small-business coverage options as a straightforward improvement of the type they are eager to make, and Obama signed it into law. Republicans are loath to agree, given the strong sentiment among the rank and file that the only fix the law deserves is a burial. \u2026. No member of the House GOP leadership has publicly hailed the fix, which was tucked, at Republicans\u2019 request, into legislation preventing a cut in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients.\n\nReps. John Boehner (R-OH) and Eric Cantor (R-VA) did such a good job of hiding the fix in the bill that many House Republicans might have had no idea that they were voting on this Obamacare fix. Last month, House Republican leaders introduced three fixes to the ACA while their party was distracted by CPAC.\n\nIt is obvious that House Republican leaders intend to fix the unintended consequences of the law, as they simultaneously campaign on destroying Obamacare. Republican voters are being lied to by their own leaders. The Republican led House seems to have no intention of getting rid of the ACA. If they were serious about getting rid of it, why would they pass improvements?\n\nHouse Republicans have a political interest in keeping the ACA on the books. If Republicans repealed the law, they couldn\u2019t campaign against it anymore. Republicans believe that Obamacare is one of the few issues that will get their voters to the polls, so their actions will continue to not match their words.\n\nThere is no bigger sign of totality of the GOP defeat on the ACA than these quiet fixes that House Republican leaders continue to pass.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While they publicly scream for the law's repeal, House Republicans have made another quiet fix to the ACA that Democrats wanted.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "While they publicly scream for the law's repeal, House Republicans have made another quiet fix to the ACA that Democrats wanted.", "title": "Republicans Quietly Make an Important Fix To Obamacare That Democrats Wanted", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/04/06/republicans-quietly-important-fix-obamacare-democrats-wanted.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/obama_boehner_rtrs_328-485x262.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-04-06T10:48:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "published_time": "2014-04-06T10:48:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-06T10:48:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2bb\"", "article_summary": "While they publicly scream for the law\u2019s repeal, House Republicans have made another quiet fix to the ACA that Democrats wanted.\nIt is obvious that House Republican leaders intend to fix the unintended consequences of the law, as they simultaneously campaign on destroying Obamacare.\nReps.
