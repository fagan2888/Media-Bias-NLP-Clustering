Terry McAuliffe (D) had tried to strike language explicitly requiring that the legislature approve any money used to expand Medicaid, but Republicans rebuffed that effort. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly completed work late Monday on a two-year, $96 billion state budget, averting a government shutdown and at least temporarily thwarting Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s key priority of expanding health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe setback for McAuliffe (D) \u2014 and the long-delayed finalization of the budget \u2014 came months into a bitter political standoff between the governor and legislative Republicans over whether to expand government-funded health coverage to 400,000 low-income Virginians under the controversial federal law. The issue has come to define McAuliffe\u2019s young term as governor.\n\n\u201cIt has been a very long session, and the good news is we have a budget,\u201d said Del. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), who has been a leader in the fight against Medicaid expansion as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nA key moment came Monday night when Virginia House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) tossed out a critical veto that the governor had hoped would make it easier to expand Medicaid without legislative approval. Three days after McAuliffe had declared that he would defy the legislature by seeking a way to expand the health-care program on his own, Howell outmaneuvered the governor with a procedural move that killed his line-item veto without a vote.\n\n\u201cI am continually surprised and disappointed by the lengths to which Republicans in the House of Delegates will go to prevent their own constituents from getting access to health care,\u201d McAuliffe said in a written statement. \u201cInstead of putting all of my vetoes through the process prescribed by the Constitution of Virginia, House Republicans robbed the voters of their voice by using a procedural gimmick to obstruct the normal legislative process where this veto was concerned.\u201d\n\nDel. Peter F. Farrell (R-Henrico) countered, \u201cSpeaker Howell calls them like he sees them.\u201d\n\nLegislators returned to Richmond on Monday to address several gubernatorial vetoes and to wrap up the long-overdue budget. After debate over some of McAuliffe\u2019s amendments, Howell threw out two vetoes for procedural reasons. The House declined to act on five others, meaning they were sustained. It overrode the remaining one and sent it to the Senate, which sustained it. McAuliffe, who left for a trade mission to Southern California on Monday afternoon, had already signed the budget over the weekend after issuing his vetoes, so the budget was finalized once the legislative action on the vetoes was complete.\n\nThe budget keeps state spending at current levels in most cases \u2014 a much leaner spending plan than the House and Senate had envisioned earlier this year. Raises for teachers and state employees, inflation payments to hospitals, and K-12 spending boosts were scuttled late in the process because of a projected $1.5 billion revenue shortfall. Some areas did receive spending increases, including mental health.\n\nWithout a budget in place, the threat of a government shutdown put the state\u2019s stellar bond rating at risk and also threatened to interrupt services to the state\u2019s 8 million residents.\n\nMcAuliffe had tried to strike language explicitly requiring that the legislature approve any money used to expand Medicaid. Howell ruled that the veto was out of order because it attempted to veto a portion of a budget item, rather than an entire item. Howell said McAuliffe had made the veto \u201cin a manner which I believe is outside his scope of authority.\u201d By striking the veto on procedural grounds, Howell averted an override vote that would have required the support of two-thirds of both chambers \u2014 an unlikely outcome given the closely divided Senate.\n\nHowell also ruled a second veto out of order. In that one, McAuliffe had sought to strike language preventing governors from appointing judges when the General Assembly is not in session. The legislature appoints judges, but until now the governor had authority to appoint some judges when it is not in session.\n\nIn addition to fiercely debating Medicaid expansion, delegates argued that democracy itself was at stake. \u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about the separation of powers, listen to what he said Friday,\u201d Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax) said, referring to McAuliffe\u2019s declaration. \u201cThis is a dangerous precedent. This governor\u2019s on the verge of setting a precedent that all of us here may well live to regret.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader David J. Toscano (D-Charlottesville) urged Howell to let House members weigh in on the issues.\n\n\u201cPlease do not use a parliamentary maneuver to deny everybody the right to vote,\u201d Toscano said.\n\nOf McAuliffe\u2019s eight vetoes, the one related to Medicaid spending was considered most critical to McAuliffe\u2019s go-it-alone expansion bid. Despite the setback, there is no question that McAuliffe will push ahead with his expansion plan. Less clear is how he can do so in a state where, even before the amendment, the constitution requires the legislature to sign off on any spending \u2014 even the pass-through spending that Washington has promised to bankroll most of Medicaid expansion.\n\nCelebrated by Democrats but denounced as illegal by Republicans, McAuliffe\u2019s plan to expand Medicaid unilaterally had the State Capitol in an intensely partisan mood even before the House and Senate gaveled in Monday.\n\nWhile McAuliffe\u2019s administration was moving ahead behind the scenes to explore expansion plans, House Republicans were researching parliamentary nitty-gritty to see whether they could block two vetoes that McAuliffe intended to ease expansion. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, were weighing whether the time would be right to take advantage of their new majority in the chamber and grab control of key committees.\n\nSenate Republicans ultimately decided to seize the moment, shaking up committees that decide which bills make it to the floor for a vote and which ones die. Although Democrats reorganized the chamber to their liking when they last took power, they complained bitterly about the circumstance that allowed the GOP to take control: the sudden resignation of Sen. Phillip P. Puckett (D-Russell) two weeks ago. They have accused Republicans of bribing Puckett to step down in the middle of the budget standoff with promises of a top tobacco commission job for him and a judgeship for his daughter. Puckett has denied any quid pro quo but withdrew his name from consideration for the tobacco commission job. Federal investigators are looking into the matter.\n\nMedicaid expansion was not formally on the agenda in the House or Senate. Worried about the shutdown threat, and given a final nudge by the surprise Senate resignation that tipped control of the chamber to the GOP, Democrats and three moderate Republicans caved two weeks ago in a months-long standoff, agreeing to a budget deal that did not include expansion.\n\nThe General Assembly has been locked all year in a battle over Medicaid expansion, McAuliffe\u2019s marquee campaign issue. Senate supporters said it would help needy Virginians, create 30,000 jobs and buoy hospitals hit hard by cuts that the Medicaid funds were intended to offset under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGOP House leaders said the existing Medicaid program, which has ballooned to 22 percent of the overall state budget, needs more reform before it is expanded. Republicans have also questioned how an already overextended federal government can afford to keep its promise to pay most of the tab, about $2 billion a year in Virginia alone.\n\nOne of McAuliffe\u2019s eight vetoes came over the weekend, related to whether certain budget-making documents have to be shared with the General Assembly. He announced the other seven Friday at a news conference, where he also declared that he would defy the legislature and find a way to expand Medicaid \u2014 and ordered his secretary of health and human resources, William A. Hazel Jr., to come up with a plan by Sept. 1.\n\nHazel and others in the administration were plowing ahead toward that goal Monday, though the governor\u2019s office declined to say how they were going about that beyond meeting and evaluating options.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s office did indicate, however, that more than just traditional Medicaid expansion was on the table. Hazel will be looking at ways to expand Medicaid but also other, unspecified options for providing health care.\n\nAnother of McAuliffe\u2019s vetoes eliminated all language related to a state Medicaid commission.\n\nThe panel had been set up under then-Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) to determine whether the existing Medicaid program had achieved certain goals that the legislature required before expansion could take place. Democrats had pushed for its creation, but Republicans had used it to thwart expansion.\n\nMcAuliffe called the commission a \u201csham to pretend that the legislature is serious about Medicaid reform and expansion.\u201d His veto was seen as largely symbolic because language creating the commission will remain in the state code even if it is removed from the budget.\n\nAnother veto strips $300,000 in funding for an ethics commission created in response to a $165,000 gifts scandal involving McDonnell and his wife, Maureen. McAuliffe signed the bill creating the commission and made no substantive changes to ethics legislation the legislature passed this year. But on Friday, he took a harder line, saying that legislators should be subjected to tougher rules and that funding the commission should wait until those are passed. On Monday, the House overrode McAuliffe\u2019s veto of the ethics bill, but the Senate did not muster the votes to follow suit, so McAuliffe\u2019s veto was sustained.\n\nMcAuliffe also issued a directive that state staffers suspend all planning work for a $300 million Capitol Square office building meant to house lawmakers and their staffs. McAuliffe had previously signed off on the building.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The General Assembly reconvenes three days after the governor vowed to defy it on Medicaid.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The General Assembly reconvenes three days after the governor vowed to defy it on Medicaid.", "title": "Va. lawmakers finalize state budget, avert government shutdown, block Gov.
