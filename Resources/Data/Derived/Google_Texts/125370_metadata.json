The Government Street location had been open since early August. Kean\u2019s locations at 140 Sharp Road, 8178 Plank Road and 439 Ninth St. in Baton Rouge and 311 S. Burnside Ave. in Gonzales will remain open through Oct. 9. All of the stores have stopped taking new cleaning orders.\n\nIn a statement, the company said the eight stores were underperforming, accounting for one-third of Kean\u2019s total sales. According to the company website, after the closures, Kean\u2019s will have seven locations in Baton Rouge, Prairieville and Central. The company has announced plans to open new locations at the Highland Marketplace and in the Onyx Residences downtown in 2016.\n\n\u201cAs Baton Rouge has shifted and changed through the years, Kean\u2019s has made an attempt to remain in many of these locations,\u201d the company said in a news release. \u201cHowever, due to \u2018wash and wear,\u2019 as well as more casual business attire, the volume in these locations does not justify our presence any longer.\u201d\n\nThe company also said it has felt the impact of labor shortages, as well as the Affordable Care Act, which mandates that companies with 50 full-time employees offer health insurance.\n\nKean\u2019s said employees who are being affected by the store closings will be offered jobs at the remaining locations where possible.\n\nFollow Timothy Boone on Twitter @TCB_TheAdvocate", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/: Kean\u2019s Fine Dry Cleaning said it is closing eight locations by Oct. 9 and blamed the decision on a shift to business casual clothes, labor shortages and the Affordable Care Act.
