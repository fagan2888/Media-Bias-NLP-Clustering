Fire crews from across the Western Slope are being summoned to assist in battling an active, three-alarm fire at a biomass power plant in Gypum on Saturday morning.

The blaze began early Saturday at the wood-burning power plant, which opened one year ago under some controversy from local residents who were worried about air quality impacts.

“This is going to be an all day affair,” said Michele Ziccardi, a spokeswoman for the Greater Eagle Fire Protection District.

Ziccardi said the power plant, which burns beetle-kill timber, has been taken out of service because of the blaze.

“We have no idea what caused it,” she said.

Fire crews from throughout Eagle County are working the fire and more apparatus are en route to help fight the blaze. Ziccardi said crews from Glenwood Springs and Basalt have been requested, adding that flames are still showing from the power plant.

The large power plant facility is located off Interstate 70 about 25 miles east of Glenwood Springs. The fire was first reported about 4 a.m.

“The building is not gone,” she said. “As far as you can see, it’s mostly exterior.”

The plant, when it opened in December 2013, was the first of its kind in the state. Operated by Holy Cross Energy, the project was touted by U.S. Sen. Mark Udall as a way to “reduce wildfire risks, create jobs and generate renewable energy sources.”

A spokesperson for the energy provider could not be immediately reached.

The 10-megawatt power plant helps provide energy to about 55,000 customers in Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield, Gunnison and Mesa counties, according to Udall’s office.

This is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.
