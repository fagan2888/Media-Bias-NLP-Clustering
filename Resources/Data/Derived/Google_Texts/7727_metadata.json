That\u2019s a lot of people. But then Kaiser adds: \u201cWe also estimate that about 29 million people nationally could look to new marketplaces as a place to purchase coverage.\u201d So, of 29 million people who might enter the Obamacare exchanges, about 17 million would be eligible for subsidies. That\u2019s about 59 percent who would be eligible for taxpayer-paid assistance, versus 41 percent who are not. That\u2019s a majority on the subsidy side, but not a huge one. Then figure that some of those who are eligible for help will only be eligible for very small subsidies. For example, a family of four in St. Louis, Mo., with one parent who earns $48,000 and another who earns $37,000 would be eligible for a subsidy \u2014 all of $13 per year to pay for an $8,088 policy \u2014 that is virtually no help at all. (The numbers come from the Kaiser Foundation\u2019s online subsidy calculator.) Out of the 59 percent who are eligible for subsidies, then, some portion will receive subsidies that do not cover the increased cost of their new coverage. For them, Obamacare will be a net loss. So, it\u2019s unlikely Obamacare will actually help the full 59 percent of those eligible for subsidies by Kaiser\u2019s estimate. The bottom line is, Obamacare could very well hurt substantially more than 41 percent of the people who are currently uninsured or purchase coverage on the individual market. That\u2019s not exactly making the system work \u201cbetter for everybody.\u201d\n\nYork goes on to observe that the \u201chelp vs. hurt ratio could change considerably, and not in the President\u2019s favor,\u201d when the even larger number of people in the employer market begin losing millions of policies due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis is useful, provocative, and discouraging data, but I can\u2019t help taking exception to the conclusion York draws from it:\n\nObamacare\u2019s future depends on those numbers. The program will not be politically viable if it hurts more people than it helps, and probably not even if it helps a few more than it hurts. If that turns out to be the case, there will be hell to pay politically for the president and his fellow Democrats, likely for a very long time.\n\nThose aren\u2019t quite the rules of the socialist game. It can survive, and flourish, by hurting a huge number of people while helping only a few. The important thing is that the many are kept from organizing and resisting effectively, while the few are motivated to show their gratitude during election season.\n\nIt would be a strategic mistake to think ObamaCare is doomed if it works out to be a bad deal for a larger number of Americans. They\u2019ll be told to swallow their injury without complaint. They\u2019ll be told it\u2019s all for the best, things will work out for the best eventually, and the beneficiaries were in such dire need that only a callous and greedy person could deny them. We\u2019re already hearing versions of those arguments from Obama and his apologists.\n\nSocialism never works \u201cbetter for everybody,\u201d although it\u2019s always sold that way. It\u2019s always a net loss for society as a whole. Political command is laughably weak and inefficient, compared to the power of voluntary commerce and free-market competition. Your government-mandated \u201cfree\u201d goodies will always be of meager quality compared to what you might have enjoyed under capitalism. You will be sternly instructed not to complain about the situation. Angry dependents of the State will be standing by, in case you get any funny ideas about demanding your freedom back.\n\nLeftist ideology is described as the re-distribution of wealth, but in practice it\u2019s more like the re-distribution of misery. Everything gets worse, and everyone has less, but it\u2019s more \u201cfair.\u201d Thin gruel is poured into more equally-sized bowls. Of course, the Ruling Class and its special friends get a better deal \u2013 they most certainly are under ObamaCare, in countless ways. A great deal of seized wealth vanishes into government \u201coverhead\u201d before re-distributed goodies emerge from the system.\n\nMisery can be disguised in many ways. Taxes can be hidden \u2013 ObamaCare contains dozens of them, many hitting the Sainted Middle Class hard in their working-family wallets, but it\u2019s hidden by third-party smoke and mirrors. A thin, bland layer of taxes, regulation, and deficit spending (which is really just deferred taxation) drains strength from the private sector, leaving it numb and confused\u2026 while bright and shiny benefits are brightly wrapped in gift paper and handed to dependents, who will be told exactly who they must vote for, if they want the prizes to keep coming.\n\nDependency is not an easy virus to shake. Look at the example of ObamaCare subsidies York provides: \u201ca family of four in St. Louis, Mo., with one parent who earns $48,000 and another who earns $37,000 would be eligible for a subsidy \u2013 all of $13 per year to pay for an $8,088 policy \u2013 that is virtually no help at all.\u201d Well, no, it\u2019s not\u2026 but you\u2019d be surprised how quickly people will get hooked on the payment of even very small subsidies, and how swiftly they\u2019ll forget those subsidies are only needed because government regulations jacked up the price of their health care. Before long, the only thing anyone will know is how much they depend on those taxpayer \u201cgifts,\u201d and how difficult it would be to get along without them.\n\nAnd of course, they\u2019ll be told their ObamaCare subsidies are the very first thing on the chopping block when anyone talks about fiscal restraint or reducing the deficit. Soon they\u2019ll be told resistance to tax increases means their subsidies will die. By then, the dependents will no longer view the subsidies as \u201cgifts\u201d or benevolent support generously provided by taxpayers. They will be viewed as entitlements, as property, and anyone who dares to cut them back will be little better than a thief.\n\nThis attitude will only be strengthened by the fact that so many of the people receiving subsidies will also be taxpayers, rather than free riders \u2013 Takers who are also Makers. The family getting that itty-bitty subsidy in York\u2019s example is earning $85,000 a year. What could be more delightful for the power-hungry socialist? The people will enslave themselves, and whip themselves bloody for disobedience.\n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think ObamaCare\u2019s future will be determined by the balance of hurting, the net number of people who think they\u2019re getting a raw deal. It will be more complicated than that, especially since the authors of the Affordable Care Act were criminally negligent and dishonest about a great many things, but they made damn sure it will be difficult to repeal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "It won't necessarily matter if ObamaCare hurts more people than it helps.", "title": "Big Government and the balance of hurting | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/scales_sunset-480x284.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/11/08/big-government-and-the-balance-of-hurting/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "It won't necessarily matter if ObamaCare hurts more people than it helps.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/scales_sunset-480x284.jpg", "description": "It won't necessarily matter if ObamaCare hurts more people than it helps.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "article_summary": "So no, I don\u2019t think ObamaCare\u2019s future will be determined by the balance of hurting, the net number of people who think they\u2019re getting a raw deal.\nThen figure that some of those who are eligible for help will only be eligible for very small subsidies.\nIt can survive, and flourish, by hurting a huge number of people while helping only a few.\nSo, it\u2019s unlikely Obamacare will actually help the full 59 percent of those eligible for subsidies by Kaiser\u2019s estimate.\nAnd of course, they\u2019ll be told their ObamaCare subsidies are the very first thing on the chopping block when anyone talks about fiscal restraint or reducing the deficit."}
