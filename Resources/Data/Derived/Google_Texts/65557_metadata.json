By understanding and honoring our rights and responsibilities to one another we can ensure a future where Indigenous peoples, languages, cultures and Nations are a strong and vibrant part of this land we call home.\u201d\n\nThe AFN National Executive Committee is hoping that First Nations and all Canadians participate in cultural events and other celebrations honoring National Aboriginal Awareness Month, and especially on National Aboriginal Day, June 21, corresponding with the summer solstice.\n\n\u201cNational Aboriginal History Month provides an opportunity to recognize not only the historic contributions of Aboriginal peoples to the development of Canada, but also the strength of present-day Aboriginal communities and their promise for the future,\u201d says the website of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. \u201cCelebrating National Aboriginal History Month in June is an important tribute to the heritage and diversity of First Nation, Inuit and M\u00e9tis communities across Canada.\u201d\n\nAnd as usual, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) has a full slate of events, concerts and other celebrations planned for June 21.\n\nMany organizations and institutions around the country are holding events. For example, the website Aboriginal Arts & Stories is holding a competition for art created by youth.\n\n\u201cAFN encourages all Canadians to learn more about Indigenous Peoples, cultures and rights by taking part in events this month,\u201d the group said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indigenous Peoples in Canada are celebrating Aboriginal Awareness month all throughout June and using the designation to draw attention to what their cultures have to offer the Indigenous Peoples in Canada are celebrating Aboriginal History Month throughout June.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/16/indigenous-peoples-canada-celebrate-aboriginal-awareness-month-155317", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/aboriginal_history_month_banner_2014.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Indigenous Peoples in Canada Celebrate Aboriginal Awareness Month"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-16T10:30-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Indigenous Peoples in Canada Celebrate Aboriginal Awareness Month"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/16/indigenous-peoples-canada-celebrate-aboriginal-awareness-month-155317", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Canada, National Aboriginal Awareness Day, Aboriginal History month", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Indigenous Peoples in Canada Celebrate Aboriginal Awareness Month"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNational Aboriginal History Month provides an opportunity to recognize not only the historic contributions of Aboriginal peoples to the development of Canada, but also the strength of present-day Aboriginal communities and their promise for the future,\u201d says the website of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.\nIndigenous Peoples in Canada are celebrating Aboriginal Awareness month all throughout June and using the designation to draw attention to what their cultures have to offer the nation.\n\u201cThis month, let\u2019s join together to celebrate Indigenous cultures, languages and traditions as well as the many contributions of Indigenous peoples in making this country what it is today.\n\u201cAFN encourages all Canadians to learn more about Indigenous Peoples, cultures and rights by taking part in events this month,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\u201cCelebrating National Aboriginal History Month in June is an important tribute to the heritage and diversity of First Nation, Inuit and M\u00e9tis communities across Canada.\u201dAnd as usual, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) has a full slate of events, concerts and other celebrations planned for June 21."}
