For example, Trump is against gay marriage, which is outlawed in Russia. Trump also shares Putin\u2019s hard line stance against ISIS (Daesh). CBS News quotes Trump\u2019s views on Putin\u2019s air strikes in Syria.\n\n\u201cPutin is now taking over what we started and he\u2019s going into Syria, and he frankly wants to fight ISIS, and I think that\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d\n\nABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos confronts Donald Trump over his praise for Vladimir Putin https://t.co/h3RAzIDdkm \u2014 Business Insider (@businessinsider) December 20, 2015\n\nIn fact, Trump and Putin have plenty in common as stern businessmen who are not afraid of the politically incorrect. But this is only the means of their influence and power. What is more instructive is what these two men believe and what we might expect Trump to do when he becomes president, going from his admiration of Putin.\n\nPutin\u2019s Ideas\n\nThere is a word for Vladimir Putin\u2019s color of politics: \u201cPutinism.\u201d Putinism is the subject of academic studies worldwide. One recent article goes into detail about the particular style of rule and ideology of Putin. Putin is an authoritarian.\n\n\u201cDuring the last several years, the polycentrism of Russian politics under Yeltsin has been replaced by monocentrism, as all other influential institutions have been drawn into the system of support for the single center of power headed by Putin.\u201d\n\nFrom Putin\u2019s collectivization (forced government ownership) of the energy sector to Putin\u2019s intervention in the Ukraine, Putin has earned his reputation as a strong leader unafraid of world public opinion. Russia is, like it or not, established as a major world power and is slowly returning to its former days under Soviet rule, at least as a significant international player.\n\nThis man may not be the face of America but he is a strong leader that takes no ****. #Putin https://t.co/cg0ySyXTvz \u2014 Todd Willis (@Tmcwillis) December 20, 2015\n\nPutin is a cult figure. In fact, the merchandising of Putin\u2019s image is very profitable as images such as a naked Putin riding a bear has the effect of keeping him in everyone\u2019s mind in the way that he wants: masculine, strong and dominant.\n\nThe only way to keep this cold from getting worse\u2013Putin riding a bear! Thanks @PaulJCarpenter and @maureensackcarp pic.twitter.com/X5i9ijBw3Y \u2014 Angela Langlands (@teach4Travel) December 7, 2015\n\nCult figures can gain popular support as people look to their political leaders for their own self esteem, associating a strong figure with a strong country. Putin\u2019s success in his endeavors has added fire to the flames of this popularity.\n\nTrump\u2019s Ideas\n\nIt is clear that Trump admires Putin.\n\nI liked a @YouTube video from @russiainsider https://t.co/F5gLhCjgc0 Trump: Putin is a strong, tough and respected leader and he\u2019s \u2014 Eragon Shadeslayer (@arya_ergaon) December 20, 2015\n\nWhat are Trump\u2019s ideas? What might we expect if Trump becomes president? First, Trump could reverse gay marriage, as he does not agree with it. Trump would also seek to defund Planned Parenthood, as he has himself made clear. Trump would also increase ties with Russia and use the full power of the US military to increase military intervention in the Middle East, particularly against ISIS (Daesh). Trump also wants to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico as he believes that illegal Mexicans are rapists.\n\nSome less controversial ideas of Trump are his plans for overhauling the tax system increasing the tax allowance for lower earners and creating a so-called \u201cflat tax\u201d for everyone else.\n\nTrump would seek to overturn Obamacare, replacing it with his own version.\n\n@ForMotionCreatv Trump would replace Obamacare with Obamacare and thinks bailing out Insurance Companies is cool. https://t.co/Gg5G6x1qpI \u2014 VirtueSignal (@VirtueSignal) November 13, 2015\n\nBut Trump, worryingly, denies climate change and would increase funding to oil exploration in Alaska. Due to the recent crash in oil prices, however, one positive benefit, as seen by Democrats, is that it is less profitable for companies to set up the expensive infrastructure in the arctic regions as recovering these costs is less likely in a time when the glut of cheap oil on the market makes such efforts redundant.\n\nOne thing is for sure. Although Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are likely to become bosom buddies if Trump is elected president, it is not so much the ideology of the Russian leader that Trump admires, but rather his leadership skills. And this means that the plans outlined above are likely to by vehemently argued by Trump and perhaps adopted as Republicans attempt to reunite after their pre-election in-fighting and devastation over the last seven years by a Democratic president\u2013Barrack Obama\u2013who has been effective using his own brand of leadership, which has been criticised as too soft by some Democrats.\n\nTrump, like Putin, will be anything but soft.\n\n[Image by Gage Skidmore [CC BY-SA 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons and Kremlin.ru [CC BY 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0) or CC BY 4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)], via Wikimedia Commons]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump shares many of Vladimir Putin's ideas.
