The Oregon gunman who opened fire at Umpqua Community College on Thursday killed himself at the scene, authorities confirmed Saturday.

The medical examiner’s office confirmed that the shooter, Chris Harper Mercer, committed suicide, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said at a press conference.

Law enforcement said the gunman had been “neutralized” in a shootout with police but it was unclear whether he had killed himself or been shot by police.

Mr. Hanlin also revealed that police had discovered another weapon, bringing the total number the gunman had at the campus and at his residence to 14.

Mr. Harper Mercer was named Friday as the gunman responsible for the rampage that killed ten people and injured seven others at the community college in Roseburg, Oregon.

Media reports indicated that the shooter left a “hate filled” note with disparaging remarks towards black men at the scene. Authorities have revealed little details on what the shooter’s motives may have been.
