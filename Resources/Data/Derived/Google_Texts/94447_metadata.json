Ashya King has a brain tumour but doctors refused to use proton laser treatment that could save his life, which led the family to take him out of hospital in the effort to find the treatment abroad.\n\nHampshire Police defended their decision to lead an international manhunt for his parents, Brett and Naghemeh, who are now in custody in Spain. They are reported to be unable to see their son, who is believed to be on his own in a hospital in the Costa Del Sol. His brother told the Metro that the Police had been guilty of child cruelty for breaking up the family and leaving Ashya on his own.\n\nHis grandmother Patricia was equally critical, saying: \u201cPutting him in a hospital where he doesn\u2019t know anybody is cruel\u2026 I have never heard of anything so cruel in all my life.\u201d Authorities are accused of holding Ashya like a virtual prisoner, unable to see family and friends during what might be the last few weeks of his life.\n\nPrior to his arrest, Brett King posted a video on YouTube explaining his actions, he expressed his shock that he was being hunted for kidnap. Mr King said: \u201cWe were most disturbed today to find that his face is all over the internet and newspapers, and we have been labelled as kidnappers putting his life at risk, neglect.\n\nHe added: \u201cHe has been smiling a lot more, he has been smiling a lot more since we took him out of hospital.\u201d\n\nMr and Mrs King were formally accused this morning of child cruelty, and will be brought before a Spanish judge to decide if they will face criminal charges. Their son will now not be able to access the treatment his parents want and is highly likely to die as a result. The family had hoped to raise the \u00a3100,000 needed for the treatment whilst travelling to the Czech republic, but they were caught at a youth hostel in Malaga.\n\nNeither the Chief Constable nor Southampton General Hospital appeared to show any sympathy for the plight of the family. Assistant Chief Constable of Hampshire Police Chris Shead said: \u201cI make no apology for being as proactive as possible in trying to find him. We had medical experts telling us Ashya was in grave danger.\u201d\n\nWhilst it is legal to seek alternative treatment when the NHS is not willing to help, the authorities are able to claim that moving the patient is dangerous. This can leave parents of sick children with few options but to abscond.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parents Arrested For Seeking Private Medical Treatment For Terminally Ill Son", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Parents Arrested For Seeking Private Medical Treatment For Terminally Ill Son", "title": "Parents Arrested For Seeking Private Medical Treatment For Terminally Ill Son - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-London/2014/09/01/ashya_king.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/09/01/parents-arrested-for-seeking-private-medical-treatment-for-terminally-ill-son/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Parents Arrested For Seeking Private Medical Treatment For Terminally Ill Son", "title": "Parents Arrested For Seeking Private Medical Treatment For Terminally Ill Son - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-London/2014/09/01/ashya_king.jpg", "creator": "@andrejpwalker", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "published_time": "2014-09-01T02:51:35-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/andrewalkerpage"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec4e\"", "article_summary": "Their son will now not be able to access the treatment his parents want and is highly likely to die as a result.\nHampshire Police defended their decision to lead an international manhunt for his parents, Brett and Naghemeh, who are now in custody in Spain.\nThey are reported to be unable to see their son, who is believed to be on his own in a hospital in the Costa Del Sol.\nAshya King has a brain tumour but doctors refused to use proton laser treatment that could save his life, which led the family to take him out of hospital in the effort to find the treatment abroad.\nNeither the Chief Constable nor Southampton General Hospital appeared to show any sympathy for the plight of the family."}
