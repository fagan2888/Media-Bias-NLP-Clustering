They\u2019ve all been advised to wait until early December or to try enrolling on the phone or via snail mail.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s been able to sign up,\u201d said Sylvia Armendariz, an eligibility-outreach worker who helps applicants navigate the process at the center. \u201cDue to the system glitches we\u2019ve had, it\u2019s been unsuccessful for me to access the website ... You try to register and it freezes.\u201d\n\nAt the Regional Center for Border Health in nearby Somerton, one person is assigned the task of logging in to the troubled HealthCare.gov federal site every morning and every afternoon to see if it\u2019s finally up and running. So far, every attempt has been thwarted by error messages.\n\n\u201cMy first experience was with somebody sitting down to register, and we had to reschedule the visit,\u201d said Yadira Escamilla, a family coordinator and navigator who runs the center\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Clinical Services. \u201cTo me, it was kind of embarrassing, but it\u2019s just out of my control.\u201d\n\nBut just across the state line in California, more than 35,000 people have signed up for health care mandated by the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Covered California, the state-run exchange, has generated complaints of long waits but has been largely spared the technical glitches that have brought the federal marketplace to a halt.\n\nAnd so it goes for residents of the District of Columbia and the 16 states that have set up their own insurance exchanges and those in the 19 states that chose not to participate and left their residents to rely on the federal insurance marketplace. (The remaining 15 states are in a federal-state partnership.) The federal site\u2019s troubles have generated calls to push back the enrollment deadline, something the Obama administration is resisting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California isn\u2019t free of health care registration issues, but it is smooth sailing compared with neighboring Arizona", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/15/a-tale-of-two-healthcarestates.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/11/15/a-tale-of-two-healthcarestates/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.ariz_aca_111413.1384527135450.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "California isn\u2019t free of health care registration issues, but it is smooth sailing compared with neighboring Arizona", "title": "California vs. Arizona: A tale of two health care states"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/11/15/a-tale-of-two-healthcarestates/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.ariz_aca_111413.1384527135450.jpg", "description": "California isn\u2019t free of health care registration issues, but it is smooth sailing compared with neighboring Arizona", "card": "summary", "title": "California vs. Arizona: A tale of two health care states"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Politics, Obamacare, Arizona, California, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Covered California, the state-run exchange, has generated complaints of long waits but has been largely spared the technical glitches that have brought the federal marketplace to a halt.\nYUMA, Ariz. \u2014 At the Sunset Community Health Center, most of the people who were eager to sign up for the new health insurance marketplace when enrollment opened Oct. 1 don\u2019t even bother showing up anymore.\nThey\u2019ve all been advised to wait until early December or to try enrolling on the phone or via snail mail.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s been able to sign up,\u201d said Sylvia Armendariz, an eligibility-outreach worker who helps applicants navigate the process at the center.\nThe federal site\u2019s troubles have generated calls to push back the enrollment deadline, something the Obama administration is resisting."}
