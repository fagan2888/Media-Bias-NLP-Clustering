Police in Biloxi say they have arrested a man who shot and killed a woman at a Waffle House restaurant after she asked him not to smoke.

Sgt. Donnie Dobbs says police received a call about the shooting at 1:11 a.m. Friday. He said the customer, Johnny Max Mount, had argued with an employee about smoking a cigarette.

He then pulled out a handgun and shot the employee one time in the head.

Dobbs said the woman died on the way to the hospital.

The suspect was outside the restaurant when police arrived and surrendered without incident.

Dobbs said he's been charged with first degree murder and is being held on $2 million bond.

The victim's name has not been released as authorities try to locate her next of kin.
