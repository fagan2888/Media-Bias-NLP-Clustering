One year after being dethroned as the top toy on girls\u2019 wishlists by characters from Disney\u2019s Frozen, the iconic doll is again No. 1, based on a new survey conducted for the National Retail Federation.\n\nThe survey asked more than 7,000 consumers what \u201chot\u201d toys they were planning to purchase for children during the upcoming holiday season. Of those who had their shopping plans laid out, 21.2 percent said they would be buying a Barbie for girls on their holiday list, while 13 percent said they would buy \u201cFrozen\u201d merchandise and 10 percent said they\u2019d be buying other dolls.\n\nThe most popular toys for boys included Lego, on more than 12 percent of shopping lists, and \u201cStar Wars\u201d toys, which jumped to the No. 2 spot for boys from No. 15 last year, thanks to growing anticipation for the Dec. 18 release of the new movie in the franchise.\n\nBigger Than Barbie: Lego Is Now King of the Toymakers\n\nThe U.S. toy industry is poised to have its strongest year in at least a decade, according to projections from The NPD Group, a market-research firm. Tie-ins with Hollywood blockbusters like \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cFrozen\u201d are helping to attract back children who had turned to video games and mobile apps, as are tech features being added to traditional toys. The newly released Barbie from Mattel, Hello Barbie, features speech recognition and is able to hold a conversation. Hasbro\u2019s new Nerf gun \u2014 ranked ninth on the boy\u2019s list \u2014 can now shoot foam balls up to 70 miles an hour.\n\nAnnual toy sales are expected to grow 6.2 percent to $19.9 billion this year, according NPD. That\u2019s up from a 4 percent rise last year and the biggest jump in at least 10 years.\n\nRelated: Holiday Shopping: What Everyone on Your Gift List Really Wants\n\nBelow are the top toys Americans plan to buy for boys and girls this year, according to the National Retail Federation:\n\nTop 10 Toys for Boys\n\n1.
