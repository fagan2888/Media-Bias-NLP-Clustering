We will not shrink from it. We will lead.\u201d\n\nLast week, Rolling Stone published an explosive account of the university\u2019s culture of impunity around rape and fraternities, featuring a devastating story of a gang rape. The article said that administrators were aware of the allegations that a freshman had been gang raped at a fraternity party, but had done nothing. It described a practice of stonewalling around the actual number of reported assaults, for fear of being labeled, as one administrator allegedly put it, \u201cthe rape school.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe behavior depicted is not something we will accept as normal, and the actions by seven men as described in the story have betrayed us. We have a problem, and we are going to get after it,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThe Rolling Stone article depicted a culture on campus of covering up or shrugging off rape allegations even as academic offenses like plagiarism result in expulsion, all under the guise of maintaining the school\u2019s image. But Sullivan drew on the community\u2019s cultural pride in her remarks. \u201cThis is a community of determination and resolve, and we embrace change when change is needed,\u201d she said. There is a piece of our culture that is broken and I ask your help in coming together as a strong and resilient community to fix it.\u201d She added, \u201cOur founder Thomas Jefferson reminds us it is more honorable to repair wrong than to persist in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not stop until every student feels safe and secure and free to work and live and grow,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nSullivan\u2019s event with students was livestreamed on the university\u2019s website, but the first half was inaudible due to a technical issue. The student newspaper, Cavalier Daily, tweeted from the room that Sullivan discussed the role of binge drinking, saying, \u201cAlcohol does not cause rape\u201d but can be \u201ca tool of a predator.\u201d\n\nShe took questions from the audience, members of whom asked about whether there would be a task force (possibly, and possibly more than one) and what the role of the women\u2019s center would be (they have recommended an additional trauma counselor.)\n\nSullivan canceled a planned appearance at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. A spokesman for the university said in a statement that \u201cduring this extraordinary and difficult time for UVA, President Sullivan\u2019s energies are best focused on our grounds, where she can speak directly to and hear directly from our university community, participate in the healing process, and work to find answers to the many questions that deserve attention.\u201d\n\nRelated: Questions follow in wake of UVA rape allegations\n\nThe UVA board called a meeting discuss campus rape last week, ultimately passing a resolution stating a policy of zero tolerance toward sexual assault. After a three-hour discussion, the board also announced that the violence prevention organization Green Dot would begin bystander awareness training in January.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say to [the victim] and her parents I am sorry, and to all survivors of sexual assault, I am sorry,\u201d said George Martin, the board\u2019s director, at that meeting. \u201cAs we said last week, this type of conduct will not be tolerated at the University of Virginia. The status quo is not acceptable. Like all of you gathered here today, I am appalled.\u201d\n\nThe university has suspended all campus fraternity activities until the end of the year. \u201cSexual violence is a very serious issue in the Greek system, but it\u2019s a very serious issue and it\u2019s much larger and much more complicated than the Greek system itself,\u201d the president of UVA\u2019s Inter-Fraternity Council told reporters last week.\n\nA video has emerged showing Associate Dean of Students Nicole Eramo \u2014 who plays a prominent role in the Rolling Stone article \u2014 acknowledging several UVA students had been suspended, rather than expelled, after admitting to sexual assault.\n\nThe federal government was already investigating the university for possible violations of Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in education, and the Clery Act, which requires reporting of on-campus crimes to the government. UVA is one of a smaller number of campuses under a stricter \u201ccompliance review\u201d by the federal government, suggesting deeper and broader concerns.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan spoke briefly to students Monday about the ongoing controversy on the university's handling of sexual assault.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/uva-president-rape-controversy-we-will-lead", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan spoke briefly to students Monday about the ongoing controversy on the university's handling of sexual assault.", "title": "UVA president on rape controversy: 'We will lead'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/uva-president-rape-controversy-we-will-lead", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap120626174904.jpg?itok=512asx39", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/uva-president-rape-controversy-we-will-lead", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap120626174904.jpg?itok=JJ-iJw0o", "title": "UVA president on rape controversy: 'We will lead'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan spoke briefly to students Monday about the ongoing controversy on the university's handling of sexual assault."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-01T09:33:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "irincarmon", "title": "UVA president on rape controversy: 'We will lead'", "tags": "health,sexual-health,university-of-virginia", "published": 1, "date": "12/01/2014 09:33:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/uva-president-rape-controversy-we-will-lead"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan spoke briefly to students Monday about the ongoing controversy on the university's handling of sexual assault.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Sexual Health, University of Virginia"}, "article_summary": "We will lead.\u201dLast week, Rolling Stone published an explosive account of the university\u2019s culture of impunity around rape and fraternities, featuring a devastating story of a gang rape.\nUVA is one of a smaller number of campuses under a stricter \u201ccompliance review\u201d by the federal government, suggesting deeper and broader concerns.\nA video has emerged showing Associate Dean of Students Nicole Eramo \u2014 who plays a prominent role in the Rolling Stone article \u2014 acknowledging several UVA students had been suspended, rather than expelled, after admitting to sexual assault.\nThe Rolling Stone article depicted a culture on campus of covering up or shrugging off rape allegations even as academic offenses like plagiarism result in expulsion, all under the guise of maintaining the school\u2019s image.\n\u201cAs we said last week, this type of conduct will not be tolerated at the University of Virginia."}
