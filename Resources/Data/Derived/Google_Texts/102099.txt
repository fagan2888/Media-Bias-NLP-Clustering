Not-so-bad economy beats the alternative Paul Krugman says U.S. economic performance has done relatively well of late only if you grade on a curve.

According to the economist Kevin O'Rourke, who has been doing a comparison between the Great Depression that began in 1929 and the Great Recession that began almost eight years ago, the world has just passed a sad landmark. While the initial slump this time around wasn't nearly as bad as the collapse from 1929 to 1933, the recovery has been weaker - and at this point world industrial production is doing worse than it did at the same point in the 1930s. A remarkable achievement!
