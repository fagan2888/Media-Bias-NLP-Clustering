Still, she said, providers don\u2019t often offer conservative treatments, especially to medically disadvantaged populations with income limitations or language and cultural considerations.\n\n\u201cPatients in chronic pain face all sorts of barriers to getting the best care,\u201d Dashe said. Lacking the money to seek treatment, some choose to live with their discomfort. \u201cOr they work so much that they just don\u2019t take care of themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cOthers may not even be aware of their options. For instance, someone with pain from shingles doesn\u2019t know they might be given just one acupuncture treatment and, bam! \u2014 it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nCultural factors influence how a person expresses pain and how they seek help, Dashe said. \u201cRoles and statuses the person has within their own culture intersect with age, race, sexuality and education,\u201d creating conflicts that get in the way of getting care.\n\nBarbara Gosse, a licensed acupuncturist and family practitioner at the Bloomington Natural Care Center, has used acupuncture to treat patients with all kinds of acute and chronic pain. But the efficiencies of alternative care struck close to home when she recently needed treatment for bone injuries brought on by XLH, a metabolic bone disorder that leaves her vulnerable to breaks.\n\n\u201cI had two major bone surgeries. With one, I followed the track of traditional care and ended up wretchedly sick in bed for a week from the medications,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the second one, I had acupuncture prior to the surgery and while I was in the hospital, instead of any pain or anti-nausea medications,\u201d she said. \u201cI was up and moving in 48 hours. It was a tremendous difference.\u201d\n\nOther specialists said relief can be as close as the kitchen or neighborhood park, in the form of nutritional therapies and simple exercise to help combat inflammation, a root cause of much chronic pain.\n\n\u201cFoods can be both inflammation reducing and inducing,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Sweere, a Minneapolis-based chiropractic and health educator. \u201cJust moving to a more balanced, less acidic diet with more fruits and vegetables can work wonders.\u201d\n\nIt also helps to get moving. \u201cExercise produces endorphins, which are natural pain relievers, \u201c he said. \u201cThe key is to get people activated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Alternative therapies still not as accessible for those with lower income, practitioners say.", "title": "Poverty limits therapies for patients with chronic pain", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/poverty-limits-therapies-for-patients-with-chronic-pain/318544171/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143786556652537.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143786556652537.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Alternative therapies still not as accessible for those with lower income, practitioners say.", "title": "Poverty limits therapies for patients with chronic pain", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/poverty-limits-therapies-for-patients-with-chronic-pain/318544171/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143786556652537.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143786556652537.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Alternative therapies still not as accessible for those with lower income, practitioners say."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdba6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPatients in chronic pain face all sorts of barriers to getting the best care,\u201d Dashe said.\nChronic pain plays no favorites \u2014 it crosses all cultural and socioeconomic circles \u2014 but the same is not true for getting that pain treated, educators gathered at Northwestern Health Sciences University in Bloomington said Saturday.\nFor instance, someone with pain from shingles doesn\u2019t know they might be given just one acupuncture treatment and, bam!\nBarbara Gosse, a licensed acupuncturist and family practitioner at the Bloomington Natural Care Center, has used acupuncture to treat patients with all kinds of acute and chronic pain.\n\u2014 it\u2019s gone.\u201dCultural factors influence how a person expresses pain and how they seek help, Dashe said."}
