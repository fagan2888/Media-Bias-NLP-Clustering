(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n4409888\n\nObamacare architect Jonathan Gruber admitted to his pricey consulting contracts with the Obama administration in a November 2013 email obtained by The Daily Caller.\n\nThe email represents the first time that Gruber confirmed what he claimed was the extent of his federal consulting work during the Obama administration \u2014 information that is under subpoena after Gruber refused to fork it over in a recent congressional hearing.\n\nGruber previously concealed his federal contracts during the period in which the White House and the establishment media was promoting his supposedly independent research to help sell Obamacare to Congress.\n\nGruber also refused to tell the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a hearing how much he made as a consultant to the administration, or what his contracts entailed, saying, \u201cI have all sorts of documents. I have paper in front of me.\u201d (RELATED: Gruber Lawyers Up)\n\nGruber recently lost his job at the firm Picwell, which plans to advise state Obamacare exchanges on people\u2019s choices, after his comments calling the American people \u201cstupid\u201d and saying that seniors \u201cdo a terrible job choosing\u201d went viral. (RELATED: Gruber On The Stupidity of the American Voter)\n\nOversight chairman Rep. Darrell Issa subpoenaed all of Gruber\u2019s Obamacare-related documents, including his federal contracts.\n\nSo how much is Gruber, who received numerous contracts from the Clinton and Bush administrations and the government-funded National Bureau of Economic Research, claiming that he got from the Obama administration?\n\nGruber claimed that he currently has \u201cNo federal contracts\u201d in an email exchange with journalist Evan Gahr, which was obtained by TheDC. \u201cI was a technical consultant to the Obama administration for the contracts reported below, but I have had no contracts since,\u201d Gruber wrote.\n\nHere is the contract Gruber confirmed:\n\nGruber received $297,600 from the Department of Health and Human Services in a contract awarded on June 19, 2009.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), intends to negotiate with Jonathan Gruber, Ph.D. on a sole sources basis for technical assistance in evaluating options for national healthcare reform,\u201d stated a federal government database. \u201cThe anticipated contract period will be eight months.\u201d\n\nThe contract was deemed a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of work Gruber was already providing to the department.\n\n\u201cASPE requires a technical memorandum on the estimated changes in health insurance coverage and associated costs and impacts to the government under alternative specifications of health system reform,\u201d according to the database. \u201cThe requirement includes developing estimates of various health reform proposals on health insurance coverage and cost. The alternative specifications to be considered will be derived from the President\u2019s health reform proposal. This project is a continuation of work that Dr. Gruber is currently providing for ASPE.\u201d\n\nWait a second? \u201cContinuation of work that Dr. Gruber is currently providing?\u201d\n\nIt turns out that Gruber received $95,000 as part of this contract before it was even officially awarded, and the $95,000 was apparently not reported on available federal government databases.\n\nA Health and Human Services official said that all of Gruber\u2019s contracts were reported but did not specify where a record of the $95,000 could be found.\n\nAs for the assignment that his contract laid out, Gruber did not exactly do a bang-up job.\n\nGruber later admitted that he never had any clue as to how to control costs in the health care law and that President Obama lied to the American people when he said that the law would control costs.
