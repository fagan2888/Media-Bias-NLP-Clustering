Well, they created a huge mess. They contracted five different people who apparently built their portions while \u201chiding in silos\u201d and never communicating with each other and they built it on 10+ year-old software.\n\nSeton Motley, founder and president of Less Government joins The Heartland Institute to discuss the horrific technical problems of the Obamacare rollout.\n\nFacebook is 9 years old! The first Pirates of the Caribbean came out around the same time that the software for healthcare.gov came out\u2026 Come on! So, how did they spend so much money and still not deliver? Well, Motley offers up the \u201cwallet rule\u201d as explanation \u2014 if you went out on a Friday night with your own wallet, but went out on a Saturday night with someone else\u2019s wallet, which night do you think you\u2019d have more fun on?\n\nThe point is, when you spend other people\u2019s money, you are less frugal, and you care less about the results. And that is what happened to healthcare.gov, and what government almost always does!\n\nWhen asked if the website would ever catch up and work how it\u2019s supposed to work- Motley is not optimistic. He predicts that if the British government can\u2019t pull it off in 9 years and $15 billion, then neither can we.\n\nListen to the podcast in the player above.\n\n[Subscribe to the Heartland Daily Podcast for free at this link.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/heartland-daily-podcast-seton-motley-healthcare-gov-technical-problems/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tech.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Heartland Daily Podcast: Seton Motley \u2013 Healthcare.gov Technical Problems"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "When asked if the website would ever catch up and work how it\u2019s supposed to work- Motley is not optimistic.\nSeton Motley, founder and president of Less Government joins The Heartland Institute to discuss the horrific technical problems of the Obamacare rollout.\n[Subscribe to the Heartland Daily Podcast for free at this link.]\nThe government spent about $634 million on creating healthcare.gov; what did they do with all that money?\nThe point is, when you spend other people\u2019s money, you are less frugal, and you care less about the results."}
