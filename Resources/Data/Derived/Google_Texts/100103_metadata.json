Each could knock the United States off the power grid. These potential disaster strikes can seem daunting.\n\n\u201cThe odds of you being in a terrorist attack are about 1 in 22 billion, or being in any kind of significant disaster,\u201d terrorism expert James Carafano tells The Daily Signal. \u201cBut the fact is, that stuff does happen. It happens all the time. And when it happens, it happens to everyday people like you.\u201d\n\nCarafano, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at The Heritage Foundation and the E.W. Richardson fellow, explains actions to take for disaster preparation in his new book, \u201cSurviving the End: A Practical Guide for Everyday Americans in the Age of Terror.\u201d\n\n>>> Vote for Jim Carafano\u2019s panel to be held at South by Southwest\n\nAccording to Carafano\u2019s research, faith, family, education, and health are attributes needed to best survive a disaster.\n\n\u201cThe person that\u2019s most likely to survive a disaster is a married, high school-educated, church-going, gun-toting yoga instructor,\u201d Carafano said.\n\nHe has proposed a panel on this topic for the 2016 South by Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin, Texas, called \u201cSurvive the End.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you really want to know what families and every American should do, don\u2019t go to a survivalist website,\u201d Carafano says.\n\nHe says survival skills, like how to start a campfire, are not as important as the confidence and resilience that come with faith, responsibility that comes from having a family, and a solid high school education. \u201cNot surprisingly,\u201d healthy people also deal much better with disasters.\n\n\u201cI came at this from a science-driven perspective,\u201d Carafano says. \u201cThe data on this, and the research behind this, is absolutely rock-solid. It\u2019s not about how much food you have stockpiled in your basement. It\u2019s about what kind of person you are.\u201d\n\nAs the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina looms, Carafano points to surveys of who delivered the best care during the aftermath of the storm.\n\n\u201cIt was the local churches and organizations that got together to help people in the communities that were rated as the most responsive and the most effective,\u201d he said of Louisiana.\n\nHe stated that certain communities got through Hurricane Katrina very well, noting that the Vietnamese community was a \u201cprime example.\u201d During this time, the Vietnamese grouped together to support and take care of one another.\n\n\u201cEven within that kind of chaos and mess, you had these elements of faith, family, education, and health.\u201d\n\nJoining Carafano on his proposed SXSW panel are Ericka Andersen Sylvester, digital director at National Review and healthy lifestyle blogger; conservative commentator Stacy Washington; and Lindsey Burke, an education expert and Will Skillman fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe panelists will not discuss how to build barricades and bomb shelters, but rather engage in conversation about having a healthy family, maintaining personal health, how to best educate children, and the role faith plays in society.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an American mom,\u201d proposed panelist Washington tells The Daily Signal. \u201cI really want to be confident that I\u2019m doing all the things that I\u2019m supposed to do to support my family and to protect them. And being prepared is one of those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing prepared is simple to do, and it doesn\u2019t take a ton of your time.\u201d\n\nHaving spoken at SXSW two years ago, Carafano would like to take a conversation back to the conference that gives practical advice anyone can implement.\n\n\u201c[The potential SXSW conference attendees] are going to hear things that are going to make them better people,\u201d he stated. \u201cEven if they\u2019re never in a terrorist attack or never in a disaster, [the things presented] are going to make them happier, better, and more productive citizens. I think it\u2019s a message that really transcends everything.\u201d\n\nIn order for Carafano\u2019s panel to make the cut, he\u2019ll need supporters to vote for it on SXSW\u2019s Panel Picker.\n\n\u201cThis is fundamental lifestyle 101 that I think is important for a generation to really embrace,\u201d said Carafano.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to James Carafano\u2019s research, faith, family, education, and health are attributes needed to best survive a disaster.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "According to James Carafano\u2019s research, faith, family, education, and health are attributes needed to best survive a disaster.", "title": "Are You Prepared When Disaster Strikes?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150828_KatrinaDisaster.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-28T14:09:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Jge274"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "According to James Carafano\u2019s research, faith, family, education, and health are attributes needed to best survive a disaster.", "title": "Are You Prepared When Disaster Strikes?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150828_KatrinaDisaster.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "homeland", "published_time": "2015-08-28T03:01:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-28T14:09:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "disaster preparation, SXSW, terrorist attack, survival skills, terrorism"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16fe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe person that\u2019s most likely to survive a disaster is a married, high school-educated, church-going, gun-toting yoga instructor,\u201d Carafano said.\nThese potential disaster strikes can seem daunting.\n\u201cEven if they\u2019re never in a terrorist attack or never in a disaster, [the things presented] are going to make them happier, better, and more productive citizens.\n\u201cThe odds of you being in a terrorist attack are about 1 in 22 billion, or being in any kind of significant disaster,\u201d terrorism expert James Carafano tells The Daily Signal.\n\u201cThis is fundamental lifestyle 101 that I think is important for a generation to really embrace,\u201d said Carafano."}
