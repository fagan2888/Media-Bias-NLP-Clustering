The U.S. Department of Health and Services Grant will help the health center expand and see more patients.

COVENTRY, RI—Comprehensive Community Action in Cranston is the recipient of a $1 million grant to help the facility expand and serve more people, the state's Congressional delegation announced.

CCAP President and CEO Joanne McGunagle said that the funding will help "CCAP to expand much needed quality and affordable dental services at our Family Health Services of Coventry health center."

The money comes by way of a federal grant through the Affordable Care Act's Community Health Center Fund.

The fund "was extended with bipartisan support in the Medicare Access and CHIP Authorization Act of 2015," according to a news release, and is expected to help provide care to 800,000 new patients nationwide.

“Community health centers are a vital source of health care for many families,” said U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. “This federal funding will expand high-quality primary and preventive care options for thousands of Rhode Islanders who need them most.”

Along with the CCAP dental center in Coventry, Blackstone Valley Community Health Care in Pawtucket and Providence Community Health Centers in Providence will get about $1 million each.

“This is another example of the Affordable Care Act's positive impact on Rhode Island. I am pleased these community health centers are receiving additional federal funds to continue to effectively serve local residents and provide comprehensive, integrated care.‎ This is a smart investment that will help provide patients with better quality health care in a more efficient manner,‎” said U.S. Senator Jack Reed.
