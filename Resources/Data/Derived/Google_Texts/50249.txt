2015 looks like it will go out with a chill.

Temperatures in Denver are not expected to get above freezing for the rest of the year, forecasters for the National Weather Service in Boulder said.

The chilly weather that settled in Saturday is expected to continue through next week, as another cold air system will keep highs hovering in the 20s and lows in the single digits.

“It will be dry Sunday and Monday with temperatures remaining below normal,” the weather service said in a forecast bulletin. “There will be a chance of light snow in the mountains Tuesday through Thursday.”

Tonight’s low in Denver is projected to hit 1 degree.

Sunday’s high in Denver is expected to be near 26 degrees.

On Monday, temperatures are set to top out at about 29 degrees.

Temperatures in the Denver metro area will be slow to warm up on Wednesday and Thursday, said Lisa Kriederman, National Weather Service meteorologist.

The sub-freezing weather should stick around through New Year’s Day, she said.

Temperatures likely could climb above freezing on Jan. 2, she added.
