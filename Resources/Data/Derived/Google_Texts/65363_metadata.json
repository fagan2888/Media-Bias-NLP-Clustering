Trouble is, Inuits who eat beluga don't necessarily cook it thoroughly, the BBC reports.\n\nToxoplasma gondii has turned up in more than 10% of belugas living in the Beaufort Sea off Canada, the Smithsonian notes. A health advisory has been issued to Inuits living in the area. How did a cat parasite manage to reach Arctic belugas?
