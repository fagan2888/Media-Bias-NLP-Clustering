The mask drew instant comparisons to Batman, the Phantom of the Opera, the Green Hornet, Hannibal Lecter and others \u2013 firing up a social media explosion and even its own Twitter handle.\n\nNow LeBron has bowed to the NBA\u2019s request that he leave the black mask at home for tonight\u2019s game against the Orlando Magic.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon LeBron agreed to wear a more traditional clear mask. (Rules are rules in the NBA, after all.) But there\u2019s rampant speculation LeBron may somehow \u201cpersonalize\u201d whatever see-through mask he wears in tonight\u2019s game \u2013 and fans are ablaze.\n\nThe Miami Heat coach, Erik Spoelstra, told ESPN about the black mask, \u201cI liked the look of it. It looked menacing. As long as he was aggressive, that was the big key.\u201d\n\nRelated: Slide Show - 9 Sports Superstars You've Never Heard Of\n\nJames, who called the mask \u201ca success,\u201d scored 31 points Thursday night against the Knicks with four rebounds and four assists. He \u201cplayed like Batman out there,\u201d said Chris Bosh, the Heat\u2019s center. The Heat smashed the Knicks 108-82.\n\nWhatever James does, he tends to attract high-wattage attention. This year alone James, 29, will earn $19 million in salary from the Heat and about $45 million in endorsements. The NBA star made more in endorsements last year than the top 10 Major League Baseball players combined, according to Forbes.\n\nAn instant memorabilia item from the Heat \u2013 a must-have $25 T-shirt \u2013 shows a close-up of LeBron in the menacing mask. The Heat\u2019s pitch is this: \u201cShow everyone that you\u2019ve seen LeBron play in his black mask with this Miami HEAT LeBron James Mask T-shirt \u2026 This is a must-have for real LeBron fans!\u201d\n\nJames told reporters he chose the darker model because it matched the Heat\u2019s black uniforms and was made of a carbon-fiber material that \u201cis actually lighter than the ones I\u2019ve been wearing in practice, so I went with it,\u201d James said. He\u2019ll need protective nose gear for several weeks after fracturing his nose in a game on Feb. 20.\n\nThe South Florida company that made LeBron\u2019s black mask also created a lighter version he could have worn against the Knicks. In addition, James reportedly had a traditional clear fiberglass mask in his locker on Thursday.\n\nHe\u2019s not the first NBA player to have to hang up a non-clear protective mask. Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving wore one last year to protect a broken nose but was asked to change it out for a clear version. Kobe Bryant of the L.A. Lakers also briefly wore a black mask in 2012 after breaking his nose.\n\nStill, LeBron, always a major draw both on and off the court, is now potentially garnering a whole new fan base for his masked-man appeal \u2013 as well as companies with dreams of dollar signs. \u201cI got a good feeling I\u2019ll be receiving some emails from mask makers who will make me whatever I want,\u201d said James with a smile after Thursday night\u2019s game. Stay tuned. (Update: James wore a clear plain mask Saturday night against the Magic, scoring 20 points and grabbing 9 rebounds and 7 assists in the Heat's 112-98 victory.)\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\nThis article was updated on March 2, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Leave it to LeBron James, one of the most dominant players ever in professional basket", "title": "LeBron James\u2019s Black Mask Hits An NBA Nerve", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/01/LeBron-James-s-Black-Mask-Hits-NBA-Nerve", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03012014_Lebron_James.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/01/LeBron-James-s-Black-Mask-Hits-NBA-Nerve", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03012014_Lebron_James.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Leave it to LeBron James, one of the most dominant players ever in professional basket", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4fc\"", "article_summary": "Now LeBron has bowed to the NBA\u2019s request that he leave the black mask at home for tonight\u2019s game against the Orlando Magic.\nThe Miami Heat coach, Erik Spoelstra, told ESPN about the black mask, \u201cI liked the look of it.\nThe South Florida company that made LeBron\u2019s black mask also created a lighter version he could have worn against the Knicks.\nKobe Bryant of the L.A.
