On the eve of the 2014 NB3 Challenge golf tournament, Notah Begay III presented the honor to Anderson for his ongoing investment in addressing the public health concerns facing Native Americans.\n\nRELATED: Team International Wins NB3 Challenge, But Native Youth True Winners\n\n\u201cI am truly honored to represent the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux and accept this award on behalf of the Community,\u201d said SMSC Vice Chairman Keith Anderson. \u201cWith health as one of the cornerstones of our giving priorities, we are proud of the longstanding partnership we have with Notah Begay III, and the remarkable work his foundation has done aimed at reversing the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes among our Native children.\u201d\n\nAnderson and SMSC, located in Minnesota, have been longtime supporters and early investors in NB3F since 2009. In 2013, both helped Begay\u2019s foundation take a major step by providing a founding investment in Native Strong: Healthy Kids, Healthy Futures, a national initiative focused on providing grants to support promising community prevention programs, cutting-edge research and advocacy efforts to fight the public health crisis facing Native children. Through this program, NB3F has since awarded $600,000 in grants and technical assistance to impact 20 tribal communities across seven states.\n\n\u201cDue to Keith\u2019s championship of the Notah Begay III Foundation, the Shakopee tribe made an early investment that enabled us to leverage more than $1 million from additional partners to support our critical and unique work on behalf of the lives of Native children,\u201d said Begay, four-time PGA TOUR winner, NBC/Golf Channel analyst and NB3F founder. \u201cThank you, Keith, for sharing our vision to bring promising solutions to better the health and wellness of Native American children to the forefront.\u201d\n\nAnderson and SMSC are long-time philanthropic leaders and over the last 22 years, have given more than $290 million in grants and charitable contributions to tribes and nonprofit organizations across the country.\n\nThe NB3 Challenge provided an appropriate backdrop for the award presentation, as it is the largest annual fundraiser for NB3F, which addresses the health and wellness issues facing Native American children \u2013 notably the disproportionate incidences of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In its first six years, the event has generated more than $5 million, helping the Foundation serve more than 20,000 Native children and families in 13 states through strategic grant making, research and advocacy.\n\nThe Oneida Indian Nation Health Champion for Native Children Award honors exemplary and selfless contributions to the health and well-being of Native American children. The award symbolizes both the undeterred leadership and altruism required to ensure that Native Americans\u2019 most valued asset \u2013 children \u2013 have what they need to thrive and to carry on treasured cultural ways for generations to come. NB3F presents this award annually to honor outstanding tribes, tribal leaders and other champions of children\u2019s health. Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter received the inaugural award in 2013.\n\nFor more information about NB3F, its work in Native communities and the NB3 Challenge, visit: www.nb3foundation.org or donate online here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Keith Anderson was honored with the second annual Oneida Indian Nation Health Champion for Native Children Award, presented by the NB3 Foundation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/06/nb3-foundation-honors-keith-anderson-native-health-support-156716", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/notah_begay_iii_presents_keith_anderson_smsc_vice_chair_with_award_2014_-_courtesy_jason_myers_nb3_foundation1.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "NB3 Foundation Honors Keith Anderson for Native Health Support"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-06T12:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "NB3 Foundation Honors Keith Anderson for Native Health Support"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/06/nb3-foundation-honors-keith-anderson-native-health-support-156716", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Notah Begay III, Notah Begay III Foundation, NB3 Foundation, Notah Begay III Foundation Challenge, NB3 Challenge, Ray Halbritter, Oneida Indian Nation, Keith Anderson, Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, Oneida Indian Nation Health Champion for Native Children Award, Native Youth, Native American Health", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "NB3 Foundation Honors Keith Anderson for Native Health Support"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32ac\"", "article_summary": "The Oneida Indian Nation Health Champion for Native Children Award honors exemplary and selfless contributions to the health and well-being of Native American children.\nThe Notah Begay III Foundation (NB3F) is proud to recognize Keith Anderson of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) with the second annual Oneida Indian Nation Health Champion for Native Children Award.\nOn the eve of the 2014 NB3 Challenge golf tournament, Notah Begay III presented the honor to Anderson for his ongoing investment in addressing the public health concerns facing Native Americans.\nFor more information about NB3F, its work in Native communities and the NB3 Challenge, visit: www.nb3foundation.org or donate online here.\nRELATED: Team International Wins NB3 Challenge, But Native Youth True Winners\u201cI am truly honored to represent the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux and accept this award on behalf of the Community,\u201d said SMSC Vice Chairman Keith Anderson."}
