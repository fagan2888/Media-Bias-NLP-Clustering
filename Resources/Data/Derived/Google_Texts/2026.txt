The Shawnee County Coroner's Office says a man suspected of carjacking two vehicles before he was shot by police earlier this month has died.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports 38-year-old Richard B. Reed of Maple Hill died at a local hospital Saturday, according to a representative from the coroner's office.

Reed was taken to a hospital April 10.

Topeka police responded that morning to a reported carjacking. The suspect was gone but was seen driving erratically half an hour later before he lost control and crashed.

Police say Reed started shooting at officers before carjacking a second vehicle. They say he was spotted driving a short time later, rammed two cars and fired again at police before being shot by officers.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting.
