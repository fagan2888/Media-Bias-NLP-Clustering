Sunday morning to protest the closure of the memorials during the partial government shutdown, throwing barricades placed in front of the memorials aside in heaps.\n\nOrganized by Brats for Veterans Advocacy, the Million Vet March on the Memorials drew in a crowd of vocal veterans fed up with the federal government\u2019s shutdown decisions waving enormous American and \u201cDon\u2019t Tread On Me\u201d flags and signs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally, thoroughly disgusted in our government\u2019s decision to close these monuments,\u201d said retired Army Green Beret Mike Freeman, who served in Vietnam.\n\nRetired Master Sergeant Jim Hanson also expressed his anger with the closures, telling The Daily Caller that veterans have every right to visit memorials erected in their honor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace to close this memorial,\u201d Hanson said, indicating the World War II memorial. \u201cIt cost more to close it than to let the veterans pay their respects. The government is not in charge of keeping people out of monuments that were put here in their own honor.\u201d\n\nAn African-American vet who asked to remain unnamed was dismayed that patriotic commemorations were caught in partisan crossfire and that more black veterans were not joining in the protest.\n\n\u201cI think that things are getting bad when they can find the money to fund academy football teams but can\u2019t find the money to give to widows and dead soldiers\u2019 families. That\u2019s just wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cMy only regret is that there\u2019s not a lot more black veterans here today. It\u2019s not a black or a white thing, it\u2019s not a Republican or a Democrat thing \u2014 it\u2019s a right or wrong thing. I\u2019m here today because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz all made appearances to thank the vets for their service and rail against the Obama administration and the closure of the memorials.\n\nCruz later blamed Democrats for the ongoing impasse over the partial government shutdown, criticizing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for striking down legislation meant to fund normal functions of government but strip funding from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI think the Democrats are trying very hard to change the subject, because they don\u2019t want to discuss the fact that House Republicans have repeatedly voted to fund vital government priorities and President Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, refused to compromise for weeks,\u201d Cruz told The Daily Caller. \u201cLegislation that would open every memorial, every federal park has been sitting on Harry Reid\u2019s desk. He refuses to allow the Senate to vote.\u201d\n\nCruz quickly pivoted back to Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Katie McHugh", "description": "Enraged vets carry 'Don't Tread on Me' signs as Palin, Cruz and Lee offer support", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Veterans from all over the country gathered at the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.
