(Photo: Nick Oza /The Republic)\n\nMaricopa Integrated Health System's cash reserves have fallen more than $40 million in the last two years. What happened?\n\nSimply put, $50 million in federal funding to offset our high cost of uncompensated care expired in December 2013.\n\nIn addition, the state makes a policy decision each year to divert federal dollars Arizona receives to pay for uncompensated care. This money is intended to support safety net hospitals like ours, but is instead placed in the state's general fund to balance its budget. In 2016 alone, that number is $74 million.\n\nYour critics say you should have seen this coming. Did you?\n\nYes, but the loss of federal funding was supposed to be offset by Medicaid restoration and the stand up of the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, that fell significantly short.\n\nHow has the change in your patient mix affected finances?\n\nAs Arizona's only public safety net hospital, our level of uncompensated care is higher than any single hospital in the state and one of the highest in the nation.\n\nNinety percent of our patients have either no payer source or a substantially reduced government payer source. This is not sustainable financially.\n\nSteve Purves (Photo: handout)\n\nWhat are you doing to right the ship?\n\nWe are doing everything we can. We are looking at our health system from top to bottom for ways to cut costs, improve efficiency, increase cash flow and improve services to our patients.\n\nHowever, we cannot fulfill our historic safety net mission through cuts alone. As long as the state keeps federal funds meant to pay for our patients' care, we will be challenged to continue this critical mission.\n\nWill voters be asked to help out?\n\nNo. The tax levy to support our uncompensated care is capped at approximately $65 million annually. However, this covers only a fraction of the uncompensated care we provide. We must find other solutions.\n\nVoters approved a bond issue to rebuild the hospital. What's the status of that?\n\nWe're grateful for the overwhelming support for Proposition 480, which provides capital funds for us to build a better safety net system of care and a teaching hospital for the future.\n\nOur board has been studying best practices on how to approach this important work. We will continue to engage the community in this process. The board will only access these funds after we start to see results from our cost cutting efforts.\n\nWhat would be the alternative if MIHS went under?\n\nNone of the alternatives are good. We are the state's only safety net health care system and we serve 500,000 patients a year. The question is: Where would they go and what would be the impact on other health care providers?\n\nOther significant impacts would include:\n\n\u2014 Maricopa County would lose the community's largest treatment centers for the seriously mentally ill.\n\n\u2014 400 physicians in training would be left to find other sponsors.\n\n\u2014 2,000 clinical training rotations for nurses, therapists and the military would disappear.\n\n\u2014 $834 million per year in economic benefit would be lost to the state.\n\n\u2014 The state's budget would lose access to hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1yDeVF9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Into the Mind: President and CEO of Maricopa Integrated Health System Steve Purves discusses the organization's financial woes.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Into the Mind: President and CEO of Maricopa Integrated Health System Steve Purves discusses the organization's financial woes.", "title": "Maricopa Integrated Health System is bleeding cash", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2015/04/17/fulfill-historic-safety-net-mission-cuts-alone/25893673/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Into the Mind: President and CEO of Maricopa Integrated Health System Steve Purves discusses the organization's financial woes.", "title": "Maricopa Integrated Health System is bleeding cash", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9437358b1df017e953bd9824c847a3845ac1e556/c=823-0-4083-3261&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/08/30/1409408266000-Maricopa-Medical-Center.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Public health and safety", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Public health and safety", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Maricopa Integrated Health System is bleeding cash", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/175605fd798f6953db99ae946bb8f13c497a3ce9/c=1224-0-3672-3261/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/08/30/1409408266000-Maricopa-Medical-Center.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/09f526be16a8697d77ad8ed9a937364d2f908008/c=823-0-4083-3261/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/08/30/1409408266000-Maricopa-Medical-Center.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79cee319eecc56c172ad34df6a70043b88b7bf08/c=284-0-4622-3261/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/08/30/1409408266000-Maricopa-Medical-Center.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fbb804ef4f28cfe11f924c7f44d59ad4dcfe6de0/c=0-255-4896-3016&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/08/30/1409408266000-Maricopa-Medical-Center.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-17T16:40:52.190000-07:00", "shorthed": "Into the Mind: MIHS is bleeding cash", "articleid": 25893673, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/071306ad679a2e0dedb19737315d17b863286009/c=0-255-4896-3016/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/08/30/1409408266000-Maricopa-Medical-Center.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ba8595fadddf7670677fc461c30110d690b0eae/c=1537-0-3359-3261/local/-/media/Phoenix/GenericImages/2014/08/30/1409408266000-Maricopa-Medical-Center.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "MIHS, Maricopa Integrated Health Systems, healthcare, free hospitals, arizona healthcare"}, "article_summary": "Into the Mind: President and CEO of Maricopa Integrated Health System Steve Purves discusses the organization's financial woes.\nWe are the state's only safety net health care system and we serve 500,000 patients a year.\nWe are looking at our health system from top to bottom for ways to cut costs, improve efficiency, increase cash flow and improve services to our patients.\nThe question is: Where would they go and what would be the impact on other health care providers?\n(Photo: Nick Oza /The Republic)Maricopa Integrated Health System's cash reserves have fallen more than $40 million in the last two years."}
