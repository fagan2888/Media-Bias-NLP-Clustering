But Obama didn\u2019t announce anything dramatic and instead said he wants to see the VA Inspector General\u2019s report on the issue before making any decisions.\n\nObama said he met with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki this morning, but in his remarks, Obama did not say he would look for a change in leadership at the VA, as many have demanded.\n\nObama said he would \u201cnot tolerate\u201d problems of ensuring veterans have access to healthcare services, even though those problems have been known for years. He also said officials would be held accountable at the VA, but was not more specific.\n\nThe lack of any concrete announcement led to heavy GOP criticism, including from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), who said Obama is \u201cknown for talking about accountability without ever holding anyone accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President has paid sparse attention to this crisis or the veterans impacted,\u201d Cantor said. In contrast, he noted that the House later Wednesday would pass a bill making it easier for Shinseki to fire people involved in the scandal.\n\n\u201cToday, the House will pass a bill that gives Secretary Shinseki the authority to terminate the employment of incompetent senior leaders at the VA,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Senate should pass it swiftly so President Obama and Secretary Shinseki can start utilizing that authority. Time is of the essence, for the sake of our veterans who deserve better.\u201d\n\nSenior leaders at the VA must be held accountable, and the White House must continue to answer for the treatment of our veterans. \u2014 Eric Cantor (@GOPLeader) May 21, 2014\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) also called on the Senate to quickly pass the House bill.\n\n\u201cI urge the president to call on his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate to act on this bill immediately. The president has made a lot of promises to our veterans. It\u2019s time to keep them.\u201d\n\nSeveral other Republicans tweeted out their own reactions to the president\u2019s speech:\n\nFor someone like @BarackObama who loves big gov\u2019t & views it as the solution to all our problems, he sure does a terrible job running it\u2026 \u2014 Rep. Jeff Duncan (@RepJeffDuncan) May 21, 2014\n\nWhere were these investigators when Obama was first told of #VA record falsification in 2008, before at least 40 veterans died? #pjnet \u2014 Rep. Steve Stockman (@SteveWorks4You) May 21, 2014\n\nPres. Obama says he will not stand for these actions in the VA but does not say what punishments will be for those who did. #emptythreats \u2014 Rep.
