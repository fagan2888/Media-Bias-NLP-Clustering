It committed to offloading unprofitable state firms including the RTB Bor copper mine, the Resavica coal mine, and the Zelezara Smederevo steel mill.\n\n\"In 2016, the government has a big responsibility ... not to loosen restrictions,\" the Fiscal Council said.\n\nCouncil member Vladimir Vuckovic said the government should push ahead with plans to trim as many as 54,000 jobs in the public sector over the next two years. Public sector wages and pensions would be kept at the present level, Vuckovic told the forum.\n\nhas expressed interest in investing in. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said on Tuesday that the government hopes for a successful sale of Zelezara Smederevo and will continue to seek a solution for RTB Bor.
