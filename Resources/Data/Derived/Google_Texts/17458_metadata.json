To some observers, it is generic \u2014 Heather Havrilesky at BuzzFeed wrote a scathing diatribe against the show for embodying \u201cthe apotheosis of hipster family awfulness.\u201d As someone who typically is the first to complain about self-absorbed, affluent white-people stories taking center stage, it\u2019s amazing how little I agreed with her point of view. Aside from the obvious part \u2014 which is that she didn\u2019t like the show \u2014 Havrilesky\u2019s specific complaint is that the characters of \u201cTogetherness\u201d aren\u2019t \u201cregular people\u201d \u2014 they are instead \u201cmiserable, spoiled jerks\u201d who aren\u2019t self-aware enough to know that they\u2019re the aforementioned miserable, spoiled jerks.\n\nThat stayed with me when I re-watched the excellent season finale of \u201cTogetherness,\u201d which airs Sunday night. It\u2019s a gorgeous, heartbreaking episode of television, one that is immediately in contention for one of the best episodes of the year. It chronicles the rupture of what the characters throughout the first season have been fiercely clinging to \u2014 the Pierson marriage, Alex and Tina\u2019s undeniable chemistry, and these four people\u2019s lives together in Los Angeles.\n\nThe finale starts with Brett (Mark Duplass), Michelle (Melanie Lynskey), Alex (Steve Zissis), Tina (Amanda Peet) and even the kids Sophie and Frankie in a convivial mood at the dinner table. It ends with each of them in a separate, enclosed space \u2014 not just apart, but slowly moving farther away from each other, like our own red-shift universe. The exact hows and whys of their dissolution has been the work of the whole season \u2014 Michelle\u2019s growing interest in the charter school as a way to find her voice and connect to her community after taking several years off from the working world; Tina\u2019s fear of really risking her heart in a relationship; Alex\u2019s apathetic approach to his acting career. But by the last minutes of Sunday\u2019s episode, the damage has been done, and no more words are necessary. Instead \u201cTogetherness\u201d resorts to a montage, set to James Blake\u2019s \u201cThe Wilhelm Scream.\u201d It is stunning \u2014 haunting, and beautiful, and tragic, and just so, so well-executed.\n\nJames Blake is a 26-year-old British musician whose style is notoriously difficult to define, even for Blake himself. It\u2019s technically dubstep, and technically electronica, but doesn\u2019t really sound like either; a more mainstream analogue might be Beck, who, like Blake, uses hip-hop beats and electronic modes of production, like sampling, to create a distinctive sound. The first beats of \u201cThe Wilhelm Scream\u201d are staccato and muted \u2014 so by the time the viewer realizes it\u2019s a song in the background, and not just a variation on the \u201cTogetherness\u201d\u2019 score, you\u2019re already in.\n\n\u201cThe Wilhelm Scream\u201d starts playing when Brett, realizing his marriage is on the edge of a knife, packs the kids off with a babysitter and starts driving north to Sacramento. But the moment you realize it\u2019s a song is when Zissis\u2019 character Alex stares slightly off-frame, sitting in his airline seat. \u201cTogetherness\u201d has been a revelation both for Alex, the character, and Zissis, the actor \u2014 a breakout moment for Alex in this season of the show corresponds with Zissis\u2019 rising profile, as many viewers are getting to know him for the first time (including myself). It makes his moment of silence here more poignant than most, as this character, and this actor, and we, the audience, recognize that there is power and talent present. For a brief moment, it seems like Alex can hear the music, can see it\u2019s too late, can feel the tragedy unfolding. It\u2019s an elegant bit of foreshadowing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tonight's season finale is gorgeous, self-aware and as gut-wrenching as the infamous Wilhelm Scream", "title": "If you\u2019re not watching \u201cTogetherness,\u201d you\u2019re missing some of the best TV of the year", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tonight's season finale is gorgeous, self-aware and as gut-wrenching as the infamous Wilhelm Scream", "title": "If you\u2019re not watching \u201cTogetherness,\u201d you\u2019re missing some of the best TV of the year", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/08/if_youre_not_watching_togetherness_youre_missing_some_of_the_best_tv_of_the_year/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/togetherness3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tonight's season finale is gorgeous, self-aware and as gut-wrenching as the infamous Wilhelm Scream", "title": "If you\u2019re not watching \u201cTogetherness,\u201d you\u2019re missing some of the best TV of the year", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/togetherness3.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amanda Peet, Editor's Picks, HBO, james blake, jay duplass, manish raval, mark duplass, melanie lynskey, steve zissis, the wilhelm scream, togetherness, Tom Wolfe", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4f4\"", "article_summary": "That stayed with me when I re-watched the excellent season finale of \u201cTogetherness,\u201d which airs Sunday night.\n\u201cThe Wilhelm Scream\u201d starts playing when Brett, realizing his marriage is on the edge of a knife, packs the kids off with a babysitter and starts driving north to Sacramento.\nInstead \u201cTogetherness\u201d resorts to a montage, set to James Blake\u2019s \u201cThe Wilhelm Scream.\u201d It is stunning \u2014 haunting, and beautiful, and tragic, and just so, so well-executed.\nThe first beats of \u201cThe Wilhelm Scream\u201d are staccato and muted \u2014 so by the time the viewer realizes it\u2019s a song in the background, and not just a variation on the \u201cTogetherness\u201d\u2019 score, you\u2019re already in.\nBut the moment you realize it\u2019s a song is when Zissis\u2019 character Alex stares slightly off-frame, sitting in his airline seat."}
