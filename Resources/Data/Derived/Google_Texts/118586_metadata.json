All of these factors result in a world in which flexibility, not continuity, is paramount. Other labor dispatching technologies and platforms are emerging that only promise more change in the direction of job atomization. The rise of new technology platforms like Uber and Homejoy has combined to make labor both more plentiful for organizations and more accessible to potential job seekers. For instance, an aspiring cabbie once had to pass byzantine hackney exams and lay out a fortune in licensure costs before he could collect his first passenger. An Uber driver only needs to pass a DMV test and own a smartphone. With these trends in place, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a world where work and workers are more independent and entrepreneurial.\n\nWell-adapted companies can thrive in that world, Wolf explains. \u201cWe know that career and job mobility is what people are looking for. Our analysis shows that the people who\u2019ve taken multiple jobs over time at Credit Suisse tend to stay and perform well.\u201d In order to keep them that way, Credit Suisse has established Internals First, a company-wide placement effort that encourages existing employees to make job or career changes within the bank. Rather than lose valued professionals to other firms\u2014and pay the millions in turnover costs that inevitably result\u2014Credit Suisse recruiters identify qualified candidates and redeploy them into new roles through Internals First.\n\nInternals First is one initiative supporting a distinct concept of career advancement at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe nature of work is changing, and the social contract is changing,\u201d Wolf says. \u201cWe\u2019re defining career support and growth in a different way. We say, \u2018As an employee you have a portfolio of experience, and we\u2019re the company that helps you enrich that portfolio.\u2019\u201d The components of a career portfolio are formal education, on-the-job experience, and networks, and each can be meticulously enhanced during an employee\u2019s time with the company. Top managing directors, for instance, are selected for intensive portfolio-enhancing program. One such program\u2014the Talent Agency\u2014teams top performers five or six at a time to tackle complex projects even while it assists them in cultivating professional networks. Other initiatives offer skill-building classes and executive coaching.\n\nThis kind of proactive approach is exactly what\u2019s necessary to not only retain talent, but also to profit from its more efficient application. Regardless of the broader developments that have accelerated churn and shortened job tenures, a huge swath of the working-age population has simply gotten used to the idea of fewer guarantees: They anticipate a steady stream of new challenges and are increasingly intolerant of feeling stymied at their jobs. According to a 2012 study conducted by Future Workplace, over 90 percent of the Millennials now flooding America\u2019s lower occupational ranks expect to leave their jobs within three years. The benefit of all this increased mobility can be detected in workers\u2019 higher sense of fulfillment and fresh perspective. On the other hand, employees who are not presented with choices on the job\u2014to experiment in another department, say, or form a new team\u2014will eventually choose to leave.\n\nYoung women are the most likely cohort to make that decision, frequently by opting out of the workforce altogether. The choice to quit or move to part time in order to raise a family can limit their options and deprive their employers of blossoming talent. \u201cEvery institution struggles to keep women tracking into senior management. Banks tend to struggle with this especially,\u201d Wolf says. To address the problem, Credit Suisse has instituted its Real Returns program. Soliciting resumes from qualified women who have taken extended time off from professional life, the company extends ten-week \u201creturnships\u201d to gauge their skills and entice them back into the office. The program has been an unqualified success, placing its accepted applicants in roles in New York and London. The company aims to permanently retain 70 percent of Real Returns graduates.\n\nIn all its strategies, Credit Suisse intends to optimize the value of its human capital by allowing it more room to develop on its own. Wolf explains, \u201cWe\u2019ve observed some things about the changing nature of the workforce. We\u2019re restructuring our deliveries, the way we grow and develop people here, to play to that reality. It\u2019s not a journey, it\u2019s not a ladder, it\u2019s not a staircase.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Companies are helping young employees find multiple career paths", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "SPONSORED CONTENT: The sequence of a career used to be so simple.", "title": "Millennials Don't Want to Climb the Traditional Ladder", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/17505641e503f9bfd8e9b9028c998955fe293e9f.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/118883/millennials-dont-want-climb-traditional-career-ladder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/17505641e503f9bfd8e9b9028c998955fe293e9f.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Millennials Don't Want to Climb the Traditional Ladder", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "SPONSORED CONTENT: The sequence of a career used to be so simple."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/17505641e503f9bfd8e9b9028c998955fe293e9f.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Millennials Don't Want to Climb the Traditional Ladder \",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/118883/millennials-dont-want-climb-traditional-career-ladder\",\"section\":\"Sponsored Content\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-30T04:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":118883,\"author\":\"The New Republic Staff\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Sponsored Content\",\"Future of Work\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Sponsored Content", "published_time": "2014-07-30"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2b1\"", "article_summary": "Internals First is one initiative supporting a distinct concept of career advancement at Credit Suisse.\nIn all its strategies, Credit Suisse intends to optimize the value of its human capital by allowing it more room to develop on its own.\nTo address the problem, Credit Suisse has instituted its Real Returns program.\nWell-adapted companies can thrive in that world, Wolf explains.\n\u201cWe know that career and job mobility is what people are looking for."}
