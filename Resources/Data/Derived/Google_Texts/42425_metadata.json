Of that amount, three quarters will shift from the state health insurance programs, Catamount and VHAP, which end Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cAnybody coming in from Catamount or Medicaid won\u2019t pay a premium,\u201d said Mark Larson, commissioner of Vermont Health Access. \u201cThey\u2019ll have more expansive coverage, including things like a limited dental benefit and non-emergency transportation services.\u201d\n\nOne of the other two major drivers of Medicaid growth is an increase in the eligibility level. Currently, only Vermonters earning up to the federal poverty level can qualify. For an individual, that\u2019s an annual income of $11,490, and it\u2019s $23,550 for a family of four.\n\nIn 2014, Vermonters earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level will be able to draw down Medicaid benefits. This is due to the Shumlin administration\u2019s taking advantage of a section in the Affordable Care Act. On paper, the new threshold is 133 percent of the federal poverty level, but the state will allow for 5 percent wiggle room.\n\nThat means that an individual earning up to about $15,800 and a family of four earning up to $32,500 should be eligible for Medicaid in 2014.\n\nThe other major cause for the increase is that the Affordable Care Act makes the state use a line from the U.S. tax return to evaluate income eligibility. Rather than using a series of complicated calculations, Vermont will use the modified adjusted gross income of residents to determine their Medicaid eligibility.\n\nTrinka Kerr, Vermont\u2019s Health Care Ombudsman, says her office has worked for years with dairy farmers earning less than the federal poverty level, who were denied Medicaid benefits because they owned large assets.\n\n\u201cThat often meant they went uninsured,\u201d she said.\n\nModified adjusted gross income allows for deductions such as tuition, student loan interest and certain self-employment expenses.\n\nPeter Sterling is the director of Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security and an advocate for universal health care coverage. He says that sole proprietors will benefit from this measurement because it doesn\u2019t penalize them for their assets, and it allows them to account for the depreciation of their assets.\n\n\u201cThat is a huge deal for a plumber, or a carpenter, a farmer, people in the trades. It\u2019s a big, big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir adjusted gross income looks a lot bigger on paper than their modified adjusted gross income. Modified adjusted gross income more accurately reflects what your typical self-employed person in the trades is actually bringing home.\u201d\n\nMedicaid will also expand to another key population: adults without children.\n\n\u201cRight now, if you are an adult, you would not even be eligible for Medicaid unless you had children, were disabled or were elderly,\u201d Kerr said.\n\nShe also notes that the change in calculation for the state\u2019s primary Medicaid program would not affect two subsets of the program.\n\n\u201cThis change does not apply to long-term care Medicaid or the Medicaid for the disabled that exist now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have their own income rules; they don\u2019t use this new modified adjusted gross income stuff.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, medicaid, vermont health care ombudsman, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "About 40,000 Vermonters will become eligible for Medicaid\u2019s free or low-cost coverage in 2014, most migrating from Catamount and VHAP.", "title": "State projects more Vermonters will qualify for Medicaid", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Medicaid.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-18T15:10:01+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2013/10/18/state-projects-vermonters-will-qualify-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "About 40,000 Vermonters will become eligible for Medicaid\u2019s free or low-cost coverage in 2014, most migrating from Catamount and VHAP.", "creator": "@andrewcstein", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Medicaid.jpg?fit=800%2C600", "title": "State projects more Vermonters will qualify for Medicaid", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Medicaid, Affordable Care Act, Vermont health care ombudsman", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Vermont health care ombudsman", "published_time": "2013-10-18T12:17:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-18T15:10:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb313\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTheir adjusted gross income looks a lot bigger on paper than their modified adjusted gross income.\nPeter Sterling is the director of Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security and an advocate for universal health care coverage.\n\u201cThis change does not apply to long-term care Medicaid or the Medicaid for the disabled that exist now,\u201d she said.\nOf that amount, three quarters will shift from the state health insurance programs, Catamount and VHAP, which end Jan. 1.\n\u201cThey have their own income rules; they don\u2019t use this new modified adjusted gross income stuff.\u201d"}
