This facility will be the equivalent of going to a community gym.\u201d\n\nPeople with disabilities can live full, rich and active lives, but they have to include activities that promote not only physical health but also physical health with psychological and social health, like yoga and Pilates classes. Unfortunately, people with disabilities have limited access to those activities because facilities don\u2019t accommodate their needs, Thompson said.\n\n\u201cBut the equipment in our wellness center will be accessible to people in wheelchairs, and our classes will be taught at a level to accommodate patients,\u201d she said.\n\nThe wellness and aquatics center is scheduled to open August 2016, and Rancho Los Amigos\u2019 entire 42-acre renovation will be completed by 2020.\n\nThe hospital will remain open and fully functional during the five-year construction project.\n\nWhen completed, the wellness center will include a therapy swimming pool with underwater treadmill, weight-lifting room, dance studio, cardio and yoga rooms. The wellness center also will feature a peer-mentoring program that will encourage patients to stay active, Thompson said.\n\nMany of these patients are at higher risk for diabetes, bone density loss, depression and cardiovascular disease because they have limited mobility, she said.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a support system where people feel comfortable and confident to work out,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIf patients see other people with disabilities working hard and helping themselves, it motivates them to do it.\n\n\u201cWe want them to make it a part of their daily routine, which will help them live a healthier life,\u201d she said.\n\nRancho Los Amigos is the only Los Angeles County Health Services Department hospital providing specialized care for people with disabilities, including spinal cord and brain injuries, strokes, neurological disorders and physical and developmental disorders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe construction and renovation project will increase patient accessibility to the hospital\u2019s outpatient and inpatient services, which are each spread among three buildings. When construction is completed, the each of the services will be housed in just one building, said Jorge Orozco, Rancho Los Amigos\u2019 chief executive officer.\n\nThe extra, vacant buildings then will be demolished, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d Orozco said.\n\nThe historic Harriman Building will be refurbished.\n\n\u201cThis is a new mission,\u201d said Dr. Mindy Aisen, Rancho Los Amigos chief medical officer. \u201cThe mission from the federal government and part of the Affordable Care Act is to take care of patients in a coordinated fashion, integrated primary care.\n\n\u201cHaving doctors\u2019 offices closer to each other is much more effective. Physicians and therapists can collaborate more easily,\u201d Aisen said. \u201cThis will be the patient\u2019s medical home, one place for all things health-related.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the construction project, call the Rancho Los Amigos hotline, which is available in English and Spanish, at 562-219-4771.\n\nContact Phillip Zonkel at 562-714-2098.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DOWNEY >> Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center is undergoing a massive $418 million renovation and expansion that includes a 12,000-square-foot wellness and aquatics center", "title": "Downey\u2019s Rancho Los Amigos getting a $418M expansion, renovation", "og": {"url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/health/20150815/downeys-rancho-los-amigos-getting-a-418m-expansion-renovation", "image": {"width": "1133px", "identifier": "http://www.presstelegram.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LB/20150815/NEWS/150818504/AR/0/AR-150818504.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "515px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Downey\u2019s Rancho Los Amigos getting a $418M expansion, renovation"}, "twitter": {"domain": "presstelegram.com", "description": "DOWNEY >> Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center is undergoing a massive $418 million renovation and expansion that includes a 12,000-square-foot wellness and aquatics center", "title": "Downey\u2019s Rancho Los Amigos getting a $418M expansion, renovation", "url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/health/20150815/downeys-rancho-los-amigos-getting-a-418m-expansion-renovation", "image": {"src": "http://www.presstelegram.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LB/20150815/NEWS/150818504/AR/0/AR-150818504.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@presstelegram", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551754518", "iphone": "id502958939", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.longbeachpresstelegram"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Downey,Los Angeles County,rancho los amigos,spinal cord injury, Spinal cord injuries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Downey,Los Angeles County,rancho los amigos,spinal cord injury, Spinal cord injuries"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a new mission,\u201d said Dr. Mindy Aisen, Rancho Los Amigos chief medical officer.\nWhen construction is completed, the each of the services will be housed in just one building, said Jorge Orozco, Rancho Los Amigos\u2019 chief executive officer.\nThe wellness and aquatics center is scheduled to open August 2016, and Rancho Los Amigos\u2019 entire 42-acre renovation will be completed by 2020.\n\u201cThis facility will be a dream come true for patients and clinicians,\u201d said Lilli Thompson, rehabilitation division chief and physical therapy department director at Rancho Los Amigos.\nWhen completed, the wellness center will include a therapy swimming pool with underwater treadmill, weight-lifting room, dance studio, cardio and yoga rooms."}
