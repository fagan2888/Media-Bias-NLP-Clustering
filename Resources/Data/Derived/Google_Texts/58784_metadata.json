Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and Andrea Mitchell.\n\n\u201cYou need Jon Stewart on Comedy Central to ask [Health and Human Services Kathleen] Sebilius, \u2018Hey, why won\u2019t you treat these two equally,\u2019 and she can\u2019t answer it,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cThat\u2019s how pathetic I think news reporting has become when we won\u2019t ask tough questions to the administration.\u201d\n\nStewart, host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d asked Sebelius Monday whether it\u2019s a \u201clegitimate concern\u201d that individuals are being forced to pay into Obamacare while big businesses have been given a year-long delay.\n\nMitchell rebutted the charge that MSNBC hasn\u2019t challenged administration officials on the efficiency and fairness of Obamacare. (It\u2019s noteworthy that an online search of Mitchell herself asking a question similar to Stewart\u2019s renders no matches.)\n\n\u201cThe response,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cthat Kathleen Sebelius gave to Jon Stewart was, \u2018If we got what we wanted, which was a single-payer plan, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d (A single-payer health care system did come up in the Stewart interview, but Sebelius\u2019s response to Stewart\u2019s specific question was to say that \u201cnothing that helps an individual get health insurance has been delayed at all.\u201d)\n\nDuffy went on to say that the President and officials in the administration should also be made to sign up under Obamacare. \u201cThey have their own gold-plated health care plan that they\u2019re in,\u201d Duffy said.\n\n\u201cSo do you,\u201d Mitchell asserted.\n\nDuffy shot back: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m in Obamacare. I\u2019m in Obamacare, Andrea. All members of Congress are and my family.\u201d\n\nMitchell said nothing.\n\nAt the end of the segment, Duffy gave a final dig at Mitchell: \u201cI think the media should start doing its job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for your advice,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nWatch:\n\nFollow Eddie Scarry (@eScarry) on Twitter.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "What was supposed to be a discussion on MSNBC Tuesday over the effects of the government shutdown on military veterans' families became a tense argument about the news media's coverage on Obamacare, and even left the news anchor speechless.
