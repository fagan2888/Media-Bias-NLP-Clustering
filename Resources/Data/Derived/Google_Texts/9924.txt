RIVERTON — A group of residents in southeast Kansas will try again to have a grand jury called to investigate a proposal for a landfill near their town, after a judge denied their first petition on legal technicalities.

The group, based in Riverton, is asking for a grand jury to investigate how the Galena City Council acquired land and structured a contract for a 40-acre landfill on 160 acres near Riverton, The Joplin Globe reported (http://bit.ly/Wg8gOc ).

The first petition, sent to the Cherokee County District Court, was denied Aug. 20 by Judge Oliver K. Lynch, who said it didn’t contain the name, address and phone number of the person filing the document and didn’t indicate that an authorized official placed the verifying signatures under oath. The petition had 365 signatures, exceeding the 225 that was needed.

“We’re going to seek legal counsel on how it needs to be worded and we’re going to get it approved,” said Jason Bolt, a spokesman for the opposition group.

The opposition began in early July after the Galena City Council approved the acquisition of the 160-acre tract and related ordinances to build the landfill.

Brian Jordan, of Jordan Disposal Service, gave the land to Galena, with the requirement that he would have a perpetual contract to operate the landfill. On July 23, the council held a special meeting to rescind a contract and ordinances regarding annexation of the land.

After opposition arose, the council voted on July 30 to postpone discussion of a landfill until January.

Galena Mayor Dale Oglesby has denied any wrongdoing. Cherokee County Attorney Nathan Coleman said an investigation by his office didn’t find any violations of the state’s open meetings law, although council members agreed to participate in training on the law.
