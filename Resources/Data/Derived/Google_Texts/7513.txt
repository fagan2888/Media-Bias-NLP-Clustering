AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Physicians have conducted an autopsy on the body of former Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, but his body will only be released to his family in a few days, Iraq’s forensics chief said Sunday.

Jordan has approved a request by the Aziz family to bury him in the kingdom, said a government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because arrangements were not finalized.

Aziz, 79, was Saddam Hussein’s staunchest defender to the world and the only Christian in the Iraqi dictator’s inner circle. He died Friday after suffering a heart attack in a prison in southern Iraq.

Aziz had been in prison since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and suffered a series of strokes. He faced execution for his role in a government that killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.

His family settled in Jordan after Saddam’s fall.
