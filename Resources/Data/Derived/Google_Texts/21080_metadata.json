The city, the Ventura County Watershed District and the United Water Conservation District are working to form the agency.\n\nA law that went into effect earlier this year, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, is intended to promote greater cooperation between agencies that manage groundwater. Within five years, the new agency must produce a groundwater management plan that lays out how to best manage and protect the resource.\n\nIn 20 years, the sources should be sustainable.\n\nWater officials will discuss the law in greater depth tonight.\n\nThe city is separately working toward an agency to oversee the Upper Ventura River basin.\n\nMonday\u2019s meeting starts at 6 p.m. in the community meeting room at City Hall, 501 Poli St.\n\nFor more information, go to cityofventura.net/water", "article_metadata": {"title": "Mound Basin oversight agency to be focus of Ventura meeting", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/ventura/mound-basin-oversight-agency-to-be-focus-of-ventura-meeting-ep-1117427318-343681062.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/webwaterrules_19072776_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Oversight of the Mound Basin, Ventura's highest-producing groundwater source, will be the focus of a meeting Monday night.", "title": "Mound Basin oversight agency to be focus of Ventura meeting"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/webwaterrules_19072776_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Mound Basin oversight agency to be focus of Ventura meeting", "description": "Oversight of the Mound Basin, Ventura's highest-producing groundwater source, will be the focus of a meeting Monday night.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By From Staff ReportsWhat a new agency to oversee the Mound Basin should look like will be the focus of a meeting Monday night in Ventura.\nThe city is separately working toward an agency to oversee the Upper Ventura River basin.\nThe Mound Basin is the city\u2019s highest-producing groundwater source but also has the worst quality water.\nIt is located in the western portion of the Santa Clara River Valley Groundwater Basin.\nThe city, the Ventura County Watershed District and the United Water Conservation District are working to form the agency."}
