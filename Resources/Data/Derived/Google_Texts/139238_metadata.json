(Photo: Rod Millington for USA TODAY)\n\nLast year, 10% of high school students say they tried e-cigarettes, up from 4.7% in 2011, according to a CDC survey released Thursday. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nTeens shouldn't be smoking anything or drinking anything (drug related) anyway. E-cigarettes are made for adults, not people who still have a developing brain.\n\n\u2014 John Alton\n\nThey are not as deadly as real cigarettes. Nicotine is a poison, yes, but it is not what causes death in cigarette smokers. The tar and other chemicals in traditional cigarettes are more harmful.\n\n\u2014 Jonah Henry\n\nThese could be more addictive than regular cigarettes. They have much more concentrated doses of nicotine. Nicotine increases the risk of heart disease.\n\n\u2014 Danny Blaney\n\nSmoke-free cigarettes are the way to go. Besides, if high-school and middle-school students are using them, perhaps we should look at the parents and hold them accountable. Why do we continue to blame the manufacturer of a product instead of the user? Products are made because people buy them: supply and demand.\n\nTake away the demand, and the supply will follow.\n\n\u2014 Joe Salvatore\n\nThe store selling these e-cigarettes looks like a Baskin-Robbins. And that is only part of it. Given the assortment of trendy colors to choose from, I'll bet a closer look at the teen demographics would reveal a majority are sold to girls.\n\nThe tobacco industry knows exactly what it is doing.\n\n\u2014 Teri Jo\n\nGive me a break! What is there to regulate with e-cigs? There is no smoke so banning it indoors is ridiculous. A lot of e-cigarette users do not even use the nicotine liquids, just flavors.\n\nWe have a product that is hurtful to the person using, no-one else. Why regulate it? Coffee is more harmful to people around others (one might spill it) than e-cigs.\n\n\u2014 Karin Jared\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1fOgal6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Last year, 10% of high school students say they tried e-cigarettes, according to a CDC survey.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Last year, 10% of high school students say they tried e-cigarettes, according to a CDC survey.", "title": "Do teens using e-cigarettes cause concern?
