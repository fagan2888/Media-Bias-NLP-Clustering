TRENTON — New Jersey's 72 hospitals contributed $21 billion to the economy in 2013 by creating 144,000 jobs, and purchasing supplies and services, according to a hospital industry annual report.

The hospital industry's contributions have continued to grow despite the sluggish economy and the cutbacks in Medicare funding related to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the 2014 N.J. Hospitals Economic Impact Report released today by the New Jersey Hospital Association said.

For instance, hospitals purchased $2.8 billion in goods and services from other companies last year, an increase of $100 million over 201, the report said. Hospitals also paid more than $8.3 billion in salaries last year, $400 million more than in 2012.

Workers paid $457 million in state income taxes last year, $22 million more than in 2012.

“Even as New Jersey hospitals are shouldering significant cuts in reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act, they continue to be a stable force in New Jersey’s economy by adding jobs while still giving back to their communities and providing $1.3 billion in charity care for our uninsured,” said NJHA President and CEO Betsy Ryan.

Healthcare will continue to add jobs in New Jersey, according to the report, which cites a state Department of Labor analysis that projected that nearly 62,000 jobs will be added from 2010 to 2020.

“New Jersey hospitals help provide economic stability to the state through employment and revenue. And their economic investments in their facilities help expand infrastructure, purchase new technology and maintain a highly skilled workforce,” said Sean Hopkins, the association's senior vice president of health economics.
