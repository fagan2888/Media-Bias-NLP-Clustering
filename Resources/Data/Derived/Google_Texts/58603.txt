AARP provides tax help for seniors

Beginning in February, the AARP Foundation is again providing free tax assistance and preparation for taxpayers with low to moderate income through the AARP Foundation Tax-Aide program, giving special attention the older population. Membership in AARP, or being a retiree, is not required to use this service.

The program is offered at approximately 134 sites in Oregon, including in Astoria and Seaside. Tax assistance is available from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Fridays at the Astoria Senior Center, 1555 W. Marine Drive. Walk-ins are welcome. For information, call 503-325-3231. Assistance is also available from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Mondays, by appointment only, at the Bob Chisholm Community Center, 1225 Avenue A in Seaside. For information call 503-738-7393. Both locations are handicap accessible.

Preparation of tax returns under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rules requires additional documentation from taxpayers this year. The good news is that for taxpayers on Medicare or Medicare Advantage for the full year, no further information is required. Otherwise, taxpayers need to bring along their familyâ€™s health insurance coverage information, including about Marketplace/Exchange purchases, and health care exemptions.

For details on documentation that is required, go to www.aarp.org/findtaxhelp or call 888-227-7669.
