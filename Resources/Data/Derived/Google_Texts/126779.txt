The torrential rain and floods swamping vast swaths of Colorado have been described as “biblical” and bona fide a 100-year storms. The numbers are staggering. Consider:

• Boulder’s 25 square miles were awash in an estimated 4.5 billion gallons of water as of Friday morning, according to reports in The Denver Post.

• An acre-foot of water — the amount of water covering 1 acre with a foot of water — equals 326,000 gallons. The equivalent of 13,803 acre-feet of water fell in the Boulder area.

A football field is roughly 1 acre.

• Boulder Creek hit a flow rate of 4,500 cubic feet per second, more than doubling the previous high flow recorded during the last quarter century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey gauging station. The river usually runs at 100 to 300 cfs.

A cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds. That means that at one point Boulder Creek was roaring with 280,800 pounds of water a second, or just over 140 tons. The standard railroad locomotive weighs 120 to 240 tons, depending on the model.

• The velocity and churn of the water in Boulder Creek was the equivalent of a Class IV rapid, an “expert” level typically encountered on the Arkansas and Colorado rivers during runoff season.

• During flash floods, 2 feet of water can move with enough force to wash away a car. Just 6 inches of water can knock a Denver Bronco-sized adult off his or her feet.

• Converting an inch of rainwater into the equivalent amount of snow is a bit tricky, given the variables. One inch of rain will produce 3½ to 4 inches of wet snow, but potentially 10 to 12 inches of light powder. With the amount of rain in Boulder, a powdery snow could have been up to the eaves of single-story homes.

• Car engines will generally flood if water reaches halfway up the wheels — less than that if the vehicle is in motion, because of surging water.

• Flood stage in the Big Thompson River is 6 feet. Water in the Big Thompson crested at 10.55 feet at 6:30 a.m. Friday. That’s more than the 9.31-foot peak in the 1976 flood that killed 144 people.

Help for flood victims

In the wake of torrential rainstorms that have raked the Front Range, flood victims can draw some comfort in knowing there are organizations offering help. Along with opening a number of temporary shelters in Boulder, Larimer and Adams counties, the American Red Cross in Colorado is collecting donations to underwrite relief efforts. redcross.org/charitable-donations.

“The best way to help out is with cash donations,” said Patricia Billinger, communications director for the Red Cross in Colorado and Wyoming. Even a little bit helps. A $2 donation will pay for a snack, $2.50 underwrites a hygiene kit distributed to evacuees, while $10 will pay for a hot meal and a couple of blankets, Billinger said.

The Intermountain Salvation Army also is working on flood-relief efforts. Their donation website is imsalvationarmy.org.
