Many of its rivals aren\u2019t, though, which means prices have to go up, the company told investors and analysts on Wednesday.\n\nOther insurers are charging premiums that are \u201cstill well below what we think appropriate rates are for a sustainable environment,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cOur price point isn\u2019t wrong, as much as others need to strengthen their price point.\u201d\n\nClimbing costs for health insurance would come at a bad time for Democrats who\u2019ve embraced one of President Barack Obama\u2019s key policy achievements. Consumers will start shopping for health insurance about the time of November\u2019s presidential election, meaning they\u2019ll find out about a potential hit to their pocketbooks just as they\u2019re choosing a candidate to vote for.\n\nPremiums for mid-level silver Obamacare plans increased 11 percent on average for this year, after climbing 7 percent for 2015, according to McKinsey & Co. More than 80 percent of Obamacare customers get government subsidies to help them buy their policies, cushioning the effect of higher rates.\n\nHigher Costs\n\nAnthem sells policies under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand in 14 states. About 791,000 of the insurer\u2019s 38.6 million members had individual Obamacare plans at the end of the year, and those customers were the main drivers of increased medical spending and lower fourth-quarter earnings. Anthem\u2019s adjusted profit fell 41 percent to $305.8 million in the period, and its shares dropped 3.7 percent to $132.68 at 2:25 p.m. in New York.\n\nOther insurers have fared worse with their Obamacare businesses. UnitedHealth Group Inc., for instance, said it lost almost half a billion dollars on ACA plans in 2015, and expects even more red ink this year. About half of the nonprofit insurers created to sell policies under Obamacare have failed, in part because they didn\u2019t charge enough.\n\nThose struggles are a threat to the viability of the health-care law, which relies on private insurers to sell the policies that have helped expand coverage. The pace of enrollment in the ACA\u2019s federal and state exchanges also has been slower than Anthem and the U.S. government forecast. Anthem said it\u2019s seen some early signs of a pickup this year, though it\u2019s waiting to find out how many people are paying their premiums by the end of this month.\n\nSome insurers are starting to feel the pain from charging too little for their health insurance policies and are beginning to boost rates, according to Anthem, whose higher prices may have contributed to its lower-than-expected sign-ups.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to see individuals recognize problems in their books,\u201d DeVeydt said. \u201cThey are starting to strengthen their pricing quite meaningfully.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-type": "post", "sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer", "news_keywords": "Politics,Anthem Inc,Washington, D.C.,business,health insurance,Policy,Obamacare", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/obamacare-will-probably-cost-more-in-2017-top-insurer-says", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "title": "Obamacare Will Probably Cost More in 2017, Top Insurer Says"}, "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/obamacare-will-probably-cost-more-in-2017-top-insurer-says", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/obamacare-will-probably-cost-more-in-2017-top-insurer-says", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Will Probably Cost More in 2017, Top Insurer Says"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Will Probably Cost More in 2017, Top Insurer Says", "parsely-tags": "Politics,Anthem Inc,Washington, D.C.,business,health insurance,Policy,Obamacare,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "O1MFIJ6KLVRE01", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "parsely-author": "Zachary Tracer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Politics,Anthem Inc,Washington, D.C.,business,health insurance,Policy,Obamacare", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "date": "2016-01-27T19:26:42.783Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-27T19:26:42.783Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25a4\"", "article_summary": "Anthem Inc., the second-largest U.S. health insurer by membership, said premiums for Obamacare insurance probably will go up next year.\nAbout half of the nonprofit insurers created to sell policies under Obamacare have failed, in part because they didn\u2019t charge enough.\nAbout 791,000 of the insurer\u2019s 38.6 million members had individual Obamacare plans at the end of the year, and those customers were the main drivers of increased medical spending and lower fourth-quarter earnings.\nConsumers will start shopping for health insurance about the time of November\u2019s presidential election, meaning they\u2019ll find out about a potential hit to their pocketbooks just as they\u2019re choosing a candidate to vote for.\nAnthem is eking out a small profit from selling policies to individuals under the Affordable Care Act."}
