As her wild strokes fly past the borders of the page, they create a colorful corona on the wooden table.\n\n\"Do you want another crayon?\" asks instructor Teisch Henline.\n\nThe woman pauses briefly, but doesn\u2019t answer. Henline places a different color in her hand and she picks up where she left off \u2014 back and forth, back and forth, slashing streaks of green across the doll\u2019s face.\n\nThe client assessment form from the N.J. Division of Developmental Disabilities for Ellen Petroff, 44, is sobering:\n\n\u2014 \"Does (Ellen) have an Intellectual or Cognitive Disability formerly known as Mental Retardation?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\u2014 \"Does (Ellen) require CONSTANT SUPERVISION at all times in order to prevent injury?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\u2014 \"Level of behavioral monitoring necessary?\"\n\n\"Within Constant Eyesight and Physically Near.\"\n\n\u2014 \"Has (Ellen) been diagnosed with\" swallowing condition (\"Yes\"), nervous system condition (\"Yes\"), seizures (\"Yes\"), hormone or endocrine problems (\"Yes\"), chronic skin condition, osteoporosis, musculosketal condition, or allergies? (\"Yes,\" \"Yes,\" \"Yes\" and \"Yes.\")\n\nFor nearly 30 years the state of New Jersey thought the best place for Ellen Petroff to get the care she needed was Woods Services in Langhorne, Pa. Now, however, the state wants her back, along with hundreds of other developmentally disabled New Jerseyans, some of whom have lived in out-of-state facilities for decades.\n\nNew Jersey officials say all they want is for the disabled to be closer to home and living in the community in the least restrictive environment. Parents and guardians say their handicapped loved ones are happy where they are and the state has turned them into pawns in a Medicaid money grab. At stake: nearly $21 million if the developmentally disabled return to New Jersey, according to the state auditor.\n\n\"We\u2019re grateful the state has funded us for 30 years, but now they\u2019ve given us no options,\" says Judy McCabe, Ellen\u2019s 74-year-old mother. \"We fear she\u2019s going to wind up some place that jeopardizes her health and her life.\"\n\nDawn Apgar, the deputy commissioner for the Division of Developmental Disabilities and Carrie Conger, the director of the DDD\u2019s Returning Home New Jersey initiative, twice had to cancel phone interviews, but spokeswoman Pam Ronan provided answers to emailed questions. The governor\u2019s office deferred to the DDD.\n\n\"The out-of-state placements were predominately to large congregate facilities because when they were made, community-based, residential settings were not as predominant as they are now,\" she said. \"Today, residential care systems for adults with developmental disabilities have transitioned to small homes in local communities. This is not only happening in New Jersey, but nationally as well.\"\n\nThere are currently 470 adults who are living in out-of-state placements paid for by the DDD and whom the DDD is working to return to New Jersey, according to the state. One who has already returned is Ashanti Moore, 25, the son of single mother Marzeter Moore of North Brunswick. Ashanti, who was diagnosed with autism, obsessive compulsive disorder and an impulse control disorder, was a resident of Woods for five years and since last June lives in a group home in Brick Township.\n\n\"He adjusted very well,\" Moore said, adding that her son is very high functioning. \"I\u2019m very, very pleased. He loves it. He loves his home.\"\n\nMoore, who is 49, said her son received his diploma last year from North Brunswick High School by fulfilling a specially tailored curriculum while at Woods.\n\n\"He\u2019s very verbal and he tells me everything and he makes his requests well-known.\"\n\nFor other parents, however, especially those like Branchburg\u2019s Judy McCabe and husband Bob, the idea of moving their adult child to a new home after 30 years is fraught with worry.\n\nTheir daughter Ellen cannot dress, feed or bathe herself. She cannot get out of bed without help, or use the toilet alone. She enjoys the Disney Channel but only the pre-school shows and her food must be cut in dime-sized pieces or she will choke. Someone is within an arm\u2019s length at all meals because Ellen has aspirated her food into her lungs often, resulting in aspiration pneumonia and hospitalization. In 2003, a third of her left lung was removed.\n\nSitting at her table in the activities room, Ellen continues to color silently. A bit of morning light catches in her black curls when she turns her head and looks up at a visiting stranger.\n\n\"I have tummy ache,\" she says.\n\nThose four words could mean anything, actually, because Ellen is unable to articulate exactly where it hurts or how much. A tummy ache could mean indigestion, or it could mean something much more serious.\n\nSUPERVISION CRUCIAL\n\nThe combination of a limited vocabulary and myriad medical issues means Ellen not only needs constant supervision, her parents say, but supervision by people deeply familiar with their daughter\u2019s habits and manners.\n\n\"She can\u2019t communicate when she\u2019s hurt, only when she\u2019s tired,\" said Judy. \"She can\u2019t isolate the pain, or she\u2019ll say \u2018yes\u2019 to every question, or \u2018no.\u2019 \"\n\nEllen has 23 different medical diagnoses according to her chart, from lupus and deep vein thrombosis to seizure disorder and osteoporosis. She has limited walking ability (and only when supported by two people), takes 25 pills a day and sees seven doctors and a nutritionist, all but two of them on the Woods campus. Ellen also has been hospitalized 27 times since 2000. At St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center in Langhorne she has been treated by the same internist for the past 28 years. At breakfast, lunch and dinner, at physical therapy, at recreational therapy and back in her room in her recliner, there is a staff person nearby nearly every hour Ellen is awake.\n\nBut no one at the DDD has been able to tell the McCabes where in New Jersey she can get the same care.\n\n\"She needs 24-hour-a day nursing and they don\u2019t have any answers,\" said Bob McCabe, 78. \"Their answer is, \u2018We\u2019ll find a place.\u2019 \"\n\nJoanne Martone has been Ellen\u2019s physical therapist for 23 years and has learned the subtle, non-verbal cues that indicate something might be wrong.\n\n\"Ellen has a lot of challenging diagnoses,\" she said, \"so her neurological status fluctuates on a daily basis. She also has lupus. She has a lot of flares and we can pretty much tell when she does. I see it in her eyes. They get glassy. She\u2019ll get a butterfly rash. She gets shaky. If she\u2019s standing and walking with me she\u2019ll literally lock her legs and won\u2019t move. She can be in pain but I don\u2019t know how severe. Someone else might think she\u2019s just being stubborn, but it\u2019s an indirect sign she\u2019s in pain.\"\n\nWoods is a 101-year-old nonprofit facility that sits on nearly 300 bucolic acres not far from the New Jersey border. Approximately 900 children, adolescents and adults are treated here for intellectual disability, developmental disabilities, neurological disorders, emotional and behavioral challenges and brain injury.\n\nSeveral hundred adults live in residential cottages. There is a central medical clinic and dental clinic, even a flower shop.\n\nScores of New Jerseyans with severe disabilities live here, but no one knows how much longer. The state\u2019s Returning Home New Jersey program has been trying since 2009 to bring what they call \"out-of-state consumers\" back home, but a lack of new group residences slowed the process. Last year, however, letters went out from the DDD explaining it was moving ahead with the program. At the same time, the state is closing two of its seven developmental centers in the next year, moving hundreds more into community group homes.\n\nPaul Prior, a disability rights lawyer with Hinkle, Fingles & Prior in Lawrenceville, believes the state is rushing things.\n\n\"One of the multitudes of concerns we have is Returning Home New Jersey is just too rapid,\" he said. \"The parents we\u2019ve worked with are concerned that all the state is trying to do is to find a bed for the person, whether it\u2019s appropriate or not.\"\n\nSTATE CITES SAVINGS\n\nIn a recent state audit of DDD programs covering the period from July 1, 2009, to July 31, 2013, the Office of Legislative Services reported the DDD \"could save $20.7 million\" by returning to New Jersey hundreds of the disabled placed in out-of-state facilities in order to qualify them for the Community Care Waiver program.\n\nOn average, officials say it costs between $160,000 and $225,000 annually to care for each of the 470 developmentally disabled people the DDD wants to bring back to New Jersey. In reality, the cost of caring for them isn\u2019t where the state would see the savings. Instead, the federal government is willing to pay more to states through the Community Care Waiver program for moving the developmentally disabled from larger facilities out of state to smaller, community group homes in state. This way, the state reduces its total financial burden caring for the handicapped. And ostensibly, the money New Jersey then receives from the federal government allows the state to build more community-based group homes.\n\nLike Ellen, 25-year-old Kara Anderson is severely disabled. She has been at Woods for six years, is multiply handicapped and needs 1-to-1 supervision, said her mother, Susan, 57. Kara, whose parents live in Hillsborough, developed epilepsy at age 11 and has several tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures a day. She was placed at Woods only after two failed attempts in-state, said her mother. One of those attempts, a group home for the severely disabled in Haddonfield, rescinded Kara\u2019s residency about a month after she moved in because the staff said it was unable to safely manage her seizures.\n\n\"We\u2019ve lived through the nightmare already,\" Anderson said. \"If she failed (there), how is a community group home going to guarantee 1-to-1? All DDD says is, \u2018It\u2019s something we will discuss with providers.\u2019 \"\n\nRecently the DDD came up with three potential group homes in New Jersey for Kara. One of them, according to Anderson, admitted it didn\u2019t have the money for 1-to-1 services, the second that it couldn\u2019t guarantee 1-to-1 and because its day program was for higher functioning adults, Kara would have to attend a nearby senior center.\n\nThe third potential provider said it had no idea Kara even needed 1-to-1 care.\n\n\"This is insulting. The state should stop shoveling us slop and expecting us to thank them for the scraps,\" she said. \"It\u2019s disgusting and we don\u2019t believe the state has our children\u2019s best interests at heart. \u2026 New Jersey should be ashamed of itself.\"\n\n8,000 WAITING\n\nThere are more than 8,000 intellectually, behaviorly and developmentally disabled New Jerseyans currently on a waiting list for a group home. The DDD, however, says, moving the disabled back into New Jersey affects the waiting list in a positive way.\n\n\"When a person moves back in state, DDD can obtain the federal match for half the cost that it pays for the person who has moved in-state,\" said spokewoman Ronan. \"The cost of the program for the person is then reduced by the federal match and DDD can pay for someone else who is waiting for services.\"\n\nAccording to attorney Prior, there are some on that list who have been waiting since 2001.\n\n\"Waiting lists in general are a real shame,\" said Margaret Nygren, executive director of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities in Washington, D.C. \"Our goal as a society should be to treat people when they need it. Problems don\u2019t go away the longer you wait. Needs increase. The challenge that all states face is fairly allocating their resources.\"\n\nSome parents and guardians who are being forced to bring their children home wonder why the state couldn\u2019t craft a policy or an exemption that would allow the state to collect the matching funds even with these disabled residents remaining out of state.\n\nAccording to 2012 Department of Human Services response to legislative questions about its budget, New Jersey already has, realizing a $1.6 million reduction in costs for the developmentally disabled by making federal claims for about 75 eligible, out-of-state people residing in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"In other words, New Jersey could ask the government for matching Medicaid dollars (for the current out-of-state cases),\" Prior said.\n\nDeep skepticism about the state\u2019s motives for moving the disabled back to New Jersey lingers among many parents and guardians. Christine Beatty, 66, of Rio Grande, scoffs at the notion that the DDD is only concerned with the well-being of her disabled daughter, Shannon, who has been at Woods for more than 30 years. Beatty says no one from DDD has ever participated in her daughter\u2019s annual assessments for at least the past 27 years, even though one of the DDD\u2019s Community Services offices is located in Hamilton, just 15 minutes across the state border from Woods.\n\n\"Except for the first three or four years, they haven\u2019t come,\" she said. \"I didn\u2019t ever know who (Shannon\u2019s) caseworker was if I needed to contact someone.\"\n\nLike other parents, Beatty fears the lack of oversight at the new group homes and the rush to move people back in from out of state will put her daughter at risk.\n\n\"It\u2019s inconceivable what the DDD puts parents through with their children,\" she said. \"I can\u2019t imagine what goes on in the group homes. You\u2019re telling me DDD oversees them and we\u2019re supposed to trust them? They can\u2019t even oversee themselves.\"", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Amy Ellis Nutt/The Star-Ledger", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@river','@starledger','chris-christie','health-news'", "title": "NJ disabled woman's parents want to know why the state is forcing her to move after 30 years", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"NJ disabled woman\\u0027s parents want to know why the state is forcing her to move after 30 years\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/05/the_fight_for_ellen_petroff.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/05/15034141-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13015308\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-05-25T11:47:34Z\", \"author\": \"Amy Ellis Nutt/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"@starledger\",\"chris-christie\",\"health-news\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/05/15034141-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Hundreds of developmentally disabled New Jerseyans are being uprooted from out-of-state facilities by the Department of Human Services and forced into group homes in state.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@amyellisnutt"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, May 25, 2014,  9:24 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/05/mccabes-jpgjpg-058464956537910e.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"aenutt\", \"author_nickname\": \"Amy Ellis Nutt/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"3051\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Hundreds of developmentally disabled New Jerseyans are being uprooted from out-of-state facilities by the Department of Human Services and forced into group homes in state.", "title": "NJ disabled woman's parents want to know why the state is forcing her to move after 30 years", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/05/the_fight_for_ellen_petroff.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, May 25, 2014,  7:45 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Hundreds of developmentally disabled New Jerseyans are being uprooted from out-of-state facilities by the Department of Human Services and forced into group homes in state."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a8a\"", "article_summary": "(\"Yes,\" \"Yes,\" \"Yes\" and \"Yes.\")\nDeep skepticism about the state\u2019s motives for moving the disabled back to New Jersey lingers among many parents and guardians.\nAt stake: nearly $21 million if the developmentally disabled return to New Jersey, according to the state auditor.\n\"If she failed (there), how is a community group home going to guarantee 1-to-1?\n\"When a person moves back in state, DDD can obtain the federal match for half the cost that it pays for the person who has moved in-state,\" said spokewoman Ronan."}
