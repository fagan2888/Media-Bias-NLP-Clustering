Comedian Nathan Fielder uses fake call from President Obama to market toys to kids in ‘Nathan For You’ finale

Comedian Nathan Fielder, the genius behind “Dumb Starbucks,” will use a fake phone call with President Obama during Tuesday night’s episode of “Nathan For You” in an attempt to sell kids an unimpressive toy.

The season finale, entitled “Toy Company,” will involve Fielder marketing to children by using the simple truth that children all desire “to not be seen as a baby.”

“It’s very easy to market to kids because their brains are so small,” explains Fielder in the preview of the episode.

He says that the toy salesman he advises should be selling a specific “identity” for kids, that identity being that owning the toy ball in question “is the only way to prove you’re not a baby.”

How does Fielder prove this? With a focus group, a few balls and a fake phone conversation with President Obama.

The three children in his “focus group” at first label the toy balls “dumb,” showing no interest in the trinkets. Then, Fielder’s phone rings.

“Sorry guys, that was the president calling and he just told me that owning this toy is now the only proof you’re not a baby,” the comedian tells the kids after hanging up on “Obama.”

With just slight reluctance, the children each grab a toy ball. Apparently, Obama can actually doing more than just golf and attend fundraisers on Martha’s Vineyard. Now, if only the president would do more to deal with the crises that face America at home and abroad.
