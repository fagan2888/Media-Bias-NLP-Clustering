Paradise High School and Chico State University graduate Carol Torkko filed her bid to run for the highest office on July 10.\n\nTorkko, who graduated cum laude with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in math, is running as a Republican with a focus on the country\u2019s money problems rather than social issues.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m heading toward is seriously balancing the budget and insuring the longevity of our Social Security trust fund,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the two major items that you don\u2019t hear any of the candidates focusing on very much in their campaigns.\u201d\n\nShe considers herself a moderate Republican and acknowledges that a tax increase will be necessary to get the country back on its feet.\n\nShe also knows the Affordable Care Act has problems and is looking to fix it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to throw out the health plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong to give something to the American people and then take it away. But a number of people complain that they\u2019re required to have health insurance when they don\u2019t want it. I know we can fix that.\u201d\n\nShe also wants to better manage illegal immigration, though she\u2019s not looking to build a wall or deport anyone unless they break the law.\n\nShe is looking to upgrade the education system and take better care of veterans, as well. She\u2019ll admit that she doesn\u2019t have any foreign policy experience, but notes that President Obama and many other U.S. presidents didn\u2019t either. Still, she will surround herself with expert advisers to help guide her through those tough situations.\n\nShe will say that she prefers diplomacy over military action, though she is not afraid to use military action if necessary.\n\nShe has a short, 100-page book titled \u201cTogether We Will Save Our U.S. of A\u201d for sale on Amazon that has further information on her plan including charts and official federal government statistics, she said.\n\nThe book can be downloaded for .99 cents, though Amazon Prime members can get it for free.\n\n\u201cI made it as inexpensive as I could,\u201d she said. It is more important to spread the word, she said.\n\nTorkko, who now lives in Redmond, Wash., knows she probably won\u2019t win the seat, but hopes her message resonates with Ridge residents and spreads to the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cIf nothing more, if I don\u2019t make it to office, I hope I wake up the American people on what they really need to go after,\u201d she said.\n\nThose who want to support her campaign can donate to: Carol Torkko for U.S. President, 15600 NE 8th Street, Suite B1-449, Bellevue, Wash. 98008. This is a Post Office box number that was created through the Federal Elections Commission and she is not allowed to use one penny of donated money for herself. The funds are only for her campaign, though she is allowed to donate any remainder to charity and has chosen two veterans organizations to support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore on Torkko can be found on her website, www.torkkoforuspresident.com, on Facebook at torkkoforuspresident, and on YouTube by searching \u201cTorkko.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Voters unhappy with the current field of presidential candidates now have a local option.
