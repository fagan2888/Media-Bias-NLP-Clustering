Lansing\u2019s mayor, Virg Bernero, supported the initiative, pointing out that the \u201cpublic is far ahead of most politicians on this issue.\u201d\n\nFerndale\u2019s measure passed even more resoundingly, with 69 percent voting in favor. It had been opposed by nearly all of the city\u2019s political establishment, and this summer the local police targeted one of the main organizers of the initiative, charging him with \u201cmarijuana delivery\u201d and even suggesting where he lives could render the initiative void even if it passed.\n\nJackson\u2019s effort to decriminalize marijuana passed with about 61 percent of the vote.\n\nPortland\u2019s initiative, meanwhile, decriminalized possession of marijuana in amounts up to 2.5 ounces but also banned its use in many public places. Legislators in Maine have been trying to legalize marijuana statewide.
