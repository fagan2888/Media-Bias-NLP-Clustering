Take Sam Bradford's season-ending ligament tear, for example. The St. Louis Rams starting quarterback is out for the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee for the second time in less than a year.\n\n\u201cWe lost our starting quarterback, but for Sam personally, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d Rams coach Jeff Fisher said at a press conference Sunday. \u201cThe news was devastating for him this morning, as you can appreciate. Anyone that\u2019s gone through that procedure [ACL surgery] and the rehab understands, to have it happen again within the calendar year is very, very difficult. So we\u2019re thinking of Sam.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Big Money NFL Draft Busts\n\nAs difficult as the injury must be for the 26-year-old Bradford, it\u2019s also painful in a very different way for his team. Bradford had been the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft and was signed to a six-year, $78 million contract, including a signing bonus of nearly $18 million and $50 million in guaranteed money, according to NFL contract tracking website Overthecap.com.\n\nBradford was the last top pick in the draft to sign such a huge deal. The NFL\u2019s 2011 collective bargaining agreement introduced a rookie wage scale that drastically reduced contract sizes for players coming into the league \u2014 for reasons highlighted again by Bradford\u2019s latest injury.\n\nRelated: The Misfortune of Playing in the NFL\n\nBoth owners and veteran players were unhappy with players getting such huge deals, with large guaranteed sums, before proving themselves on the field. Quarterbacks Cam Newton and Andrew Luck, the top picks in 2011 and 2012 respectively, each signed four-year deals for $22 million guaranteed, with the teams holding an option for a fifth year.\n\nEven before his latest injury, Bradford\u2019s contract was something of an albatross for the Rams. Of the 20 quarterbacks chosen with the top pick in the draft, Bradford had played the third fewest games in his first five seasons in the NFL, behind only JaMarcus Russell, an all-time bust, and Alex Smith, who languished for years in San Francisco.\n\nRelated: The Green Bay Packers \u2014 Worst Investment Ever\n\nAnd when he was on the field, Bradford only put up mediocre stats, including a below-average quarterback rating, to go with an 18-30-1 won-loss record.\n\nThose numbers aren\u2019t solely Bradford\u2019s fault \u2014 but they make his $78 million deal look awfully expensive. And it just got even worse.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As difficult as the injury must be for the 26-year-old Bradford, it\u2019s also painful in a very different way for his team.", "title": "Sam Bradford Is Exactly Why the NFL Changed Its Rookie Contracts", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/25/Sam-Bradford-Exactly-Why-NFL-Changed-Its-Rookie-Contracts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Football_Busts_05072014_Sam_Bradford.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/25/Sam-Bradford-Exactly-Why-NFL-Changed-Its-Rookie-Contracts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Football_Busts_05072014_Sam_Bradford.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As difficult as the injury must be for the 26-year-old Bradford, it\u2019s also painful in a very different way for his team.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "1 overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft and was signed to a six-year, $78 million contract, including a signing bonus of nearly $18 million and $50 million in guaranteed money, according to NFL contract tracking website Overthecap.com.\nSo we\u2019re thinking of Sam.\u201dRelated: 10 Big Money NFL Draft BustsAs difficult as the injury must be for the 26-year-old Bradford, it\u2019s also painful in a very different way for his team.\nEven before his latest injury, Bradford\u2019s contract was something of an albatross for the Rams.\n\u201cWe lost our starting quarterback, but for Sam personally, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d Rams coach Jeff Fisher said at a press conference Sunday.\nBradford was the last top pick in the draft to sign such a huge deal."}
