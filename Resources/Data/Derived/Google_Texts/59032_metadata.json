I believed I could keep my health insurance plan. I feel lied too.\u201d\n\nBoonstra was diagnosed with leukemia five years ago and was given a 20 percent chance of survival.\n\nThe 49-year-old from Dexter, Mich., said at the time she could no longer afford the care she needed as a result of Obamacare.\n\nThough AFP released this video in February, Boonstra\u2019s story garnered wider attention after the Detroit News Monday reported that she could actually save about $1,000 under her new plan that meets Affordable Care Act requirements:\n\nBoonstra\u2019s old plan cost $1,100 a month in premiums or $13,200 a year, she previously told The News. That didn\u2019t include money she spent on co-pays, prescription drugs and other out-of-pocket expenses. By contrast, the [Michigan Blue Cross Premier Gold] plan premium costs $571 a month or $6,852 for the year. Since out-of-pocket costs are capped at $5,100 for in-network doctors and hospitals, including deductibles, the maximum Boonstra would pay this year for all of her cancer treatment is $11,952. [\u2026] She said she still fears her costs will be unaffordable because she could be hit with large out-of-pocket bills in the early months when she wouldn\u2019t have the money to pay. She also said her out-of-pocket maximum could be higher than advertised because there\u2019s one prescription that was previously covered by her old plan that isn\u2019t and she now buys with a separate prescription discount card.\n\nBlue Cross spokesman Andy Hetzel told the News that all prescriptions Boonstra needs are in fact covered by the plan. As for reaching her maximum in a short period of time, something Boonstra said she couldn\u2019t afford to happen, Hetzel told the newspaper while that could occur, it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nWhen the facts surrounding Boonstra\u2019s claims were questioned after this initial ad, AFP released another one, in which Boonstra changed what she said from the plan being \u201cunaffordable\u201d to that it \u201cdidn\u2019t work for me.\u201d\n\nFollowing the revelations made by the Detroit News, many other publications have come out to blast Boonstra and AFP for the allegedly misleading ad.\n\nRick Ungar, a Forbes contributor writing on politics and policy from the left, wrote that he thinks Boonstra simply didn\u2019t do her homework as to the details on her plan.\n\n\u201cAs for AFP, one would think they would be considerably more careful in picking the \u2018horror stories\u2019 they chose to tell. One might also want to consider what it means when this is the best anti-Obamacare groups can come up with when attempting to undermine the future of this law,\u201d Ungar continued.\n\nThe Washington Post labeled Boonstra\u2019s story with three Pinocchios, its rating system for fact checking.\n\nOn Thursday, Boonstra penned a familiar story in her Detroit News op-ed. Her experience was shared by many last year: insurance plan gets cancelled, followed by the frustration of trying to navigate Obamacare options with a defunct website. Eventually, she settled on the private plan she now has.\n\n\u201cI recently told my story in Michigan with the help of a group called Americans for Prosperity. Now people are attacking me and calling me a liar. Some believe that I can afford the insurance because the annual premiums will be lower,\u201d Boonstra wrote. \u201cThose people choose to ignore the problems inherent with high out-of-pocket limits and prescriptions that aren\u2019t covered for a person like me.\n\n\u201cMy new plan could mean wildly fluctuating and front-loaded costs in the first few months of the year. I chose my old plan \u2014 the one that Obamacare canceled \u2014 specifically so I could budget for the same monthly costs with certainty.\u201d\n\nAfter the initial ad ran, Rep. Gary Peters (D., Mich.), who is seeking to move to a Michigan state Senate seat, sent a letter to the station manager advising them to require AFP to back up its claims to comply with the FCC\u2019s regulations protecting against the spread of misinformation. Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) criticized it as well.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that every one of the Koch brothers\u2019 ads are a lie, but I\u2019ll say this \u2026 the vast, vast majority of them are,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThis was one of the reasons the Glenn Beck Radio Program\u2019s Pat Gray last week called Reid the \u201cworst living human being on the planet.\u201d\n\nAs for Boonstra, who called out these congressmen in her piece, she wrote that she \u201cnever asked for this. Obamacare has turned my life into a nightmare.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking out for the 225,000 Michiganians who also lost their insurance plans thanks to Obamacare. Like them, I want a plan that works for me,\u201d she continued. \u201cInstead, Obamacare has denied me my choice of coverage, President Barack Obama has betrayed my trust, Harry Reid called me a liar, and Gary Peters has tried to silence me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 0, "twitter": {"description": "A Michigan woman with cancer is defending herself against critics after she publicly spoke out against Obamacare.  \"I'm not lying about Obamacare,\" Julie Boonstra wrote in an op-ed in the Detroit News Thursday, responding to nearly a month of criticism she's been seeing regarding the facts of an...", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m Not Lying\u2019: Cancer Patient Hits Back at Critics Who Question Her Facts Against Obamacare", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/03/14/im-not-lying-cancer-patient-hits-back-at-critics-who-question-her-facts-against-obamacare/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Julie-Boonstra_2.jpeg", "creator": "@lizklimas", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "julie, boonstra, responds, criticism, about, facts, anti, obamacare, ad", "sailthru.tags": "government, health, obamacare, video, author-liz-klimas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 153, "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "categories": "obamacare,video,government,health", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 79, "description": "A Michigan woman with cancer is defending herself against critics after she publicly spoke out against Obamacare.  \"I'm not lying about Obamacare,\" Julie Boonstra wrote in an op-ed in the Detroit News Thursday, responding to nearly a month of criticism she's been seeing regarding the facts of an...", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/779484", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "A Michigan woman with cancer is defending herself against critics after she publicly spoke out against Obamacare.  \"I'm not lying about Obamacare,\" Julie Boonstra wrote in an op-ed in the Detroit News Thursday, responding to nearly a month of criticism she's been seeing regarding the facts of an...", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m Not Lying\u2019: Cancer Patient Hits Back at Critics Who Question Her Facts Against Obamacare", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/03/14/im-not-lying-cancer-patient-hits-back-at-critics-who-question-her-facts-against-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 548, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Julie-Boonstra_2.jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 337}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-03-14T15:42:54+00:00", "twitter-count": 98}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2b7\"", "article_summary": "Some believe that I can afford the insurance because the annual premiums will be lower,\u201d Boonstra wrote.\nA Michigan woman with cancer is defending herself against critics after she publicly spoke out against Obamacare.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking out for the 225,000 Michiganians who also lost their insurance plans thanks to Obamacare.\nBy contrast, the [Michigan Blue Cross Premier Gold] plan premium costs $571 a month or $6,852 for the year.\nSince out-of-pocket costs are capped at $5,100 for in-network doctors and hospitals, including deductibles, the maximum Boonstra would pay this year for all of her cancer treatment is $11,952."}
