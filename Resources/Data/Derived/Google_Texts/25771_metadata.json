This year those carriers are also cleared to talk to consumers about the new exchanges and other details of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and Blue Cross has turned to agents to handle the work.\n\nTen Blue Cross companies in 14 states that have access to about \u201ca hundred stores,\u201d are using licensed professionals to staff their health care information kiosks in the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer\u2019s outlets, said Blue Cross spokesman Robert Elfinger. The regional Blue Cross companies are all making separate deals with local brokers and Blue Cross understands that the brokers are free to sell other carrier\u2019s products, said Elfinger.\n\nThe opportunity to get access to Wal-Mart foot traffic is a big opening for agencies said executives from one such firm, Enroll Alaska, that is making a big bet on the new business possibilities under the new healthcare law.\n\nWhen Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska approached Enroll Alaska about staffing their information booths in Wal-Mart the agency leapt at the chance, said Tyann Boling who is chief operating officer of Enroll Alaska, a spanking new division of Alaska-based Northrim Benefits Group. The operation was formed only months ago to focus entirely on the new market for individuals and represents a shift for Northrim, which is owned by Northrim Bank, and for 30 years has been focused on group policies.\n\n\u201cWe saw an opening to focus on the individual marketplace,\u201d said Boling. And securing access to the Wal-Mart customers became a major component of the agency\u2019s roll out strategy of reaching the bulk of the state\u2019s uninsured individuals, said Northrim Employee Benefits Consultant Joshua Weinstein. Another pillar of the plan is to place Enroll Alaska representatives in health clinics and hospitals around the state to help individuals understand the new healthcare exchanges mandated by the Affordable Care Act, said Weinstein.\n\nNorthrim brought Boling in from the outside to spearhead its new division and has ramped up swiftly to \u201c20 to 30 agents\u201d to help individuals navigate the new exchanges, said Weinstein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big gamble,\u201d he said, \u201cbut seven months ago we decided to shift. We needed to create a new division.\u201d The move required a significant line of credit and comes freighted with \u201clarge political risk and reputational risk,\u201d Weinstein said with a nod to the stalemate in Washington over the law and also to Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell\u2019s decision not to set up a state-run exchange but instead leave that to the federal government. There is significant dissatisfaction with Obamacare in the state \u2014 both Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska have vowed to repeal it \u2014 and Northrim is sensitive about giving the impression they are supporters of the act.\n\nNorthrim Bank President Joe Beedle has said publically that the bank is not endorsing the controversial law but has made a \u201cmore than seven-digit investment\u201d in Enroll Alaska because the act is the law of the land.\n\nCompany executives concede that the act staying the law of the land is in question and that their gambit is predicated on it doing so as a repeal would all but shutter Enroll Alaska. But still, \u201cthat\u2019s what we decided to do,\u201d said Weinstein of the company\u2019s decision to invest in their retail strategy while acknowledging that \u201cthis will only be successful if we enroll large numbers of people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Social Services an estimated 21% of the state\u2019s population \u2013 or 139,422 people \u2013 have no health insurance and would be eligible to get coverage through under Affordable Care Act provisions. This is the market Enroll Alaska has its eyes on.\n\nBoling admitted that the days are hectic as her company tries to manage its website, phone bank and staffing for all of the new field locations. \u201cWe expected some challenges,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we are moving very quickly,\u201d to make contact with as many uninsured people as possible \u2014 an effort jump started by the access to the Wal-Mart stores, Enroll Alaska executives said.\n\nEnroll Alaska is not the only resource for Alaskan consumers wanting answers about the new health law. Federally funded \u201cnavigators\u201d have been put in place to assist consumers \u2014 government grants have gone to the United Way of Anchorage and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium to fulfill this role. But the \u201cnavigators\u201d are forbidden to recommend a particular health care policy or solution. That is where Enroll Alaska can come in, said Weinstein. Consumers can get only so much from a government navigator or website or they can \u201ccall a toll-free number \u2014 but who is going to help after that?\u201d he asked. \u201cAn insurance professional.\u201d\n\nEnroll Alaska executives know the hill to profitability is steep. Two carriers are taking part in the marketplace in Alaska, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska and Moda Health of Portland, Ore., and their commissions are modest. Premera pays a flat fee of $25 per month per enrollee and Moda remits 6% of premiums, according to published reports. But, said Boling, Northrim didn\u2019t shy from jumping in. \u201cWe\u2019re building a business around the individual marketplace,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the company is also re-examining its core business and is preparing strategic shifts.\n\n\u201cWe expect the large employers to keep their group plans,\u201d said Weinstein. But he said he thinks the smaller ones will tend to \u201cStop, drop and roll,\u201d or stop what they are doing, drop their coverage and roll their employees over to the new exchanges. \u201cWe want to respond in a meaningful way\u201d to these market changes.\n\nWeinstein said Northrim would look to put together packages of ancillary insurance that employers can offer their workforce. Things like tax-free savings accounts and benefits to cover expenses such as ambulance transportation, blood, drugs and medical supplies like bandages that are usually layered on top of major medical coverage. \u201cWe want to provide a win-win,\u201d said Weinstein.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/commercial-auto/agencies-land-access-to-valuable-walmart-floor-space-15895.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/nurse%20doctor%20medical%20first%20aid%20(300%20x%20198).jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "The opportunity to staff health insurance kiosks in the massive retailer's stores is huge opportunity for some lucky agents", "title": "Agencies land access to valuable Wal-Mart floor space"}, "twitter": {"description": "The opportunity to staff health insurance kiosks in the massive retailer's stores is huge opportunity for some lucky agents", "title": "Agencies land access to valuable Wal-Mart floor space", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/commercial-auto/agencies-land-access-to-valuable-walmart-floor-space-15895.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/nurse%20doctor%20medical%20first%20aid%20(300%20x%20198).jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The opportunity to staff health insurance kiosks in the massive retailer's stores is huge opportunity for some lucky agents", "author": "Insurance Business"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a91\"", "article_summary": "The regional Blue Cross companies are all making separate deals with local brokers and Blue Cross understands that the brokers are free to sell other carrier\u2019s products, said Elfinger.\nEnroll Alaska is not the only resource for Alaskan consumers wanting answers about the new health law.\nTen Blue Cross companies in 14 states that have access to about \u201ca hundred stores,\u201d are using licensed professionals to staff their health care information kiosks in the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer\u2019s outlets, said Blue Cross spokesman Robert Elfinger.\nThis is the market Enroll Alaska has its eyes on.\nTwo carriers are taking part in the marketplace in Alaska, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska and Moda Health of Portland, Ore., and their commissions are modest."}
