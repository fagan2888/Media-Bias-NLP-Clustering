Hall, Power of positive thinking, Reagan occult, Ronald Reagan, Politics News\n\nRonald Reagan often spoke of America\u2019s divine purpose and of a mysterious plan behind the nation\u2019s founding. \u201cYou can call it mysticism if you want to,\u201d he told the Conservative Political Action Conference in 1974, \u201cbut I have always believed that there was some divine plan that placed this great continent between two oceans to be sought out by those who were possessed of an abiding love of freedom and a special kind of courage.\u201d These were remarks to which Reagan often returned. He repeated them almost verbatim as president before a television audience of millions for the Statue of Liberty centenary on July 4, 1986.\n\nWhen touching on such themes, Reagan echoed the work, and sometimes the phrasing, of occult scholar Manly P. Hall.\n\nFrom the dawn of Hall\u2019s career in the early 1920s until his death in 1990, the Los Angeles teacher wrote about America\u2019s \u201csecret destiny.\u201d The United States, in Hall\u2019s view, was a society that had been planned and founded by secret esoteric orders to spread enlightenment and liberty to the world.\n\nIn 1928, Hall attained underground fame when, at the remarkably young age of twenty-seven, he published \u201cThe Secret Teachings of All Ages,\u201d a massive codex to the mystical and esoteric philosophies of antiquity. Exploring subjects from Native American mythology to Pythagorean mathematics to the geometry of ancient Egypt, this encyclopedia arcana remains the unparalleled guidebook to ancient symbols and esoteric thought. \u201cThe Secret Teachings\u201d won the admiration of figures ranging from General John Pershing to Elvis Presley. Novelist Dan Brown cites it as a key source.\n\nAfter publishing his \u201cGreat Book,\u201d Hall spent the rest of his life lecturing and writing within the walls of his Egypto-art deco campus, the Philosophical Research Society, in L.A.\u2019s Griffith Park neighborhood. Hall called the place a \u201cmystery school\u201d in the mold of Pythagoras\u2019s ancient academy.\n\nIt was there in 1944 that the occult thinker produced a short work, one little known beyond his immediate circle. This book, \u201cThe Secret Destiny of America,\u201d evidently caught the eye of Reagan, then a middling movie actor gravitating toward politics.\n\nHall\u2019s concise volume described how America was the product of a \u201cGreat Plan\u201d for religious liberty and self-governance, launched by a hidden order of ancient philosophers and secret societies. In one chapter, Hall described a rousing speech delivered by a mysterious \u201cunknown speaker\u201d before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The \u201cstrange man,\u201d wrote Hall, invisibly entered and exited the locked doors of the statehouse in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, delivering an oration that bolstered the wavering spirits of the delegates. \u201cGod has given America to be free!\u201d commanded the mysterious speaker, urging the men to overcome their fears of being hanged or beheaded, and to seal destiny by signing the great document. Newly emboldened, the delegates rushed forward to add their names. They looked to thank the stranger only to discover that he had vanished from the locked room. Was this, Hall wondered, \u201cone of the agents of the secret Order, guarding and directing the destiny of America?\u201d\n\nAt a 1957 commencement address at his alma mater Eureka College, Reagan, then a corporate spokesman for General Electric, sought to inspire students with this leaf from occult history. \u201cThis is a land of destiny,\u201d Reagan said, \u201cand our forefathers found their way here by some Divine system of selective service gathered here to fulfill a mission to advance man a further step in his climb from the swamps.\u201d Reagan then retold (without naming a source) the tale of Hall\u2019s unknown speaker. \u201cWhen they turned to thank the speaker for his timely words,\u201d Reagan concluded, \u201che couldn\u2019t be found and to this day no one knows who he was or how he entered or left the guarded room.\u201d Reagan revived the story in 1981, when Parade magazine asked the president for a personal essay on what July 4 meant to him. Presidential aide Michael Deaver delivered the piece with a note saying, \u201cThis Fourth of July message is the president\u2019s own words and written initially in the president\u2019s hand,\u201d on a yellow pad at Camp David. Reagan retold the legend of the unknown speaker\u2014this time using language very close to Hall\u2019s own: \u201cWhen they turned to thank him for his timely oratory, he was not to be found, nor could any be found who knew who he was or how he had come in or gone out through the locked and guarded doors.\u201d\n\nWhere did Hall uncover the tale that inspired a president? The episode originated as \u201cThe Speech of the Unknown\u201d in a collection of folkloric stories about America\u2019s founding, published in 1847 under the title \u201cWashington and His Generals, or Legends of the Revolution\u201d by American social reformer and muckraker George Lippard. Lippard, a friend of Edgar Allan Poe, had a strong taste for the gothic\u2014he cloaked his mystery man in a \u201cdark robe.\u201d He also tacitly acknowledged inventing the story: \u201cThe name of the Orator . . . is not definitely known. In this speech, it is my wish to compress some portion of the fiery eloquence of the time.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Hall seemed to know almost nothing about the story\u2019s point of origin. He had been given a copy of the \u201cSpeech of the Unknown\u201d by a since-deceased secretary of the occult Theosophical Society, but with no bibliographical information other than its being from a \u201crare old volume of early American political speeches.\u201d The speech appeared in 1938 in the Society\u2019s journal, The Theosophist, with the sole note that it was \u201cpublished in a rare volume of addresses, and known probably to only one in a million, even of American citizens.\u201d\n\nThere are indications that Reagan and Hall may have personally met to discuss the story. In an element unique to Hall\u2019s version, the mystic-writer (dubiously) attributed the tale of the unknown speaker to the writings of Thomas Jefferson. When Reagan addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on January 25, 1974, he again told the story, but this time cited an attribution\u2014of sorts. Reagan said the tale was told to him \u201csome years ago\u201d by \u201ca writer, who happened to be an avid student of history. . . . I was told by this man that the story could be found in the writings of Jefferson. I confess, I never researched or made an effort to verify it.\u201d\n\nWhether the president and the occultist ever met, it is Hall\u2019s language that unmistakably marks the Reagan telling.\n\nBiographer Edmund Morris noted Reagan\u2019s fondness for apocryphal tales and his \u201cDal\u00edesque ability to bend reality to his own purposes.\u201d Yet he added that the president\u2019s stories \u201cshould be taken seriously because they represent core philosophy.\u201d This influential (and sometimes inscrutable) president of the late twentieth century found an illustration of his core belief in America\u2019s purpose within the pages of an occult work little known beyond its genre.\n\n\u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d\n\nDuring the 1980 president campaign, many Americans were electrified by Reagan\u2019s depiction of America as a divinely ordained nation where anything could be willed into existence.\n\nIn announcing his candidacy in 1979, Reagan declared: \u201cTo me our country is a living, breathing presence, unimpressed by what others say is impossible. . . . If there is one thing we are sure of it is . . . that nothing is impossible, and that man is capable of improving his circumstances beyond what we are told is fact.\u201d It was a vastly different kind of political oratory than the restrained, moralistic tones of his opponent, Jimmy Carter.\n\nThrough his reiteration of this theme of America\u2019s destiny, and his powers as a communicator, Reagan shaped how Americans wanted to see themselves: as a portentous people possessed of the indomitable spirit to scale any height. This American self-perception could bitterly clash with reality in the face of a declining industrial base and falling middle-class wages. Nonetheless, the image that Reagan gave Americans of themselves\u2014as a people always ushering in new dawns\u2014formed the political template to which every president who followed him had to publicly adhere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Gipper's warm \"morning in America\" worldview was directly shaped by his reading of occult thinker Manly P.
