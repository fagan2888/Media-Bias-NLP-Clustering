Chris Christie called his presidential rival Marco Rubio the \u201cboy in the bubble.\u201d He was referring to Rubio\u2019s supposed lack of face time with voters, instead relying on manufactured town halls and scripted answers. Yet, pundits can\u2019t help thinking the New Jersey governor was also targeting Rubio\u2019s youth. Judge for yourself:\n\n\"We know who the boy in the bubble is up here who never answers your questions, who's constantly scripted and controlled because he can't answer your questions,\" Christie said. \"So when Senator Rubio gets here, when the boy in the bubble gets here, I hope you ask him some questions.\"\n\nThe New Jersey governor had no intention of backtracking on the controversial comment in an interview with Fox News' Greta Van Susteren:\n\n\"The reason it applies to him is because he is not ready to be president of the United States. He is not ready because of the way he \u2013 not only his lack of accomplishment in his Senate career but also because he lives a very protected life as a candidate. He doesn't answer questions in gaggles.\"\n\nRubio, who has enjoyed a surge in New Hampshire as of late, surpassing Ted Cruz to get to second place, dismissed Christie\u2019s dis as a simple knee jerk reaction to his own slipping poll numbers.\n\n\"When people are having a tough time in a campaign, especially near the end, you see some desperation set in they start saying things,\" Rubio told reporters Thursday.\n\nChristie has company in attacking the increasingly popular Florida senator. In an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\u201d Friday, Gov. Jeb Bush said Rubio had accomplished \u201cnothing\u201d in the Senate.\n\nThe timing of the two governors\u2019 attacks against Rubio led to a New York Times report suggesting the two had a secret deal to jeopardize Rubio\u2019s campaign. Christie denied that allegation.\n\nDonald Trump is still well in front in New Hampshire polls, but with Rubio steadily gaining, the businessman may again find himself in a frustrating second place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rubio surge = bigger target..05/27/2016 7:53:26AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Rubio surge = bigger target.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Christie Doubles Down on 'Boy in the Bubble' Comment, Hammers Rubio on Youth, Inexperience", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/02/05/christie-continues-to-hammer-rubio-on-youth-inexperience-n2115300", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/35/a2ccd056-f2f2-4c09-af0c-967fe935359e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Rubio surge = bigger target.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Christie Doubles Down on 'Boy in the Bubble' Comment, Hammers Rubio on Youth, Inexperience", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/02/05/christie-continues-to-hammer-rubio-on-youth-inexperience-n2115300", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/35/a2ccd056-f2f2-4c09-af0c-967fe935359e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Christie Doubles Down on 'Boy in the Bubble' Comment, Hammers Rubio on Youth, Inexperience, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\"So when Senator Rubio gets here, when the boy in the bubble gets here, I hope you ask him some questions.\"\nJudge for yourself:\"We know who the boy in the bubble is up here who never answers your questions, who's constantly scripted and controlled because he can't answer your questions,\" Christie said.\nChris Christie called his presidential rival Marco Rubio the \u201cboy in the bubble.\u201d He was referring to Rubio\u2019s supposed lack of face time with voters, instead relying on manufactured town halls and scripted answers.\nYet, pundits can\u2019t help thinking the New Jersey governor was also targeting Rubio\u2019s youth.\nDonald Trump is still well in front in New Hampshire polls, but with Rubio steadily gaining, the businessman may again find himself in a frustrating second place."}
