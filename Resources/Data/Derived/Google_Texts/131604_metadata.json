In a way, he works for them all \u2014 and for none of them.\n\nIn a niche made more attractive by the complexities of healthcare insurance and Obamacare, Lo serves as a broker for individuals and companies, working to whittle down the bulky menu of insurance choices to a few that best suit his clients.\n\nPatch sat down with Lo on a virtual park bench, and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: How did you come up with the name of your business?\n\nA: I submitted a list of 5 possible names to my wife. She picked the best one: Well Spot. We brand ourselves as a health insurance firm dedicated to wellness.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What\u2019s the best part about doing business in your town?\n\nA: We help individuals and small businesses within our local community. Already, more than 30 clients have found healthcare coverage through Well Spot. Our customers include many self-employed individuals. It has been rewarding to be a part of our local business community.\n\n\n\nQ: What attracted to you to this business, and how did you start?\n\nA: This business allows us to help our clients find better access to healthcare. Our complex health insurance system often frustrates us. Well Spot simplifies our lives. We allow our customers to find insurance to take care of their health and financial needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: If you were to get an indulgent snack in your town, where would you go and what would you get?\n\nA: I would get frozen yogurt from Taro near the Morristown Green.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What\u2019s the biggest challenge or most difficult moment you\u2019ve faced in your job?\n\nA: It was most difficult to build early momentum. People tend to shop for health insurance from people they trust. Therefore, we worked hard to establish a strong reputation within our community.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What advice would you give to a person just starting in your business?\n\nA: Seek help from people already in the industry. The health insurance system has lots of structure. It makes sense to understand how it works before innovating.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever been given?\n\nA: To succeed, put your heart in what you do.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: If you were going to have a secret rendezvous in town, where would it be?\n\nA: I would meet secretly at Loantaka Park, where I often jog with my friends and family.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: You\u2019re not the only person in this business. How do you distinguish yourself from the others?\n\nA: We listen patiently to our customers to find solutions that fit. As a broker, Well Spot represents clients who need health insurance. We run the extra mile for our customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Morristown, NJ Patch", "description": "This isn't insurance offered by an agent but by a healthcare broker whose niche is to find clients the best healthcare insurance available.", "title": "3 Minutes With Morristown Insurance Broker Keith Lo of Well Spot", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/592484/2015/03/T800x600/2015035500afc9bc35c.jpg", "url": "http://patch.com/new-jersey/morristown/3-minutes-morristown-insurance-broker-keith-lo-well-spot-0", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-03-16T05:31:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-16T05:31:41-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Morristown, NJ - This isn't insurance offered by an agent but by a healthcare broker whose niche is to find clients the best healthcare insurance available.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "This isn't insurance offered by an agent but by a healthcare broker whose niche is to find clients the best healthcare insurance available.\nMorristown\u2019s Keith Lo, the president of Well Spot Corp. and a Patch partner, doesn\u2019t work for an insurance company.\nAs a broker, Well Spot represents clients who need health insurance.\nWe brand ourselves as a health insurance firm dedicated to wellness.\nPeople tend to shop for health insurance from people they trust."}
