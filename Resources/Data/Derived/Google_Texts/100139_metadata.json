The 32-year-old considers her handpicked collection of workouts her \u201cprized possessions,\u201d particularly the titles featuring instructor Shaun T.\n\n\u201cHe helped me lose 30 pounds and so many inches,\u201d she says.\n\nJohnson loves progressing through a familiar routine. She feels like she\u2019s become buddies with the folks on screen.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t Johnson have plans to buy any more DVDs \u2014 not even this month, the biggest time of year for the fitness industry? There\u2019s simply too much competition for her muscles.\n\nHer marketing job keeps her on the road a week each month, and her phone travels with her everywhere. Google\u2019s fastest-growing app category in 2014 was health and fitness. So for those hotel-room workouts, Johnson now uses Sworkit (free, or $1.99 for the premium version, iOS and Android), which spits out customizable circuit-training routines.\n\nOn the side, she\u2019s experimenting with streaming workouts, which have transformed the Internet into an all-you-can-sweat buffet. For now, Johnson has just sampled free options, including the BeFit YouTube channel and Popsugar (available on YouTube and Hulu), and she\u2019s been consistently pleased with the content, if not always her WiFi connection.\n\nWith so many new alternatives available \u2014 most of them considerably cheaper than investing in another disc \u2014 of course Johnson and her fellow DVD devotees are straying. The only question is how much longer the market has before its final cooldown.\n\nWhen historians study the fitness DVD era, they may be able to pinpoint its demise to March 11, 2014. That\u2019s when Collage Video, which started hawking workout programs in 1987, shocked its die-hard fans with the news it was closing.\n\nThe site\u2019s thorough reviews and preview snippets had made Collage the Web\u2019s most trusted DVD source. But shoppers had been increasingly reading up on possible purchases, and then clicking over to Amazon or eBay to save money.\n\n\u201cThe outlook was bleak,\u201d admits Peter Castro, vice president of BayView Entertainment, a New Jersey studio that produces and distributes exercise videos. Rather than see one of its best customers go under, BayView purchased Collage and relaunched the site in June with a revamped look and lower prices.\n\nCastro is convinced that if any segment of the DVD market has the stamina to survive, it\u2019s fitness. Unlike movies or shows most people watch only a handful of times, workouts are often replayed daily. Fans generally want to experience them in a single location \u2014 often a living room or basement. Plus, the core customers aren\u2019t especially tech-savvy, says Castro, who\u2019s amazed how much business is still conducted through catalogs and by check. Until four years ago, he notes, Collage was selling VHS.\n\nBut even Collage will likely migrate \u2014 at least partially \u2014 to a streaming, subscription-based model, Castro says. He\u2019s just not sure when, or how different it will look from the other Web sites jostling for the title of the \u201cNetflix of fitness.\u201d The list of competitors keeps growing. Some are focused on one studio or instructor, such as Cathe Live, Suzanne Bowen Fitness and Barre3.\n\nAlthough the workouts these outlets offer might not seem so drastically different from what\u2019s on DVD, the online format is reshaping the industry.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/hffit27.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00f8\"", "article_summary": "Meet Sarah Johnson, fitness DVD addict.\nWhen historians study the fitness DVD era, they may be able to pinpoint its demise to March 11, 2014.\nSo why doesn\u2019t Johnson have plans to buy any more DVDs \u2014 not even this month, the biggest time of year for the fitness industry?\nSo for those hotel-room workouts, Johnson now uses Sworkit (free, or $1.99 for the premium version, iOS and Android), which spits out customizable circuit-training routines.\nOn the side, she\u2019s experimenting with streaming workouts, which have transformed the Internet into an all-you-can-sweat buffet."}
