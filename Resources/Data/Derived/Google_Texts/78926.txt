Panama City Beach Mayor Gayle Oberst even came out to raise a toast to the event.

Each person received a shot glass and went to each tasting over 200 different crafts beer from around the country and globe.

Fishale is raising money for the toys for kids foundation.

Marketing Director of Fishale Chris Pfahol says, "For us the excitement of crafts beer, being able to give it to a good charity and just have a great time with our community is what we are excited about."

Panama City Beach Mayor Gayle Oberst says, "I think it's a great festival. It's going to be a lot of fun and it's going to raise money for a very worth wild organization."

The organization was established in 1997.

All proceeds that are collected will go to Toys for Kids foundation.
