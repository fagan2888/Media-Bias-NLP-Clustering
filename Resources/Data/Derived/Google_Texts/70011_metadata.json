The Urbandale-based company says it wants to raise rates to its customers by at least 18 percent.\n\nIowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart says Coventry likely took on more risk than they projected. He predicts rates will rise for current policyholders who have purchased the subsidized coverage through Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately people are not going to be able to see rates until November so people will have to wait until open enrollment which begins,\u201d says Gerhart. \u201cBut at that time they\u2019ll be able to go to Healthcare.gov or talk to an agent or navigator to look for insurance that best suits their needs.\u201d\n\nGerhart says two other carriers have filed to be on the healthcare exchange next year. He says he can\u2019t predict what that will do to rates but it will offer more choices if someone impacted by the rate increase wants to shop around.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Coventry Health Care is currently the only health insurance provider offering subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act in", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://iowapublicradio.org/post/coventry-health-care-wants-raise-rates-18-percent", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/ipr/files/styles/medium/public/201505/16224080672_fa030dac9c_o.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Coventry Health Care is currently the only health insurance provider offering subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act in", "title": "Coventry Health Care Wants to Raise Rates 18 Percent"}, "story_id": 410045747, "twitter": {"site": "@IowaPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Clay_Masters"}, "author": "Clay Masters", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Coventry Health Care Wants to Raise Rates 18 Percent"}, "nid": 58350, "datePublished": "2015-05-27", "wordCount": 187, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Coventry Health Care is currently the only health insurance provider offering subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act in Iowa.\nThe Urbandale-based company says it wants to raise rates to its customers by at least 18 percent.\nHe predicts rates will rise for current policyholders who have purchased the subsidized coverage through Healthcare.gov.\nIowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart says Coventry likely took on more risk than they projected.\nHe says he can\u2019t predict what that will do to rates but it will offer more choices if someone impacted by the rate increase wants to shop around."}
