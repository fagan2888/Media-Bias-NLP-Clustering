Steve Beshear

Officials of a Frankfort-based health technology company with close ties to the Beshear administration, and the spouses of those officials, combined to contribute $50,000 to the Kentucky Democratic Party last month – the largest bundle of contributions in a huge fundraising month for the party.

A report filed by the Kentucky Democratic Party with the Federal Election last week shows contributions of $10,000 each in July from: HealthTech CEO Sandeep Kapoor; Kapoor's wife Gargi Chatterjee Kapoor, who works in state government's Commonwealth Office of Technology; HealthTech COO Franklin Lassiter; Lassiter's wife Mary Lassiter, who is secretary of Gov. Steve Beshear's executive cabinet; and HealthTech senior consultant Kathy S. Frye.

Sandeep Kapoor is former chief technology officer in the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Lassiter is former executive director of that cabinet's Office of Administrative and Technology Services. The two said they left state government to form HealthTech in 2011.

Both said in interviews that their company did no business with state government for more than two years after they left their former jobs at the cabinet. They said HealthTech currently does some consulting work for the Health and Family Services Cabinet, but the contract was won through a competitive process and represents a small part of the company's revenue.

Kapoor said the firm's close ties to the Beshear administration could be questioned if the company began with a Kentucky contract. "But we started working for almost 2 and a half, 3 years, before we got re-engaged here in Kentucky," Kapoor said.

Kapoor said the company now has nearly 60 employees and has contracts in 17 states. "We do technical assistance, we do subject-matter expertise, information technology solutions for state governments…We're doing a lot of work in the area of high tech and Affordable Care Act in multiple states."

As to why Health Solutions gave so big to the Democratic party, Franklin Lassiter said, "Matt Bevin and the Republican Party say the first thing they are going to do is try to do away with Kentucky kynect and with all the ancillary things that go along with the Affordable Care Act. We're not for that."

Lassiter said the Affordable Care Act "has been indirectly responsible for a lot of the work we've done."

But Kapoor said that whether Kentucky continues to embrace the Affordable Care Act under the next governor "won't even be a blip" for his company. He said less than 8 percent of Health Solution's revenues come from Kentucky. Also, he said, any major reversal of health policy would mean change, and change normally means more work for health technology consultants.

He said the Affordable Care Act is good policy for Kentucky that he supports for personal reasons. "I have a special needs child who had struggled to get insurance earlier...The Affordable Care Act is very important to us both personally," Kapoor said.

The $50,000 from HealthTech people represented the largest of many big contributions – many of them from state contractors or appointees of Gov. Beshear - during a big month for the Kentucky Democrats.

The party reported $585,867 in total receipts during the month and $687,203 in cash-on-hand as of July 31.

By comparison, the Republican Party of Kentucky reported just $382,928 in receipts for the entire first six months of this year. It reported only $167,116 on hand as of June 30. (The RPK did not file a report for July. It reports its finances to the FEC every six months, the Democratic Party reports its finances monthly.)
