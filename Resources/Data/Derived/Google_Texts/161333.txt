A 21-year-old woman was killed early Sunday in Vail when she was hit by a car while trying to cross Interstate 70, Vail police said.

The woman, Starria Feldmann, of West Vail, stepped from the median into the westbound lanes of the interstate about 2 a.m. The driver who hit Feldmann is not suspected of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of time of the crash and has not been charged with any crime, police said.

“Witnesses indicate the woman had gone outside of her residence shortly before the accident, but it remains unclear why she walked onto the highway,” police said in a release. “Investigators believe alcohol was a factor.”

Westbound lanes of the interstate were closed for about three hours while authorities investigated the death.

In 2009, a pedestrian was killed while trying to cross the interstate near where Feldmann was killed, police said.
