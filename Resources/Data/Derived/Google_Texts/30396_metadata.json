The petition-initiated law would require consumers to buy a separate rider for abortion coverage.\n\nEd Rivet is with Right to Life. He says anti-abortion groups felt compelled to act because of the new federal healthcare law.\n\n\u201cThe healthcare law is coming. People have to buy insurance,\u201d says Rivet, \u201cIf we don\u2019t pass this law, it will include abortion coverage. Pretty simple. They said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll sign.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Legislature is expected to adopt the law once the signatures are certified by a state board. Otherwise the question would go on the ballot. Either way, the measure could not be vetoed by the governor.\n\nGovernor Rick Snyder vetoed a similar provision that was sent him last year by the Legislature, and he says he doesn\u2019t regret it.\n\nAt the time Snyder said \u201cbecause it didn\u2019t identify in terms of rape, incest kind of issues appropriately.\u201d\n\nDemocratic state Senator Glenn Anderson, who opposes the measure, says it would be better to let voters decide the question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll stop and think about the small number of signatures,\u201d says Anderson, \u201cIt\u2019s only between 3 and 4 percent of the population of this state, if this is implemented and passed by the Legislature, will basically make a decision on women\u2019s health. I think it\u2019ll be a big mistake.\u201d\n\nThis is the fourth time abortion foes used the petition process to enact a law.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "Abortion opponents have turned in more than 315,000 petition signatures calling on the Legislature to place new restrictions on health coverage.
