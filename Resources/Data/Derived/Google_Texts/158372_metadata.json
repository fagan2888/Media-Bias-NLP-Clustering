In a recent video, TED Ed aims to debunk the myths of OCD in order to make it easier for potential sufferers to seek help.\n\nThe first myth is the idea OCD is synonymous with repetitive, or ritualistic, behaviors. There are two aspects of OCD: intrusive thoughts, images, and impulses, as well as the behavioral compulsions to relieve their intrusions. While the commonly given example is excessive hand-washing, this isn\u2019t necessarily a symptom of OCD. This, instead, could be an obsessive tendency.\n\nSomeone with OCD, which TED Ed cites is actually a rare disorder, will have little or no control over their intrusive thoughts and compulsions, ultimately impeding their work, school, and social life. And something like excessive hygiene is hardly the \u201cmain symptom\u201d of the disorder; obsessions and compulsions can manifest as fears of contamination or illness.\n\nExperts believe the brains of OCD sufferers are hardwired to function a certain way. The three affected regions \u2014 the orbitofrontal, caudate nucleus, and cingulate gyrus \u2014 play respective roles in social behavior, as well as emotional and motivational responses. OCD is also associated with lower levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which the brain regions use to help regulate vital processes.\n\nIf someone is diagnosed with OCD, there are effective treatments available, from medication to behavioral therapy. The National Institute for Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health has found OCD \"usually responds well to treatment.\" As TED Ed concludes, \"With knowledge and understanding comes the power to seek help.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "main, symptom, ocd, isnt, excessive, handwashing, plus, other, myths, debunked", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "TED Ed hopes to empower potential OCD sufferers with the knowledge they need to seek help.", "title": "Everything You Believe About OCD Probably Isn't True [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/main-symptom-ocd-isnt-excessive-handwashing-plus-other-myths-debunked-335008", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/26/main-symptom-ocd-isnt-excessive-handwashing-plus-other-myths-debunked.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "TED Ed hopes to empower potential OCD sufferers with the knowledge they need to seek help.", "title": "Everything You Believe About OCD Probably Isn't True [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/main-symptom-ocd-isnt-excessive-handwashing-plus-other-myths-debunked-335008", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/26/main-symptom-ocd-isnt-excessive-handwashing-plus-other-myths-debunked.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/26/main-symptom-ocd-isnt-excessive-handwashing-plus-other-myths-debunked.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-26T16:00:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-26T16:00:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "TED Ed hopes to empower potential OCD sufferers with the knowledge they need to seek help."}, "article_summary": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neurobiological disorder that neither society nor mental health professionals fully understand, finds TED Ed.\nWhile the commonly given example is excessive hand-washing, this isn\u2019t necessarily a symptom of OCD.\nExperts believe the brains of OCD sufferers are hardwired to function a certain way.\nAs TED Ed concludes, \"With knowledge and understanding comes the power to seek help.\"\nIn a recent video, TED Ed aims to debunk the myths of OCD in order to make it easier for potential sufferers to seek help."}
