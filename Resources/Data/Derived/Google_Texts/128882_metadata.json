Kim LaPean, spokesperson for University Health Services, said the current contract is designed to provide a more stable, three- to five-year partnership.\n\nAs a result, students will pay slightly more for coverage but will have access to increased coverage for vision and dental care, transgender benefits and a wider range of in-network providers, including local emergency services.\n\nLaPean said that initially, UHS was bracing for difficult decisions such as across-the-board price increases and benefits cuts, but that the modest price increases came as a happy surprise. She said the \u201caggressive\u201d negotiations and expertise of UHS\u2019 new broker, Wells Fargo Insurance, and an insurance climate more accustomed to the Affordable Care Act were likely factors that shaped the deal.\n\nThe Student Health Insurance Advisory Committee, or SHIAC \u2014 composed of students from the ASUC and the Graduate Assembly \u2014 met weekly with UHS officials starting in November to provide input and learn the complexities involved with choosing carriers.\n\nCosts for basic SHIP coverage will rise by $16, from $1,290 to $1,306 per semester, for undergraduates \u2014 the same price that students who have dependents such as a spouse or single child pay. For graduate students who are single or with one dependent child or spouse, prices will increase more significantly from $1,877 to $2,073. Graduate students with two dependent children, however, will pay $4,030.\n\nLaPean and members of student feedback committees \u2014 SHIAC and the larger Student Health Advisory Committee \u2014 said the increase was well worth the additional benefits.\n\n\u201cIt ended up being kind of an easy choice,\u201d said Elioth Gomez, a UC Berkeley senior on both committees.\n\nApproximately 10 percent of UC Berkeley students are parents, according to an estimate from LaPean. In the 2014-15 term, about 200 dependents were covered, all of them either children or spouses.\n\nDependents represent less than 1 percent of the approximately 22,000 students covered through SHIP insurance, LaPean said in an email, but coverage for dependents is a crucial factor for some students when choosing whether to attend UC Berkeley.\n\n\u201c(You ask), \u2018Are you making the right decision for them?\u2019 \u201d said Michal Olszewski, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in molecular and cell biology and representative on SHIAC. \u201cI started to question that when dependent coverage was revoked.\u201d\n\nHe and his wife worried when their son, now almost 2 years old, went for a long stretch of time without insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cIt should never have been a problem in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nUC Berkeley began offering dependent coverage in 2011 but controversially terminated the program as a cost-saving measure last year. Vociferous feedback from unions representing UC workers and graduate students, among other groups, was a driving force behind its restoration, according to LaPean.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a more transparent process for everyone,\u201d LaPean said.\n\nStudents commended the new benefits for transgender-related operations in next year\u2019s plan. While SHIP currently covers transgender reassignment surgery, it will now cover related treatments as well, such as electrolysis hair removal and top surgery, which are considered cosmetic operations by some insurance providers and are therefore not covered, according to LaPean.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re essential as the surgery itself, if not more,\u201d said David Green, a second-year public policy graduate student in the campus\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy, who is transgender. Like many on the feedback committees, she considers the options integral to those seeking to transition.\n\nAs part of the transition, LaPean said some students will experience delays as the provider networks and online systems adjust.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be the most progressive school out there,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cWe are Berkeley, and a lot of people forget that.\u201d\n\nAccording to the UHS website, more details of the plan will be released in April.\n\nAlexander Barreira is the lead schools and communities reporter.
