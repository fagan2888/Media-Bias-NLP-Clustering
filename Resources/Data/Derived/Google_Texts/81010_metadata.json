(AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\n4005917\n\nThe White House is scoffing at a new study which shows there\u2019s no public record that President Barack Obama ever met with the top official responsible for developing the Obamacare network.\n\nBut White House spokesman Jay Carney declined today to cite one example where Obama met with Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of the Health and Human Services department.\n\nInstead, Carney claimed that \u201cshe\u2019s here a lot and meets with the president with regular \u2014 with regularity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that Kathleen Sebelius has been one of the more frequent visitors to and attendance of meetings with the president,\u201d Carney said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t have the figures.\u201d\n\nSebelius has likely met with Obama many times at ceremonial events, such as celebrations, staged cabinet meetings and PR events.\n\nBut if White House officials details any of those meetings, they\u2019ll likely get media pressure to describe all of the meetings \u2014 and the number of those meetings between Obama and Sebelius may be very small. That would be a problem, because it would bolsters critics who says the president acted carelessly and recklessly while trying to redesign the nation\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nThe report, \u201cPresidential Meetings With Cabinet Secretaries Since the Signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\u201d is shocking because it suggests that Obama didn\u2019t bother to meet with Sebelius, despite her task of revamping the nation\u2019s health-care system to match the interests of the Democratic Party.\n\nAlso, the Obamacare rollout has been a PR catastrophe for Obama, partly because it showed how be deceived the public about his promise that they could keep their insurance plans, and because it shredded his claim that he could manage the federal government.\n\nIn the weeks after the Oct. 1. unveiling, his approvals numbers crashed below 40 percent, and the public\u2019s trust in him dropped to roughly 5o percent.\n\nBut instead of proving the report wrong by providing reporters with dates, diary entries and photographs, Carney today scoffed at the report, which was completed by the private-sector Government Accountability Institute, run by an accomplished researcher, Peter Schweizer.\n\nThe \u201creport that was written by an advocate,\u201d complained Carney, who is paid to be an advocate for the president.\n\nThe report, he said, \u201cis based on a ridiculously false premise\u201d that all visits to the White House are recorded in public logs. Instead, he said, visiting \u201ccabinet secretaries don\u2019t regularly get entered into the visitors logs because they come frequently.\u201d\n\nBut the report does not claim Sebelius never met with Obama \u2014 it claims \u201cthe [public] Presidential schedule does not document a single one-on-one meeting with Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of the Department of Health and Human Services.. [although] there is one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and [then] Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.\u201d\n\nCarney insisted that Obama does meet with cabinet officials. \u201cHe meets with other Cabinet secretaries in one-on-ones and small groups all the time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe repot documents hundreds of such meetings, but only one with Sebelius.\n\nBut Carney did not provide any examples where Obama met with Sebelius. \u201cI don\u2019t have all those figures in front of me\u2026 I don\u2019t have the figures,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "The White House is scoffing at a new study which shows there\u2019s no public record that President Barack Obama ever met with the top official responsible for", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The White House is scoffing at a new study which shows there\u2019s no public record that President Barack Obama ever met with the top official responsible for developing the Obamacare network.
