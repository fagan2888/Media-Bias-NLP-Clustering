However, some say that\u2019s setting the bar too high. A wider availability of marijuana may increase rates of accidental ingestions by children attracted to cookies and other candies laced with the drug.\n\nOn Tuesday, a two-year-old girl ingested marijuana accidentally by eating a cookie she\u2019d found in front of her apartment building in Longmont, Colo. Aida Hernandez said that she told her daughter to throw away the cookie and didn\u2019t realize anything was wrong until they\u2019d gone out shopping. The girl later tested positive at the hospital for marijuana\u2019s active ingredient, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). \u201cShe was sleepy, she was opening and closing her eyes, and she couldn\u2019t walk very well,\u2019 Hernandez told FOX31 Denver after police began investigating with social services on the case.\n\nDetective Commander Jeff Satur said police had failed to find any signs of drug use after searching the family\u2019s home. \u201cAt this point we believe the family,\u201d Satur said.\n\nThe accidental dosing came just one day prior to the beginning of retail marijuana sales in the state, whose voters approved the drug law reform in a November referendum. Presently, marijuana is legal for prescription-based medical treatment in 18 states and the District of Columbia, whereas the drug has been legalized now for recreational purposes in Colorado and Washington.\n\nIn May, medical toxicologist George Sam Wang and his colleagues at the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center in Denver published a study about pediatric marijuana poisonings. \"We are seeing increases in exposure to marijuana in young pediatric patients, and they have more severe symptoms than we typically associate with marijuana,\" Wang said in a statement. \"We hadn't seen these exposures before the big boom of the medical marijuana industry.\u201d\n\nThe medical marijuana industry began in Colorado in 2009, before which such poisonings were much rarer. In the study, Wang and his colleagues compared the number of children treated in the emergency room of one local hospital for marijuana poisonings, before and after the law\u2019s enactment.\n\nAt that hospital, nearly 14,000 children ages 12 and younger had been evaluated for accidental poisonings during the retrospective study group, running from January 2005 to the end of 2011. Of those pediatric cases, 790 occurred prior to the law\u2019s change, while 588 occurred after Sept. 30, 2009 \u2014 showing a big jump. Moreover, Wang and his colleagues found that none of the earlier poisonings were attributed to marijuana.\n\nSource: Wang, George Sam, Roosevelt, Genie, Heard, Kennon.
