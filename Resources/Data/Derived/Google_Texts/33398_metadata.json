These individuals are really bright and have real potential to go on to exciting and fulfilling jobs. But by choosing the criminal path they can move from low level \u2018pranking\u2019 to higher level cyber crime quite quickly, sometimes without even considering that what they\u2019re doing is against the law.\u201d\n\nA conviction handed down as the result of a cyber prank could hinder educational and career prospects, the NCA warned, and could potentially leave an individual unable to travel overseas.\n\nThe NCA\u2019s campaign specifically singles out a freely available tool, the Lizard Stresser, that was touted by a group of hackers who called themselves the Lizard Squad and successfully used the software to take down the Playstation 4 and Xbox Networks late last year with a tactic called a distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack. British authorities subsequently arrested seven individuals accused of using the tool to cripple websites, and all of them were under the age of 18.\n\nAround 30 percent of U.K. businesses claim they have suffered from DDoS attacks, NCA reported earlier this year, but companies have hardly been the only ones affected: after British authorities announced earlier this year that they had arrested a half-dozen teenagers suspected of using the Lizard Stresser, the NCA\u2019s own website was briefly brought down by a DDoS attack.\n\n\u201cYoung people are becoming increasingly savvy and switched on to the world of cyber, something that is critical to the future defense of our country. The issue is keeping them on the right side of the law; many become attracted to the environment and the kudos they earn from getting involved in criminal activities,\u201d said Dr. Robert L Nowill, the chairman of the British government\u2019s Cyber Security Challenge\u2014a government-endorsed program that intends to steer computer-inclined youngsters towards using their cyber skills for good.\n\nAs part of its #CyberChoices campaign, the NCA has released a list for parents of behaviors that \u201cmay indicate a young person is at risk of getting involved in cyber crime,\u201d the likes of which includes an interest in programing, irregular sleeping patterns and antisocial behavior.\n\n\u201cIf a young person is showing some of these signs try and have a conversation with them about their online activities. This will allow you to assess their computer knowledge proficiency so you can understand what they are doing, explain the consequences of cyber crime and help them make the right choices,\u201d the agency implored.\n\nIn the U.S., meanwhile, a federal judge in Missouri this week sentenced a 33-year-old man to 12-months in prison for taking down a law enforcement-affiliated website last year with a DDoS attack as an apparent act of protest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.K.'s federal law enforcement agency is asking British parents to keep an eye on their kids' computer habits after determining that the average age of individuals suspected of hacking is only 17 years old.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.K.\u2019s federal law enforcement agency is asking British parents to keep an eye on their kids\u2019 computer habits after determining that the average age of individuals suspected of hacking is only 17 years old.", "title": "As hacking suspects get younger, parents urged to patrol kids\u2019 computer habits", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/8/hacking-suspects-get-younger-parents-urged-patrol/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/28/curbing-kids-onlinejpeg-07ca0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/28/curbing-kids-onlinejpeg-07ca0.jpg", "description": "The U.K.'s federal law enforcement agency is asking British parents to keep an eye on their kids' computer habits after determining that the average age of individuals suspected of hacking is only 17", "card": "summary", "title": "As hacking suspects get younger, parents urged to patrol kids\u2019 c"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Technology Internet, Law Crime, National Crime Agency"}, "article_summary": "The U.K.\u2019s federal law enforcement agency is asking British parents to keep an eye on their kids\u2019 computer habits after determining that the average age of individuals suspected of hacking is only 17 years old.\nThis will allow you to assess their computer knowledge proficiency so you can understand what they are doing, explain the consequences of cyber crime and help them make the right choices,\u201d the agency implored.\n\u201cIf a young person is showing some of these signs try and have a conversation with them about their online activities.\nThese individuals are really bright and have real potential to go on to exciting and fulfilling jobs.\nBritish authorities subsequently arrested seven individuals accused of using the tool to cripple websites, and all of them were under the age of 18."}
