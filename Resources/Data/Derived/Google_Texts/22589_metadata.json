Barely a few hours later, I found myself sifting through customary Facebook remembrances and news media eulogies for the conservative stalwart.\n\nTruthfully, I was perplexed. Scalia was a polarizing figure\u2014and unapologetically so\u2014with a legal legacy that I and many others consider reproachable, if not destructive. He classified the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as \"racial entitlement,\u201d and issued a blistering dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, comparing abortion rights to slavery. Any opinions related to the LGBT community denied the protection of their fundamental rights. And yet, many of my friends, many journalists, even, were circumspect on these shortcomings.\n\nWhen distinguished individuals die, it's natural to celebrate their accomplishments, but it's also never too soon to criticize them.\n\nA few weeks ago, Fernand Le F\u00e8vre wrote an op-ed calling on Columbians to reflect upon civil discourse. He inveighed against the use of \u201cthe language of idiosyncratic intuitions and moral assumptions\u201d to obstruct otherwise productive discussion, citing a seminar in which he and his liberal classmates allowed a socially conservative nationalist to \u201cvoice and explain his opinions without rebuke.\u201d He claims that this polite engagement\u2014\u201cimbued with mutual respect\u201d\u2014created a space for identifying common ground.\n\nLe F\u00e8vre\u2019s approach to civil discourse can be summarized as respectful disagreement. It\u2019s not a groundbreaking framework by any means, but Le F\u00e8vre actually does it harm. Woven throughout his piece is the dangerous notion that contention and hostility \u201cstunt the process of learning.\u201d\n\nAfter Scalia\u2019s death, many people followed in Le F\u00e8vre\u2019s footsteps by writing platitudinous odes: \u201cWe may have our political differences, but he was committed and consistent to his legal reasoning,\u201d a friend of mine wrote on Facebook. She wasn\u2019t the only one. I was taken aback by the overwhelming tolerance, by the concerted efforts to avoid acrimony. By being deferential to the contrarian justice, don\u2019t we obfuscate the very thing that gave Scalia acclaim: his brilliant antagonism?\n\nThe Supreme Court originalist will certainly be remembered for his shrewd, bellicose opinions\u2014from codifying the right of any American to bear arms in District of Columbia v. Heller, to lamenting the Affordable Care Act as \u201cjiggery-pokery.\u201d Scalia\u2019s writings never failed to deliver a pugnacious uppercut. To borrow from a New Yorker profile by Margaret Talbot, his hotheaded opinions were \u201cthe jurisprudential equivalent of smashing a guitar on stage.\u201d\n\nIn his op-ed, Le F\u00e8vre posited that a \u201cdisservice to our learning\u201d would be failing to establish commonalities, but in disagreeing with his SCOTUS colleagues, Scalia actually drove his critics to be more incisive and transparent about their own principles. Did the justice\u2019s hostility make legal discourse less valuable or intellectually exacting? Not at all. Rather, his bombast was intended to scrutinize his peers\u2019 decisionmaking and to embolden them to return the favor. According to Ed Morrison, Columbia Law School professor and former Scalia clerk, \u201ccombat was an important way [for him] to identify what the important issues are in a case.\u201d\n\nWhen debating, we often seek security in the form of reassurances and concord. Scalia reminds us that dissonance can be just as fruitful. Le F\u00e8vre\u2019s criticism of \u201cunbalanced conversation\u201d shouldn\u2019t lead us to make generous allowances for the sake of \u201ccommon ground.\u201d That\u2019s a far more artificial and detrimental pursuit than putting on the boxing gloves.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting deliberate discourtesy; rather, I\u2019m encouraging Columbians to engage in prickly conversations over delicate ones. It\u2019s okay that there may not be mutual understanding. But when we respond to one another with criticism instead of cossetting words, we more thoroughly test our own beliefs. Why be conciliatory when you could be combative, even when speaking (ill) of the dead?\n\nJustice Scalia wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way.\n\nThe author is a Columbia College junior majoring in history and concentrating in statistics.
