Bobby Jindal (R-LA) is scheduled to speak in front of a group of pastors at a dinner in Greenville, S.C. He will likely have things to say that would provide great insight into his mindset as a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate. Unfortunately, no one will hear them, thanks to a bizarre precondition set by the dinner\u2019s organizers: Reporters can attend, but only if they agree to print approved quotes.\n\nNormally, to prevent reporters from going away from an event with the wrong quotes, the event would be deemed \u201coff the record\u201d or simply \u201cclosed to the press.\u201d But according to local paper The Greenville News, the dinner\u2019s organizers, the American Renewal Project, told them: \u201cNews reporters aren\u2019t allowed to attend unless they can agree with the candidate on which quotes to report\u201d.\n\nAccording to the group\u2019s president, the policy is intended to prevent the media from twisting their words:\n\nDavid Lane, president of the American Renewal Project, told The News he has little to gain from exposure in the news media. Some reporters, he said, \u201chave agendas\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t even care what the truth is.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that\u2019s the way it is, but that\u2019s the way it is,\u201d Lane said.\n\nIt is unclear as to whether the Jindal team had any input in creating the press policy.\n\nThe American Renewal Project is a right-wing Christian group dedicated to mobilizing pastors across America with the hopes of returning the country to its Judeo-Christian roots. Lane himself is a highly influential conservative activist, with his group and its state offshoots hosting forums and dinners for well-known GOP politicians. (Next week, Jindal and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) will headline a meeting of 200 pastors in Des Moines, Iowa.)\n\nUnsurprisingly, agreeing to publish candidate-approved quotes is \u201csomething The Greenville News won\u2019t do,\u201d the paper said.\n\nUPDATE (6:21 p.m.): A spokesman for Jindal clarified that the Governor \u201ccan be quoted\u201d when reporters are around.\n\n[Full disclosure: Tina Nguyen worked as an intern for the office of Gov.
