CNN reports Secret Service saying they already have someone in custody and are checking his bag. President Obama is not at the White House. It doesn’t sound like a big deal, but multiple outlets report a “lockdown” in the building.

Last year, Capitol Hill went on “lockdown” after Miriam Carey allegedly tried to drive through a security checkpoint at the White House. She was fatally shot after a chase by Secret Service, and her family is now suing.
