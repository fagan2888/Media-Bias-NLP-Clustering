The data were released Tuesday by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\n\nDetails of Survey\n\nThe survey -- which was conducted via phone interviews in 2013 and 2014 -- polled more than 48,000 Californians on various health-related issues, such as:\n\nBirth control use;\n\nChronic conditions;\n\nFast-food consumption; and\n\nDrug use.\n\nThe survey included all 58 counties in the state and was conducted in seven languages.\n\nThe survey found that the uninsured rate in 2014 dropped by more than three percentage points to 17.4%, in large part because of increased enrollment in Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, under the ACA.\n\nFindings on Obesity\n\nDespite the increase in health coverage, the survey found that about 27% of adults in 2014 were considered obese -- up from 19% in 2001.\n\nAccording to the survey, 31% of California adults with incomes below the federal poverty level in 2014 were obese, compared with less than a quarter of the richest 50% of Californians.\n\nSusan Babey, a senior research scientist at UCLA, said, \"It's not a trend that's going to change quickly, but it is disappointing to see the obesity number climb, particularly since nationally it has shown a leveling off.\" She added, \"[W]e haven't seen that leveling off in California, particularly among adults.\"\n\nBabey also noted that the incidence of obesity in California actually could be higher because the data in the survey were self-reported, and people tend to underestimate their weight.\n\nFindings on Diabetes\n\nMeanwhile, the survey found that the percentage of Californians with diabetes has increased in the last decade. Nine percent of Californians in 2014 were diagnosed with diabetes, compared with 6.6% in 2003.\n\nThe uptick in the diabetes rate could be due in part to a growing rate of Californians who reported eating fast food at least twice a week -- up from 35% in 2007 to 39% in 2014 (Buck/Reese, Sacramento Bee, 8/18).\n\nAdditional Findings\n\nThe survey also found that:\n\nNearly 12% of Californians ages 18 and older said they were current smokers, but 70% of those had considered quitting in the next six months;\n\nNearly 34% of women ages 18 to 44 who use birth control said they used forms of long-term contraception, such as intrauterine devices and implants; and\n\n56.6% of women ages 18 to 44 who use birth control said they used oral contraception (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research release, 8/18).\n\nMeanwhile, the survey found that children in the state were leading more sedentary lifestyles -- a trend that Babey said could harm the long-term health of Californians. She said, \"Evidence suggests that the habits we develop as children, particularly adolescents, influence our health behaviors as adults\" (Sacramento Bee, 8/18).", "article_metadata": {"description": "New data from the California Health Interview Survey show that while more California adults have health insurance, the rate of obesity increased from 19% in 2001 to 27% in 2014.
