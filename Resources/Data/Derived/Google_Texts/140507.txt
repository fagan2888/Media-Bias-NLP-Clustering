Get Ready to Laugh and Laugh at Obama's "Plans" For When He's Out of Office

What will happen once President Barack Obama leaves office? The Obamas will stay in Washington DC for two more years, that's for sure. But as for specifics, it seems no one knows — not even the president.

In a funny video called "Couch Commander" that aired during his White House Correspondents' Dinner speech over the weekend, Obama goes through all his different options.

"I can't golf every day, can I?" he asks Joe Biden as he lies on a couch. The vice president makes some suggestions, like that he volunteer for a sports team in the area. Obama calls up the Washington Wizards to ask if they need help — only to be hung up on. Then he goes to the DMV to get a driver's license and argues with the clerk over how real his birth certificate is.

After posting a video about Obamacare to Michelle Obama's Snapchat that goes viral for all the wrong reasons, he finally meets up with former Speaker of the House John Boehner to talk to someone who understands what he's going though.

The two watch Toy Story together in a movie theater and Boehner tells Obama to stop sending him LinkedIn requests before serving up some solid advice: "Here's the beauty of this whole thing. You got all the time in the world to figure this thing out. You can just be you for a while — if you know how to do that again." For Obama, that means wearing his "mom jeans" again without any judgment.

There's more talk about having beers at 11:30 and all-day breakfast at McDonald's, but the video ends with Obama playing his 347th round of golf and no one caring one single bit.
