Mikhail Grigorenko, the Sabres\u2019 2012 first-round draft choice, logged 19 minutes and had an assist in his first game back at Buffalo since the summer trade that brought him to Colorado.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to come back in this building and have a lot of good memories,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cI was really excited. I wish we won the game, but it was good.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt was a little bit more special than other games, but at the same time I\u2019ve got to go out there and try to help your team win. It didn\u2019t work out today, but yeah, obviously it was special.\u201d\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\nMatinee. After the rare afternoon game \u2014 actually, the official start time was 10:30 a.m. Mountain time \u2014 the Avalanche was expected to arrive back in Denver early in the evening.\n\nColorado has a Wednesday home game against Montreal, with the Avs hoping to overcome what this season has been the dreaded home-ice disadvantage before heading back out on the road to Edmonton and Vancouver.\n\nStandings. After the NHL\u2019s limited Sunday schedule, the Avalanche (29-26-4) still was in what would be the first of the two Western Conference playoff spots. Colorado was one point up on Nashville, in the other wild-card spot; and six ahead of Minnesota, Arizona and Vancouver.\n\nStatus quo.
