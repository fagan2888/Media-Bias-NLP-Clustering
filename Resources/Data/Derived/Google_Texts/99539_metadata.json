You can view the 90-minute webinar here in its entirety.\n\nThe seminar covered the reporting requirements for the ACA, including:\n\nIRS reporting for health care providers on IRS Form 1095-B\n\nIRS reporting for employers on IRS Form 1095-C\n\nTransmittal Forms 1094-B and 1094-C\n\nFiling deadlines for 2015:\n\nForms filed with IRS: 2/29/2016 (paper) or 3/31/2016 (electronic)\n\n\n\nStatements sent to employees: 2/1/2016 (1/31 is a Sunday)\n\nThe webinar focused on employer reporting, reporting penalties and ways to avoid or mitigate those penalties. However, it is critical that reporting entities, particularly employers, appreciate the potential underlying penalties that drive the need for reporting. In other words, unlike Form W-2 and payroll reporting, the content of ACA reporting may itself result in massive penalties.\n\nSome of the top risk areas for Section 4980H penalties include:\n\nNot counting hours properly\n\nFailing to track full-time employee status of variable employees\n\nApplying waiting periods incorrectly\n\nNot reviewing employee vs. independent contractor classifications\n\nIntentionally excluding too many employees in 2016\n\nNot making proper offers of coverage\n\nExcluding some locations (especially those out of state)\n\nExcluding dependents\n\nRegister for tomorrow\u2019s complimentary webinar on how to avoid common ACA reporting mistakes here.
