Just a quarter say Congress understands the health care system well and the consequences of the health care laws they pass.\n\nAbout half of respondents, 48 percent, say the typical lawmaker understands these issues \u201cnot well at all,\u201d and 25 percent say the typical member of Congress understands the issues \u201cnot too well.\u201d Twenty-one percent believe the average member of Congress understands the health care system and the impact of the health care laws they pass \u201csomewhat well\u201d and just 4 percent think the average legislator understands these issues \u201cvery well.\u201d\n\nOnly 32 percent of Democrats say that the typical member of Congress understands the health care system and an even lower number of Republicans \u2014 16 percent \u2014 agree. Instead, majorities of Republicans (55 percent) and independents (52 percent) go so far as to say Congress doesn\u2019t understand the health care system \u201cat all,\u201d as well as 40 percent of Democrats.\n\nCompared to other groups, young Americans have considerably higher confidence in Congress\u2019 knowledge and abilities, with 40 percent who say Congress understands the health care system well and 58 percent who say it doesn\u2019t. However, there is a divide between younger and older millennials. For instance, while 41 percent of 25-34 year olds says Congresspersons understands these issues \u201cnot well at all\u201d compared to 23 percent of college-aged millennials.\n\nAs Americans get older they become less likely to expect Congress to understand health care and the laws it passes. Roughly 58 percent of Americans over 45 have little confidence in Congress\u2019 knowledge, compared to 42 percent among those aged 25-44, and a quarter among those aged 18-24.\n\nWhite Americans over 35 are considerably more likely than young white Americans, or minorities to have little confidence in Congress. For instance, 59 percent of older Caucasians don\u2019t expect Congress people to understand the health care system \u201cat all\u201d compared to about a third of younger Caucasians and minorities.\n\nNationwide telephone poll conducted Dec 4-8 2013 interviewed 1011 adults on both mobile (506) and landline (505) phones, with a margin of error +/- 3.7%.
