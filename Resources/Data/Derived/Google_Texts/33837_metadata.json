He met with someone Elhassan \"believed maintained connections to individuals engaged in jihad overseas,\" the Justice Department said in a statement.\n\nIn January, Elhassan drove Farrokh to Richmond, Virginia, where Farrokh went to the airport and cleared security in a bid to board a Chicago-bound flight, prosecutors said. From there, authorities say, he planned to fly to Jordan and eventually travel to Syria to join ISIS.\n\nAuthorities arrested him at the airport. Elhassan was arrested after returning to Woodbridge, Virginia, where the two lived.\n\nThe FBI estimated in October that 250 U.S. residents have traveled or tried to travel to Syria to fight in the civil war raging there.\n\nCopyright 2016 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
