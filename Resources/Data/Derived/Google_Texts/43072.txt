The Obama administration announced Friday that small businesses can qualify for tax credits without going through the troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange.

The move is good news for small businesses in Oregon since the exchange's function for small businesses is on hold indefinitely. A similar change had already been made for the federal exchange used in most states, but now it applies to troubled state-based exchanges as well.

There's a catch: small businesses must sign up for coverage equivalent to policies that would be sold on the exchange, subject to Affordable Care Act requirements. Also, Oregon has to apply for permission.

Cover Oregon and U.S. Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden had been pushing for the change. Merkley on Friday released a statement, saying "small businesses and their employees should not lose access to quality health insurance because of a broken website."

Qualifying Oregon small businesses will be able to qualify for tax credits covering half their costs for coverage under the plan.
