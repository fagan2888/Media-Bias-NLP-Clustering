Dallas police were on hand to monitor the event, though kept a distance from the protesters.\n\nIn October, police made the request that people leave their guns at home when using the trail after two men wearing bulletproof vests and carrying fake rifles caused a scare.\n\nPizgatti pointed to five recent armed robberies on the Katy Trail and the murder of David Stevens, a 53-year-old runner, who was hacked to death on White Rock Creek Trail, as examples of people needing to defend themselves.\n\nOn Thursday police announced the arrest of two people in connection to the robberies. Daray Robinson, 21, and Jamaciay Smith, 17, have each been charged with one count of aggravated robbery. Police are investigating whether Robinson and Smith are behind all five armed robberies.\n\nPizgatti said the group did not want to intimidate other users of the trail but rather, \u201cencourage people to take it upon themselves to protect their loved ones and their lives.\u201d\n\nBut earlier this week Friends of the Katy Trail posted to their Facebook page asking people to avoid using the trail during the rally.\n\nMelissa Fisher, who frequently uses the trail, said she has felt unsafe on the trail at some point, largely in part to the low visibility in some areas, but that guns didn\u2019t make her feel any safer.\n\n\u201cHow do you walk up to a guy with an AK-47 and know if he is a good guy or a bad guy?\u201d she said.\n\nTexas law does not prohibit the carrying of long guns and starting in January, licensed Texans will be able to openly carry handguns in belt or shoulder holsters.\n\nMatthew Short, the group\u2019s public relations director, invoked Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris to make his point about gun rights.\n\n\u201cWe do not want victims of those gun free zones in Dallas,\u201d Short said. \u201cDallas is not going to be Paris. We are not going to have an environment where people can go and murder 150-plus people because the public is not armed. We want the criminals to know the public is armed and going to take care of themselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2RvemVucy1nYXRoZXItZm9yLW9wZW4tY2FycnktcmFsbHktb24ta2F0eS10cmFpbC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Julie Fancher", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Members of a Dallas-based open-carry group held a rally on the Katy Trail Saturday afternoon protesting requests from Dallas police to leave guns off the trail, saying it has led\u2026", "title": "Dozens gather for open-carry rally on the Katy Trail", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/11/dozens-gather-for-open-carry-rally-on-katy-trail.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-11-14T22:48:18Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}, "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Members of a Dallas-based open-carry group held a rally on the Katy Trail Saturday afternoon protesting requests from Dallas police to leave guns off the trail, saying it has led to an uptick in crime on the trails.\nPizgatti pointed to five recent armed robberies on the Katy Trail and the murder of David Stevens, a 53-year-old runner, who was hacked to death on White Rock Creek Trail, as examples of people needing to defend themselves.\nWe want the criminals to know the public is armed and going to take care of themselves.\u201d\nAbout 40 people gathered at Reverchon Park and walked part of trail during the peaceful protest.\nWe are not going to have an environment where people can go and murder 150-plus people because the public is not armed."}
