But on the eve of the state\u2019s primary Tuesday, Wehby\u2019s Republican and Democratic opponents are seizing on another way to define her \u2013 as an unstable stalker.\n\nOn Monday, The Oregonian published a 2007 police report about an altercation between Wehby and her soon-to-be-ex-husband Jim Grant, in which he accused her of \u201congoing harassment.\u201d The couple has accused each other of acting violently, with Grant admitting to it: \u201dJim said over the last year Monica has pulled his hair, slapped him and thrown items at him. Jim said he had been violent with her in the past approximately three years or so ago.\u201d\n\nThis follows revelations that in April 2013, Wehby\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Andrew Miller, called the police to complain that she was \u201cstalking\u201d him and had repeatedly entered his home uninvited. Politico reported on the incident Friday, on the morning of the primary debate. On the same day, The Oregonian published audio of the call.\n\nThough Miller said at the time he would seek a protective order against Wehby, he didn\u2019t, and now says he regrets the call. \u201cThere was a week there or so when we were breaking up that people can be emotional. And me included,\u201d Miller told Politico.\n\nWehby said in a statement, \u201cA year ago I went through the process of concluding a relationship. That relationship ended amicably, and while I\u2019m not pleased that it has been deemed newsworthy, I guess that is the cost of challenging the political status quo.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another bend in this convoluted tale: Earlier this month, the Democratic Party of Oregon filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging Wehby\u2019s campaign was improperly coordinating with a super PAC to which Miller is a major donor. The group has run ads attacking Wehby\u2019s primary opponent, Jason Conger. Miller has also donated to Wehby\u2019s Senate campaign.\n\nWehby\u2019s campaign has denied the allegations.\n\nAt the Republican debate Friday, Conger said the incident raised questions about Wehby\u2019s judgment. The right-leaning Daily Caller referred to Wehby\u2019s \u201cweird past\u201d and questioned whether the Republican establishment was properly vetting candidates.\n\nClose video Political weirdness finds a home in Oregon Jim Moore, professor of political science at Pacific University, talks with Rachel Maddow about the strange cast of characters that make up the Oregon Republican Party and its wildly wealthy benefactors, including several who aren\u2019t even in Oregon. embed like save share group\n\nBefore the report about Wehby\u2019s ex-husband, National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Brad Dayspring was treating the disclosure about Wehby\u2019s ex-boyfriend as an opportunity to deflect Democratic claims of a \u201cwar on women.\u201d Dayspring blamed Democrats, whom he claimed had \u201cwaged a war to personally destroy Republican Senate candidates, particularly strong Republican women.\u201d He added that Democrats had \u201cresorted to vicious personal attacks that would almost certainly classify as sexist by their own definition.\u201d He did not say whether he himself would classify it as sexist.\n\nAsked whether focusing on Wehby\u2019s brush with the police over her breakup was sexist, an Oregon Democratic stategist said, \u201cThat\u2019s laughable.\u201d\n\nThe late-in-the-race specter of Wehby as a Fatal Attraction-like spurned woman will likely be blunted by the fact that the state has mail-in voting that has been going on for weeks. (The last day to mail in primary ballots was May 6, though they can also be dropped off at a municipal clerk\u2019s office through Tuesday evening.)\n\nBut if Wehby wins the primary, the revelations could hurt her in the general election A poll recently released by a NewRepublican.org, a group advocating for Wehby, showed Wehby with a wide lead in the primary overall, including with the 37 percent of voters who had already mailed their ballots.\n\nThe primary winner will face first-term incumbent Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley. Republicans have been gleeful at the prospect of a competitive Senate contest in a largely Democratic state.\n\nWehby, the director of pediatric neurosurgery at a Portland children\u2019s hospital, was an early and prominent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, the rollout of which has been particularly rocky in Oregon. She has a catchy slogan, \u201cKeep your doctor. Change your senator,\u201d and a heartwarming ad, \u201cTrust,\u201d which gained national attention. It portrays Wehby as the compassionate savior of a tearful woman who was told to terminate a much-wanted pregnancy because of a fetal spine disorder. \u201cWe have a twelve year old today because of Dr. Wehby,\u201d Lexi Liebelt says.\n\nThe ad also neatly elides the fact that Wehby says (at times nebulously) that while she is personally opposed to abortion she does not want the federal government involved in a woman\u2019s decision \u2013 making her the subject of a barrage of attack ads from social conservatives in the primary.\n\nIf Wehby makes it to the general election, Democrats face a tricky path, portraying a relative moderate as an extreme who would help put the Senate in the hands of the GOP. They have pointed to her uncertain position on contraceptive coverage on employer insurance plans, currently before the Supreme Court. (In a radio interview, Wehby said the coverage was \u201cmore of a benefit package than actual insurance for real health problems.\u201d) She also has sent some very mixed signals on how she would vote on Supreme Court nominees. Here\u2019s how the Willamette Week described it:\n\n\u201cWe asked all five candidates in this race a fairly simple question: which U.S. Supreme Court justice most closely mirrors your values? After one candidate named Justice Anthony Kennedy, Wehby piggybacked on the answer. After Conger gave a ringing endorsement of arch-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Wehby awkwardly changed her answer to Scalia as well. (Outside the interview, she told us she really meant to say Chief Justice John Roberts, but that she actually likes Justice Samuel Alito best of all.)\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not too late to define Wehby, since it\u2019s not clear if she has defined herself.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A promising, female GOP Senate candidate in Oregon is being scrutinized over alleged altercations with her former husband and a boyfriend.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-hopeful-monica-wehby-accused-harrassment-stalking", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "A promising, female GOP Senate candidate in Oregon is being scrutinized over alleged altercations with her former husband and a boyfriend.", "title": "GOP Senate hopeful Monica Wehby accused of harrassment, stalking", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-hopeful-monica-wehby-accused-harrassment-stalking", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/senate_oregon.jpeg-0808d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-hopeful-monica-wehby-accused-harrassment-stalking", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/senate_oregon.jpeg-0808d.jpg?itok=6pPWaga_", "title": "GOP Senate hopeful Monica Wehby accused of harrassment, stalking", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A promising, female GOP Senate candidate in Oregon is being scrutinized over alleged altercations with her former husband and a boyfriend."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-05-19T20:00:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "irincarmon", "tags": "abortion,affordable-care-act,democrats,election-2014,elections,equality,health,health-care-reform,republicans,war-on-women,women,women-in-politics", "title": "GOP Senate hopeful Monica Wehby accused of harrassment, stalking", "published": 1, "date": "05/19/2014 20:00:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-hopeful-monica-wehby-accused-harrassment-stalking"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "A promising, female GOP Senate candidate in Oregon is being scrutinized over alleged altercations with her former husband and a boyfriend.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Elections, Election 2014, Equality, Women, Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Abortion, Affordable Care Act, War On Women, Women in Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc397\"", "article_summary": "Until recently, Oregon Republican Senate hopeful Monica Wehby was known mostly as a rare chance for the GOP hopeful to be competitive in a blue state, and a candidate with a campaign ad quickly dubbed one of the best of the year.\nThe group has run ads attacking Wehby\u2019s primary opponent, Jason Conger.\nMiller has also donated to Wehby\u2019s Senate campaign.\nBut on the eve of the state\u2019s primary Tuesday, Wehby\u2019s Republican and Democratic opponents are seizing on another way to define her \u2013 as an unstable stalker.\nAfter Conger gave a ringing endorsement of arch-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Wehby awkwardly changed her answer to Scalia as well."}
