Gen X, the leading edge of which will turn 50 next year, with the youngest hitting 35, are facing the reality of their looming retirement prospects. And so far, there is much room for improvement.\n\nGen X was roiled by the Great Recession, losing nearly half (45 percent) of their wealth. Now, a new study by Northwestern Mutual reveals that Gen X is compounding that major setback with the poorest financial habits of the four generations surveyed. Most respondents characterized themselves as spenders rather than savers, making them the generation most likely to have more debt than savings.\n\nAlmost four in 10 (37 percent) admit they do not \"at all feel financially secure,\" an outlook more pessimistic than any other generation, even the often money-challenged Millennials.\n\nRelated: The Worst States For Retirement in 2015\n\nAnd nearly one-quarter of Gen X is \u201cnot at all confident\u201d that they will achieve their financial goals, with their top financial fear including a lack of retirement savings. Remember, this is the generation that may face the ramifications of a shaky Social Security system, the trust funds of which are forecast to be depleted by 2033, according to a recent study by researchers at Harvard and Dartmouth.\n\n\"It is not easy being X,\" said Rebekah Barsch, vice president of financial planning with Northwestern Mutual, in a statement. \"Aside from weathering a number of economic cycles, this group is juggling home mortgages, educational debt, and lifestyle needs.\u201d\n\nThe result: Gen X-ers\u2019 median savings for retirement has fallen 15 percent in the last two years, from $70,400 in 2012 to $59,800 today. Of those who have managed to set aside money for retirement, 42% have less than $50,000 saved.\n\nRelated: More Americans Smell Fear\u2014not Roses\u2014When They Retire\n\nBut facing a potential retirement shortfall, Gen X-ers have something their Boomer parents don\u2019t have much of: time to recover. As they cross the 50-year-old yard line, \u201ccatch up\u201d retirement plan contributions kick in, allowing an additional $1,000 to be put into IRAs -- and an extra $6,000 in 401(k)s.\n\nGen X-ers also have time to pay off their mortgage before retirement, in order to reduce monthly budget demands for life after work.\n\nAnd as their children grow older, expenses may decline, allowing even more financial resources to be allocated to retirement savings \u2013 before their prime earnings years pass.\n\nFacing 40 -- or pushing 50 -- may give the grunge generation something they need most: a wake-up call.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Main Street.\n\nRead more from Main Street:\n\nPlaces to Never Use a Debit or Credit Card to Make a Payment\n\nThe 25 Toughest U.S. Colleges to Get Into\n\n10 Outrageous Ways Wealthy New Yorkers Flaunt Their Money", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "They were \u201clatch-key kids,\u201d then", "title": "Gen X-ers Are Behind in Retirement Savings", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/09/Gen-X-ers-Are-Behind-Retirement-Savings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09302012_retirement_piggies_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/09/Gen-X-ers-Are-Behind-Retirement-Savings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09302012_retirement_piggies_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "They were \u201clatch-key kids,\u201d then", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8fd8\"", "article_summary": "Related: More Americans Smell Fear\u2014not Roses\u2014When They RetireBut facing a potential retirement shortfall, Gen X-ers have something their Boomer parents don\u2019t have much of: time to recover.\nRelated: The Worst States For Retirement in 2015And nearly one-quarter of Gen X is \u201cnot at all confident\u201d that they will achieve their financial goals, with their top financial fear including a lack of retirement savings.\nGen X, the leading edge of which will turn 50 next year, with the youngest hitting 35, are facing the reality of their looming retirement prospects.\nAnd as their children grow older, expenses may decline, allowing even more financial resources to be allocated to retirement savings \u2013 before their prime earnings years pass.\n\"Aside from weathering a number of economic cycles, this group is juggling home mortgages, educational debt, and lifestyle needs.\u201dThe result: Gen X-ers\u2019 median savings for retirement has fallen 15 percent in the last two years, from $70,400 in 2012 to $59,800 today."}
