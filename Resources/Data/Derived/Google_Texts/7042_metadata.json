This market insight analyzes the instrumentation and reagent segment activity within the US hemostasis market. Key trends and a comparative analysis between the installed base trends of 2012 and 2013 are provided for hospitals, blood banks, independent/reference labs, clinics/physician office laboratories (POLs), and public health institutes. A SWOT analyses and market share for the main leading vendors (e.g., Siemens/Sysmex, Diagnostica Stago, and Instrumentation Laboratories) have been studied. The base year is 2013 and forecasts span 2014 to 2016.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) has boosted the number of patients using the healthcare system, which, in turn, has increased demand within the reagent market.\n\nLaboratory and hospital consolidation has caused the number of instruments per site to increase thus slowing down the sale of analyzers.\n\nPhysician office erosion has resulted in a decreased customer base for the sale of low throughput analyzers.\n\nMarket Segmentation:\n\nThe market can be segmented by analyzers and reagents. This does not include point of care testing (POCT).\n\nThis research service covers only fully-automated analyzers.\n\nKey vendors are Sysmex/Siemens, Diagnostica Stago, and Instrumentation Laboratory.\n\nIncludes analysis of only Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified labs.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1. Executive Summary\n\n2. Market Trends Competitive Landscape (SWOT Analysis)\n\n3. Forecast and Trends - Total Hemostasis Market\n\n4. Market Share Analysis\n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d9rqzc/us_hemostasis", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d9rqzc/us_hemostasis) has announced the addition of the &quot;US Hemostasis Market&qu", "og": {"image": {"width": 465, "identifier": "http://www.businesswire.com/images/bwlogo_square.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 225}}, "twitter": {"description": "Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d9rqzc/us_hemostasis) has announced the addition of the &quot;US Hemostasis Market&qu", "title": "Research and Markets: US Hemostasis Market 2014-2016: Key vendors are Sysmex/Siemens, Diagnostica Stago, and Instrumentation Laboratory", "image": {"src": "http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20141212005126/en/371054/21/ResearchAndMarkets_800px.jpg"}, "site": "@businesswire", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-12", "p": {"domain_verify": "95725e0359a14c2e1ccbd936e10d20d6"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d9rqzc/us_hemostasis) has announced the addition of the \"US Hemostasis Market\" report to their offering.\nThis market insight analyzes the instrumentation and reagent segment activity within the US hemostasis market.\nA SWOT analyses and market share for the main leading vendors (e.g., Siemens/Sysmex, Diagnostica Stago, and Instrumentation Laboratories) have been studied.\nMarket Trends Competitive Landscape (SWOT Analysis)3.\nKey vendors are Sysmex/Siemens, Diagnostica Stago, and Instrumentation Laboratory."}
