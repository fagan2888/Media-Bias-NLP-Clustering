Free clinics will offer blood pressure screenings, HIV testing, flu shots and even a Zumbathon.\n\n\u201cThis month saves lives. You\u2019re going to take someone\u2019s blood pressure, you\u2019re going to find out that someone\u2019s diabetic, and you\u2019re going to be the difference between them having a life or a higher quality of life,\u201d Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez said at an Oct. 3 ceremony kicking off the county\u2019s binational health week.\n\n\u2026 Powered by Cincopa Video Hosting for Business solution. no name 2014 Open Air Health Fair The Oct. 18 opening day of the 2014 Open Air Health Fair in San Jose, a two day event in alignment with Binational Health Week, provides access to free health screening services, health education, and referrals to community organizations to the public.

This year, while coverage is still a priority, Ren\u00e9 Santiago, director of Santa Clara Valley Health & Hospital System, said the focus has shifted.\u201cWe want to make sure that not only do they have insurance, not only do they have coverage, but also translating that into better care, and ultimately, obviously, better health,\u201d Santiago said in an interview.In a speech at the Oct. 3 event, Santiago emphasized the health disparities Latino-Americans face, including higher rates of many chronic diseases, like obesity and diabetes. Occupational hazards also represent a unique health risk \u2014 nationwide Latinos are more likely to work in high-risk occupations and have higher rates of fatal work injuries than other populations, according to a 2013 CDC report by Baron et. al.\u201cThese collective efforts are aimed at improving the quality of life for Latinos and all residents living in Santa Clara County,\u201d said health officer Dr. Sara H. Cody in a letter to attendees of the event.Over the past 10 years, Binational Health Week has impacted over 98,000 residents through more than 170 community events and 16,000 screenings, said Rocio Luna, a director at the Department of Public Health, in her speech. What began as a one-week event is now three weeks long. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably do it the whole month next year,\u201d Luna said in an interview.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "With Nov. 15 kick-off for open enrollment via HealthCare.gov fast approaching, Santa Clara County officials are encouraging Latino-American residents to sign up for insurance and to get the health care they need.", "title": "Santa Clara County officials encourage Latinos to get health care - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Binational_Health_Week.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-30T18:30:57+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/10/20/santa-clara-county-latinos-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Health", "tag": "Santa Clara County", "published_time": "2014-10-20T06:43:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-30T18:30:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "With Nov. 15 kick-off for open enrollment via HealthCare.gov fast approaching, Santa Clara County officials are encouraging Latino-American residents to sign up for insurance and to get the health care they need.", "title": "Santa Clara County officials encourage Latinos to get health care - Peninsula Press", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Binational_Health_Week.jpg", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4"}, "article_summary": "no name 2014 Open Air Health Fair The Oct. 18 opening day of the 2014 Open Air Health Fair in San Jose, a two day event in alignment with Binational Health Week, provides access to free health screening services, health education, and referrals to community organizations to the public.\nFree clinics will offer blood pressure screenings, HIV testing, flu shots and even a Zumbathon.\nBerkeley and San Francisco currently have ballot measures up to tax sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably do it the whole month next year,\u201d Luna said in an interview.\nWhat began as a one-week event is now three weeks long."}
