He took a break from acting in the early 1990s, finishing a three-year pro boxing career with six wins and two draws.\n\nHe hinted that the return to the ring has helped him cope with unspecified personal issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some things going on in my life so that (boxing has) sort of saved me from myself,\u201d Rourke told Russian TV. \u201cAnd for a man like me, it\u2019s better to live in fear than go on in shame.\u201d\n\nHe has said he plans to hold another four fights in Russia.\n\nRourke prepared in a dressing room in front of a shrine featuring candles, images of saints, and photographs of his dogs. Rourke said he had been in mourning for his recently-deceased Chihuahua.\n\nHe took to the ring in a Stetson hat, a red-and-gold robe and shiny gold gloves, repeatedly crossing himself.\n\nRourke, who had said he lost 35 pounds (16 kilograms) to prepare to the fight, was much thinner than in his best-known cinematic fighting persona, when he bulked up to play the title character in 2008\u2019s \u201cThe Wrestler.\u201d His shorts bore his ring nickname from the 1990s, Marielito, with a Spanish-language message reading \u201calways handsome.\u201d\n\nThe fight was held at a pedestrian pace, with both Rourke and Seymour frequently backing away from one another and letting down their guard.\n\nSeveral of Rourke\u2019s punches appeared illegal. His final punch struck the stumbling Seymour on the buttocks and the 29-year-old went down to all fours until the referee stopped the contest. The Russian crowd chanted \u201cMisha,\u201d a short form of the Russian name Mikhail, in Rourke\u2019s honor.\n\nSeymour, a former California Golden Gloves champion with a 1-9 pro record, did not land any significant blows on Rourke, whose previous boxing career left him with injuries that he has previously said necessitated extensive plastic surgery to his face.\n\nFollowing the fight, the crowd was treated to a concert by Grigory Leps, a Russian rock singer who has been barred from entering the United States due to alleged mafia connections.\n\nOn the undercard, Olympic light-heavyweight champion Egor Mekhontsev continued his unbeaten start to his professional career, moving to a 7-0 record with a win over Ugandan fighter Joey Vegas.\n\nRussia\u2019s Eduard Troyanovsky knocked out Jose Agustin Feria of Colombia in the first round for the WBA intercontinental lightweight title, moving to a 20-0 record.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mickey Rourke wins boxing exhibition bout in Moscow", "title": "Mickey Rourke wins boxing exhibition bout in Moscow", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/28/mickey-rourke-wins-boxing-exhibition-bout-in-moscow/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128_055136_mickey-rourke.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128_055136_mickey-rourke.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-28T17:47:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T17:19:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf862\"", "article_summary": "MOSCOW \u2014 Hollywood actor Mickey Rourke returned to the boxing ring Friday at the age of 62, defeating a fighter less than half his age in an exhibition bout.\nHe took a break from acting in the early 1990s, finishing a three-year pro boxing career with six wins and two draws.\nThe bout at a Moscow concert hall was Rourke\u2019s first fight in 20 years.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some things going on in my life so that (boxing has) sort of saved me from myself,\u201d Rourke told Russian TV.\nRourke sent 29-year-old Pasadena native Elliot Seymour to the canvas twice in the second round before the referee stopped the fight."}
