REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n4941470\n\nPresident Barack Obama discussed the legacy of his foreign policy, the Obama doctrine, in an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg for The Atlantic.\n\nObama openly shares his thoughts on the foreign policy issues that have been plaguing his two terms in office. The interview is supplemented by a series of reflection articles from experts, who agree his agenda will go down as a clear shift in American foreign policy.\n\nThe interview goes into detail about Obama\u2019s relationships with some of America\u2019s closest allies. At one point he got in an altercation with British Prime Minister David Cameron over the UK\u2019s declining defense spending. Obama told Goldberg that \u201cfree riders aggravate me\u201d and that Cameron had to pay \u201chis fair share.\u201d Obama explained that he regarded this as part of his job, to encourage other nations to take actions for themselves by \u201cleading from behind.\u201d\n\nAnother harsh exchange Obama recalls was with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who, according to Obama, questioned his understanding of the situation in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the African American son of a single mother, and I live here, in this house,\u201d Obama told Netanyahu. \u201cI live in the White House. I managed to get elected president of the United States. You think I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about, but I do.\u201d\n\nNiall Ferguson, Laurence A. Tisch professor of history at Harvard University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote that Obama\u2019s interactions with his cabinet and world leaders confirm his idea of the president regarding himself \u201cas the smartest person in the room \u2014 any room.\u201d\n\nUsing an example of Secretary of State John Kerry handing over a classified document with Obama responding: \u201cOh, another proposal?\u201d Ferguson concludes that power seem to have \u201cmade Obama arrogant.\u201d\n\nAnother example is Obama\u2019s approach to the rise of Islamic State, which he feared, yet didn\u2019t consider a threat to the U.S.\n\nObama faced a great deal of criticism for not taking more steps toward fighting the organization more aggressively, particularly during the fall of 2015 during the ongoing migrant crisis in Europe and with the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\nGoldberg says Obama at one point used Batman character \u201cThe Joker\u201d as a metaphor to describe ISIS.\n\n\u201cThese are men who had the city divided up. They were thugs, but there was a kind of order,\u201d Obama said describing a scene from The Dark Knight. \u201cEveryone had his turf. And then the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire. ISIL is the Joker. It has the capacity to set the whole region on fire. That\u2019s why we have to fight it.\u201d\n\nBut as Ferguson points out, \u201cwhen the Joker started decapitating American citizens, the president abandoned his policy of non-intervention in Syria.\u201d\n\nObama further used global warming to justify why ISIS wasn\u2019t a priority.\n\n\u201cISIS is not an existential threat to the United States,\u201d he told Goldberg in one of their conversations. \u201cClimate change is a potential existential threat to the entire world if we don\u2019t do something about it.\u201d\n\nThe defining moment for the Obama doctrine came August 2013, when he decided to go against his foreign policy advisors and not strike the Assad regime in Syria when it crossed his chemical weapons red line. Obama says it was a way of going against the \u201cWashington Playbook.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the source of the controversy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s a playbook in Washington that presidents are supposed to follow. It\u2019s a playbook that comes out of the foreign-policy establishment.\u201d\n\nDo You Think President Obama Is Arrogant?
