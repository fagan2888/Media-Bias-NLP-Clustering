As a hospital trustee, I can affirm that hospitals continually struggle to provide the best possible care at the lowest cost. This is a constant and endless quest. But we must do more. We must advocate for the generous federal matching funds linked to expansion that will bring more than a billion dollars into our state. And we must champion efforts to level the playing field with other states that have embraced expansion and accepted this federal support.
