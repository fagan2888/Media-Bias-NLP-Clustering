Riders in the USA Pro Challenge\u2019s 123-strong peloton elbowed for position.\n\n\u201cIt was that kind of electric moment we all live for,\u201d said Phinney, whose dramatic sprint in the last kilometer of Stage 1 earned him his first win since a May 2014 crash shattered his left leg and severed his patellar tendon. \u201cI\u2019ve had 15 months to think about putting my hands up in the air again, and it was everything I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nAlmost 27 years ago to the day, a then 29-year-old Davis Phinney won the 15th stage of the final Coors Classic in his hometown of Boulder, a career apex for Colorado\u2019s cycling giant. Davis and his wife, Connie, herself a world champion cyclist, were watching their son on the big screen on the lawn of Steamboat\u2019s downtown courthouse on Monday when the peloton rounded the final turn.\n\nPHOTOS: USA Pro Challenge 2015 across Colorado\n\n\u201cDavis and I were really just floored, but we\u2019ve always been floored by what our kids can do,\u201d said Connie, who last May simply hoped her son would regain use of his mangled leg. \u201cHe\u2019s a changed person from before the accident and, man, he\u2019s still a good bike racer too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sky is the limit for Taylor,\u201d said Davis, who is battling Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nOn the final of two 49-mile laps, things didn\u2019t look good for Phinney as the peloton suddenly surged on the final of three steep climbs. He felt himself falling back. Teammate Rohan Dennis of Australia gave him a look and dropped the hammer, leading a two-man breakaway that would last until the final kilometer.\n\nDennis seemed poised to win the stage for most of the downhill push from Oak Creek into Steamboat. With only 5 kilometers to go, the 25-year-old Dennis and Canadian national champion Guillaume Boivin of Optum shared drafting duty in a two-man breakaway that stretched 25 seconds ahead of the peloton.\n\nWATCH: Taylor Phinney wins Stage 1 of the USA Pro Challenge\n\nDennis\u2019 sprinting breakaway wasn\u2019t part of the BMC plan.\n\n\u201cI was talking with Taylor on the way up the last climb and was like, \u2018What is happening?\u2019 \u201d said BMC\u2019s Brent Bookwalter, who rode Phinney\u2019s tail to a third-place finish. \u201cWe had some tentative plans going into today. But when we have a strong Rohan Dennis, the script of the plan goes out the window.\u201d\n\nIn a Boulder-forged finish, Boulder\u2019s Kiel Reijnen of UnitedHealthcare squeezed into second place in the theatrical finish that saw the top three finish within one second of one another.\n\nPhinney said he thought Dennis was going to win the stage. He wasn\u2019t planning a late sprint. But coming downhill with a tailwind into the final kilometer down Lincoln Avenue, Phinney felt good. He made what he called a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d decision. The peloton flew past Dennis. Phinney found a line on the far right side and stood up on his pedals.\n\n\u201cI knew we could come in with a lot of speed and somebody, if they wanted to, could jump early and get a pretty good gap and potentially hold that,\u201d Phinney said. \u201cIt was a Davis Phinney special. Get dropped and come back and win.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins\n\nTuesday\u2019s stage 2\n\nDistance: 115.3 miles\n\nStart time: 10:55 a.m.\n\nProjected finish time: 3:35 p.m.\n\nStart: Steamboat Springs\n\nBrief description of course: 1.3-mile neutral start in Steamboat Springs before traveling out of town over Rabbit Ears Pass (9,391 feet) through Kremmling and Parshall and over Ute Pass (9,570 feet) into Silverthorne before heading through Dillon and Keystone and ending with a mountaintop finish at Arapahoe Basin (10,789 feet).
