Cindy Stevenson, the recently retired superintendent of Jefferson County Public Schools, says she knew the time had come to leave the district when the new conservative majority on the school board was declining to take staff recommendations on a variety of issues.

Stevenson spoke about her experiences with the new Jeffco board on The Roundup, a public affairs discussion conducted by the Denver Post editorial board.

Stevenson said she originally decided to stay through the end of the school year in order to ensure an orderly transition to a new superintendent. However, that became untenable and she left the district in February.

Stevenson also discussed how the district has evolved during her more than 12 years at the helm, and the challenges that remain for the new board.
