(For details of the PSDA, see our article, Pittsburgh Paid Sick Days Act Effective 2016, Notices Available.)\n\nThe PSDA requires all employers of employees within the Pittsburgh city limits to provide paid sick leave to all full- and part-time employees.\n\nIn September, the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association joined several local restaurants in challenging the PSDA, arguing that the City exceeded its municipal authority in enacting the PSDA. The court entered an order in which the City of Pittsburgh and the Association agreed to a 60-day stay of the implementation, application, and enforcement of the PSDA as the court addresses the merits of the Association\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nTherefore, currently, the PSDA is set to take effective on March 10, 2016.
