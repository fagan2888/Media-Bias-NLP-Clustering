Several people, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and the billionaire mogul himself, are comparing The Donald to the 40th president, but according to his son President Reagan \u201cwould be appalled\u201d at the frontrunner\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201cMy father would be appalled,\u201d Michael Reagan said during an appearance on Newsmax Prime. \u201cOn behalf of my father and the Reagan family to see someone like this who just personally attacks people time and time and time again is absolutely appalling to me and I hope all the voters start to see through Donald Trump and the kind of candidate that he his and the kind of president he may end up being.\u201d\n\nReagan said his father really did believe in what the former president coined the \u201c11th Commandment,\u201d which is \u201cThou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.\u201d However, Trump, and many of his supporters, would argue that he is simply a counter-puncher, and has not started any of the recent dust ups with his fellow-candidates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like and I don\u2019t appreciate the things he says about Jeb Bush, or what he says about Gov. Perry or anybody else,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cI want to hear what he\u2019s going to do and when he tells us what he\u2019s going to do, I can be for or against it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, according to the PPD average of national Republican nomination polls, Trump has a double-digit lead over his rivals including Bush and Perry, who recently suspended his campaign.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michael Reagan, Ronald Reagan, President Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, Trump vs Reagan, Video", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Michael Reagan, the son of the Republican standard-bearer President Ronald Reagan, said the comparison of his father with Donald Trump is not accurate.", "title": "Michael Reagan on Donald Trump: \u201cMy Father Would Be Appalled\u201d", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Donald-Trump-Loyalty-Pledge.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2016-04-14T13:51:06-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/video/2015/09/14/michael-reagan-on-donald-trump-my-father-would-be-appalled/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michael Reagan, the son of the Republican standard-bearer President Ronald Reagan, said the comparison of his father with Donald Trump is not accurate.", "creator": "@PPDNews", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Donald-Trump-Loyalty-Pledge.jpg", "title": "Michael Reagan on Donald Trump: \"My Father Would Be Appalled\" | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/video/2015/09/14/michael-reagan-on-donald-trump-my-father-would-be-appalled/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/30155", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/30155", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "keywords": "Michael Reagan, Ronald Reagan, President Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, Trump vs Reagan, Video", "article": {"section": "Video", "tag": "Ronald Reagan", "published_time": "2015-09-14T09:35:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T13:51:06-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "Michael Reagan, the son of the Republican standard-bearer President Ronald Reagan, said the comparison of his father with Donald Trump is not accurate."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01f0\"", "article_summary": "Michael Reagan, the son of the Republican standard-bearer President Ronald Reagan, said the comparison of his father with Donald Trump is not accurate.\n\u201cMy father would be appalled,\u201d Michael Reagan said during an appearance on Newsmax Prime.\nSeveral people, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and the billionaire mogul himself, are comparing The Donald to the 40th president, but according to his son President Reagan \u201cwould be appalled\u201d at the frontrunner\u2019s rhetoric.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like and I don\u2019t appreciate the things he says about Jeb Bush, or what he says about Gov.\nPerry or anybody else,\u201d Reagan said."}
