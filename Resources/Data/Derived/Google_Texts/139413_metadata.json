Their hire, Mike Mears, comes with a long track record in the conservative movement after the RNC realized it needed to \u201ctake care of their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is they were going out to all these new communities, but they also basically needed to take care of their own\u2014their folks, partners, what have you,\u201d Mears told TheBlaze in an interview. \u201cHow I view a partner is anybody during an election year who does something for Republicans. Maybe not every single Republican that\u2019s running, but at the end of the day, they help elect Republicans\u2014that\u2019s a partner.\u201d\n\nMears joined the RNC from the socially conservative Family Research Council and before that worked for Concerned Women for America and the Susan B. Anthony List, both groups that oppose abortion.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk into a room I pretty much have credibility (with conservative groups),\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t take my resume away from me, that\u2019s for sure. There\u2019s no \u2018establishment\u2019 tag that you can put on me.\u201d\n\nMears, who started in July, said his role primarily is to \u201ckeep an open line of communication\u201d between the groups and the RNC.\n\n\u201cI joke that I\u2019m part ambassador and part newspaper ombudsman,\u201d he said. \u201cI represent the RNC to these folks, but at the same time I represent these groups to the RNC.\u201d\n\nHe said a common refrain from his former colleagues in the conservative movement has been, \u201cI\u2019ve never known anybody at the RNC.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow they do, so there\u2019s no excuse for them not to at least pick up the phone and say hey, what are you guys thinking over there, or, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he said.\n\nMears has already had a brief introduction to a wider audience: he played \u201cObamacare\u201d in the RNC\u2019s recent series of ads highlighting the problems with healthcare.gov that was modeled after Apple\u2019s \u201cGet a Mac\u201d campaign.\n\nMears said a large part of his job is \u201cjust showing up and listening and hearing what people are saying.\u201d\n\n\u201c(People) say hey, I\u2019d really like to get a message to the chairman. And I say fantastic, give me the message, I\u2019m more than happy to give it to him. I have his ear, I\u2019m able to talk to him about things and that\u2019s worked really well. If you wait for the chairman\u2019s schedule to open up, it could be a while, because he\u2019s very busy trying to build up this party,\u201d Mears said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of in there to bridge that gap.\u201d\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, where Mears previously worked, said the RNC hasn\u2019t had anyone \u201con the inside\u201d drawing in or working closely with social conservatives before.\n\n\u201cSocial conservatives know Mike, they trust Mike, he\u2019s been around,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cI think this is a very positive move from the chairman listening and understanding that in the last election they stepped over their base trying to reach independent voters and a lot of their core voters stayed home. I think this is a step in the right direction of correcting that.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Republicans) stepped over their base trying to reach independent voters\u2026\u201d Share:\n\nBut Amy Kremer, the head of the Tea Party Express, one of the largest such groups in the country, said Mears hasn\u2019t reached out to her and hasn\u2019t heard anyone specifically mention him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that they have hired him or hired somebody to reach out to conservative groups and Tea Party groups,\u201d Kremer said. She said she met with RNC officials shortly after the election and advised them of the disconnect between party leadership and local people on the ground. But, she said, \u201cat the end of the day, the Tea Party movement \u2026 is not an arm of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nWhile hiring Mears could be a start in mending the fences, Kremer said the focus needs to be at the local level, not in Washington.\n\n\u201cD.C. is not the answer, D.C. is so not the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look at \u2026 (conservative organizations like) FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, they do have people in D.C. but they also have state directors, state coordinators \u2026 people that are actually there on the ground in the states, networking all the time and building that network, because when it comes to election time or when you need to mobilize on an issue, you need to have a network in place.\u201d\n\nMorton Blackwell, a longtime RNC official and former member of the Reagan administration, said Mears will have his work cut out for him.\n\n\u201cThis is not a particularly easy job because obviously there is disagreement within the national party,\u201d Blackwell told TheBlaze. \u201cI think it is likely there will be more serious conservative primary challengers to Republican incumbents next year than we\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d\n\nOne thing Mears said he won\u2019t do is preach to or criticize conservative groups for the candidates they put up, after instances where Tea Party-backed candidates have surged ahead of \u201cestablishment\u201d-preferred picks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of going to be criticizing these groups,\u201d Mears said. \u201cWhen their candidate gets through a primary I\u2019m going to challenge them to do everything that they possibly can to get them elected and that means training them and that means coming alongside them, sure, but criticizing, no. No, no, no, no. That\u2019s been the problem. Everybody wants to shoot each other and I just want to stop that the best I can.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: 4:00 p.m. ET \u2013 Taylor Budowich, executive director of the Tea Party Express, emailed this statement:\n\nAmy Kremer\u2019s comments misstated Tea Party Express\u2019 relationship with Mike Mears and the RNC. Tea Party Express\u2019 Co-Founder and Chief Strategist Sal Russo and myself have had very productive dialogue with Mike over the past few months. He is a great asset to the RNC and someone who holds a lot of credibility with us, as well as movement conservatives across the country. After working with him closely, it is evident he shares our same goal for 2014, and that\u2019s taking back control of the Senate and expanding our majority in the House. We couldn\u2019t be more happy with the RNC for making this hire.\n\nFollow Madeleine Morgenstern (@MadeleineBlaze) on Twitter\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Republican National Committee bemoaned its lack of outreach to minorities during the presidential campaign, but after some very public soul-searching, it's not just Hispanic, black or Asian communities the RNC is making a concerted effort to court -- it's their own base.
