From \u201cdeath panels\u201d to the Supreme Court to the birth control mandate to the government shutdown to the website\u2019s disastrous launch, it\u2019s been a mainstay of the national debate for years. But with less than a week until the deadline to sign up for 2014 coverage, some people are still undecided about whether or not to sign up. Or at least, they\u2019re actively avoiding thinking about it. America Tonight gathered together four \"young invincibles\" Monday -- the exact kind of people the Obama administration is desperately trying to recruit as it tries to meet its goal of 6 million enrollees. And two of them were still conflicted. \u201cIt concerns me a bit,\u201d Kevin Brunell admitted, about not having health insurance. \u201cThere\u2019s always the proverbial bus that you could get hit by. But I do my best not to get hit by buses.\u201d Brunell is a real estate agent in Washington D.C., functionally self-employed and has been without health insurance for four years. The 30-year-old said he does his best to be healthy. He eats a plant-based diet, goes to yoga a few times a week and has declined invitations to go snowboarding.\n\nIt\u2019s not high on my list of one way to spend an afternoon. Kevin Brunell\n\nHe knows that he probably should sign up for health insurance under Obamacare (his financial adviser recommended it). \u201cEventually I\u2019ll sign up, I\u2019m sure. It just hasn\u2019t necessarily been a priority,\u201d he explained, adding that he hasn\u2019t really done any research about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much insurance costs. I haven\u2019t looked into it.\u201d Brunell went on the federal Obamacare website on two occasions. The second time, he said he couldn\u2019t log in. (If Brunell can prove this, he could get an extension beyond the Monday deadline). The first time he said he saw a plan costing $200 a month, and thought \u201cthat\u2019s too much money.\u201d He explained that he was told that he should set aside half a day to look at all the options properly, and \u201cit\u2019s not high on my list of one way to spend an afternoon.\u201d That\u2019s half a day he could spend selling houses or hanging out in the park. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a roll of the dice, I suppose,\u201d he added. Fanna Gebreyesus, a graduate student in art history at American University in Washington D.C., chimed in. \u201cWhat if something does happen? What if I do get hit by a bus? What if something I couldn\u2019t prevent happens?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to destroy my life, you know what I mean? It\u2019s not going to be half a day, it\u2019ll be maybe half a year, who knows.\u201d\n\nJust the jargon of it all, the prices. It\u2019s not something I really want to think about.
