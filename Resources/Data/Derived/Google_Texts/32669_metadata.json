Here\u2019s what\u2019s on tonight\u2019s agenda:\n\nHouse Bill 539 would shift funds from traditional public school to charter schools. Sen. Chad Barefoot is advocating that the money should follow the child, giving charter schools a fairer share of state funds.\n\nIf approved, this will allow charter schools to receive funding for services and costs borne exclusively by local public schools. Critics say these changes will deprive local public school of funding at a time when they can least afford it.\n\nHouse Bill 318, Protect North Carolina Workers Act, would permanently bar North Carolina\u2019s ability to suspend SNAP\u2019s three month time limit for childless adults who are working fewer than 20 hours per week.\n\nSNAP benefits are limited to three months out of every three years for childless, nondisabled adults unless they are working at least half time, participating in a qualified job training program or certified volunteer placement for 20 hours a week, or in workfare. This time limit applies regardless of whether these individuals are actually able to find employment or training opportunities.\n\nTazra Mitchell of the NC Budget & Tax Center explains how this could adversely impact more than 100,000 North Carolinians.\n\nPolicy Watch\u2019s Rob Schofield weighs in on HB 318 here.\n\nFinally House Bill 765, known as the Regulatory Reform Act of 2015, is also up for concurrence.\n\nEnvironmentalists say HB 765 has many flaws including a provision exempting businesses that voluntarily report environmental violations from civil penalties.\n\nThe good folks at Clean Water for North Carolina note this bill would also:\n\n* Significantly reduce the number of state air quality monitors\n\n* Relax the requirements for controlling stormwater pollution and resort development on the coast\n\n* Reduce public access to information about air pollution in their neighborhood\n\n* Allow the destruction of intermittent streams\n\nThe full fact sheet on HB 765 complied by CWNC can be found here.\n\nThe Senate goes into session at 10:30 a.m. this morning, then reconvenes at 7:00 p.m. for the final votes of the day.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbdf\"", "article_summary": "If approved, this will allow charter schools to receive funding for services and costs borne exclusively by local public schools.\nEnvironmentalists say HB 765 has many flaws including a provision exempting businesses that voluntarily report environmental violations from civil penalties.\nFinally House Bill 765, known as the Regulatory Reform Act of 2015, is also up for concurrence.\nSen.
