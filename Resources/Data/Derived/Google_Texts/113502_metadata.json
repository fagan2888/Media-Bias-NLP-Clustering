Frank Oliver, who was dean of the African Americans in length of service in the General Assembly.\n\nMany of them have been fully supportive of this newspaper and it is because of them, and our relationship with each, we have firsthand knowledge of what each contributes to their own constituents as well as to voters everywhere.\n\nEach in his or her way daily serves constituents, but they also contribute to legislation bettering the lives of all Pennsylvanians. Each has been a stalwart supporter of education. The offices held include one in Congress, four in State Senate, 12 in the State House, Mayor, City Commission Chair, Council President, eight City Council Members, District Attorney and Sheriff.\n\nBURNING BRIDGES OR JACKPOT WIN?\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough not to believe in the role of a party loyalist when your entire political career has been opposed by the political party to which you belong. Forget about it forever, when you are opposed again by the party for a second term.\n\n2nd Dist. Councilwoman Maria Qui\u00c3\u00b1ones S\u00c3\u00a1nchez now won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take a party endorsement for granted; she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll campaign as though she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be. It was her intensive campaign which ousted Councilman Dan Savage, and easily rebuffed his second try at doing the same to her.\n\nNow she believes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her time to begin building an empire. For that, she has declared her support for several independent aspirants to the General Assembly, tapping the bulk of her staff for House seats and her husband Tom\u00c3\u00a1s for Senate.\n\nThey include Quetcy Lozada, her chief of staff, o is targeting State Rep. Angel Cruz in the 180th; Jason Dawkins, who will challenge first-term incumbent State Rep. James Clay in the 179th; Danilo Burgos, to replace State Rep. J.P. Miranda in the 197th; and her husband, who is challenging State Sen. Christine Tartaglione (D-Kensington), despite the local party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promotion of another candidate.\n\nNow turn the clock back to her second-term campaign and one discovers, though Savage had the endorsement, Qui\u00c3\u00b1ones S\u00c3\u00a1nchez was supported by Cruz and by Ward Leader Carlos Matos, whose sister-in-law is Tartaglione. The Senator and her very active political family were behind Qui\u00c3\u00b1ones S\u00c3\u00a1nchez. That made for an easy win.\n\nHer belief in her winning efforts has blinded her to the fact she is burning bridges. Take Cruz, for example. He was on her side her first two races. He used his team and resources to help her. Now she wants to dump him!\n\nTalk about paybacks. Cruz is already lining up his supporters for the vendetta, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She fancies herself as the first Latino Mayor. She could run for that office, but if she wants to run for City Council again, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see my name on the ballot challenging her.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Cruz has one target now: Qui\u00c3\u00b1ones S\u00c3\u00a1nchez.\n\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why he is not supporting anyone in the legislative races around his district. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All those mentioned are my friends.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nJ.P. Miranda may have his hands full with an indictment on his back, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count him out. The district is more Black than Latino and with more Latinos in the race, the stronger the possibility he will win the primary. In that race will be Ben Ramos and Leslie Acosta, who has Democratic Party endorsement.\n\nWe see Tom\u00c3\u00a1s climbing a slippery slope. Tartaglione\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two district offices account for an average of 1,500 constituent services weekly. He should check for himself before entering his challenge. The Senator has the bulk of labor endorsements normally involved in her district races.\n\nIf the Councilwoman wins, then the scenario changes, but her work will be cut out for her.\n\n\u00c2\n\n\n\nSTACK ONLY NEEDS CITY VOTER TURNOUT\n\nIn the crowded Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor, State Sen. Mike Stack (D-Northeast) finds himself in the lead in the all-important money race. Stack raised $362,574 last year as well as carrying over an additional $289,973 from his previous campaigns.\n\nAltogether he has $397,134 cash on hand. Crown Holdings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 John Conwaytops individual donor list with $25,000. Stack has hired Seven Points Consulting to do his events, polling, etc. but also spent $1,000 with Perry Consulting. Stack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign has also given $1,000 to Brendan Boyle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign in the similarly crowded Democratic primary for the 13th Congressional Dist.\n\nAlso running for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor are State Rep. Brandon Neuman (D-Washington), former Congressman Mark Critz, Harrisburg City Councilman Brad Koplinski, Bradford Co. Commissioner Mark Smith and Harrisburg advisor Dr. Brenda Alton.\n\nNeuman will seek two offices this year: reelection to his House seat in the 48th Dist. and the Lieutenant Governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office.\n\nSo he is paying the rice, recently getting a challenger in his home district. Republican N. Strabane Township Supervisor Sonia Stopperich announced her candidacy for Pennsylvania\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 48th Legislative Dist. seat. Should Neuman gain the nomination for the second spot on the Democrats\u2019 statewide ticket, Stopperich will undoubtedly hammer him for running for both offices in the general election.\n\n\u00c2 13TH DISTRICT RACE WILL CHURN VOTES\n\n13th Dist. Congressional candidate Marjorie Margolies continues to reap dividends from her time in Congress. US House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) was a special guest at a fundraiser hosted by Stradley Ronon Chairman William R. Sasso, Senior Counsel Bennett G. Picker and Counsel Josh Shapiro, who serves as Chair of the Montgomery Co. Board of Commissioners.\n\nVALERIE ARKOOSH is outspoken advocate of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Valerie Arkoosh has won the endorsement of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a physician in Philadelphia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospitals, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen how programs like Social Security and Medicare are more than a promise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are lifelines,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Arkoosh said in a campaign email announcing the endorsement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m honored to announce the endorsement of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a leading voice in protecting and expanding Social Security and Medicare benefits for the last 30 years.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nArkoosh also noted that she previously worked with the Committee when she was the President of the National Physicians Alliance. They worked together on improving health care for seniors as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe National Committee is considered one of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most-influential organizations dedicated to protect, promote and ensure the financial security, health and the well being of current and future generations of maturing Americans.\n\nAs head of the National Physicians Alliance, Arkoosh advocated for increasing Medicare benefits as part of the Affordable Care Act when it was passed in 2010; the committee cited that work in its endorsement.\n\nArkoosh, who has never run for office, raised $203,089 in the fourth quarter of 2013, and had $643,000 cash on hand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most in the race, according to recent campaign finance reports.\n\nALLYSON MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN A PROGRESSIVE VOTER?\n\nNational Journal has called gubernatorial candidate Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz (D-Phila.) the most-conservative member of the Pennsylvania House Democrats.\n\nThe most liberal is Chaka Fattah (D-Phila.) with a 90.3% rating, followed by Matt Cartwright (D-Luzerne) and Mike Doyle (D-Allegheny). Then comes Bob Brady (D-Phila.) at 81.7% and Allyson with 69%.\n\nThe vote didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t differentiate ideological from party positions, with loyalty sometimes putting oneself on a more-conservative bent.\n\nPROGRESSIVES ENDORSE HANGER IN PHILLY\n\nJohn Hanger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for Pennsylvania Governor was endorsed by a leading Philadelphia progressive group and by several community activists who have joined together under the coalition Progressive Philly Rising.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153On Feb. 1, community leaders and the working people of Philadelphia are coming together to reclaim our city and our state,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Todd Wolfson, lead organizer of Progressive Philly Rising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of us are joining John Hanger and his inspiring \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPeople\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which has pointed the way forward.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nWolfson said the groups and individuals represented in Progressive Philly Rising \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are beginning the process of working together to determine the future of our schools, our economy, our public infrastructure, our environment and our democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nMcCORD WISELY QUITS GAMING CONTROL BOARD\n\nAs the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board continues to review applications for a casino license in Philadelphia, State Treasurer Rob McCord \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who fought to become a non-voting member of the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive sessions, where such things as casino licenses are deliberated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has announced he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t participate in those sessions.\n\nConcerns had been raised, by some observers of the situation, regarding the ethics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or at least the appearance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of McCord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being part of those sessions while accepting gubernatorial campaign contributions from law firms that represent gambling and casino interests.\n\nWhy make enemies? His move makes sense.\n\nHe has added to his endorsement list the powerful Pennsylvania State Education Association, the Commonwealth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 union, which boasts 180,000 members and vast monetary resources. The endorsement packs an even-bigger punch in this Governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s race where education funding is a focal point. But not all teachers are backing McCord: the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers threw its support behind Allyson Schwartz. The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers has not endorsed.\n\nTHE LONGER ON TV, THE HIGHER WOLF POLLS\n\nTom Wolf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign won an influential Lehigh Valley endorsement today from one of its longest-serving public officials, John Morganelli, who has served as Northampton District Attorney for 22 years.\n\nThere could be many more as Wolf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ads for Governor continue to appear on channels around the state. His polling is reportedly markedly climbing as far as recognition is concerned. To his credit, the ads are promoting his family background, his humble nature and his willingness to share profits with his employees. This is the approach that clinched Nutter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign for Mayor.\n\nWe understand he is hiring several Philadelphia operatives to help him gain support in the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democratic majority bloc of black voters. Another positive sign for Wolf is the fact Republican State Committee is now targeting him with their press releases. Previously, that honor was reserved for Schwartz.\n\nADMIRAL SEEKS SHIPMATES FOR 2016\n\nIn what might be some of the earliest volunteer-recruitment calls ever, Adm. Joe Sestak is recruiting volunteers to help with his 2016 run for Senate.\n\nHe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been coy about his 2016 run, but recruiting volunteers 27 months before the election could be a record. His minefield could include Attorney General Kathleen Kane, Montco Commissioner Josh Shapiro and, in the end, a formidable US Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nJOIN OUR NEWSPAPER Join over 3.000 visitors who are receiving our newsletter and learn how to optimize your blog for search engines, find free traffic, and monetize your website.
