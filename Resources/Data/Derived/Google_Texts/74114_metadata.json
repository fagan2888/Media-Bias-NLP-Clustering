Others, however, range from ludicrous to disrespectful to clever to all of the above. Call them what you will, we just can\u2019t stop watching them.\n\nOne of our favorites, produced by a nonprofit organization \u201ccommitted to educating citizens about economic policy,\u2019\u2019 employs a combination of hilarity and hyperbole to compare Obama\u2019s presidency to an online romance gone bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2008, I fell in love,\u2019\u2019 a smiling woman gushes. \u201cHis online profile made him seem so perfect.\u2019\u2019 But her glee quickly devolves into regret. \u201cI trusted him,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u201cI stuck with him because he promised he\u2019d be better. He\u2019s great at promises,\u2019\u2019 she laments before symbolically closing a laptop with an image of Obama on its screen. She ends with a pointed attack on Democrats: \u201cI know I\u2019m stuck with Barack for two more years, but I\u2019m not stuck with his friends.\u2019\u2019\n\nMany of the commercials are for national audiences, but there are plenty with local appeal. In this spot set during a fictional spelling bee, a contestant is asked to spell \u201cShaheen,\u2019\u2019 as in Jeanne Shaheen, the U.S. senator from New Hampshire. After asking for a definition and hearing it used in a sentence, the child spells out \u201cO-B-A-M-A.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cClose enough!\u2019\u2019 decide the judges.\n\nHere in Massachusetts, our own Charlie Baker is apparently not the only candidate who exploited his family for campaign ads. Mike Heffernan, who is running for state treasurer, showed that he is willing to do whatever it takes to save the Bay State money, including not paying for the labor of his own wife, children, and grandfather, who were used as cast and crew for a clever take on a campaign commercial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther efforts that feature the candidates themselves are quite simply over the top. Iowa Senate hopeful Bob Quast, a Second Amendment fan who made term limits the focus of his campaign, brandishes a Glock in an ad and promises \u201cto blow your balls off\u2019\u2019 if you threaten his family. This strategy may not be the most effective, as indicated by a recent poll.\n\nApparently testicular references are a thing in Iowa, as current State Senator Joni Ernst claims in her ad that her background of castrating pigs on the Iowa farm where she grew up has properly prepared her to join the U.S. Senate and help repeal Obamacare.\n\nWill Brooke, a congressional candidate in Alabama, also wants to eliminate Obamacare by any means necessary. After shooting a copy of the legislation with a high-powered rifle fails to destroy it, Brooke is forced to \u201cresort to more extreme measures to get rid of Obamacare.\u2019\u2019 In this case, Plan B means feeding the pieces of paper into a tree-shredding machine, sending pages of scrap paper flying into the air. Brooke\u2019s bid ended in September, when he lost the primary.\n\nAnd then there are the cameos.\n\nAmerica\u2019s favorite Nevada cattle rancher, Cliven Bundy, who once famously wondered if black people were \u201cbetter off as slaves, picking cotton,\u2019\u2019 uses a new ad for independent congressional candidate Kamau Bakari to continue his conversation about race. Bakari, who is black, tells Bundy that \u201ca brave white man like you might be just what we need to put an end to this political correctness stuff in America.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s unclear if that mission was actually accomplished or not in this ad, which concludes with the pair daring Eric Holder to come to Nevada to talk about race since he \u201cwasn\u2019t too busy to go to Ferguson, Missouri.\u2019\u2019 Yes, it\u2019s as weird as it sounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a mock candidate\u2014Gil Fulbright, who bills himself as an \u201chonest politician\u2019\u2019\u2014to put all of these political ads in their proper perspective. Fulbright\u2019s satirical advertisement states that his campaign for a US Senate seat from Kentucky \u201cis not about me. It\u2019s about crafting a version of me that\u2019ll appeal to you.\u2019\u2019 Touch\u00e9, Mr. Fulbright, touch\u00e9.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Election Day is on the horizon, and we\u2019re obsessed with watching political ads, from the ludicrous to the tasteless to the surprisingly clever.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Election Day is on the horizon, and we\u2019re obsessed with watching political ads, from the ludicrous to the tasteless to the surprisingly clever.", "creator": "@BostonDotCom", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/BDC_b_logo_transparent_background_og.jpg", "title": "The 2014 Political Ads We Can\u2019t Stop Watching", "site": "@BostonDotCom", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/smalltile.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Boston.com", "description": "Election Day is on the horizon, and we\u2019re obsessed with watching political ads, from the ludicrous to the tasteless to the surprisingly clever.", "title": "The 2014 Political Ads We Can\u2019t Stop Watching", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shaheen-850x478.png", "url": "http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2014/10/21/the-2014-political-ads-we-cant-stop-watching", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/boston", "section": "News", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-10-21T18:40:17-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mediumtile.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf49c\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementIt takes a mock candidate\u2014Gil Fulbright, who bills himself as an \u201chonest politician\u2019\u2019\u2014to put all of these political ads in their proper perspective.\nHere in Massachusetts, our own Charlie Baker is apparently not the only candidate who exploited his family for campaign ads.\nWith Election Day on the horizon, we\u2019re once again engaged in a pastime we\u2019ve loved ever since the controversial Wille Horton ad from 1988: watching (and rewatching) the most jaw-dropping political ads of the season.\nSome have been simply tasteless, such as the ads that used imagery from the murder of journalist James Foley.\nCall them what you will, we just can\u2019t stop watching them."}
