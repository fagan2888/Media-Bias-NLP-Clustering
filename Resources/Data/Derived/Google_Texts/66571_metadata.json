What if it has won 70 percent?\n\nIs there something wrong with the situation?\n\nThe sobering reality to coaches in the NBA now is that it is reality. The downside to having a star player is getting on the bad side of him \u2014 or never connecting with him (or them) at all.\n\nIn Cleveland, David Blatt was fired Friday for a lack of connection, not for his record. General manager David Griffin said so.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a disconnect right now,\u201d Griffin told reporters. \u201cA lack of spirit and disconnectedness I can\u2019t accept.\u201d\n\nAnd, poof! Blatt\u2019s gone.\n\nThese are the new rules for the coaching profession:\n\n1. Win \u2014 a title, preferably.\n\n2. Make sure everyone is happy along the way.\n\nThat used to be a bonus. It is now a prerequisite. Disconnectedness got Blatt fired. An inability to connect anymore to his star in Houston led to a rough start and, eventually, to Kevin McHale getting canned. George Karl was on the hottest of seats in Sacramento facing an owner who was most certainly going to choose DeMarcus Cousins over the coach who verbally sparred with the star center.\n\n\u201cIt used to be you were judged on wins and losses,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cNowadays, in the NBA, it\u2019s not just about wins and losses. You could be winning \u2014 30-11 \u2014 and get fired, because, is your owner happy, are your fans happy, is your GM happy, are your players happy?\u201d\n\nWhich is ridiculous, according to Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy, who zeroed in on the Blatt situation.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea why it happened, but there\u2019s no explanation that can include that he didn\u2019t meet expectations in terms of winning,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way to even make a flimsy case, let alone a solid one.\n\n\u201cNone of us now has any clue whatsoever what the expectation for coaches are.\u201d\n\nOh, but they do.\n\nIn April 2012, Van Gundy went through it himself. He and his star in Orlando, Dwight Howard, got crossways. Van Gundy publicly expressed his thoughts that Howard was trying to get him fired. And whether or not that was the case, a little more than a month later he was, in fact, fired.\n\nHoward stayed.\n\nThat was back then, a precursor to what is now taking place. New on the list of reasons to be fired are a star\u2019s happiness, style of play (see Malone with Sacramento circa 2014) and whatever else. The money is good, and for many that\u2019s cause enough to dismiss any coach\u2019s complaints, but the fine print on the contract might as well read: \u201cCan be terminated for any reason.\u201d\n\nThe new rules of coaching may well place relationship building at the top of the list, then winning right after that. And maybe that\u2019s fine. Players have a right to like their workplace, right?\n\nBut perhaps the biggest cautionary tale is for the organization. Star players are great; you can\u2019t win without them. Hometown stars are even better. But lines must be drawn. The people in power must retain the power. When those lines start to gray, when a player becomes bigger than the organization, very little good can come from it in the end.\n\nGriffin was right. Blatt\u2019s tale goes beyond wins and losses. The new rules call for the men in the profession to be equal parts winner and entertainer. Still, it would be prudent for one old thing to find its way back into the lexicon.\n\nCommon sense.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@ denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nStephen Curry, G, Golden State\n\nNothing could be more normal about the following statement: Stephen Curry was stellar last week. But he was. And because of an incredible week of performances, the reigning MVP is The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Curry averaged 34.3 points, 8.0 assists, 7.3 rebounds and 2.0 steals in four games. He shot 54.3 percent from the field and 49 percent from the 3-point line. The Warriors won three of the four games, including a blowout victory over the Cavaliers in Cleveland.\n\nBackground: Let\u2019s start with the game against the Cavaliers. That was the most eye-opening victory of the season for any team in the league, and Curry was relentless in it. He scored 34 points, knocked down seven 3-pointers and made 12-of-18 shots from the field. His best all-around statistical game of the week came at home Friday night, when he torched Indiana for a triple-double of 39 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds. The Warriors won on a night their coach, Steve Kerr, returned to the bench.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: Nothing can be written here that hasn\u2019t already been said. Curry is the class of the NBA \u2014 and he is playing better this season than last season, when he won the MVP award. His play is exemplary, his poise is exemplary, his humble nature is exemplary. He is everything a star should be on and off the court, and his play is head and shoulders above the rest.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: The new rules of coaching are nearly impossible", "title": "Dempsey: The new rules of coaching are nearly impossible", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/dempsey-the-new-rules-of-coaching-are-nearly-impossible/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T20:18:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:38:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "article_summary": "Star players are great; you can\u2019t win without them.\nAnd because of an incredible week of performances, the reigning MVP is The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\nThese are the new rules for the coaching profession:1.\nCurry is the class of the NBA \u2014 and he is playing better this season than last season, when he won the MVP award.\nThe new rules call for the men in the profession to be equal parts winner and entertainer."}
