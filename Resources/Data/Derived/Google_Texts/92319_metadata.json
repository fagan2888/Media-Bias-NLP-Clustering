They attack us because we've been over there; we've been bombing Iraq for 10 years.\"\n\nThen-frontrunner Rudolph Giuliani, visibly agitated, interrupted the proceedings to condemn Paul's \"extraordinary statement...that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq\" and then demand a retraction as the crowd went wild. Campaign reporters, straight and ideological alike, started writing Ron Paul's obituary. But a funny thing happened on the way to Paul's seemingly inevitable ostracism from the Republican Party for the sin of noninterventionism: His star began to rise, while Giuliani's crashed and burned.\n\nNow retired from Congress after a second, more successful run at the White House, Paul can gaze out at a world and a GOP that has become much more sympathetic to his once-lonely view of the world. There are entire armies of young libertarian activists\u2014including many recent military veterans\u2014who got their introduction to the philosophy through Ron Paul's bracing criticism of U.S. misadventures abroad. You can't talk about libertarian foreign policy without talking about\u2014and to\u2014Ron Paul. Reason Editor in Chief Matt Welch caught up with the three-time presidential candidate over the phone in October.\n\nView this article.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "On May 15, 2007, at a Republican primary debate in Columbia, South Carolina, longshot presidential candidate Ron Paul shocked the room with his answer", "title": "Interview: Ron Paul on Libertarian Foreign Policy", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/12/17/interview-ron-paul-on-foreign-policy", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1418671914229.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1418671914229.jpg", "description": "On May 15, 2007, at a Republican primary debate\nin Columbia, South Carolina, longshot presidential candidate Ron\nPaul shocked the room with his answer to a question about how 9/11\nchanged America: \"Have you ever read the reasons they attacked us?\nThey attack us because we've been over there; we've been bombing\nIraq for 10 years.\"\nThen-frontrunner Rudolph Giuliani, visibly agitated, interrupted\nthe proceedings to condemn Paul's \"extraordinary statement...that\nwe invited the attack because we were atta", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Interview: Ron Paul on Libertarian Foreign Policy"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T13:30:00+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b2d\"", "article_summary": "Campaign reporters, straight and ideological alike, started writing Ron Paul's obituary.\nReason Editor in Chief Matt Welch caught up with the three-time presidential candidate over the phone in October.\nThere are entire armies of young libertarian activists\u2014including many recent military veterans\u2014who got their introduction to the philosophy through Ron Paul's bracing criticism of U.S. misadventures abroad.\nYou can't talk about libertarian foreign policy without talking about\u2014and to\u2014Ron Paul.\nOn May 15, 2007, at a Republican primary debate in Columbia, South Carolina, longshot presidential candidate Ron Paul shocked the room with his answer to a question about how 9/11 changed America: \"Have you ever read the reasons they attacked us?"}
