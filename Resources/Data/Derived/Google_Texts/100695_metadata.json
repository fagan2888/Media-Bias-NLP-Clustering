Tammy Baldwin this week may have crystallized for conservatives why Senate Republicans are digging in their heels on President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nomination.\n\n\u201cOne only has to look at the Court\u2019s docket this year in particular to see the gravity of the issues that they are grappling with. We know that a Supreme Court justice who\u2019s able to serve 10, 20, 30, 40 years is someone who\u2019ll shape the interpretation of policy for a generation or more,\u201d the Madison Democrat told Politico after leaving a protest on the steps of the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning.\n\nNo wonder conservatives want nothing to do with an Obama nominee, even a so-called \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d in appeals court Judge Merrick B. Garland.\n\nTwenty years of another liberal like Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on a left-led court would be disastrous for core conservative and constitutional principles, conservatives assert.\n\nBaldwin, an openly gay senator from one of the most liberal cities in the nation, was part of the Obama Supreme Court dog and pony show Thursday. It\u2019s the highly politicized shame game to make intransigent GOP senators change their minds on a hearing for Garland. Republicans remain mostly united in their stance that the next president \u2013 be that chief executive a Republican or Democrat \u2013 nominate a replacement for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.\n\nIn short, no Obama nominees in this election year.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely will not allow the Supreme Court to flip,\u201d U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin\u2019s senior senator, said last month at a political forum hosted by Milwaukee conservative talk-radio host Charlie Sykes. Johnson made his comments to thunderous applause, according to the New York Times.\n\nThat enthusiasm from the base shows why Obama and his left-wing, politically driven shame game may fail to move the Republican position.\n\nWhile a CNN/ORC poll late last month showed a slight majority of respondents, 52 percent, said Garland should be confirmed, the conservative base has a profound distrust of this president and his ultra-liberal leanings.\n\n\u201cYeah, I am hearing the drumbeat, \u2018Do your job! Do your job!\u2019 \u201d Johnson said, playing off the Dems\u2019 meme in their pressure campaign to get Garland a hearing. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our job,\u201d Johnson declared, to shouts of \u201cyes,\u201d according to the Times.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama job is to nominate and he chose to do that,\u201d the Oshkosh Republican told Wisconsin Watchdog last month. \u201cOur job is to advise and consent.\u201d\n\nJohnson on the SCOTUS battle: \u2018We have fulfilled our constitutional duty\u2019\n\nThe Senate\u2019s advice, Johnson said, was the same as Vice President Joe Biden\u2018s, who in 1992 as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman urged President George H.W. Bush not to send a Supreme Court nominee to the Senate during that election year.\n\nShould there be a vacancy on the court, Biden said, Bush should \u201cnot name a nominee until after the general election is completed,\u201d and if he did, the \u201cSenate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenate consideration of a nominee under these circumstances is not fair to the president, to the nominee, or to the Senate itself,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhere the nation should be treated to a consideration of constitutional philosophy, all it will get in such circumstances is partisan bickering and political posturing from both parties and from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\nFunny how the times change. Biden was on the political PR trail this week explaining why the \u201cfull Supreme Court Matters to You.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson said he was open to meeting with anyone, including Garland. But his view has not changed.\n\n\u201cWisconsinites\u2019 Second Amendment right to bear arms and other fundamental liberties are at stake, so I will continue doing my job as a constitutional check on the president\u2019s power, and we will continue to withhold our consent until the American people have a voice through their votes this fall,\u201d the senator said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Democrat opponent, former Sen. Russ Feingold, whom Johnson beat in 2010, has tried to fire up his troops with the Supreme Court issue. He says the incumbent and his Republican colleagues are \u201cplaying\u201d to their base, failing to note the partisan impact from the left.\n\n\u201cThey protect those at the very top, and they are not even willing to do their job when it comes to a clear issue on the Supreme Court because everything is about being partisan and keeping control on the Supreme Court,\u201d Feingold told the New York Times. \u201cSo people smell a rat. They smell that something is not honest about this.\u201d\n\nLiberals see the issue as a big winner come November, with voters taking out their frustrations over the Supreme Court battle on Republicans at the polls \u2013 delivering the Senate back to Democrats and retaining control of the White House. Ultimately, the nominee will be the left\u2019s anyway, and his confirmation will follow, or so the left-wing vision goes.\n\nFeingold and his friends, however, fail to see that Johnson, his fellow Republican senators, and many millions of Americans see the fight on constitutional principles.\n\n\u201cThe left wants the Supreme Court flipped. They want an activist court,\u201d Johnson told Wisconsin Watchdog. \u201cThey want to have President Obama appoint another super legislator to join the liberal block and what would be put at risk are your Second Amendment rights to bear arms, your First Amendment rights to free speech and religious liberty. That\u2019s what is at stake here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Tammy Baldwin crystalizes why conservatives want nothing to do with an Obama Supreme Court nomination", "title": "Tammy Baldwin unwittingly sums up why right won't budge on Obama SCOTUS nominee - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/04/Tammy-Baldwin-pointing.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-08T09:51:48+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/261717/tammy-baldwin-obama-supreme-court/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Judiciary", "tag": "Barack Obama,Charlie Sykes,George H.W.
