(Photo: Hudson Valley Hospital)\n\nThe mother/child bond is one of nature's most powerful. It starts at the moment of the baby's birth and gets stronger each day through feeding and nurturing.\n\nAn important part of child-rearing for many mothers is the ability to breastfeed, as the benefits have long been documented. According to Linda LeMon, a certified lactation consultant at NewYork-Prebysterian/Hudson Valley Hospital in Cortlandt Manor, \"Thousands of research studies show babies who receive breast milk are more likely to thrive and have fewer ear and respiratory infections, stomach issues, allergies and digestive problems.\"\n\nThe benefits of breastfeeding extend to the mother as well. Studies show it reduces her risk of breast and ovarian cancer, it promotes a faster recovery from pregnancy and childbirth, lowers stress levels, and it lowers the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease throughout life.\n\nThe challenge for many women comes when their maternity leave ends and returning to their job begins: Can they continue to express milk in the workplace? The answer, says Ms. LeMon, is a resounding yes. \"It's the law,\" she says. \"The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was amended in 2010 with the passage of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 4, requiring employers to accommodate nursing women who want to express milk for their infants during the work period.\" Many companies now make this important accommodation for new mothers.\n\nThe law stipulates that employers must provide breastfeeding women the opportunity to lactate at work in a private place (not a bathroom) and preferably within close proximity to her work area. \"In addition,\" says Ms. LeMon, \"the law further states that a woman can continue to express milk in the workplace for up to three years after her baby is born in an atmosphere that is non-judgmental and non-discriminatory.\"\n\nProviding support for nursing women at work is good for business too.\n\nHundreds of companies across America provide lactation support programs as part of their family-friendly benefit platform. Studies show they produce beneficial results including:\n\n1. Healthier babies and moms resulting in lower healthcare costs. One company, for example, found that their newborn healthcare costs are three times less when employees participate in the lactation program.\n\n2. Less absenteeism due to infant illness (among both mothers and fathers) Another company found a 77 percent reduction in lost work time since babies who receive their mother's milk are healthier.\n\n3. Higher employee job satisfaction and lower turnover.\n\nA nine-company study found that the average return to work rate is 94 percent when a lactation program is provided.\n\n4. Improved employee loyalty and performance. Many companies report that their employees are more productive and loyal when they provide women with lactation support such as time and space to express milk at work.\n\nWith the benefits of a workplace lactation program clearly established, in addition to the benefits it provides mother and child, Ms. LeMon offers this advice: \"Don't be afraid to ask for support to continue breastfeeding after you return to work. Remember: It's your right.\"\n\nFrom pregnancy through the early weeks of your baby's life, the Women's Pavilion for Birthing at NewYork-Presbyterian/Hudson Valley offers a host of resources and training for women and their families including a breastfeeding support group that meets every second and fourth Wednesday of the month, and monthly prenatal breastfeeding education.\n\nFor more information, visit nyp.org/hudsonvalley or call 914-734-3896.\n\nThis story is provided and presented by our sponsor: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1MCi7Tk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Hundreds of companies across America provide lactation support programs as part of their family-friendly benefit platform.", "og": {"site_name": "lohud.com", "description": "Hundreds of companies across America provide lactation support programs as part of their family-friendly benefit platform.", "title": "Workplace lactation programs benefit baby, mother and employer", "url": "http://www.lohud.com/story/sponsor-story/newyork-presbyterian-hospital/2015/07/15/workplace-lactation-programs/30206603/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lohud.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds of companies across America provide lactation support programs as part of their family-friendly benefit platform.", "title": "Workplace lactation programs benefit baby, mother and employer", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2cfbc10a4f2df3a8699de614f41444aa2c5b73d2/c=150-0-424-274&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/15/Westchester/Westchester/635725799346117594-Big-Latch-On-2014-IMG-5409-1-.JPG", "creator": "@lohud", "site": "@lohud", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOFOLLOW, NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600070416", "fb": {"app_id": 169889109713077}, "Googlebot-News": "noindex, nofollow", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "workplace lactation,lactation,breast-feasting,baby feeding,breast-feeding programs new york,baby's birth new york,workplace baby feeding"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a28\"", "article_summary": "Hundreds of companies across America provide lactation support programs as part of their family-friendly benefit platform.\nWith the benefits of a workplace lactation program clearly established, in addition to the benefits it provides mother and child, Ms.\nWomen breast-feeding.\nThe challenge for many women comes when their maternity leave ends and returning to their job begins: Can they continue to express milk in the workplace?\nMany companies report that their employees are more productive and loyal when they provide women with lactation support such as time and space to express milk at work."}
