Nearly 118,000 adults in Broward and Palm Beach counties are too poor to qualify for benefits under Obamacare, but they don't qualify for Medicaid either, according to a new analysis.

The coverage gap under the Affordable Care Act affects more than one of five uninsured adults in the two counties, according to the Urban Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington.

The result: An estimated 56,200 poor adults in Palm Beach County and 61,600 in Broward can't get affordable health insurance, the institute's analysis found.

"If you're under the federal poverty level, you don't have an option for health care coverage," said Stephen Zuckerman, an Urban Institute health economist.

Under the Affordable Care Act, uninsured adults in Florida with incomes between 100 and 138 percent of federal poverty level may qualify for subsidies to buy coverage through the new marketplaces.

The act placed those under the poverty line in an expanding Medicaid program. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could decide whether to increase their Medicaid programs, and Florida chose not to, Zuckerman said.

The state's Medicaid program serves 169,365 clients in Palm Beach County and 240,192 in Broward. Only parents who make under 35 percent of the federal poverty level can get Medicaid; adults with no children generally can't, Zuckerman said. The federal poverty level for a family of four is $23,550.

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative politcal advocacy group, said expanding Medicaid is not the answer to providing quality health care to the working poor in South Florida.
