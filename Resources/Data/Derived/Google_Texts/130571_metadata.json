A cursory inspection revealed shattered windows, imploded doors and broken equipment around the launch pad that will require extensive repairs. How much damage has been dealt to Orbital Sciences\u2019s reputation, and perhaps even NASA\u2019s quest to outsource orbital flights, is less certain.\n\nOrbital Sciences is one of two companies NASA now relies on to fly supplies to the space station. Four previous Antares flights, including three to the station, had launched successfully, and five resupply flights remain in the company\u2019s $1.9-billion NASA contract. Orbital Sciences\u2019 stock price has fallen by some 15 percent in recent days and the rocket mishap potentially complicates its planned merger with another aerospace company, Alliant Techsystems. \u201cThis is a big problem for NASA,\u201d says Roger Handberg, a space policy expert at the University of Central Florida. \u201cThey are now dependent on the commercial sector to lift payloads to the space station, and their own rocket, the Space Launch System, is at least three years out and is intended for other purposes. So what happens if Orbital Sciences can\u2019t get its rockets fixed? Then what do you do?\u201d\n\nThe space agency does have some options. NASA officials said the station\u2019s crew was in no danger of running out of supplies for several months, and on Wednesday a Russian Soyuz rocket launched a resupply mission that docked with the station to deliver even more. SpaceX, the other company NASA uses to resupply the station, is slated to launch its fourth delivery in December and has eight more scheduled. Orbital Sciences\u2019s next Antares launch, previously set for April, is likely to be delayed for several months.\n\nAccording to John Logsdon, a space policy expert at The George Washington University, if Orbital cannot return its Antares rockets to flight in time to fulfill the remaining resupply missions in its contract, NASA could buy additional flights from Russia\u2014or SpaceX, if the company proves to have sufficient \u201csurge capacity.\u201d In \u201cextreme cases,\u201d Logsdon says, NASA could even buy launches from the space agencies of Europe, India or Japan. \u201cThis just reinforces NASA\u2019s good judgment in having two providers, both Orbital and SpaceX,\u201d says Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, an industry association. If Orbital was the only provider, there might be a six-month or even a year before a return to flight. But SpaceX looks ready and will probably launch [its next resupply mission] in early December, so this redundant system will work.\u201d\n\nThis is not Orbital Sciences\u2019s first high-profile launch failure. In 2009 a malfunction in the fairing separation of its Taurus XL rocket destroyed NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellite; in 2011 a similar problem doomed NASA\u2019s Glory spacecraft. Even so, in the aftermath of the Antares failure a variety of NASA officials, congressional representatives and senators, and industry experts have issued statements in support of Orbital Sciences and the company\u2019s ongoing service to the space agency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Experts wonder if Orbital Sciences Corp. has the right stuff to meet NASA\u2019s goal of outsourcing orbital flights", "title": "Rocket explosion may imperil commercial spaceflight", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Experts wonder if Orbital Sciences Corp. has the right stuff to meet NASA\u2019s goal of outsourcing orbital flights", "title": "Rocket explosion may imperil commercial spaceflight", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/02/rocket_explosion_raises_grave_doubts_about_potential_commercial_spaceflights_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/aptopix-space-station.jpeg-620x4121.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Experts wonder if Orbital Sciences Corp. has the right stuff to meet NASA\u2019s goal of outsourcing orbital flights", "title": "Rocket explosion may imperil commercial spaceflight", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/aptopix-space-station.jpeg-620x4121.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lee Billings", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, NASA, Orbital Sciences, Orbital Sciences Corp, Scientific American, Space", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey are now dependent on the commercial sector to lift payloads to the space station, and their own rocket, the Space Launch System, is at least three years out and is intended for other purposes.\nOrbital Sciences is one of two companies NASA now relies on to fly supplies to the space station.\nOrbital Sciences\u2019s next Antares launch, previously set for April, is likely to be delayed for several months.\nSo what happens if Orbital Sciences can\u2019t get its rockets fixed?\n\u201cThis just reinforces NASA\u2019s good judgment in having two providers, both Orbital and SpaceX,\u201d says Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, an industry association."}
