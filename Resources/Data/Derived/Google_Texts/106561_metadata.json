The firm provides gyro-stabilized camera systems.\n\n\"His legacy includes many feats such as, conducting the first vital organ transplant mission in Los Angeles, supporting the first response rescue efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and being the only American Hollywood movie pilot to fly throughout the People's Republic of China,\" Gatena said in a statement.\n\nPurwin also appeared in cameo roles as a pilot in many productions, including the films \"Jurassic World,\" \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"Indecent Proposal.\"\n\nThe plane was owned by Heliblack LLC, which lists Purwin as an officer and registered agent, according to FAA and California records.\n\n\"There are no words that can express our heartache for we have lost one of the world's greatest helicopter pilots and one of aviation's greatest leaders,\" Gatena added in a statement.\n\nPurwin's plane, an Aerostar Piper 60, crashed in the town of San Pedro de los Milagros in the region of Antioquia, the aviation authority said.\n\nThe plane departed the Olaya Herrera Airport in Medellin, and the last contact was 3:22 p.m. local time Friday, the authority said.\n\nThe crash occurred between 5 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. Friday, said Carolina Sanchez Marin with the San Pedro de los Milagros Fire Department.\n\nThe plane could fit up to eight passengers, she said.\n\nThe cause of the crash is under investigation, the authority said.\n\nStarring Cruise, \"Mena\" is based on the life of drug pilot Adler Berriman \"Barry\" Seal, who's recruited by the CIA and \"soon finds himself in charge of one the biggest covert CIA operations in the history of the United States that spawned the birth of the Medellin cartel and eventually almost brought down the Reagan White House with the Iran-Contra scandal,\" Cross Creek Pictures said.\n\nAs a drug smuggler turned informant, Barry Seal was eventually killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and a federal report said his killing was carried out on behalf of the Medellin cartel. Three Colombian nationals were convicted in his killing and were sentenced to life without parole, according to news accounts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A small plane carrying crew members from a Tom Cruise movie crashed Friday in foggy and cloudy conditions in the Colombian mountains, killing two people aboard, including a prominent Hollywood stunt pilot.", "language": "english", "author": "CNN", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/Tom-Cruise-movie-crew-members-in-plane-crash-that-kills-2-in-Colombia-327148901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/cruise+crew+crash.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A small plane carrying crew members from a Tom Cruise movie crashed Friday in foggy and cloudy conditions in the Colombian mountains, killing two people aboard, including a prominent Hollywood stunt pilot.", "title": "Tom Cruise movie crew members in plane crash that kills 2 in Colombia"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A small plane carrying crew members from a Tom Cruise movie crashed Friday in foggy and cloudy conditions in the Colombian mountains, killing two people aboard, including a prominent Hollywood stunt pilot.", "title": "Tom Cruise movie crew members in plane crash that kills 2 in Colombia", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/Tom-Cruise-movie-crew-members-in-plane-crash-that-kills-2-in-Colombia-327148901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/cruise+crew+crash.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Tom Cruise movie crew members in plane crash that kills 2 in Colombia", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tom Cruise movie crew members, in plane crash that kills"}, "article_summary": "A small plane carrying crew members from a Tom Cruise movie crashed Friday in foggy and cloudy conditions in the Colombian mountains, killing two people aboard, including a prominent Hollywood stunt pilot.\nThe crew members had just wrapped up work on the new film \"Mena,\" Universal Pictures said in a statement.\nKilled were Hollywood stunt pilot Alan D.
