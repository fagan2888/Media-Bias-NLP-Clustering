Officers said the people inside the cars were associated with a Hispanic gang and police believe they were headed to carry out a shooting.\n\nOne of the cars did pull over, and police said they found two guns, but the car then drove off which began the chase.\n\nA line of police cars trailed closely behind the maroon Honda Civic as it weaved in and out of traffic. The driver even used his blinker to signal lane changes.\n\nOsage SkyNews 6 pilot Will Kavanagh watched the whole thing unfold.\n\n\"Police, as they were chasing them, speeds reaching 75 to 80 miles per hour through this rush hour traffic,\" Kavanagh said.\n\nFour men were inside the car. Sergeant Sean Larkin said officers saw the men toss three hand guns and ammo out of the car along the route.\n\n\"I think these guys just wanted to separate themselves from the guns,\" Larkin said. \"Each one of these guns is a trigger pull away from a homicide.\"\n\nThe pursuit lasted a good half hour, taking officers from I-244 to 169, then over to I-44 and finally to 41st and Yale, where the driver, again, let police know he was making a turn, this time into the Promenade Mall parking lot.\n\nThe car came to a stop and the men surrendered, sticking their arms out the windows.\n\n\"He's just stopped here, on his own, hands up, so we're gonna see how this is gonna play out,\" said Kavanagh.\n\n\"Eventually, I think they got to a point where they knew just weren't gonna be able to get away and finally just pulled over,\" Larkin said.\n\nOne by one the men stepped out of the car with their hands up.\n\n\"As you can see here, they're backing him up right to the car,\" Kavanagh said.\n\nPolice handcuffed all four men.\n\nPolice believe the four are in their late teens. They also say officers recovered the guns that were thrown out during the chase.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Osage SkyNews 6 followed a high-speed chase in Tulsa.", "author": "NewsOn6.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/24559132/tulsa-police-catch-a-vehicle-after-high-speed-chase", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24559132_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Osage SkyNews 6 followed a high-speed chase in Tulsa.", "title": "Tulsa Police Arrest Driver After High-Speed Chase"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24559132_SA.jpg", "description": "Osage SkyNews 6 followed a high-speed chase in Tulsa.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tulsa Police Arrest Driver After High-Speed Chase"}, "wnreadableurl": "tulsa-police-catch-a-vehicle-after-high-speed-chase", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/01/27", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "\"Police, as they were chasing them, speeds reaching 75 to 80 miles per hour through this rush hour traffic,\" Kavanagh said.\n\"As you can see here, they're backing him up right to the car,\" Kavanagh said.\n\"I think these guys just wanted to separate themselves from the guns,\" Larkin said.\nSergeant Sean Larkin said officers saw the men toss three hand guns and ammo out of the car along the route.\nOne of the cars did pull over, and police said they found two guns, but the car then drove off which began the chase."}
