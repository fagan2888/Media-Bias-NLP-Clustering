Among patients not on ventilators, researchers identified the five most common major diagnostic categories: respiratory, circulatory, digestive, musculoskeletal and connective tissue, and infectious and parasitic diseases and disorders. Among these five diagnoses, the researchers identified those patients who had spent three or more days in a \"standard hospital ICU\" and those with multiple organ failure.\n\nMultiple organ failure patients who were treated at LTCHs fared better in the long term if they were in the diagnostic category of musculoskeletal and connective tissue, circulatory, and respiratory conditions, according to the study. Mortality gaps were \"statistically insignificant\" in patients diagnosed with digestive issues and infections, parasitic diseases and disorders involving multiple organ failure.\n\nPatients who spent time in intensive care units had significantly lower mortality rates in all diagnostic categories except digestive disorders.\n\nFurthermore, multiple organ failure LTCH patients with circulatory, digestive and musculoskeletal and connective tissue conditions had lower costs associated with their care with savings ranging from ranging from $13,806 to $20,809 per patient per hospitalization.\n\nSimilar savings were found among patients who had spent time in ICUs in the diagnostic categories of circulatory, digestive, and musculoskeletal and connective tissue conditions. However, patients with respiratory and infectious and parasitic conditions ended up incurring higher costs at LTCHs.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the announcement\n\nRelated articles\n\nHospitals for critically ill patients in tough financial spot\n\nHospitals base discharges on payments, not patient progress", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patients with critical and medically complex diagnoses fare better and receive less expensive care at long-term acute care hospitals, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0published in the July issue of the journal\u00a0Medical Care.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Patients with critical and medically complex diagnoses fare better and receive less expensive care at long-term acute care hospitals, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0published in the July issue of the journal\u00a0Medical Care.", "title": "Patients with complex diagnoses receive better, less expensive care at long-term acute care facilities", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/patients-complex-diagnoses-receive-better-less-expensive-care-long-term-acu/2015-07-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,complex patients,healthcare costs,long-term acute-care hospitals (LTAC),Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1130\"", "article_summary": "By David FergusonPatients with critical and medically complex diagnoses fare better and receive less expensive care at long-term acute care hospitals (LTCH), according to a study published in the July issue of the journal Medical Care.\nSimilar savings were found among patients who had spent time in ICUs in the diagnostic categories of circulatory, digestive, and musculoskeletal and connective tissue conditions.\nPatients who spent time in intensive care units had significantly lower mortality rates in all diagnostic categories except digestive disorders.\n\"Because care for these patients requires a significant amount of healthcare resources,\" said Koenig, \"it's important to identify cost-effective treatment approaches.\"\nAmong patients not on ventilators, researchers identified the five most common major diagnostic categories: respiratory, circulatory, digestive, musculoskeletal and connective tissue, and infectious and parasitic diseases and disorders."}
