The title drought continues for Argentina.\n\nGoalkeeper Claudio Bravo made a save and striker Alexis Sanchez converted the winning penalty as the hosts defeated Argentina 4-1 in a shootout after a 0-0 draw in the Copa America final on Saturday, finally winning its first major tournament.\n\nThe result extended Argentina\u2019s 22-year title drought, and Lionel Messi will continue to hear criticism for his lackluster play with the national team when it needs him the most.\n\nBravo stopped Ever Banega\u2019s low shot by diving to his left to make the save and, earlier, Gonzalo Higuain also missed for Argentina, sending his shot over the crossbar.\n\nThe Chileans made all of their penalties, and captain Bravo lifted the nation\u2019s first ever trophy in front of President Michelle Bachelet and nearly 50,000 Chileans who packed the Estadio Nacional, frantically waving Chile\u2019s red, blue and white flags.\n\nThe title rewarded the nation\u2019s best generation of players after years of disappointments in the South American tournament and at World Cups. The victory secures Chile a spot in the Confederations Cup for the first time.\n\n\u201cThis is a dream, this team deserved a victory like this,\u201d said midfielder Arturo Vidal, one of the leaders of this golden generation. \u201cThe Chilean people needed this triumph, needed something so beautiful as being crowned America\u2019s champion.\n\n\u201cToday it was an incredible step forward for us, this generation deserved it,\u201d the Juventus midfielder said.\n\nChile hadn\u2019t made it to a final in 28 years, when it lost to Uruguay in the Copa America in Argentina. It finished runner-up four times, including at home in 1955. Its best result at a World Cup was a third-place finish at home in 1962, and last year it reached the round of 16, being eliminated by host Brazil on penalties.\n\n\u201cWe had to leave this negative history behind us,\u201d said Barcelona goalkeeper Bravo, Chile\u2019s most experienced player all-time with nearly 100 caps. \u201cThis is a privileged generation. We had to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nArgentina\u2019s disappointment comes less than a year since the 1-0 loss to Germany in the World Cup final. Argentina lost consecutive Copa America finals to Brazil in 2004 and 2007, and in the 2011 tournament at home, Messi and his teammates didn\u2019t make it past the quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cWe will just keep trying,\u201d said Argentina coach Gerardo Martino, who four years ago lost the Copa America final while managing the Paraguayan national team. \u201cWe will keep trying with these same players that today are crying in the locker room.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s defeat came exactly 22 years after Argentina won its last title at the 1993 Copa America, when Messi was only a kid. Since then, it has failed in seven Copa Americas and six World Cups, with Messi playing in five of those tournaments.\n\n\u201cWe did everything we could but again it wasn\u2019t meant to be,\u201d said Javier Mascherano, Messi\u2019s teammate at Barcelona. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly painful, and we know it\u2019s only going to get harder from now on.\u201d\n\nMessi struggled throughout the match on Saturday and was never a factor, looking nothing like the star that he usually is with Barcelona.\n\nIt was an even final from the start, with the teams creating few scoring chances. Chile controlled possession during most of the second half and came closer than Argentina to getting on the board.\n\nSanchez had one of the game\u2019s best opportunities in the 82nd, but his close-range shot missed wide.\n\nArgentina\u2019s greatest chance came in the last play of regulation in a breakaway that started with Messi near midfield, but Higuain hit the outside of the net after a dangerous cross into the area.\n\nIn extra time, it was Sanchez who almost scored in a counterattack after Javier Mascherano misplayed a ball near midfield, but his right-footed shot missed the target.\n\nIn the shootout, Matias Fernandez, Vidal and Charles Aranguiz all netted for Chile, while Messi scored Argentina\u2019s lone goal in the team\u2019s first attempt.\n\nSanchez\u2019s winner was a soft shot into the middle of the net as Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero dived to his left, igniting a frantic celebration by his teammates and the fans on the stands.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The wait is finally over for Chile.
