Aberdeen, SD

One of two Minnesota men accused of robbing a South Dakota casino at gunpoint has pleaded not guilty.



Roger Kihega, of Cokato, Minnesota, pleaded not guilty to armed robbery and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon Friday.



The American News reports Kihega is accused of stealing cash from Casino Korner in Aberdeen. Michael Washington is also facing charges.



Authorities say each of the men fired a shot in the air while robbing the business. Nobody was hurt.



Chief Deputy State's Attorney Chris White filed paperwork Friday charging Kihega as a habitual offender, meaning he has several prior felonies and could face a more severe maximum penalty.



Bond for Kihega is set at $100,000 cash.
