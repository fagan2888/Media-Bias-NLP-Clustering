A new center aimed at creating a safe space for the LGBT community is in the first stages of becoming a reality.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that the Capital City Equality Center received 501(c)(3) status, designating it as a public charity. The center will provide a place for people to meet, share experiences and support one another.

Organizers began working on the project in May 2015.

The center may provide resources for people to find jobs, for groups to host meetings or for businesses and organizations to gain awareness of the issues the LGBT community faces through programming. The organization might also open a clothing and food bank.

Stephanie Mott, the center's board president, says she hopes that establishing a safe space will reduce self-harm and suicides.
