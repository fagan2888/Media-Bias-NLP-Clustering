They packed Eighth St. near Third Ave. in Gowanus, grooved to hip hop and house music, and waved \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d signs.\n\nRacial justice and civil rights activist Linda Sarsour was one of the first to address the fired-up crowd.\n\n\u201cAs a Muslim American, I am proud to put my vote behind the only Jewish candidate for President,\u201d she said to roaring applause. \u201cThat\u2019s how we do in Brooklyn, N.Y.\u201d\n\nThough the Vermont senator was campaigning in Madison, Wis., the opening of Sanders\u2019 Brooklyn office felt more like a festival than a political event.\n\nFood trucks dished up local delicacies as Sanders was touted as the people\u2019s candidate. The one-story red brick structure serving as the Sanders New York HQ seemed a world away from rival Clinton\u2019s 11th-floor national headquarters in Brooklyn Heights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting Bernie because he speaks to my people,\u201d said Brooklyn City Councilman Rafael Espinal. \u201cWhen Bernie speaks, he speaks about the people who are not being represented in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nSanders, who grew up in a heavily Jewish neighborhood off Kings Highway, hasn\u2019t hidden his Brooklyn roots, and his obvious accent has been a crowd pleaser at his rallies across the country.\n\nThe 74-year-old\u2019s proletariat principles and message of economic equality have made him a hit with voters facing hard times.\n\n\u201cYounger people who come out with tens of thousands of dollars in student debt are looking at the economy and seeing a system that does not work,\u201d said 32-year-old Brooklynite Joe Dinkin. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly appealing, the fact that (Sanders) listens to the masses instead of just a wealthy few. \u201cBernie is speaking our language.\u201d\n\nMary Fitzgerald, 54, a nurse from the Bronx, said Sanders is the only viable presidential candidate in her eyes.\n\nOhio State senator Nina Turner speaks at the Bernie Sanders rally in Park Slope, Brooklyn. (Alex Rud)\n\n\u201cHe can make health care affordable and realistic for all Americans,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThe system we have right now puts profits before patients.\u201d\n\nBeyond health care, Fitzgerald said Sanders would make good on his promises to alleviate poverty and provide affordable education.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get people out of poverty if you don\u2019t get people a decent wage,\u201d she said. \u201cI see that in the Bronx, the unhealthiest borough in the country. He actually has a plan and a message to solve it.\u201d\n\nFor all his spirit, Sanders has been falling behind Clinton in delegates needed to win the nomination.\n\nIncluding superdelegates \u2014 party officials who can back any candidate \u2014 Clinton has at least 1,692 to Sanders\u2019 958. It takes 2,383 to win.\n\nBut the upstart democratic socialist still has a chance.\n\nSanders was looking to pull off a trifecta of wins in western caucuses Saturday. He was declared the winner in Alaska and Washington, and was forecast to come out on top in Hawaii.\n\nNo matter what the numbers say, Lisa Harbadkin, 72, of Manhattan, has kept the faith Sanders can still pull it out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to rebalance the Democratic Party to where it was before the Reagan years,\u201d Harbadkin said. \u201cThe Democrats have been moving too far to the right. Bernie can fix that.\u201d\n\nThe New York primary takes place April 19.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "CHRIS SOMMERFELDT, DENIS SLATTERY", "twitter": {"description": "Brooklyn was Bernin\u2019 Saturday as Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign opened a hometown headquarters with a raucous rally.", "title": "Brooklyn feels the Bern outside Sanders' new headquarters", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/brooklyn-feels-bern-sanders-new-headquarters-article-1.2578825", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2578824.1459032607!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/sanders27n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "hillary clinton, bernie sanders,", "parsely-author": "Denis Slattery", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.tags": "hillary clinton, bernie sanders,", "nydn_tags": "bernie sanders, gowanus, hillary clinton, 2016 election, rafael espinal", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton, bernie sanders,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/brooklyn-feels-bern-sanders-new-headquarters-article-1.2578825", "parsely-title": "Brooklyn feels the Bern outside Sanders' new headquarters", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-26T18:57:09-0400", "sailthru.title": "Brooklyn feels the Bern outside Sanders' new headquarters", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-26T22:57:09", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2578824.1459032607!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/sanders27n-1-web.jpg", "description": "Brooklyn was Bernin\u2019 Saturday as Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign opened a hometown headquarters with a raucous rally.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Brooklyn was Bernin\u2019 Saturday as Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign opened a hometown headquarters with a raucous rally.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Brooklyn was Bernin\u2019 Saturday as Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign opened a hometown headquarters with a raucous rally.", "title": "Brooklyn feels the Bern outside Sanders' new headquarters", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/brooklyn-feels-bern-sanders-new-headquarters-article-1.2578825", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2578824.1459032607!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/sanders27n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "bernie sanders, gowanus, hillary clinton, 2016 election, rafael espinal", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "CHRIS SOMMERFELDT, DENIS SLATTERY", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2578824.1459032607!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/sanders27n-1-web.jpg"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s how we do in Brooklyn, N.Y.\u201dThough the Vermont senator was campaigning in Madison, Wis., the opening of Sanders\u2019 Brooklyn office felt more like a festival than a political event.\nBrooklyn was Bernin\u2019 Saturday as Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign opened a hometown headquarters with a raucous rally, some political canvassing and a good old-fashioned block party.\nOhio State senator Nina Turner speaks at the Bernie Sanders rally in Park Slope, Brooklyn.\nThe one-story red brick structure serving as the Sanders New York HQ seemed a world away from rival Clinton\u2019s 11th-floor national headquarters in Brooklyn Heights.\nIncluding superdelegates \u2014 party officials who can back any candidate \u2014 Clinton has at least 1,692 to Sanders\u2019 958."}
