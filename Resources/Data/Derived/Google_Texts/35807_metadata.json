During the two year grant period, they will increase their tribal capacity to qualify for direct federal funding to operate their own Child and Family Service Centers.\n\nRELATED: Great Plains ICWA Summit Hoping to Address Native Foster Care Concerns\n\nSioux Tribal leaders have long asserted that state-run foster care programs, which tend to place native children in non-native homes, are preventing Lakota children from being reared in an environment where they inherit a strong sense of their personal identity and cultural heritage.\n\n\u201cThe unjust taking of our grandchildren in the Crow Creek community was the focus of the Peabody Award winning radio series on National Public Radio in late 2011,\u201d said former tribal Chairman Brandon Sazue. \u201cWe are ready to implement a permanent solution to this problem that has been going on for 130 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure this historic solution is realized,\u201d said Chase Iron Eyes, a South Dakota counsel for the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project and a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. \u201cThe people best situated to care for our children are our own families and extended family network, which we call Tiospaye.\u201d\n\nVideo of Bring the Lakota Children Home - Chase Iron Eyes\n\n\u201cMy administration is determined to partner with tribes,\u201d Obama said during his speech at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, going on to lend his support to the Lakota\u2019s effort to address long standing economic and social conditions.\n\n\u201cWe want children learning about their language and learning about their culture,\u201d the President said.\n\nIn 2011, National Public Radio published an in-depth investigation into whether the South Dakota Department of Social Services repeatedly violates the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and receives significant federal money in the process.\n\n\u201cThe up to $65 million that\u2019s going to the state of South Dakota should be coming to us so we can keep our families together,\u201d said Chase Iron Eyes during a public meeting in Rapid City, South Dakota, last July.\n\nICWA is federal legislation passed in 1978 that is intended to give Native American tribes a strong voice in child custody issues with an ultimate aim of ensuring tribes rights to maintain and preserve their language and culture.\n\nThe NPR report asserted that nine in 10 native children were being placed by the DSS into non-native homes in South Dakota, prompting tribal officials to formulate ways to divert federal funding away from South Dakota\u2019s social service agencies and transfer it into native foster care systems.\n\nThe planning grant applications are being submitted for funding under the terms of the 2008 Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, commonly referred to as the Baucus Act. The law introduced major changes to the Social Security Act, primarily in Section IV-E, regarding foster care and adoptions assistance payments to the states. One of the major changes made it possible for federally recognized tribes to receive direct IV-E payments to support their own child and welfare programs without state intervention. Previously Section IV-E monies could only be given to state agencies.\n\nThe planning grant program under the Baucus Act can award individual planning grants up to $300,000 and has a total annual budget of $3 million. According to the Tribal Directory of the Bureau of Indian Affairs there are 566 federally recognized tribes. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe received a Baucus planning grant in 2013.\n\nFive Sioux tribes are submitting applications under the Baucus Act this year: Cheyenne River, Crow Creek, Standing Rock, Yankton and Pine Ridge by the June 24, deadline.\n\n\u201cIf we are successful, we can build up our families and help keep our children on the reservation,\u201d said Sam Sully, Secretary of Yankton Tribe Business and Claims Committee. \u201cIt is a big problem, kids are taken off the reservation and it causes a lot of hardships. We have a lot of work to do, and we intend to be successful.\u201d\n\nThe Lakota People's Law Project has provided research support and assisted A Positive Tomorrow, a Native-American advocacy group specializing in these grants to work with the tribal leadership.\n\nA Positive Tomorrow was crucial in preparing the grant applications and issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cThis historic achievement would not have been possible without the tribes\u2019 determination, efficiency, and professionalism, and without the assistance of the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project. I truly hope that Health and Human Services acknowledges the severity of the crisis in South Dakota, and makes the Lakota applications a priority.\u201d\n\nThe Lakota People\u2019s Law Project has been partnering with tribes and leaders in South Dakota since 2005 from its offices in Rapid City, South Dakota, and Santa Cruz, California. LPLP\u2019s activities have included funding and supporting Native experts to provide technical assistance to the tribes on family and child welfare issues. The project combines public interest law, investigation, research, education, and organizing into a unique model for advocacy and social reform.\n\nThe Lakota People's Law Project is sponsored by the non-profit Romero Institute based in Santa Cruz, California. The Institute is named after slain human rights advocate Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador. The Institute seeks to identify and dismantle structural sources of injustice and threats to the survival of our human family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Following a stirring speech by President Obama at the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation, the Lakota Sioux tribes took a historic step forward on Monday in their ongoing str", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/26/5-sioux-tribes-applied-fund-their-own-foster-care-programs-155501", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/chaseironeyes.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "5 Sioux Tribes Applied to Fund Their Own Foster Care Programs"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-26T14:14-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/26/5-sioux-tribes-applied-fund-their-own-foster-care-programs-155501", "dc": {"title": "5 Sioux Tribes Applied to Fund Their Own Foster Care Programs"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "5 Sioux Tribes Applied to Fund Their Own Foster Care Programs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda96b\"", "article_summary": "Five Sioux tribes are submitting applications under the Baucus Act this year: Cheyenne River, Crow Creek, Standing Rock, Yankton and Pine Ridge by the June 24, deadline.\n\u201cThe up to $65 million that\u2019s going to the state of South Dakota should be coming to us so we can keep our families together,\u201d said Chase Iron Eyes during a public meeting in Rapid City, South Dakota, last July.\nThe Lakota People's Law Project is sponsored by the non-profit Romero Institute based in Santa Cruz, California.\nFollowing a stirring speech by President Obama at the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation, the Lakota Sioux tribes took a historic step forward on Monday in their ongoing struggle to end South Dakota\u2019s seizures of their children.\nRELATED: Swept Away: South Dakota's Native Children Denied Due Process in Custody CasesSwept Away, Part 2: Suing South Dakota to Protect Native ChildrenFive Lakota tribes of South Dakota, with expert assistance from A Positive Tomorrow, have submitted Title IVE Applications for Federal Planning Grants to fund the planning of their own foster care programs."}
