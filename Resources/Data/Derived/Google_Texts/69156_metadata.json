The vehicle was transferred through the Department of Defense\u2019s controversial 1033 program, which authorizes the military to donate what it considers surplus military equipment to police and sheriff departments in the United States, including tanks and weapons used in the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThis and other federal programs that flood local law enforcement with weapons of war have fallen under increased scrutiny following the crackdown by heavily armed riot police and military service members on protesters in Ferguson, Missouri opposing the police killing of unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown. Numerous other San Diego police agencies have received weapons from the military, although the MRAP stands out for its high dollar value.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe police department acknowledged that the MRAP is likely to be controversial.\n\n\u201cI can totally see people thinking \u2018Oh, my God. Are they going to be rolling armored vehicles into our schools and what the hell\u2019s going on?'\u201d said Joe Florentino, a captain with the department, to local media. He claimed that the vehicle will be used during situations of emergency to keep kids safe.\n\nBut numerous organizations and institutions have warned that the militarization of U.S. police has dangerous consequences for civilians. An American Civil Liberties Union report released in June details needless deaths and terror at as a result of \u201cunnecessarily and dangerously militarized\u201d policing. \u201cNeighborhoods are not war zones, and our police officers should not be treating us like wartime enemies,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe armored vehicle has already stirred concern in the Unified School District, which serves 132,000 students from preschool to 12th grade. Board Trustee Scott Barnett stated in a press release issued Thursday that the acquisition is a \u201cmisguided priority.\u201d\n\nHowever, Barnett said it was not the excessive arming of the police he was worried about, but rather, what he considers to be the higher priority of replacing old police cruisers. He argued that the vehicle should be leased to nearby police agencies to raise money for upgraded vehicles. The \u201cFerguson controversy,\u201d said Barnett, is likely to make it \u201cmuch more difficult for local police agencies to obtain these vehicles, so we may actually have a hot commodity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police for San Diego city schools have obtained a war-grade armored vehicle from the Department of Defense.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sarah Lazare | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Police for San Diego city schools have obtained a war-grade armored vehicle from the Department of Defense.", "title": "Public School Police Receive Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/public-school-police-receive-mine-resistant-ambush-protected-vehicle/196511/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mrap.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-12T15:48:09-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police for San Diego city schools have obtained a war-grade armored vehicle from the Department of Defense.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mrap.jpg", "title": "Public School Police Receive Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Police", "published_time": "2014-09-13T05:00:24-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-12T15:48:09-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "The $700,000 mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle (MRAP), which is designed to withstand blasts from improvised explosive devices and mines, was given to law enforcement for the Unified School District in April.\nThe armored vehicle has already stirred concern in the Unified School District, which serves 132,000 students from preschool to 12th grade.\nAre they going to be rolling armored vehicles into our schools and what the hell\u2019s going on?\nThe police department for San Diego\u2019s public schools recently revealed that they have acquired a large armored combat vehicle from the U.S. military.\nHe argued that the vehicle should be leased to nearby police agencies to raise money for upgraded vehicles."}
