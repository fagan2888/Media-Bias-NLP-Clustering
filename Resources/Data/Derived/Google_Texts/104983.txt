On Thursday’s edition of “The 700 Club,” televangelist and former GOP presidential candidate Pat Robertson expressed his concern over the way that “the girl-on-girl movies” are supposedly influencing young people to pursue homosexual relationships. When a viewer called in for Robertson’s advice about how best to deal with news that her 21-year-old daughter had begun dating a woman, the host offered some words of wisdom about LGBT millennials.

“I think she needs somebody to help her get her identity straight,” Robertson said. “She may not be right in this, she may have thought she has a crush on some older girl along the way and she’s actually homosexual when she’s not, I don’t know. The whole question of sexual identity has gotten so blurred in the press these days it’s hard to know. Why is she that way? Was she molested when she was younger?”
