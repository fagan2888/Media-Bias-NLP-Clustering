She watched the men in her village skeptically. If they only cared about card games and alcohol, how could marriage improve her life?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in a husband,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThat changed when an acquaintance of her uncle approached her with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The woman could arrange for Kai to travel to China, where there\u2019s an abundance of well-paying factory jobs and, if she was interested, sophisticated, affluent men awaited.\n\nAfter she agreed to go to China \u2014 a place she only knew from TV dramas \u2014 things moved quickly. Within a week, the human traffickers had forged all the necessary documents and brought her to the airport.\n\nIn hindsight, Kai realized that it was too good to be true.\n\nSoon, she had been sold to a Chinese man who physically abused and raped her. She had never met him before, she didn\u2019t speak his language, and she had no clue where she was \u2014 other than that it was somewhere in China.\n\n\u201c[W]hen I didn\u2019t want to sleep with him, when I tried to resist, he grabbed me. He got angry and pushed me on the bed and had sex with me. \u2026 He was very aggressive. He was the first man I slept with, I didn\u2019t have any experience, but I knew that this was not right. It was terrible,\u201d she said.\n\nBesides the daily rapes, the man\u2019s family treated her like a servant and she was held in solitary confinement.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one who was trafficked to southern China that day.\n\n\u201cThere were two other girls, younger than me, who were also at the airport. They cried when they said goodbye to their families. We were all a little bit scared,\u201d Kai remembers.\n\n\u201cI had heard of such stories, where women were trafficked, where they were tricked and then sold. But I though it wouldn\u2019t happen to me,\u201d Kai said.\n\nFor years, local media in Laos and Myanmar, both neighboring China, have reported cases of women who were trafficked to China \u2014 often under the influence of drugs.\n\nChina\u2019s one-child policy, introduced in 1979 to address rapid population growth, has produced a gender imbalance. Male heirs are favored in Chinese culture, and there have been reports of parents aborting female fetuses or even killing baby girls. The British Medical Journal estimated in 2005 that China had produced a surplus of 32 million young men \u2014 about four times the population of New York City.\n\nFor many of these men, looking across China\u2019s borders has become the only option to find a wife.\n\nQuest for a better life\n\nKai and the two women she had traveled with were led to believe that they would find work in China, and possibly marry a suitable Chinese man.\n\nAt the airport, they were picked up by a Cambodian woman and four Chinese who took them to a town that Kai remembers by the name \u201cFuja.\u201d\n\nThey were told to doll themselves up so they\u2019d look pretty for the men who were about to visit the house to pick one of them as a bride. It was then that Kai finally realized that she was being trafficked. There was no lucrative $500-a-month job waiting for her, and it was not up to her to decide who she\u2019d marry.\n\nOne by one, impoverished-looking Chinese men came in to shop for an obedient, Southeast Asian wife who would give them an heir.\n\n\u201cWhen I was sitting there so the Chinese men could look at me, I knew that I had been trafficked. They chose us, and I felt like a prostitute,\u201d she said.\n\nAs soon as she arrived at her new husband\u2019s house, the abuse began.\n\n\u201c[W]hen I didn\u2019t want to sleep with him, when I tried to resist, he grabbed me. He got angry and pushed me on the bed and had sex with me,\u201d Kai said, adding that the same ordeal would take place up to four times a day.\n\nThe United Nations reports that millions of people worldwide are victims of trafficking. This may be a conservative estimate, as most cases are thought never to be reported. The picture of shackled slaves inspected at auctions has changed into a secretive and much more nuanced underground trade worth billions.\n\n\u201cAsia, and in particular Southeast Asia, remains one of the key areas of origin and destination of trafficking in persons,\u201d said Annette Lyth, the UN\u2019s Inter-Agency Program on Human Trafficking\u2019s regional program coordinator.\n\nOverall, about 80 percent of victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced to work in brothels or, like in the case of Kai, sold as brides against their will.\n\nAfter two months, Kai finally managed to get ahold of a phone and called a Cambodian radio station whose phone number she remembered, begging for help.\n\nWithin several days, she was repatriated.\n\nOthers, Cambodian authorities say, are not as lucky. The first cases of trafficking Cambodian brides to China were recorded about two years ago, when families informed human rights organizations that they were looking for their daughters, who had disappeared in China.\n\nEvery month, said Choun Bun Eng, chairwoman of the Cambodian government\u2019s committee to fight human trafficking, police arrest traffickers just before they send women off to China. But the majority slip through.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know why this has risen so much, but we take it seriously,\u201d Choun said.\n\nKai\u2019s traffickers have disappeared and will most likely never be arrested. Of the two women who boarded the plane with her, one has been repatriated, and the second remains missing. Nobody, not even her family, knows what happened to her.\n\nBack at her home in Cambodia, Kai said that tending after her small plot of land and the handful of chickens now makes her feel content.\n\n\u201cIn a way, I was lucky,\u201d she said.\n\n(Kuch Naren contributed reporting.)\n\nThis article was published by Global Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here\u2019s one Cambodian woman\u2019s ordeal as a trafficked wife.', China, one child policy, souse trade,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Denise Hruby", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Here\u2019s one Cambodian woman\u2019s ordeal as a trafficked wife.', China, one child policy, souse trade,", "title": "Because Of China's Preference For Baby Boys, Some Men Now Buy \u2018Wives\u2019 From Abroad", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/chinas-preference-baby-boys-men-now-buy-wives-abroad/190892/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cambodia_china_trafficking_wives.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-16T07:51:27-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here\u2019s one Cambodian woman\u2019s ordeal as a trafficked wife.', China, one child policy, souse trade,", "title": "Because Of China's Preference For Baby Boys, Some Men Now Buy \u2018Wives\u2019 From Abroad", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cambodia_china_trafficking_wives.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "souse trade", "published_time": "2014-05-17T05:00:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T07:51:27-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bd8\"", "article_summary": "Because Of China\u2019s Preference For Baby Boys, Some Men Now Buy \u2018Wives\u2019 From AbroadHere\u2019s one Cambodian woman\u2019s ordeal as a trafficked wife.'\nOne by one, impoverished-looking Chinese men came in to shop for an obedient, Southeast Asian wife who would give them an heir.\n\u201cWhen I was sitting there so the Chinese men could look at me, I knew that I had been trafficked.\nFor many of these men, looking across China\u2019s borders has become the only option to find a wife.\n\u201cI had heard of such stories, where women were trafficked, where they were tricked and then sold."}
