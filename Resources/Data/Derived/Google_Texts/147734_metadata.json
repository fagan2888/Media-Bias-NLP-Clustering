They state that the inclusion of the coverage had not been disclosed to employers, but was rather \u201cencrypted in health insurance contracts under the rubric of \u2018medically necessary\u2019 surgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe imposition of this undisclosed abortion mandate, without any prior public or contractual notice, result[ed] in plaintiffs unwittingly and currently providing and affirmatively funding objectionable abortion coverage by the payment of premiums and co-pays contrary to their sincerely held moral and religious beliefs,\u201d the complaint outlines.\n\nThe groups not only state that the mandate violates their religious liberty and freedom of conscience, but also that the Department lacked the authority to institute the requirement. No law or regulation had been passed requiring the coverage.\n\nConnect with Christian News\n\n\n\nFollow @4christiannews\n\n\n\nThe suit was filed on May 4 in the New York State Supreme Court. Defendants in the case include Capital District Physicians Health Plan, Blue Shield of Northeastern New York, UnitedHealthcare of New York, MVP Health Care, Excellus Health Plan, and the Independent Health Association.\n\nThe Department of Financial Services has not yet commented on the legal challenge, other than stating that it is reviewing the filed complaint.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Supreme Court sent litigation surrounding the Obamacare abortion pill mandate, filed by the \u201cLittle Sisters of the Poor\u201d and other religious organizations, back to the lower courts after failing to reach a majority opinion in the matter.\n\n\u201cThankfully, even with a 4-4 court, we got some good news from the Supreme Court yesterday when it sent them packing and sent the case back to the lower courts. Thank God that has happened,\u201d House Speak Paul Ryan told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cClearly the court does not believe that the government has done a good enough job protecting religious liberty. That much is clear.\u201d\n\nSome were disappointed, however, with the 4-4 outcome.\n\n\u201cJust sending it to the lower courts and saying, \u2018figure it out,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t sound like a responsible action by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d opined Rep.
