“Game of Thrones” author George R.R. Martin does his writing on a processing system from the 1980s. Given the success of his novels, and wildly popular HBO show adaptation, I don’t think it’s hurt him.

It is, however, a fascinating thought. With cutting-edge technology rolling out by the minute, why revert to using WordStar 4.0 on a DOS word processor?

Last night on “Conan” Martin explained his word processing choices. “I have a secret weapon,” Martin says. “I actually have two computers.”

“I have a computer I browse the Internet with and I get my email on, and I do my taxes on,” Martin continues. “And then I have my writing computer, which is a DOS machine, not connected to the Internet. I use WordStar 4.0 as my word processing system.”

His reasoning for this is to simplify the process. WordStar 4.0 boils down the word processing components to a degree Martin prefers.
