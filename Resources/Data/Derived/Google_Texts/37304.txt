Native actor Jeff Barehand (recently seen on Z Nation) and his son have teamed up and made a #CrashtheSuperbowl Doritos ad entitled Drone Wars. In the ad, the Barehand duo battle wits on a fishing trip to see who can best satisfy their craving for Doritos. If Barehand makes it to the three semi-finalists he would get a private seat at the Superbowl. If he wins, he gets a million bucks.

According to the Doritos website, the submission process is closed and the public can now vote for their favorites by visiting the website and rating a video with 1 to 5 stars.

After the initial voting process, 50 semifinalist will be selected and three finalists will be chosen. The official voting begins January 5, 2016. Voters can vote once per day per device.
