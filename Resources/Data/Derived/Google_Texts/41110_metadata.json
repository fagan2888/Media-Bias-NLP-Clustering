So it\u2019s kind of hard to understand what was too controversial here, and I pride myself on being really good at being upset at things that do not seem to upset other people. Was it calling misogynists babies? The blunt articulation of what misogynistic threats actually sound like? (\u201cI\u2019ll probably feel better if I tell a feminist she should be raped\u201d made me sigh in a very knowing way.) The fact that it treats its material fairly seriously other than making the characters infants who say \u201cWaaaah\u201d a lot? Piss jokes?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Kupperman tells Salon: It \"blew my mind\" that the Times wouldn't publish his and David Rees' latest comic", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Michael Kupperman tells Salon: It \"blew my mind\" that the Times wouldn't publish his and David Rees' latest comic", "title": "This is the #YesAllWomen comic the New York Times wouldn\u2019t publish", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/this_is_the_yesallwomen_comic_the_new_york_times_wouldnt_publish/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/kupperman_comic.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michael Kupperman tells Salon: It \"blew my mind\" that the Times wouldn't publish his and David Rees' latest comic", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/kupperman_comic.jpg", "title": "This is the #YesAllWomen comic the New York Times wouldn\u2019t publish", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "This is the #YesAllWomen comic the New York Times wouldn\u2019t publish", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #yesallwomen, david rees, michael kupperman, Misogyny, New York Times, Violence Against Women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98e1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: #yesallwomen, david rees, michael kupperman, Misogyny, New York Times, Violence Against Women, Life News, News, Politics NewsDavid Rees and Michael Kupperman do a regular comic for the New York Times\u2019 Week in Review, but the paper refused to run their take on #YesAllWomen because the material was deemed \u201ctoo sensitive.\u201d The issues addressed?\nHere\u2019s the comic, shared with permission from Kupperman (click to enlarge):Kupperman told Salon over email that he was genuinely shocked that the comic was rejected.\nThe fact that it treats its material fairly seriously other than making the characters infants who say \u201cWaaaah\u201d a lot?\n(\u201cI\u2019ll probably feel better if I tell a feminist she should be raped\u201d made me sigh in a very knowing way.)\nMen\u2019s rights activists, infantile misogyny, Internet harassment and pissing in your pants."}
