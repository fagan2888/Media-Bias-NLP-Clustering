This is true not only on domestic issues, such as immigration and Obamacare, but now in foreign and defense policy, too. Checking Obama\u2019s misuse of his foreign-affairs powers should be a top priority for the new Republican majorities in Congress.\n\nObama\u2019s worldview demands major departures from traditional American foreign policy and threatens to use international agreements to transform domestic policy. For example, as part of his crusade against global warming, Obama signed an amorphous agreement with China last month, ostensibly committing the parties to limit carbon emissions. The president will surely invoke it as a legal basis for sweeping executive orders on climate change. Similarly, now that the president has signed the Arms Trade Treaty (which has no chance of Senate ratification), he may attempt to limit firearms sales through executive action.\n\nOverseas, Obama desperately wants a face-saving deal with Iran that will give him a diplomatic success without legislative constraints and let him leave office without Iranian development of a nuclear weapon. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t seek congressional legislation in any comprehensive agreement for years,\u201d one senior administration official leaked about the Iranian negotiations. Only Iran\u2019s intransigence in pursuit of an even better deal has forced an extension of negotiations from November 24 to next summer.\n\nThese assertions of unilateral executive power raise constitutional conflicts of the first order. Congress must first ask whether any of Obama\u2019s agreements include obligations sufficiently grave to amount to a treaty under the Constitution \u2014 or, alternatively, whether these potential deals flow from the president\u2019s legitimate constitutional authority in foreign affairs, and thus need not be embodied in treaties.\n\nIf, as some reports indicate, the administration has pledged not to use military force against Iran in exchange for a halt to its nuclear-weapons program, such a commitment would almost certainly require Senate ratification. The West cannot rely on Iran\u2019s promises to confine itself to a civilian nuclear program, but if such an agreement were adopted, Tehran would know that Obama would not resort to military force, and Iran\u2019s nukes would dramatically reshape the regional balance of power in its favor.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats should agree on one thing when it comes to military force: An international agreement\u2019s renunciation of the use of American force manifestly limits U.S. sovereignty, with enormous effects on national security. Obama\u2019s move on Iran may well violate Article II of the Constitution, which declares that the president \u201cshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties,\u201d but only if \u201ctwo thirds of the Senators present concur.\u201d Article II\u2019s plain meaning and history requires that any agreement that restricts the nation\u2019s sovereignty must undergo Senate approval by a two-thirds supermajority.\n\nA history of bipartisan agreement supports this view. \u201cWith the exception of the SALT I agreement, every significant arms control agreement during the past three decades has been transmitted to the Senate pursuant to the Treaty Clause of the Constitution,\u201d Senators Joe Biden and Jesse Helms declared about the Bush administration\u2019s 2002 nuclear-arms-reduction deal with Russia. This unlikely duo agreed that President Bush had to submit the deal as a treaty: \u201cNo constitutional alternative exists to transmittal of the concluded agreement to the Senate for its advice and consent.\u201d Senators of both parties should again join together to stop an assault on the separation of powers.\n\nAs advisers to President Bush at the time, we supported vigorous executive authority to protect our national security after the 9/11 attacks. We approved measures that included U.S. withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. When Bush proposed the 2002 agreement with Russia, he agreed with Biden and Helms that it should undergo the Constitution\u2019s treaty process. Even though Bush was urged to resort to a scheme of mutual reductions without any formal treaty, he wisely placed constitutional text and historical practice first.\n\nBush\u2019s logic remains valid today. The Constitution requires that treaties win supermajorities to guarantee that they are backed by the highest levels of political consensus and that (in the words of Federalist No. 1) we have \u201cgood government from reflection and choice\u201d rather than bad government from \u201caccident and force.\u201d Article II\u2019s supermajority process checks presidents who are tempted to bargain away national sovereignty for political advantage or short-term gain.\n\nWhite House claims that an Iran deal does not amount to a treaty ring false. The administration has argued that the agreement would involve multiple parties \u2014 not just Iran and the United States, but also the Europeans and others who have sanctioned Iran. The inclusion of many parties, however, has nothing to do with a treaty\u2019s status: Multilateral agreements, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, have undergone Senate approval. Other reports point out that the Iran agreement may have a sunset date, but an expiration date has not previously denied an international deal the status of a treaty.\n\nWe concede that no \u201cred line\u201d unambiguously divides agreements that require Senate ratification from those that do not. Presidents have long made \u201csole-executive agreements\u201d that involve areas within the executive\u2019s exclusive competence, such as diplomatic negotiations, political support, and the recognition of governments. Some pacts \u2014 most prominently trade agreements, such as the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement and the 1996 ministerial declaration of the World Trade Organization \u2014 have undergone approval by majority vote of both houses of Congress. These \u201ccongressional\u2013executive\u201d agreements first came into frequent use during the New Deal years. Along with the sole-executive agreement, they have swamped treaties. Between 1939 and 1989, for example, the U.S. entered into 11,698 executive and congressional\u2013executive agreements, but only 702 Article II treaties that underwent the supermajority-approval process in the Senate.\n\nSole-executive agreements can only relay a promise by the current occupant of the Oval Office about the exercise of his own powers. The Constitution vests the president with authority as commander-in-chief to make decisions beginning and ending the use of military force. So, for example, an agreement that halted Tehran\u2019s nuclear-weapons program but imposed no similar obligation on the United States likely would not be a treaty.\n\nThere is some precedent for such agreements. The \u201cBrussels agreements\u201d of the mid 1990s, which formalized the return of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to Russia, did not require congressional consent, although the U.S. was a signatory. The Agreed Framework with North Korea, which sought to halt Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear-weapons program, also did not undergo Senate review. Even the Proliferation Security Initiative, which coordinated efforts to stop shipments of technology that could be used in weapons of mass destruction, did not take the status of a treaty. None of these agreements required the United States to promise weapons reductions or refrain from the use of force. If the Iranian deal contains no promise against a future American attack and merely \u201crequires\u201d Iran to renounce weaponization, it could take the form of an executive agreement.\n\nBut agreements that extend beyond a president\u2019s time in office or make long-term commitments of U.S. sovereignty must undergo the Article II treaty process. An enduring non-aggression pact, or even a unilateral commitment not to use American force on a lasting basis, demands the participation of other branches of government. Together with ending economic sanctions (which Iran will demand), these commitments would work a significant change in the U.S.\u2013Iran relationship that is tantamount to a peace treaty. Peace agreements should receive Senate approval. Only the cooperation of the executive and legislative branches of government over time can ensure that the U.S. will live up to restrictions on its sovereignty.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama\u2019s efforts to tie the United States to a feckless global-warming agreement with China test other parts of the international-agreement rules. The president cannot commit the nation to environmental standards on his own, because only Congress has the constitutional power to control interstate and international commerce (under which heading the federal government regulates the environment). International executive agreements cannot expand the president\u2019s authority, which was delegated by Congress under the Clean Air Act, to issue regulations on global warming. Such a sweeping change in U.S. domestic law would require Congress to pass a new statute, as the Clinton administration and Congress did to implement the NAFTA and WTO agreements. At the very least, the China climate deal should be approved by majorities of both houses of Congress, if not by two-thirds of the Senate.\n\nObama would justify executive action under the Arms Trade Treaty in the guise of respecting a treaty\u2019s objectives while waiting for the Senate to ratify it. Parts of the treaty nonetheless would violate the Second Amendment and should not survive the ratification process. For Obama to use that excuse in this case to act without congressional authorization would be even more lawless than his controversial immigration orders.\n\nWhether the Iranian or Chinese deals constitute formal treaties or not, and considering the unratified status of the Arms Trade Treaty, Congress should use the tools that the Constitution provides to protect its political influence in foreign affairs. First, Congress can use its exclusive authority over foreign commerce to impose permanent sanctions on Iran. Congress could scuttle an Iranian agreement simply by making sanctions mandatory, without any possibility of a presidential waiver. Obama may still desperately seek an agreement, but Iran won\u2019t sign if the sanctions continue. Similar creative legislative steps (although obviously subject to a potential presidential veto) could be taken to frustrate the China climate agreement or any executive action on gun control.\n\nSecond, Congress can make clear that any agreement made by Obama alone binds only him. If Obama attempts to lift the Iran sanctions pursuant merely to a sole-executive agreement, Congress should provide by law that any sanctions will automatically revive on January 20, 2017. Congress could also make this clear by appropriating funds for new military forces earmarked for the Persian Gulf region. These would powerfully signal that while Iran\u2019s behavior may find favor in the Obama White House, it meets with the opposite reaction from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Whether Iran would agree to a deal in such circumstances is highly doubtful.\n\nA sole-executive agreement (which is what the Iranian deal would become) represents a promise that a president will exercise his powers in a certain way. A unilateral agreement with Iran can promise only that the United States will not attack and will lift sanctions for as long as Obama remains president. Obama\u2019s successor is free to rip up the Iranian deal on his or her first day in office. Iran can feel confident of long-term economic relief only if the president lifts sanctions now and then Congress agrees to repeal them permanently.\n\nWhatever the status of these and other international agreements, there is much to be said for seeking congressional assent to significant and risky policies. President Obama has yet to understand, as President George W. Bush did, that winning congressional support in war and peace can strengthen his hand abroad. It is rare that a policy can achieve so many benefits at once. Submitting the Iranian and Chinese agreements, or gun-control legislation, to Congress would ensure a broad consensus that the measures advance American national interests. This would promote bipartisan cooperation, subject crucial foreign policies to legislative review, and restore the proper constitutional balance over treaties. Congress\u2019s approval ensures that if these deals truly advance the cause of peace, they will be long-lasting.\n\n\u2014 John R.

Together with ending economic sanctions (which Iran will demand), these commitments would work a significant change in the U.S.\u2013Iran relationship that is tantamount to a peace treaty. Peace agreements should receive Senate approval. Only the cooperation of the executive and legislative branches of government over time can ensure that the U.S. will live up to restrictions on its sovereignty.\n\n#page#Meanwhile, Obama\u2019s efforts to tie the United States to a feckless global-warming agreement with China test other parts of the international-agreement rules. The president cannot commit the nation to environmental standards on his own, because only Congress has the constitutional power to control interstate and international commerce (under which heading the federal government regulates the environment). International executive agreements cannot expand the president\u2019s authority, which was delegated by Congress under the Clean Air Act, to issue regulations on global warming. Such a sweeping change in U.S. domestic law would require Congress to pass a new statute, as the Clinton administration and Congress did to implement the NAFTA and WTO agreements. At the very least, the China climate deal should be approved by majorities of both houses of Congress, if not by two-thirds of the Senate.\n\n#ad#Obama would justify executive action under the Arms Trade Treaty in the guise of respecting a treaty\u2019s objectives while waiting for the Senate to ratify it. Parts of the treaty nonetheless would violate the Second Amendment and should not survive the ratification process. For Obama to use that excuse in this case to act without congressional authorization would be even more lawless than his controversial immigration orders.\n\nWhether\u00a0the Iranian or Chinese deals constitute formal treaties or not, and considering the\u00a0unratified\u00a0status of the Arms Trade Treaty, Congress should use the tools that the Constitution provides to protect its political influence in foreign affairs. First, Congress can use its exclusive authority over foreign commerce to impose permanent sanctions on Iran. Congress could scuttle an Iranian agreement simply by making sanctions mandatory, without any possibility of a presidential waiver. Obama may still desperately seek an agreement, but Iran won\u2019t sign if the sanctions continue. Similar creative legislative steps (although obviously subject to a potential presidential veto) could be taken to frustrate the China climate agreement or any executive action on gun control.\n\nSecond, Congress can make clear that any agreement made by Obama alone binds only him. If Obama attempts to lift the Iran sanctions pursuant merely to a sole-executive agreement, Congress should provide by law that any sanctions will automatically revive on January 20, 2017. Congress could also make this clear by appropriating funds for new military forces earmarked for the Persian Gulf region. These would powerfully signal that while Iran\u2019s behavior may find favor in the Obama White House, it meets with the opposite reaction from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Whether Iran would agree to a deal in such circumstances is highly doubtful.\n\nA sole-executive agreement (which is what the Iranian deal would become) represents a promise that a president will exercise his powers in a certain way. A unilateral agreement with Iran can promise only that the United States will not attack and will lift sanctions for as long as Obama remains president. Obama\u2019s successor is free to rip up the Iranian deal on his or her first day in office. Iran can feel confident of long-term economic relief only if the president lifts sanctions now and then Congress agrees to repeal them permanently.\n\nWhatever the status of these and other international agreements, there is much to be said for seeking congressional assent to significant and risky policies. President Obama has yet to understand, as President George W. Bush did, that winning congressional support in war and peace can strengthen his hand abroad. It is rare that a policy can achieve so many benefits at once. Submitting the Iranian and Chinese agreements, or gun-control legislation, to Congress would ensure a broad consensus that the measures advance American national interests. This would promote bipartisan cooperation, subject crucial foreign policies to legislative review, and restore the proper constitutional balance over treaties. Congress\u2019s approval ensures that if these deals truly advance the cause of peace, they will be long-lasting.\n\n\u2014 John R.

This is true not only on domestic issues, such as immigration and\u00a0Obamacare, but now in foreign and defense policy, too. Checking Obama\u2019s misuse of his foreign-affairs powers should be a top priority for the new Republican majorities in Congress.\n\nObama\u2019s worldview demands major departures from traditional American foreign policy and threatens to use international agreements to transform domestic policy. For example, as part of his crusade against global warming, Obama signed an amorphous agreement with China last month, ostensibly committing the parties to limit carbon emissions. The president will surely invoke it as a legal basis for sweeping executive orders on climate change. Similarly, now that the president has signed the Arms Trade Treaty (which has no chance of Senate ratification), he may attempt to limit firearms sales through executive action.\n\n#ad#Overseas, Obama desperately wants a face-saving deal with Iran that will give him a diplomatic success without legislative constraints and let him leave office without Iranian development of a nuclear weapon. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t seek congressional legislation in any comprehensive agreement for years,\u201d one senior administration official leaked about the Iranian negotiations. Only Iran\u2019s intransigence in pursuit of an even better deal has forced an extension of negotiations from November 24 to next summer.\n\nThese assertions of unilateral executive power raise constitutional conflicts of the first order. Congress must first ask whether any of Obama\u2019s agreements include obligations sufficiently grave to amount to a treaty under the Constitution \u2014 or, alternatively, whether these potential deals flow from the president\u2019s legitimate constitutional authority in foreign affairs, and thus need not be embodied in treaties.\n\nIf, as some reports indicate, the administration has pledged not to use military force against Iran in exchange for a halt to its nuclear-weapons program, such a commitment would almost certainly require Senate ratification. The West cannot rely on Iran\u2019s promises to confine itself to a civilian nuclear program, but if such an agreement were adopted, Tehran would know that Obama would not resort to military force, and Iran\u2019s nukes would dramatically reshape the regional balance of power in its favor.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats should agree on one thing when it comes to military force: An international agreement\u2019s renunciation of the use of American force manifestly limits U.S. sovereignty, with enormous effects on national security. Obama\u2019s move on Iran may well violate Article II of the Constitution, which declares that the president \u201cshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties,\u201d but only if \u201ctwo thirds of the Senators present concur.\u201d Article II\u2019s plain meaning and history requires that any agreement that restricts the nation\u2019s sovereignty must undergo Senate approval by a two-thirds\u00a0supermajority.\n\nA history of bipartisan agreement supports this view. \u201cWith the exception of the SALT I agreement, every significant arms control agreement during the past three decades has been transmitted to the Senate pursuant to the Treaty Clause of the Constitution,\u201d Senators Joe Biden and Jesse Helms declared about the Bush administration\u2019s 2002 nuclear-arms-reduction deal with Russia. This unlikely duo agreed that President Bush had to submit the deal as a treaty: \u201cNo constitutional alternative exists to transmittal of the concluded agreement to the Senate for its advice and consent.\u201d Senators of both parties should again join together to stop an assault on the separation of powers.\n\n#page#As advisers to President Bush at the time, we supported vigorous executive authority to protect our national security after the 9/11 attacks. We approved measures that included U.S. withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. When Bush proposed the 2002 agreement with Russia, he agreed with Biden and Helms that it should undergo the Constitution\u2019s treaty process. Even though Bush was urged to resort to a scheme of mutual reductions without any formal treaty, he wisely placed constitutional text and historical practice first.\n\nBush\u2019s logic remains valid today. The Constitution requires that treaties win\u00a0supermajorities\u00a0to guarantee that they are backed by the highest levels of political consensus and that (in the words of\u00a0Federalist\u00a0No. 1) we have \u201cgood government from reflection and choice\u201d rather than bad government from \u201caccident and force.\u201d Article II\u2019s\u00a0supermajority\u00a0process checks presidents who are tempted to bargain away national sovereignty for political advantage or short-term gain.\n\n#ad#White House claims that an Iran deal does not amount to a treaty ring false. The administration has argued that the agreement would involve multiple parties \u2014 not just Iran and the United States, but also the Europeans and others who have sanctioned Iran. The inclusion of many parties, however, has nothing to do with a treaty\u2019s status: Multilateral agreements, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, have undergone Senate approval. Other reports point out that the Iran agreement may have a sunset date, but an expiration date has not previously denied an international deal the status of a treaty.\n\nWe concede that no \u201cred line\u201d unambiguously divides agreements that require Senate ratification from those that do not. Presidents have long made \u201csole-executive agreements\u201d that involve areas within the executive\u2019s exclusive competence, such as diplomatic negotiations, political support, and the recognition of governments. Some pacts \u2014 most prominently trade agreements, such as the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement and the 1996 ministerial declaration of the World Trade Organization \u2014 have undergone approval by majority vote of both houses of Congress. These \u201ccongressional\u2013executive\u201d agreements first came into frequent use during the New Deal years. Along with the sole-executive agreement, they have swamped treaties. Between 1939 and 1989, for example, the U.S. entered into 11,698 executive and congressional\u2013executive agreements, but only 702 Article II treaties that underwent the\u00a0supermajority-approval\u00a0process in the Senate.\n\nSole-executive agreements can only relay a promise by the current occupant of the Oval Office about the exercise of his own powers. The Constitution vests the president with authority as commander-in-chief to make decisions beginning and ending the use of military force. So, for example, an agreement that halted Tehran\u2019s nuclear-weapons program but imposed no similar obligation on the United States likely would not be a treaty.\n\nThere is some precedent for such agreements. The \u201cBrussels agreements\u201d of the mid\u00a01990s, which formalized the return of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to Russia, did not require congressional consent, although the U.S. was a signatory. The Agreed Framework with North Korea, which sought to halt Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear-weapons program, also did not undergo Senate review. Even the Proliferation Security Initiative, which coordinated efforts to stop shipments of technology that could be used in weapons of mass destruction, did not take the status of a treaty. None of these agreements required the United States to promise weapons reductions or refrain from the use of force. If the Iranian deal contains no promise against a future American attack and merely \u201crequires\u201d Iran to renounce\u00a0weaponization, it could take the form of an executive agreement.\n\nBut agreements that extend beyond a president\u2019s time in office or make long-term commitments of U.S. sovereignty must undergo the Article II treaty process. An enduring non-aggression pact, or even a unilateral commitment not to use American force on a lasting basis, demands the participation of other branches of government.
