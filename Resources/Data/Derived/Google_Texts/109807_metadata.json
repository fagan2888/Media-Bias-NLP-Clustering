It is possible that some other cities have not reached Shenzhen's standards of management. Now that Shenzhen has this problem, you can't rule out a lot of other places having such risks,\" Fan said.\n\nShenzhen is supposed to be a model, modern city for China. Once a quiet fishing village, it was chosen by Beijing three decades ago to help pioneer landmark economic reforms, and it has boomed ever since.\n\nThe waste site that collapsed on the industrial estate was only supposed to have had a lifespan of around a year and should have stopped operating in February this year, according to the Shenzhen government's online news portal.\n\nBut workers said it continued to take waste mud, the report added.\n\nShenzhen media has reported several times in the past few years that companies were illegally dumping construction waste as the legal dumps were all full.\n\nThe Shenzhen government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother local newspaper, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Daily, said companies were becoming so desperate that even old ponds once use to farm fish were being filled by building waste, though low-lying land and mountain hollows were preferred.\n\nSuch dump sites were often forced through despite opposition by residents, media reports said. Environmental impact assessments were likely skipped, they said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Over a year ago, a government-run newspaper warned that a boomtown", "title": "China's Shenzhen warned of waste problem a year before disaster", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/21/Chinas-Shenzhen-warned-waste-problem-year-disaster", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-landslide_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/21/Chinas-Shenzhen-warned-waste-problem-year-disaster", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-landslide_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Over a year ago, a government-run newspaper warned that a boomtown", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9849\"", "article_summary": "But workers said it continued to take waste mud, the report added.\n\"Shenzhen has 12 waste sites and they can only hold out until next year (2015),\" the newspaper said.\nBesides new buildings, a network of subway lines is being built in Shenzhen, and mounds of earth are being excavated and dumped at waste sites.\nNow that Shenzhen has this problem, you can't rule out a lot of other places having such risks,\" Fan said.\nShenzhen media has reported several times in the past few years that companies were illegally dumping construction waste as the legal dumps were all full."}
