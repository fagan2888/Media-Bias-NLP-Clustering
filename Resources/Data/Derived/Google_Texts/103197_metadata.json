A candidate has to earn my vote. And thus far, Donald Trump has not.\u201d\n\nTrump is the likely Republican nominee for president, after trouncing Cruz Tuesday in Indiana's primary.\n\nWagner has been critical of various comments made by Trump in recent months, especially his remarks criticizing Senator John McCain for being a prisoner of war during the Vietnam conflict. In response, she had donated $1,000 that she earlier had received from Trump to the Ballwin VFW chapter.\n\nWagner is a former co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party. Her public refusal to get behind Trump, for now, signals that it may be tough for national Republicans to achieve unity.\n\nEven if Cruz isn't campaigning, his Missouri allies aren't ready to jump ship. \u201cThe fight for liberty is still alive,\u2019\u2019 said Carl Bearden, co-chair of Cruz\u2019s Missouri operation.\n\nMissouri Republican Party chairman John Hancock has a different task \u2013 cooling any tensions between the Trump and Cruz activists before the presidential convention in Cleveland. \u201cWhat we know about wounds and Republicans is that sometimes they heal, and sometimes they don\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 Hancock said.\n\nBesides Wagner, Cruz's major Missouri supporters include state Sen. Bob Onder, R- Lake St. Louis. Trump had few prominent backers in the state, even though he won Missouri\u2019s March 15 presidential primary.\n\nLast Saturday, some tempers flared when the Cruz activists succeeded at the congressional-district conventions in getting their supporters elected as Trump delegates. That move angered Trump allies who had counted on their own people filling the slots.\n\nCruz's Missouri camp is still hoping to install more of its supporters as delegates when the remaining 25 slots are filled May 21 at the state GOP convention in Branson. Hancock is trying to assemble a \"unity slate'' that can appease the Trump and Cruz forces.\n\nThe pro-Cruz delegates committed to Trump will be required to vote for Trump on the first ballot. With no other official GOP opponents, Trump is expected to capture the nomination on that first ballot.\n\nStill, Bearden emphasized that Cruz\u2019s 565 committed delegates, including 17 in Missouri, will remain committed to Cruz, despite his decision to bow out.\n\nThat\u2019s true of many of the other former GOP contenders, who officially \u201csuspended\u2019\u2019 their campaigns, rather than outright quitting, to maintain control of their delegates.\n\nBearden observed, \u201cA lot of us here were surprised\u201d by Cruz\u2019s decision Tuesday night, after losing to Trump in Indiana\u2019s Republican primary.\n\nBut the aim of Cruz allies now, said Bearden, will be on \u201caffecting and impacting\u2019\u2019 the platforms approved at the state and national conventions.\n\nParty platforms are primarily a series of stances that the party activists embrace and that its candidates are encouraged to adhere to.\n\nThe Missouri GOP\u2019s 15-page recommended platform, for example, calls for \u201creducing government regulations,\u2019\u2019 the approval of a balanced budget amendment to the national Constitution, eliminating Obamacare, and overturning the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing most abortions.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Just days after Ted Cruz\u2019s Missouri backers scored local victories over Donald Trump, the Cruz camp is mulling its next move now that Cruz has dropped out", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/wagner-declining-endorse-trump-missouri-cruz-backers-shift-focus", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201603/SLP2016031103.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Just days after Ted Cruz\u2019s Missouri backers scored local victories over Donald Trump, the Cruz camp is mulling its next move now that Cruz has dropped out", "title": "Wagner is declining to endorse Trump, as Missouri Cruz backers shift focus"}, "story_id": 476791364, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Wagner is declining to endorse Trump, as Missouri Cruz backers shift focus"}, "nid": 52429, "datePublished": "2016-05-04", "keywords": "Ted  Cruz, Donald Trump, Election 2016, Missouri Republican Party, Top Stories", "wordCount": 618, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Wagner is a former co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party.\nBesides Wagner, Cruz's major Missouri supporters include state Sen.
