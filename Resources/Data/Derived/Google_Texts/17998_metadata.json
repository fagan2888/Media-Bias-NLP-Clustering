Republican state lawmakers inserted last-minute language into Virginia's two-year budget in June to block McAuliffe's proposed expansion to cover 400,000 uninsured Virginians.\n\nMcAuliffe had contended that accepting $2 billion in federal funds to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would create jobs, raise state salaries and bolster pensions.\n\nRepublican lawmakers opted not to accept the funds.
