Perhaps this might be a little bit of both. The NSA collected data on six potential targets about their online porn habits as a way to undermine their credibility, according to a new document leaked from the Edward Snowden cache. But were these efforts limited to legitimate counter-terrorism targets?\n\nThe National Security Agency has been gathering records of online sexual activity and evidence of visits to pornographic websites as part of a proposed plan to harm the reputations of those whom the agency believes are radicalizing others through incendiary speeches, according to a top-secret NSA document. The document, provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, identifies six targets, all Muslims, as \u201cexemplars\u201d of how \u201cpersonal vulnerabilities\u201d can be learned through electronic surveillance, and then exploited to undermine a target\u2019s credibility, reputation and authority. The NSA document, dated Oct. 3, 2012, repeatedly refers to the power of charges of hypocrisy to undermine such a messenger. \u201cA previous SIGINT\u201d \u2014 or signals intelligence, the interception of communications \u2014 \u201cassessment report on radicalization indicated that radicalizers appear to be particularly vulnerable in the area of authority when their private and public behaviors are not consistent,\u201d the document argues. Among the vulnerabilities listed by the NSA that can be effectively exploited are \u201cviewing sexually explicit material online\u201d and \u201cusing sexually explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young girls.\u201d\n\nActually, a better question might be if any of them are legitimate counter-terrorism targets. The NSA admits that none of them are accused \u2014 so far \u2014 of terrorist activities, and that at least one of them qualifies as a \u201cUS person.\u201d That status requires a much higher degree of scrutiny for surveillance, but no explanation appears in the story to say whether NSA provided that or not.\n\nOne former NSA official defended the program by pointing out that discrediting terrorist leaders by exposing (so to speak) their hypocrisy is a lot cleaner than drone-bombing them:\n\nStewart Baker, a one-time general counsel for the NSA and a top Homeland Security official in the Bush administration, said that the idea of using potentially embarrassing information to undermine targets is a sound one. \u201cIf people are engaged in trying to recruit folks to kill Americans and we can discredit them, we ought to,\u201d said Baker. \u201cOn the whole, it\u2019s fairer and maybe more humane\u201d than bombing a target, he said, describing the tactic as \u201cdropping the truth on them.\u201d \u2026 According to the document, the NSA believes that exploiting electronic surveillance to publicly reveal online sexual activities can make it harder for these \u201cradicalizers\u201d to maintain their credibility. \u201cFocusing on access reveals potential vulnerabilities that could be even more effectively exploited when used in combination with vulnerabilities of character or credibility, or both, of the message in order to shape the perception of the messenger as well as that of his followers,\u201d the document argues.\n\nWell, that\u2019s possibly true, but it seems largely theoretical. That argument ignores the fact that American intelligence is probably not going to carry a lot of weight with these targets\u2019 audiences, even if the data showed the men patronizing JDate.com or something. Radicals would claim that the US falsified the data, and while it might put a few lingering doubts in the minds of some, most will just end up scoffing.\n\nBesides, the NSA isn\u2019t exactly hitting pay dirt here:\n\nOne target\u2019s offending argument is that \u201cNon-Muslims are a threat to Islam,\u201d and a vulnerability listed against him is \u201conline promiscuity.\u201d Another target, a foreign citizen the NSA describes as a \u201crespected academic,\u201d holds the offending view that \u201coffensive jihad is justified,\u201d and his vulnerabilities are listed as \u201conline promiscuity\u201d and \u201cpublishes articles without checking facts.\u201d A third targeted radical is described as a \u201cwell-known media celebrity\u201d based in the Middle East who argues that \u201cthe U.S perpetrated the 9/11 attack.\u201d Under vulnerabilities, he is said to lead \u201ca glamorous lifestyle.\u201d A fourth target, who argues that \u201cthe U.S. brought the 9/11 attacks on itself\u201d is said to be vulnerable to accusations of \u201cdeceitful use of funds.\u201d The document expresses the hope that revealing damaging information about the individuals could undermine their perceived \u201cdevotion to the jihadist cause.\u201d\n\nOh, my! A celebrity lives a glamorous lifestyle! An academic publishes articles without checking facts! So \u2026 he\u2019s basically the New York Times. I kid, I kid \u2026.\n\nThe issue here isn\u2019t so much that the NSA tracks the online activities of foreign radicals suspected of involvement in terrorism, although perhaps it should be that they have so little to show for it. The issue is that the mechanisms in the hands of the NSA could easily be turned against other \u201cUS persons\u201d for the exact same purpose the NSA expresses in their document but aimed at political activists here at home. I\u2019m not saying that either the Bush or Obama administrations have done or do this \u2014 but the possibility exists, and with the NSA\u2019s trawling of domestic communications, it\u2019s possible for those inside the intel community to go rogue and do this on their own, too.\n\nUpdate: My friend Olivier Knox wonders in jest if the \u201cprogram\u201d wasn\u2019t a backfill for internal activity:\n\n.@EdMorrissey I feel like maybe that's how the rank/file analysts explained their Internet search history to their bosses\u2026 \u2014 Olivier Knox (@OKnox) November 27, 2013\n\nYou\u2019ve just made the list, pal.
