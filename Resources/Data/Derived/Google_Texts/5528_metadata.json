For decades, the presenilin 1 gene has been associated with early-onset familial form of Alzheimer\u2019s, which runs in families; but scientists only recently were able to glean more information about how mutations in this gene caused the disease. \u201cIn mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in skin cell of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease caused by presenilin mutations, we observed that the ability to break down and reuse normal proteins and to remove potentially toxic damaged proteins and organelles is severely impaired,\u201d Dr. Ralph Nixon, an author of the 2010 study, said in a press release. In this study, the researchers suggested trying a new drug development route that would focus on eliminating toxic proteins before they do damage, rather than focusing on removing amyloid plaques from the brain.\n\nStudying presenilin proteins in amoebas can help move researchers forward in developing this new drug route. \u201cThis discovery allows us to examine the role for the human presenilin 1 protein, without the use of animal testing,\u201d Professor Robin Williams of the School of Biological Sciences at Royal Holloway said in the press release. \u201cIt is amazing that so simple an organism lends itself to the study of such a complex disease.\u201d\n\nSource: Ludtmann M, Otto G, Schilde C, et al.
