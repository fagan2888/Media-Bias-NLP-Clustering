Less than a week after his wedding, Pocius is suddenly a widower.\n\nThey were at 12,400 feet when the strike happened at about 1:15 p.m., but because their location was outside cell service, witnesses had to hike to get a signal and couldn\u2019t place a 911 call until 2:05 p.m., according to Chaffee County authorities. Emergency crews were dispatched but did not reach the couple until between 4:30 and 5 p.m. Then, Flight for Life Helicopters were delayed by weather.\n\nPocius was finally evacuated on a helicopter around 5:45 p.m.\n\nHis wife was pronounced dead on the mountain. It appears that Bartlett died instantly, Randy Amettis of the Chaffee County Coroner\u2019s Office said.\n\nTwo other hikers, who were not with Bartlett and Pocius, were also hit by the lightning strike but had only minor injuries. They were able to \u201cself-evacuate,\u201d according to Undersheriff Derek Bos.\n\nBartlett and Pocius met at a bar where she worked part time, and the chemistry was instant, she wrote in a post on their wedding website.\n\n\u201cWe ended up having more things in common than we first thought, including a shared appreciation for kids\u2019 movies, yoga, sarcasm and love for the outdoors,\u201d Bartlett wrote on the couple\u2019s page on theknot.com. \u201cIt became apparent very quickly that we had both found \u2018our person.\u2019 Six months after we started dating seriously, we found ourselves engaged and the rest is history!\u201d\n\nBartlett\u2019s profile picture on Facebook, last updated Wednesday, shows her wearing her wedding dress holding a bouquet of flowers as Pocius, eyes closed, kisses her on the cheek. Bartlett is smiling broadly, her eyes looking to the sky.\n\nMatthew Nussbaum: 303-954-1666, mnussbaum@denverpost.com or twitter.com/MatthewNussbaum\n\nLightning deaths\n\nKathleen Bartlett, killed Friday in Chaffee County, is the first lightning fatality in Colorado in 2015 and the 21st since 2005, based on figures kept by the National Weather Service:\n\n2014: A man and a woman on consecutive July days at Rocky Mountain National Park in Larimer County\n\n2013: Two farmworkers in August in Larimer County\n\n2012: None\n\n2011: A man in August in Custer County\n\n2010: A man in June in Chaffee County\n\n2009: A man in June in Weld County\n\n2008: Four were killed in July: two graduate students in Larimer County, a sheepherder in Mineral County and a teenager in Custer County\n\n2007: A man was killed while jogging in July in Jefferson County; another person was killed in September in El Paso County\n\n2006: Six total were killed: a man in May in Park County; three people in separate incidents in June, two men in Adams County and one man in Jackson County; a teenager in July in Teller County; and a man in September in Montrose County\n\n2005: A man was killed in September in Otero County", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Newlywed couple hit by lightning on Mt.
