The hospital has won acclaim for its orthopedic care.\n\nNew England Baptist Hospital, one of the nation\u2019s top destinations for orthopedics, is planning to leave its sprawling campus on a prime location atop Mission Hill, where it has been treating patients for 119 years.\n\nHospital officials said it could take as long as a decade to relocate, possibly to a location on or near the campus of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital about a mile away. The two hospitals signed a partnership agreement last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials say the hospital\u2019s finances are sound, but that the more than century-old campus is showing signs of wear and the Baptist cannot afford the renovations needed to update its Mission Hill facilities.\n\n\u201cTo renovate our current facility would be cost-prohibitive,\u201d Baptist spokeswoman Lisa Rand said. \u201cA new Boston facility will need to be developed, as our current campus will not meet our future patient care needs.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes, the move will signal a new era for the Baptist, which has carved a niche for itself as a stand-alone institution specializing in a narrow field of medicine while many other hospitals in the region have combined to form medical complexes that treat every kind of illness.\n\nPatients with aching hips and worn-out knees have been flocking to the Baptist as its reputation for providing top-shelf orthopedic care has grown nationally during the past several years. Since 2010, the 118-bed hospital has focused exclusively on orthopedic care, including joint replacements and sports injuries.\n\nThe hospital, which employs about 1,400, prides itself on service and has high satisfaction rates among patients. It is often noted for successfully treating athletes and celebrities, including a young US Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who suffered a spine injury in a horrific plane crash in 1964, and former Celtic great Larry Bird, who had several surgeries for a bad back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very special place. It\u2019s really a family,\u201d said Dr. Michael C. Kearney, a urologist who has treated patients at the Baptist for 13 years. \u201cAs long as the New England Baptist retains its leadership and retains its independence, it will retain its special culture,\u201d he said.\n\nGlobe photo/File New England Baptist Hospital as it appeared in 1936. In its Mission Hill neighborhood, already some residents have expressed concern about how Baptist\u2019s departure will affect the area.\n\nThe hospital also sits on a gold mine in its 19-acre campus on one of the city\u2019s highest points. Relocating would not only yield a huge payday from the sale of that land, but make it easier for Baptist to develop the modern facilities it needs.\n\n\u201cWhen you have an old facility and you\u2019re trying to work in a modern era when people care about efficiency and collaboration, it can be very difficult to remodel your old quarters,\u201d said David E. Williams, president of the Boston consulting firm Health Business Group. \u201cIt makes sense for them to at least contemplate moving.\u201d\n\nBaptist occupies seven buildings on Mission Hill, on a campus valued by the city of Boston at about $170 million. The hospital\u2019s relocation would shake up the landscape of a neighborhood that thousands of families and college students call home, and certainly draw intense interest from property developers.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mission Hill longtime residents are already worried about how Baptist\u2019s departure will affect a neighborhood where rising rents and property values have squeezed out lower- and middle-income families.\n\n\u201cWe have to figure out a way this doesn\u2019t damage the neighborhood irreparably,\u201d said Richard Giordano, a neighborhood activist and 25-year Mission Hill resident. \u201cThey need to maximize the sale value, and maximizing the sale value doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something that\u2019s good for the neighborhood. It could be a real estate trust that could build 1,000 luxury apartments up there. It could be a college dormitory.\u201d\n\nCity Councilor Josh Zakim said the city should create an advisory group of residents and elected officials to discuss what kind of development should take the place of the Baptist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important the community has a say,\u201d said Zakim, who represents Mission Hill. \u201cWe have a few years\u2019 notice to do this. It\u2019s incumbent on us to play a role in advising what happens there.\u201d\n\nHospital officials and their neighbors in Mission Hill have clashed in the past, but the relationship has improved in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe Baptist has been a great institutional neighbor,\u201d Zakim added. \u201cThey\u2019ve played a real role in community benefits, summer jobs for kids, extra snow plowing \u2014 folks are really going to be concerned about losing that.\u201d\n\nHospital operators across the nation are under pressure to control costs while delivering high-quality care. In Massachusetts, several community hospitals have merged or affiliated with the state\u2019s big health systems \u2014 Partners HealthCare, Steward Health Care System, Beth Israel Deaconess, and Lahey Health. Bigger networks that offer a full suite of medical services, hospital executives argue, give them more clout in the marketplace and the opportunity to deliver more efficient care.\n\nBaptist leaders expect demand for orthopedic services to grow in the coming years as the population ages. And though Baptist has a strong brand, the hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center last February said they would pursue a partnership to develop a national destination for orthopedic care. The details of that deal are still being worked out.\n\nBeth Israel Deaconess is in the midst of reviewing its own aging campus in the Longwood Medical Area. Hospital officials expect they will need new facilities to accommodate growth, and that construction may include a new home for the Baptist.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very much part of the planning process,\u201d Beth Israel Deaconess spokesman Jerry Berger said.\n\nThe two hospitals have a history: They both belong to CareGroup, which launched in 1996 as a broad hospital and physician network that also included Mount Auburn Hospital. The network eventually dissolved but CareGroup still exists as a bond-holding company.\n\nEllen Lutch Bender, president of the health care consulting firm Bender Strategies LLC, predicted the Baptist will be able to maintain its identity even if it leaves its longtime home.\n\n\u201cThe brand and the excellence of New England Baptist Hospital will travel wherever they end up being,\u201d Bender said. \u201cThe culture of the organization is larger than bricks and mortar.\u201d\n\nMore coverage:\n\n\u2022 Beth Israel, Baptist team up on orthopedic care\n\n\u2022 Three big providers exploring health alliance\n\n\u2022 Does cracking knuckles damage joints?\n\n\u2022 Do you really need a knee replacement?", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.1270346123", "eomportal-id": 453757, "description": "New England Baptist Hospital is planning to leave its perch atop Mission Hill on a sprawling site overlooking Boston, where it has been treating patients for 119 years.", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Roxbury Crossing", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "New England Baptist Hospital is planning to leave its perch atop Mission Hill on a sprawling site overlooking Boston, where it has been treating patients for 119 years.", "zip": 2120, "title": "New England Baptist Hospital to leave longtime location on Mission Hill - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/17/new-england-baptist-hospital-leave-longtime-location-mission-hill/IadkrLwyORlPWfZqF4xYgI/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/01/14/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/kreiter_baptist2_biz.jpg", "state": "MA", "longitude": "-71.10718680000002", "streetaddress": "125 Parker Hill Ave", "latitude": "42.3293235", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "New England Baptist Hospital,Mission Hill,orthopedics,moving,orthopedics,campus,119 years,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,relocate,Harvard-affiliated hospital", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 19:05:04 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "New England Baptist Hospital,Mission Hill,orthopedics,moving,orthopedics,campus,119 years,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,relocate,Harvard-affiliated hospital,partnership agreement,renovation,medicine,top-shelf orthopedic care,reputation,grown,sports injuries,joint replacements,Dr. Michael C.
