Here, there are about 186 physicians for every 100,000 people, according to the Texas Medical Association. The national average is 236 per 100,000.\n\nThe KERA radio story.\n\nAnd if the state keeps turning out the same number of medical students, UNT Health Science Center President Michael Williams has a warning:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never catch up to the deficit,\u201d Williams says. \u201cEver.\u201d\n\nYes, Williams says it sounds bad. But he\u2019s got a plan. For years, the president of UNT\u2019s Health Science Center has been dreaming about handing out more diplomas to doctors in Fort Worth. That city one of the largest in the country without a medical degree program.\n\nIn just a few years, that\u2019s going to change. UNT\u2019s Health Science Center and Texas Christian University have partnered to create a medical degree program. In fact, by the fall of 2018, three new MD programs will be up and running in Central, North, and South Texas \u2013 adding hundreds of new doctors to the state.\n\nThe Need For Primary Care Doctors\n\nDennis Andrulis, a senior research scientist at the Texas Health Institute, says what Texas needs most are pediatricians and primary care doctors, not highly paid specialists.\n\n\u201cHaving a new medical school offers such great opportunity for a community,\u201d Andrulis says. \u201cThe big question is the extent to which this med school will reach out to community based care rather than being caught up in the romance and allure of specialty surgery (\u2026) big money makers.\u201d\n\nThe average compensation for a specialist in 2014 was $284,000. For primary care docs it is closer to $190,000, according to a 2015 Medscape report.\n\nUNT Health Science Center president Michael Williams says you can\u2019t corral students into a primary care.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he says, \u201cI can say \u2018well we want to have all primary care doctors\u2019 but I don\u2019t have any control over that reality.\u201d\n\nStill, Williams points out the Health Science Center\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine has a good track record.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been the leading medical school in Texas for a number of years in graduating and turning out primary care physicians,\u201d he says.\n\nWilliams says to get more primary care doctors in Texas, you need the right culture, and more in-state residency slots for graduates to work in after they graduate.\n\nOther Solutions To The Primary Care Shortage\n\nLinda Green, a professor of health care management at the Columbia Business School has another fix for the primary care shortage \u2014 one that involves a shift in the office.\n\n\u201cWhere there\u2019s much more of a team approach,\u201d she says. \u201cOther professionals like nurse practitioners and physician assistants have at least the same quality [of care] as primary care physicians for dealing with things like flu and strep throat and the kinds of things primary care physicians often see.\u201d\n\nMore states are allowing nurse practitioners to practice to the full scope of their abilities \u2014 allowing primary care doctors to see more patients and handle more complex cases. Texas has removed some restrictions on nurses ability to practice medicine, though supervision is still required.\n\n[Read more: North Texas Nurses Gain New Freedom To Treat Patients]\n\nGreen says a combination of new medical schools like the one in Fort Worth, higher reimbursements and a culture of teamwork are all necessary to get more primary care doctors in Texas.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://breakthroughs.kera.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MD-SCHOOL-00003.jpg", "type": "website"}, "description": "There\u2019s a serious doctor shortage in Texas.
