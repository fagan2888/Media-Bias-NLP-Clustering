Those rates are only slightly lower than what President Obama proposed, and higher than rates proposed by House Republicans two years ago.\n\n\u201cA 10 percent repatriation tax is a little low for my taste, but it is definitely in the realm of reasonable, relative to what else has been proposed,\u201d said Edward Kleinbard, former Chief of Staff of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation and a proponent of progressive tax policies who described himself as \u201con the other side of the political ledger\u201d from Trump.\n\nKleinbard agrees with Trump\u2019s call for an end to deferrals so foreign earnings are taxed in real-time instead of only when they\u2019re declared in the U.S. as dividends.\n\n\u201cMuch as it pains me to say it, I agree with that instinct,\u201d Kleinbard said. \u201cWorldwide taxation, eliminating deferrals, is the only stable place for the United States to end up.\u201d\n\nSpecial report: Donald Trump - Promise and Peril\n\nA Washington Center for Equitable Growth study released this month determined profit-shifting by U.S. multinationals is reducing federal tax revenues by more than $100 billion each year. The problem has exploded in the past decade, during which the scale of lost revenue due to so-called inversions \u2014 U.S. companies relocating offshore or overseas \u2014 has increased five-fold, according to the study.\n\nLike most inversion tax plans, Trump proposes allowing companies to receive a credit in the amount of any foreign taxes they pay.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan goes further afield, however, when he proposes to also drop the domestic corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, which the billionaire says \u201cmakes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America\u2019s tax rate one of the best in the world.\u201d\n\nKleinbard said that plan would \u201chemorrhage revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-five (percent) is about as low as you can go without aggressively looking to new sources of taxation,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how appealing a 15 percent rate would even be to companies eyeing inversion. Many of the most popular destinations \u2014 Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Bermuda, Cayman Islands \u2014 have effective corporate rates of less than 5 percent, according to a report from the Center for Equitable Growth. Almost all of that $100 billion in revenue loss, the study found, came from shifting profits to countries with corporate tax rates under 15 percent.\n\nBut Robert Willens, a New York corporate tax consultant and former Lehman Brothers director, said inversion is such a complex undertaking for companies that even a 25 percent corporate tax rate might be enough to deter the practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple \u2014 if the tax rates in the U.S. were more competitive, why would anybody bother going through this brain damage that they have to go through, and getting criticized, and being subjected to political scrutiny?\u201d Willens said. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t bother if the tax rate were competitive.\u201d\n\nWillens agreed a 15 percent rate would leave a big revenue hole, but said that could be mitigated by changing some tax preferences corporations currently enjoy, such as their ability to depreciate assets on an accelerated basis.\n\nBut other elements of Trump\u2019s economic vision worry experts, including recent comments that the U.S. can\u2019t default on its debt \u201cbecause you print the money,\u201d suggesting a strategy that would include simply making more cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Argentina,\u201d said Michael Klein, an international economics affairs professor at Tufts University. \u201cAnd that\u2019s also his experience going bankrupt three times. That\u2019s not a national policy. \u2026 Even to say things like that would spook the markets and lead to disruption.\u201d\n\nBernard Weinstein, an economist at Southern Methodist University, gave Trump credit for acknowledging that the economy has to recover at a faster pace with more job creation, but warned that he lacks an actual blueprint for prosperity.\n\n\u201cHe has touched on a real concern,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cNormally, when you\u2019re six or seven years out of a severe economic downturn, you\u2019re growing a lot faster than we are. \u2026 (But) I haven\u2019t heard any specifics I believe would do much to stimulate the economy.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for another Trump promise \u2014 repealing Obamacare.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a plan for what he wants instead. Some of the other candidates did have very significant plans, \u201d said Joshua Archambault, a health care expert at the Pioneer Institute. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know what he would change on Day 1 or the first 100 days on health care because he\u2019s been so all over the place.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump has staked out an uncharacteristically moderate position on one of the campaign\u2019s hottest issues \u2014 bringing home some $100", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "parsely-page": "{\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bostonherald.com\\/news\\/us_politics\\/2016\\/05\\/promise_peril_donald_trump_moderate_on_inversion_tax\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"1065217916\",\"title\":\"Promise & Peril: Donald Trump moderate on inversion tax\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-05-26T04:00:00Z\",\"tags\":[\"Donald Trump\",\"Trump: Promise and Peril\",\"GOP\",\"section-News\"],\"authors\":[\"Jack Encarnacao\",\"Chris Cassidy\"],\"section\":\"News\"}", "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump has staked out an uncharacteristically moderate position on one of the campaign\u2019s hottest issues \u2014 bringing home some $100", "card": "summary", "title": "Promise & Peril: Donald Trump moderate on inversion tax"}, "og": {"image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/gallery/public/media/2016/05/25/052516trump05.jpg?itok=wc-ZPxgN", "description": "Donald Trump has staked out an uncharacteristically moderate position on one of the campaign&rsquo;s hottest issues &mdash; bringing home some $100 billion in tax revenues on earnings U.S. multinational companies have parked overseas after moving their headquarters to tax-haven nations.", "title": "Promise & Peril: Donald Trump moderate on inversion tax"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597309570500616}, "viewport": "maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But Robert Willens, a New York corporate tax consultant and former Lehman Brothers director, said inversion is such a complex undertaking for companies that even a 25 percent corporate tax rate might be enough to deter the practice.\nLike most inversion tax plans, Trump proposes allowing companies to receive a credit in the amount of any foreign taxes they pay.\nAlmost all of that $100 billion in revenue loss, the study found, came from shifting profits to countries with corporate tax rates under 15 percent.\nMany of the most popular destinations \u2014 Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Bermuda, Cayman Islands \u2014 have effective corporate rates of less than 5 percent, according to a report from the Center for Equitable Growth.\nIt\u2019s unclear how appealing a 15 percent rate would even be to companies eyeing inversion."}
