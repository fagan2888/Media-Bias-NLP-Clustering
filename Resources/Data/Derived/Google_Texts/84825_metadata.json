Edie Littlefield Sundby details her plight in a new article the Wall Street Journal published:\n\nEveryone now is clamoring about Affordable Care Act winners and losers. I am one of the losers.\n\nMy grievance is not political; all my energies are directed to enjoying life and staying alive, and I have no time for politics. For almost seven years I have fought and survived stage-4 gallbladder cancer, with a five-year survival rate of less than 2% after diagnosis. I am a determined fighter and extremely lucky. But this luck may have just run out: My affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective Dec. 31.\n\nMy choice is to get coverage through the government health exchange and lose access to my cancer doctors, or pay much more for insurance outside the exchange (the quotes average 40% to 50% more) for the privilege of starting over with an unfamiliar insurance company and impaired benefits.\n\nCountless hours searching for non-exchange plans have uncovered nothing that compares well with my existing coverage. But the greatest source of frustration is Covered California, the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act health-insurance exchange and, by some reports, one of the best such exchanges in the country. After four weeks of researching plans on the website, talking directly to government exchange counselors, insurance companies and medical providers, my insurance broker and I are as confused as ever. Time is running out and we still don\u2019t have a clue how to best proceed.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, health-insurance policies could not be sold across state lines; now policies sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges may not be offered across county lines.\n\nWhat happened to the president\u2019s promise, \u201cYou can keep your health plan\u201d? Or to the promise that \u201cYou can keep your doctor\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Woman With Stage Four Gallbladder Cancer Loses Insurance Thanks to Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "A woman with stage four gallbladder cancer is one of the millions of Americans who are losing their health insurance thanks to the rules and regulations that ar", "title": "Woman With Stage Four Gallbladder Cancer Loses Insurance Thanks to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/04/woman-with-stage-four-gallbladder-cancer-loses-insurance-thanks-to-obamacare/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sadwoman10.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "woman,gallblader,cancer,insurance,obamacare,pro-life", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A woman with stage four gallbladder cancer is one of the millions of Americans who are losing their health insurance thanks to the rules and regulations that are a part of Obamacare.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, health-insurance policies could not be sold across state lines; now policies sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges may not be offered across county lines.\nEdie Littlefield Sundby details her plight in a new article the Wall Street Journal published:Everyone now is clamoring about Affordable Care Act winners and losers.\nBut the greatest source of frustration is Covered California, the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act health-insurance exchange and, by some reports, one of the best such exchanges in the country.\nBut this luck may have just run out: My affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective Dec. 31."}
