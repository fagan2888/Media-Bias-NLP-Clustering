Mark Waller of Colorado Springs, who almost failed to make the June 24 primary ballot as he captured just 30.7 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cI am running for Attorney General because the office is not some political training ground for another higher office or a place to make policy in order to fulfill one\u2019s political ambitions,\u201d Coffman, who has served in the AG\u2019s office since 2005, said in a veiled dig at Waller. \u201cIt is a serious place where serious actions are taken to preserve and protect the people of Colorado.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Waller was slammed in a handout to delegates created by former state Rep. Doug Bruce, who was ousted from office by Waller in a 2008 GOP primary. The handout featured a silly photo of Waller and questioned his time in the military, characterized him as a political opportunist and endorsed Coffman.\n\nThe Coffman campaign denounced the handout.\n\nAt most junctures of Coffman\u2019s speech she revved her base by assailing Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and the Obama administration. Coffman\u2019s nomination Saturday was seconded by current Attorney General John Suthers, who leaves office due to term limits.\n\nWaller, a former House GOP minority leader, who for months has been vocal inside Capitol that he would easily make the ballot, focused some of his attention on Coffman as he addressed delegates.\n\nHe touted everything from fighting \u201cliberal opponents\u201d on new gun-control laws, to being a staunch opponent to the state\u2019s new health care exchanges implemented under the Affordable Care Act, noting he \u201cwas against the idea of implementing what I believe is an unconstitutional law and giving it credibility in the Centennial state.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, my opponent refused to oppose this scheme and a narrow majority of Colorado lawmakers passed the implementation of Obamacare,\u201d said Waller about the bipartisan legislation to create the exchanges.\n\nCoffman and Waller hope to move on to challenge Democrat Don Quick, a former District Attorney from Adams and Broomfield counties, who secured his party\u2019s nomination on Saturday in Denver.\n\nFollow Kurtis on Twitter: @kurtisalee\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Attorney General,Cynthia Coffman,Doug Bruce,Eric Holder,John Suthers,Mark Waller,Obama administration", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Chief Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Coffman nearly walked away with the GOP nomination for Attorney General over the weekend, amassing 69 percent of the support from state delegates.", "title": "Cythnthia Coffman", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/04/14/cynthia-coffman-amasses-almost-70-percent-gop-delegate-support-rep-mark-waller-just-30-percent/108145/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/04/COFFMAN.jpeg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Chief Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Coffman nearly walked away with the GOP nomination for Attorney General over the weekend, amassing 69 percent of the support from state delegates.", "title": "Cynthia Coffman amasses 69 percent of GOP delegate support, almost keeps Mark Waller off ballot", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/04/14/cynthia-coffman-amasses-almost-70-percent-gop-delegate-support-rep-mark-waller-just-30-percent/108145/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/04/COFFMAN.jpeg", "creator": "@kurtisalee", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Chief Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Coffman nearly walked away with the GOP nomination for Attorney General over the weekend, amassing 69 percent of the support from state delegates."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a3a\"", "article_summary": "Chief Deputy Attorney General Cynthia Coffman nearly walked away with the GOP nomination for AG over the weekend, amassing 69 percent of the support from state delegates.\nThe handout featured a silly photo of Waller and questioned his time in the military, characterized him as a political opportunist and endorsed Coffman.\nJohn Hickenlooper, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and the Obama administration.\nCoffman and Waller hope to move on to challenge Democrat Don Quick, a former District Attorney from Adams and Broomfield counties, who secured his party\u2019s nomination on Saturday in Denver.\nCoffman\u2019s nomination Saturday was seconded by current Attorney General John Suthers, who leaves office due to term limits."}
