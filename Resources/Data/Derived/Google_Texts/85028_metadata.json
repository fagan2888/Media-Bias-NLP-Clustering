The CRA was asked to consider whether a franchise renewal fee paid by a resident to a non-resident was subject to withholding tax. The CRA determined that, at least in the circumstances it was considering, a cross-border franchise renewal fee is subject to a withholding tax under subsection 212(1)(d)(i) of the Income Tax Act (the \"Act\"). Subsection 212(1)(d)(i) of the Act provides for an income withholding tax of 25% on all amounts paid or credited to a non-resident person by a resident as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of \"rent, royalty or a similar payment.\" The terms \"rent\" and \"royalty\" are not defined by the Act, but generally speaking, a rent or royalty represents payment made to the owner of property for the right to use the property for a given period of time. The CRA determined that a renewal fee paid by a franchisee to a franchisor for the right to use a franchise in Canada for a given period of time is considered rent, royalty or a similar payment for the purposes of the Act. Therefore section 212(1)(d) applies, and the non-resident recipient of the renewal fee is required to pay a withholding tax.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b645b1c2-dcc1-4608-a48a-8d52367c13f8", "image": "http://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png", "description": "The Canadian Revenue Agency&#39;s Income Tax Rulings Directorate published a ruling on March 27, 2014 which may have significant implications for\u2026", "title": "Non-resident franchisors may pay withholding tax on renewal fees received from Canadian franchisees | Lexology"}, "Description": "The Canadian Revenue Agency&#39;s Income Tax Rulings Directorate published a ruling on March 27, 2014 which may have significant implications for\u2026", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebdd\"", "article_summary": "Therefore section 212(1)(d) applies, and the non-resident recipient of the renewal fee is required to pay a withholding tax.\nThe CRA was asked to consider whether a franchise renewal fee paid by a resident to a non-resident was subject to withholding tax.\nThe CRA determined that, at least in the circumstances it was considering, a cross-border franchise renewal fee is subject to a withholding tax under subsection 212(1)(d)(i) of the Income Tax Act (the \"Act\").\nCanada January 28 2015The Canadian Revenue Agency\u2019s Income Tax Rulings Directorate published a ruling on March 27, 2014 which may have significant implications for franchises.\nSubsection 212(1)(d)(i) of the Act provides for an income withholding tax of 25% on all amounts paid or credited to a non-resident person by a resident as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of \"rent, royalty or a similar payment.\""}
