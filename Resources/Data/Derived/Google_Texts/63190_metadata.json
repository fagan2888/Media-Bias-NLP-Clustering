The GAO said in its report that it does not expect the program to be \u201cbudget-neutral\u201d for the federal government during its first three years.\n\n\u201cIn approving the demonstration (known as the private option), HHS did not ensure budget neutrality,\u201d the report states. \u201cSpecifically, HHS approved a spending limit for the demonstration that was based, in part, on hypothetical costs \u2014 significantly higher payment amounts the state assumed it would have to make to providers if it expanded coverage under the traditional Medicaid program \u2014 without requesting any data to support the state\u2019s assumptions.\n\n\u201cWe estimated that, by including these costs, the three-year, nearly $4 billion spending limit that HHS approved for the state\u2019s demonstration was approximately $778 million more than what the spending limit would have been if it was based on the state\u2019s actual payment rates for services provided to adult beneficiaries under the traditional Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nThe GAO also noted that HHS has given Arkansas the flexibility to adjust the spending limit if actual costs prove higher than expected because of the demographics of enrollees.\n\n\u201cHHS in effect waived its cost-effectiveness requirement that providing premium assistance to purchase individual coverage on the private market prove comparable to the cost of providing direct coverage under the state\u2019s Medicaid plan\u2014 further increasing the risk that the demonstration will not be budget-neutral,\u201d the report states.\n\nHHS reviewed a draft of the report and submitted comments disagreeing with the GAO\u2019s conclusions.\n\n\u201cGAO used only a subset of the data that (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) uses to assess and determine the appropriate estimates used in developing a budget neutrality model that corresponds with the state\u2019s proposed program intervention,\u201d HHS said in its comments. \u201cGAO also relied on a very narrow reading of HHA budget neutrality policy that does not account for major program changes as a result of the expansion of Medicaid created by the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nHHS said the GAO did not consider a number of factors that could end up saving money.\n\n\u201cArkansas may quantify savings from reduced churning (people moving between Medicaid and exchanges as a result of fluctuating incomes), improvement in care and in health from reduced fragmentation and access to different providers, and increased competition in the marketplace given the additional enrollees due to premium assistance,\u201d HHS said.\n\nMatt DeCample, spokesman for Gov. Mike Beebe, also criticized the report in an interview Monday.\n\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be any information in this report that was based on anything on the ground in Arkansas. It\u2019s some assumptions, some of which are fair and some of which, as described in HHS\u2019 response, aren\u2019t a good reflection of what\u2019s actually going on in Arkansas,\u201d DeCample said.\n\nEnrollment in the private option began last October. By the end of August, 205,097 Arkansas had been found eligible for the program and 194,257 had completed enrollment, according to the state Department of Human Services.\n\nAppropriating federal funds to continue the program will require a three-fourths vote of both chambers of the state Legislature in the session that starts Jan. 12.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The U.S. Government Accountability Office is projecting that Arkansas\u2019 so-called private option will cost federal taxpayers $778 million more than expanding traditional Medicaid would have cost.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/government-accountability-office-says-private-option-not-budget-neutral", "site_name": "Arkansas News", "type": "article", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The U.S. Government Accountability Office is projecting that Arkansas\u2019 so-called private option will cost federal taxpayers $778 million more than expanding traditional Medicaid would have cost.", "title": "Government Accountability Office says private option not budget-neutral"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/government-accountability-office-says-private-option-not-budget-neutral", "title": "Government Accountability Office says private option not budget-neutral", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-08T18:53:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The U.S. Government Accountability Office is projecting that Arkansas\u2019 so-called private option will cost federal taxpayers $778 million more than expanding traditional Medicaid would have cost.\n\u201cIn approving the demonstration (known as the private option), HHS did not ensure budget neutrality,\u201d the report states.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services disagreed with the projections in the GAO report released Monday.\nThe GAO said in its report that it does not expect the program to be \u201cbudget-neutral\u201d for the federal government during its first three years.\nEnrollment in the private option began last October."}
