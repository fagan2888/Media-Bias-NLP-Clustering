In fact, Hudgens compares requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions to requiring auto insurers to pay claims to any reckless drivers without comprehensive auto insurance who crash their cars:\n\nHUDGENS: I\u2019ve had several companies come in and they have said just the fact \u2014 just the fact \u2014 that in the individual market pre-existing conditions have to be covered on Jan. 1, that that is going to double the cost of insurance. And if you don\u2019t really understand what covering pre-existing conditions would be like, it would be like in Georgia we have a law that says you have to have insurance on your automobile. You have to have liability insurance. If you\u2019re going to drive on Georgia\u2019s roads, you have to have liability insurance. You don\u2019t have to have collision. You don\u2019t have to have comprehensive\u2026. But you have to have liability. But say you\u2019re going along and you have a wreck. And it\u2019s your fault. Well, a pre-existing condition would be you then calling up your insurance agent and saying, \u2018I would like to get collision insurance coverage on my car.\u2019 And your insurance agent says, \u2018Well, you never had that before. Why would you want it now?\u2019 And you say, \u2018Well, I just had a wreck, it was my fault and I want the insurance company to pay to repair my car.\u2019 And that\u2019s the exact same thing on pre-existing insurance.\n\nWatch it:\n\nPerhaps it isn\u2019t surprising that Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s (R-GA) administration is advancing the insurance industry\u2019s line on Obamacare. In September, Deal revealed that he had taken over half a million dollars in contributions from the health care industry through a Super PAC whose activities were kept secret until an investigative reporter uncovered corporate donations to the group over the summer. Many of those donations \u2014 including $50,000 checks from United Health Care, Inc. and WellCare of Georgia \u2014 came from major insurance companies that are opposed to Affordable Care Act\u2019s consumer protections, like the coverage requirement for Americans with pre-existing conditions. Other donors included Humana, Blue Cross, and Aetna.\n\nHudgens himself has even deeper ties to insurance companies. In fact, Consumer Watchdog singled him out in a 2011 report on insurance commissioners\u2019 relationships with the industry they regulate. It found that private insurers were Hudgens\u2019 top supporters for his 2010 race, donating just under $150,000 to his campaign.\n\nOver 20 percent of Americans who applied for insurance in the pre-Obamacare individual market were denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition in the 46 states that didn\u2019t already ban those practices.\n\nAs of press time, Deal\u2019s office had not responded to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "People with pre-existing conditions are like irresponsible drivers asking for insurance company handouts, according to Georgia's insurance commissioner.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "People with pre-existing conditions are like irresponsible drivers asking for insurance company handouts, according to Georgia's insurance commissioner.", "title": "Insurance Commissioner Compares Pre-Existing Conditions To Car Wrecks: \u2018It\u2019s Your Fault\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/04/3020831/georgia-insurance-commissioner-pre-existing-fault/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/apimages_ralph-hudgens.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People with pre-existing conditions are like irresponsible drivers asking for insurance company handouts, according to Georgia's insurance commissioner.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/apimages_ralph-hudgens-321x214.jpg", "title": "Insurance Commissioner Compares Pre-Existing Conditions To Car Wrecks: \u2018It\u2019s Your Fault\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/apimages_ralph-hudgens.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/apimages_ralph-hudgens.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-04T15:25:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Insurance Commissioner Compares Pre-Existing Conditions To Car Wrecks: \u2018It\u2019s Your Fault\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/Angela Lewis Georgia insurance commissioner Ralph Hudgens (R) campaigning for his current job in 2010Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens (R) has a message for the estimated 57.2 million Americans suffering from diabetes, asthma, cancer, genetic disorders, and other pre-existing medical conditions: it\u2019s your fault.\nWhy would you want it now?\u2019 And you say, \u2018Well, I just had a wreck, it was my fault and I want the insurance company to pay to repair my car.\u2019 And that\u2019s the exact same thing on pre-existing insurance.\nWell, a pre-existing condition would be you then calling up your insurance agent and saying, \u2018I would like to get collision insurance coverage on my car.\u2019 And your insurance agent says, \u2018Well, you never had that before.\nAnd if you don\u2019t really understand what covering pre-existing conditions would be like, it would be like in Georgia we have a law that says you have to have insurance on your automobile.\nHudgens himself has even deeper ties to insurance companies."}
