So who has the advantage \u2014 the U.S. or China?\n\nChina\u2019s twin-engine design bears a striking resemblance to the single-jet F-35. Still, the Joint Strike Fighter is expected to fly slightly farther and carry a heavier load of weapons, according to the data, which was first reported by Jane\u2019s.\n\nMilitary experts say that while the J-31 looks like, and may even fly like, the F-35, it\u2019s what\u2019s under the hood and embedded in the skin that really matters. The U.S. has the better computer software, unique sensors and other hardware, stealth coating, and engines technology\u2014all critical attributes that make fifth-generation aircraft different than the military jets of last century.\n\nExactly how long that advantage lasts is up for debate; senior Pentagon officials and experts believe American technology superiority is shrinking. That means the U.S. military\u2019s weapons will not overmatch adversaries for as long as they have in past decades.\n\nRelated: 12 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically, are they producing weapon systems that have fifth-generation characteristics that potentially nullify some of our planned advantages in the future battlespace,\u201d said Peter Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at New America.\n\n\u201c[W]e were depending more so on the [American weapons] having that generation-ahead edge, and if we don\u2019t have that generation-ahead edge, that is incredibly scary for us in various scenarios,\u201d Singer said.\n\nU.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work and acquisition chief Frank Kendall have spent much of the past two years warning that the U.S. military\u2019s technology advantage is eroding.\n\n\u201cWhat it does is reduce the cost and lead time of our adversaries to doing their own designs, so it gives away a substantial advantage,\u201d Kendall said of cyber espionage at a 2013 Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing.\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nSince then, Work and Kendall have been leading projects to find technologies that will give the American military an advantage on the battlefield of the future.\n\nChina is suspected of stealing F-35 design data in 2009. U.S. officials have said classified information was not stolen in that breach, but in 2011 it emerged that China was building a multirole, stealth fighter of its own that could strike targets in the air and on the ground, like the F-35. The J-31 flew for the first time in 2012.\n\nThe Pentagon huddled with defense companies in 2007 to urge firms to better protect their networks. Companies are attempting to beef up their cybersecurity, but there is a gap in the security talent, said Justin Harvey, chief security officer for Fidelis Cybersecurity, a firm that works with the U.S. government and private industry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re buying these tools, but they\u2019re not investing a ton in the people,\u201d he said. Whenever a company is attacked, they typically call Fidelis or similar cybersecurity firms to consult because they don\u2019t have employees with the training or experience to assess the breach.\n\nRelated: 12 Weapons that Changed Everything\n\n\u201cI think 90 percent of U.S. companies are not equipped to deal with cyber espionage,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nThe defense industrial base and financial services industry are the best-protected, he said.\n\nCyber espionage allows rival companies to get access to the information gleaned during testing \u201cfor the cost of breaching your network,\u201d Singer said.\n\nCyber theft allows China to save tens of billions of dollars in research-and-development, the experimentation and testing a new weapon goes through before it reaches the battlefield, experts say. While the Chinese jet fighters might still be inferior to the American planes, not having to do early research and development allows them to focus on upgrades and improvements.\n\nRelated: 5 Expensive Weapons Programs No One Wants\n\nThis means the 10- to 20-year advantage an aircraft like the F-35 was supposed have on the battlefield might not be there, Singer said. Those Chinese plans could then compete against U.S.-made aircraft 20 years from now when the U.S. government allows more and more allies to buy the F-35.\n\n\u201cThose future competitions will be incredibly difficult because we\u2019ll have paid the R&D for our competitors,\u201d Singer said.\n\nIncreased research-and-development costs, ever common in Pentagon acquisition projects, often lead to a decrease in the total number of items purchased. Most recently, this was the case with the F-35\u2019s older brother, the F-22 Raptor. The Air Force had wanted more than 700 planes, a number cut first to 381 and ultimately to 187.\n\n\u201cThe expense of our fifth-generation [fighter aircraft] means we have not been able to buy as many as we want,\u201d Singer said.\n\nRelated: The $1 Trillion Question for the F-35: Is the U.S. Buying an Inferior Plane?\n\nBut the F-35, unlike previous aircraft, has been designed to receive upgrades over the years, which will ultimately improve its capabilities, allowing it defeat new threats.\n\nF-35 development will end in October 2017. After that the program will move into a \u201cfollow-on development\u201d phase, said F-35 project spokesman Joe DellaVedova. \u201cOne of the F-35\u2019s great strengths is that it\u2019s a growth platform, so its software, its processors, its radar, its capability; there\u2019s a lot of room for growth.\u201d\n\nThe jet fighters will get software and hardware upgrades every two years on an alternating basis.\n\nThe F-35 itself and its ground equipment undergo multiple tests each year to make sure the systems can withstand cyber attack, DellaVedova said. \u201cWe take the cyber threat very seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the Chinese planes might still have inferior systems, stealing intellectual property and subsequent R&D savings also allows Beijing to make drastic changes in prototypes.\n\nFor the J-20, a Chinese stealth fighter being built to rival the F-22, there have been numerous prototypes in which the plane\u2019s design has become stealthier, Singer said.\n\n\u201cTheir designs, their capabilities are shifting from prototype to prototype in a way that has not happening with the current way that we are building our fifth-gen systems,\u201d he said.\n\nThis piece originally appeared on DefenseOne.
