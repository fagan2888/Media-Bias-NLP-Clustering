In fact, a recent US News and World Report\u2019s list of the Best 100 Jobs shows both nurse and nurse practitioner in the Top 10. And it\u2019s a respected profession as well: A 2013 Gallup poll showed 82 percent of Americans rate the ethical and honesty standards of nurses as \u201chigh or very high,\u201d the highest of all professions.\n\nYet despite talk of an impending nursing shortage over the next few years, some believe there is an even bigger crisis looming, one that stems from the very heart of the career \u2014 education. Quite simply, nursing students are not as prepared as they should be for the \u201creal world\u201d of nursing and patient care.\n\nThis skills deficit is all-encompassing. There is a lack of the basic technical skills, such as physical assessment and emergency response. But the equal lack of \u201csoft skills,\u201d such as critical thinking, problem recognition, prioritization and recognition of urgency, and communication with physicians, is just as alarming.\n\nPerhaps the most unfortunate part is these serious gaps aren\u2019t being caught early on in the nurse\u2019s education. As a result, we\u2019re seeing many young professionals get far enough down the nursing education path that when they reach the clinical phase of their education, it is too late to catch up and too onerous for supervising nurses to help them.\n\nA Lack of Education\n\nThis lack of education isn\u2019t just affecting entry-level nurses. In fact, many nurses are not learning the in-demand skills that can help them take their career to the next level. For example, there is an increased demand for nursing administrators in hospitals, labs, and other health care settings. These nurses get competitive salaries and also receive a number of other benefits. Yet a study published in The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety, well before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act showed many new nurses entering the profession felt \u201cpoorly\u201d or \u201cvery poorly\u201d prepared by their nursing education programs to implement quality improvement measures; these are duties demanded of nurse administrators and ones that will be in higher demand as ACA takes full effect.\n\nOf course it\u2019s not as though these issues have arisen independent of the dramatic changes in the overall health care and nursing landscape. To be sure, today, the complexity of patient care is exponentially greater than it was five years ago, due to technological advances in care, decreased length of patient stay, and rapidity of change. This has undoubtedly changed the way nurses should\u2014and need to be\u2014learning. And what they should be learning is how to provide quality patient-centered care, where doctors, nurses, and other hospital personnel work together as an integrated team to make sure the patient has the best outcome and experience possible.\n\nOne of the barriers to achieving this level of care is that although there is far more complexity to the state of nursing today and more educational material to be covered in the same amount of time, clinical education is still being conducted as it was in the 1960s. Then, nursing education consisted of all of the familiar courses, such as anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, and medical-surgical nursing. The difference was that typically after six months of school the students were actually in charge of nursing divisions, which allowed them to be immersed in the clinical arena rather quickly.\n\nBy contrast, today many nursing school faculty simply don\u2019t have the clinical skills that are being demanded of their students following graduation. Instead, they have concentrated on nursing theory rather than the practical aspects of actually dealing with doctors and patients, which doesn\u2019t help their students post-graduation. And, as is the criticism with the education system overall in this country, many feel that nursing schools are simply gearing their programs to teach students to take tests\u2014in this case NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination).\n\nImprovements in Nursing Education and Skills\n\nWith millions of previously uninsured Americans ready to join the patient population in the next two years, it is more critical than ever to ensure our nurses are in the position to provide the best possible service.\n\nHere is how we might accomplish this goal:\n\nEstablish nursing residency programs. It\u2019s a model that works extremely well for physicians, so why not for nurses? In fact, the Institute of Medicine\u2019s recent report, \u201cFuture of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health,\u201d recommends residency programs to aid the transition from education to practice. Given the increasing role many nurses are playing in health care, it would appear to be a logical next step.\n\nIncrease clinical competence. Nursing schools will benefit from a curriculum that focuses on real-life applications rather than just abstract classroom learning, as well as increasing interdisciplinary education and the skill set to work as a team. This would entail hiring faculty with a solid mix of clinical and academic skills and experience. The idea is to bring in the best of both worlds\u2014instructors who can speak from personal experience about the conditions or situations they are teaching.\n\nCreate better academic/clinical synergies. We must remember that our nursing students will in fact one day be interacting with real-life patients. Therefore, classroom content needs to be tied seamlessly to clinical content and the focus has to shift from technical skills to sound clinical judgment \u2014 and in the words of former professor emerita Patricia Benner (Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco), \u201cshift to thinking in action\u201d and then finally to application. Interestingly, nursing graduates also crave better academic/clinical synergies. Across the board, nurses who graduated from undergrad programs not only requested more clinical time for students but also suggested that clinical assignments be more realistic. For example having students watch over six to seven patients at a time rather than one or two.\n\nEstablish partnerships. Nursing schools and health care organizations should consider collaborative partnerships to create dedicated education units that can provide a more realistic immersion into the clinical environment. This could involve hybrid partnerships, where the clinical faculty members are actually the clinical nurses working at the bedside. It could also include specialty-specific fellowships where students are enculturated in the clinical setting.\n\nThe decline in nursing skills didn\u2019t happen overnight, and it will take some time to fix. A collaborative effort focusing on a combination of academic instruction and real-life applications \u2013 and a focus on both the technical as well as \u201csoft\u201d skills \u2013 will be crucial to getting our nurses back on track and ready to properly serve the patients and families that so trust and respect them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/06/20/course-correction-better-preparing-todays-nurses-for-21st-century-health-care-service/", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "title": "Course Correction: Better Preparing Today\u2019s Nurses For 21st Century Health Care Service"}, "description": "Course Correction: Better Preparing Today\u2019s Nurses For 21st Century Health Care Service  | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bd4\"", "article_summary": "Quite simply, nursing students are not as prepared as they should be for the \u201creal world\u201d of nursing and patient care.\nThis could involve hybrid partnerships, where the clinical faculty members are actually the clinical nurses working at the bedside.\nPerhaps the most unfortunate part is these serious gaps aren\u2019t being caught early on in the nurse\u2019s education.\nGiven the increasing role many nurses are playing in health care, it would appear to be a logical next step.\nFor example, there is an increased demand for nursing administrators in hospitals, labs, and other health care settings."}
