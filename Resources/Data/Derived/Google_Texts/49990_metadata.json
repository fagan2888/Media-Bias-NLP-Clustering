Today, spending by \u201cdark money\u201d organizations on congressional elections surpassed that of all previous cycles.\n\nAt $169.2 million so far, money spent by these groups that don\u2019t disclose their donors handily outpaces 2010\u2019s previous record for a midterm election, where dark money spending topped out at $135 million. It even, albeit barely, tops the $168.6 million spent in congressional races in 2012.\n\nThough spending by conservative dark money groups makes up the majority, 73 percent, of all reported dark money spending, the overall total is down considerably from 2012, and is comparable to what they spent in 2010. Still, the $124 million in reported spending by conservative dark money organizations in 2014 is more than the combined spending of all liberal dark money groups going back to 1990.\n\nThe majority of the increase this cycle is made up of spending by liberal dark money groups, whose outlays have more than tripled since 2010, from $10.7 million to $33 million.\n\nIn 2010, only one of the top 10 most active dark money groups was a liberal group, VoteVets.org, and only three liberal groups had reported spending more than $1 million. In 2014, two liberal groups \u2014 Patriot Majority USA and the League of Conservation Voters \u2014 are among the 10 biggest spenders, and six liberal groups reported spending more than $1 million in congressional races around the country.\n\nMore evidence that Democrats have cannonballed into the outside spending pool: The largest disclosed contributions this cycle have gone to super PACs that support Democrats, and the largest growth in dark money spending has been on the left.\n\nNonparty outside spending as a whole, however, still leans heavily to the right, with nearly $300 million spent by organizations supporting Republicans, compared to just under $217 million spent by pro-Democratic groups. That roster of this cycle\u2019s top donors would look far more conservative if the names of those fueling the political expenditures of dark money groups were disclosed to the public.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only what the FEC reports say. There\u2019s a lot more dark money spending that goes entirely unreported to the FEC. This important not only because it leaves huge holes in the data, but it\u2019s also what makes it possible for these groups to operate as 501(c) organizations, rather than openly political organizations like super PACs, which have to disclose their donors.\n\nIssue no. 1: Making sure you lose\n\n\n\nHidden from the stats is a pattern having to do with how these groups operate inside and outside the Federal Election Commission\u2019s reporting \u201cwindows.\u201d The term refers to a time period \u2014 within 60 days before a general election, or 30 days before a primary \u2014 during which any ads discussing issues and also mentioning candidates for office must be reported as expenditures to the FEC, even if they don\u2019t ask the public to vote for or against the candidate. There\u2019s no reporting requirement for any ads that run before that time, meaning any official tally of how much is spent is hard to come by.\n\nMost organizations that make issue ads outside of the FEC\u2019s reporting windows aren\u2019t seeking to influence an election or circumvent well-established disclosure rules for political activities. These groups usually spend a small amount of money on an effort clearly linked to their mission as an organization, and once the FEC\u2019s electioneering windows open, they don\u2019t show up as big spenders in the data.\n\nBut a relative handful of nonprofit organizations spend heavily on politically charged ads, using the FEC reporting window as a shield for the activity \u2014 both as a means to obscure the activity from oversight and to keep their donors secret.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works.\n\nJanuary 2014 opened with new ads from a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization called Americans for Prosperity \u2014 the flagship organization in the Koch brothers donor network. The ad, running in North Carolina, showed a woman in front of a plain white background saying \u201cpeople don\u2019t like political ads\u201d then jumped into an explanation of the shortcomings of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 popularly referred to as Obamacare \u2014 as the camera slowly tightened on her face. The ad ends with Senator Hagan\u2019s phone number and a call for viewers to \u201ctell Senator Hagan to stop thinking about politics and start thinking about people.\u201d\n\nAs the months went by, this same ad was run in Arkansas, in Colorado, in Louisiana, and elsewhere \u2014 each time encouraging voters to call the corresponding fill-in-the-blank Democratic senator who just so happened to be in a very contentious race to keep his or her seat. Though the ads were structured as a discussion about the issues, independent fact-checkers rated the claims made in the ad as \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nThis ad was the first of many \u201ceducational\u201d ads that would run in states with embattled Senate Democrats. From Alaska to New Hampshire and in between, the ads ran throughout the spring and summer, without any of the spending in these states being reported to the FEC. All of the ads ended with a phone number and encouraged voters to call the politicians featured in the ads.\n\nBut AFP\u2019s ads didn\u2019t just portray Democratic senators. The group also ran upbeat ads featuring GOP congressmen running, who happened to be running against the Democrats in the group\u2019s negative ads.\n\nOne such ad that appeared in late May featured Rep Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who is running to unseat Senator Mark Pryor. The ad discussed no single issue, but simply discussed Cotton\u2019s opposition to moves by \u201cWashington\u201d to \u201cburden farmers with red tape,\u201d as well as his stands against the debt ceiling increase and Obamacare. It closed with a call for viewers to \u201cthank him for standing with Arkansas.\u201d\n\nAnother ad run the same month in Colorado praised Rep Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) generally for his positions on everything from energy to healthcare and government spending. Gardner is currently running to replace Sen. Tom Udall (D-Colo.), who has been the subject of many of AFP\u2019s negative ads. AFP\u2019s efforts mentioning Gardner and Cotton were made easier by the fact that both are currently lawmakers in the House looking to move to the Senate. The ads, therefore, are framed not as support for their Senate campaigns but general congratulations for the work they\u2019re already doing in the House.\n\nAFP ultimately ran ads like these in nine of this cycle\u2019s 10 most contentious Senate races. Most followed the same pattern of negative \u2014 and generally false or misleading \u2014 ads about Democratic senators interspersed with ads showing amorphous appreciation for GOP congressmen who were seeking to oust them.\n\nOn Sept. 4, when the FEC\u2019s reporting window opened \u2014 requiring all future spending on such ads to be logged with the agency \u2014 the Wesleyan Media Project, in partnership with the Center for Responsive Politics, published a report showing that Americans for Prosperity had already run more than 33,000 ads in races around the country, more than any other outside group. Up to that point, and for nearly a month thereafter, the only filings Americans for Prosperity had filed with the FEC were two electioneering communication reports in Kansas.\n\nThis isn\u2019t entirely new. Americans for Prosperity has run politically charged ads outside of the FEC\u2019s reporting windows in the past. As the Wesleyan report shows, AFP had bought 8,198 ads through the end of August 2012, but that\u2019s only about one-fourth of its 2014 total over the same period.\n\nAnd once the FEC\u2019s reporting window opened? AFP began running ads explicitly advocating for and against the same candidates who had been the subject of its supposedly educational ads for the previous 10 months. Again, in 9 of the 10 most contentious Senate races, AFP began to directly oppose candidates in the race; across the board, those candidates were Democrats.\n\nThe push came partly in the form of a series of web ads telling voters to \u201cfire\u201d these incumbent Democrats. The ads recycle the same false claim about Obamacare used in AFP\u2019s earliest \u201ceducational\u201d ads.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just ads. AFP\u2019s expenditures show the organization has been taking its message house to house, hiring canvassers and phonebank operators. Still more, they are sending mailers and putting up billboards, according to FEC reports.\n\nThis visualization shows how the timing works at its most basic level:\n\nA different profile for liberal spending\n\nOn the left, the groups that are spending more than ever this cycle have also been spending for months, and as we\u2019ve noted before, their efforts often result in the same kinds of misleading or outright false ads groups like Americans for Prosperity has run. Patriot Majority, in particular, which has spent more than $10 million primarily opposing candidates in the same senate races Americans for Prosperity has focused on. The League of Conservation Voters isn\u2019t far behind with just under $9.5 million in much the same list of races. On paper \u2014 at the FEC \u2014 both of these groups have spent more than Americans for Prosperity.\n\nHowever, the principal difference is that spending by these groups \u2014 which makes up nearly two-thirds of all liberal dark money reported to the FEC \u2014 was reported to the FEC much earlier than was the spending by Americans for Prosperity. Patriot Majority\u2019s first FEC filings in North Carolina date back to February of this year, compared to Americans for Prosperity\u2019s first report in October, despite the fact that both groups were running politically charged ads during roughly the same time. Likewise, in Arkansas, where Patriot Majority has been taking liberties with the truth for quite some time, its ad buys appear to track with its FEC reports, which go back as far as June 2013. And FEC reports from other top liberal dark money groups like the League of Conservation Voters and VoteVets.org for their spending in the top Senate races align with the actual timing of their ad buys.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, however, isn\u2019t the only organization that uses issue ads as a loophole to understate political activity. In the Wesleyan report from early September, Crossroads GPS, another 501(c)(4) linked to GOP political strategist Karl Rove, was second only to Americans for Prosperity in ad buys by nondisclosing groups, with 16,423 ad buys in 10 contests, six of which were top Senate races. None of that spending had been reported to FEC.\n\nSince the FEC reporting window opened, GPS has spent more than $26 million against Democrats. Most of that spending has been directed at eight of the 10 most contentious Senate races this cycle; in six of them, GPS had already run ads before the reporting window opened.\n\nOne of the Senate races Crossroads added to its roster after the FEC window opened, Kentucky, was the only top Senate race Americans for Prosperity hadn\u2019t touched. That race was the sole focus of another group, one of the most notable dark money organizations of the 2014 cycle \u2014 which also has close ties to Crossroads GPS.\n\nThe Kentucky Opportunity Coalition is a 501(c)(4) social welfare group \u2014 as are Americans for Prosperity and Crossroads GPS \u2014 whose sole social welfare function appear to be getting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) re-elected. KOC first reported spending to the FEC in early June, but the group sprang to life much earlier than that.\n\nIn fact, as early as May 2013, KOC was making ads touting Mitch McConnell\u2019s leadership in the fight against Obamacare. In February 2014, the group ran radio ads warning of President Obama\u2019s War on Coal, saying McConnell has been \u201cfighting Obama\u2019s anti-coal agenda at every turn.\u201d\n\nKOC\u2019s story, as the Center for Public Integrity laid out in detail recently, is quite extraordinary. Founded in 2008,the day to day operations are handled by Scott Jennings, who has twice served in high-level positions in McConnell re-election campaigns. According to CPI, only the McConnell and Grimes campaigns have run more ads than KOC, and every single one of the 12,000 ads KOC has run in Kentucky \u2014 along with all of the ads on the group\u2019s Youtube page \u2014 mention either McConnell or Grimes.\n\nAll this despite the fact that KOC has never previously raised enough money \u2014 $50,000 \u2014 to be required to file a detailed tax return with the IRS. So far in 2014, its FEC-reported spending alone is more than $7.5 million.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "OpenSecrets Blog", "description": "It's official.
