The lower levels will be closed for reconstruction work.\n\nApart from that change, bus service to the station will not immediately change, Port Authority officials said.\n\nLater, riders will notice new retail space and loading areas, improved handicapped accessibility, and improved signage, lighting and better arrival and departure information.\n\nThe distinct 51-year-old station, with a modern design featuring 26 triangular roof sections made of concrete, is located on the Manhattan end of the bridge at 179th Street, in Washington Heights. The station handles about 5 million passenger-trips a year, or about 10,000 round-trip riders per weekday, the bulk of them NJ Transit riders.\n\nIn addition to space for local and national retail stores, the revamped station will include a new waiting area, new arrival and departure information screens, five additional bus gates, and an elevator from the subway and street-level below in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to the Port Authority.\n\nThe start of work follows an initial authorization of the project by Port Authority commissioners in 2011, before the agency entered into a public-private partnership in January 2013 with a company known as GWBBS Development Venture, LLC,\n\nWork on the GWB station comes after commissioners authorized $90 million in short-term improvements to the agency's much larger Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown last month, following demands to reduce departure delays and alleviate passenger crowding and discomfort at the terminal, which is located a block east of the Lincoln Tunnel.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@am-newsletter','@river','port-authority-ny-nj','transit','transportation'", "title": "Overhaul of GWB bus station begins Monday", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Overhaul of GWB bus station begins Monday\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/overhaul_of_gwb_bus_station_begins_monday.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/01/gwb-bus-stationjpg-281f5e4ae0618189.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13730395\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-24T20:51:25Z\", \"author\": \"Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@am-newsletter\",\"@river\",\"port-authority-ny-nj\",\"transit\",\"transportation\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/01/12133616-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The $183 million project will add gates, retail space, a new waiting area and signage, and an elevator.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@stevestrunsky"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, August 24, 2014, 10:42 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/01/gwb-bus-stationjpg-281f5e4ae0618189.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sstrunsky\", \"author_nickname\": \"Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"8361321\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The $183 million project will add gates, retail space, a new waiting area and signage, and an elevator.", "title": "Overhaul of GWB bus station begins Monday", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/overhaul_of_gwb_bus_station_begins_monday.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, August 24, 2014,  4:52 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The $183 million project will add gates, retail space, a new waiting area and signage, and an elevator."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b80\"", "article_summary": "Apart from that change, bus service to the station will not immediately change, Port Authority officials said.\nNEW YORK \u2014Thousands of New Jersey commuters will start to notice changes at the George Washington Bridge Bus Station Monday morning, when work on a yearlong $183 million overhaul of the upper Manhattan depot is scheduled to begin.\nThe station handles about 5 million passenger-trips a year, or about 10,000 round-trip riders per weekday, the bulk of them NJ Transit riders.\nLater, riders will notice new retail space and loading areas, improved handicapped accessibility, and improved signage, lighting and better arrival and departure information.\nThe distinct 51-year-old station, with a modern design featuring 26 triangular roof sections made of concrete, is located on the Manhattan end of the bridge at 179th Street, in Washington Heights."}
