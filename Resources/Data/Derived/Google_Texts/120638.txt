Winning a second term isn’t the only thing newly re-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie proved capable of this week.

Despite the countless jabs comedian Jimmy Fallon has made regarding the governor’s corpulent figure, Christie proved that he’s able to take a joke when he stopped by Fallon’s “Late Night” show Friday during his “Thank You Notes” segment.

And just a day after Christie defeated Democratic gubernatorial candidate Barbara Buono in a landslide, Fallon’s fat jokes were in full throttle.

“Chris Christie won a second term as New Jersey governor last night. We like him. He’s a good guy. Christie said he couldn’t have done it without his biggest supporter – and then his belt said, ‘Happy to help, man,'” said Fallon on his program Wednesday night.

When Fallon decided to set aside his quips and pen Christie a thank you note during his show Friday night, The Garden State’s governor popped in for a surprise appearance to extend his gratitude.

“Thank you, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, for going back for seconds,” said Fallon as he signed and sealed Christie’s note in an exaggerated manner.

Moments later, Fallon was greeted by the governor himself who offered a quick — and close — “you’re welcome.”
