Audax-Backed AllOver Media Buys Again

The advertiser is picking up Zoom Media divisions after a deal for Ripple Resort Media

AllOver Media LLC has acquired two Zoom Media divisions Â– the social indoor and family network segments.

The social indoor group owns static posters and digital screens in more than 1,600 venues, including sports bars, restaurants and clubs. The family network unit owns backlit billboards, digital screens, floor clings and other advertising space in sports and recreation centers, including arcades, bowling alleys and roller skating rinks.

Zoom Media, headquartered in New York, is a lifestyle advertising company that has more than 25,000 digital screens and 55,000 billboards. The business developed The Fitness Network, a media and marketing program located in fitness clubs.

The deal comes less than a week after AllOver announced the acquisition of Ripple Resort Media Inc., which provides ads on ski lifts at winter resorts. The business has been backed by Audax since March, when the PE firm picked it up for an undisclosed amount.

Before the Audax deal, AllOver made a few acquisitions, including Gas Station Radio in 2014 and the Wide Format Shop in 2012.

New York-based Audax has been behind a few other deals recently. In June, the group picked up surgical instruments business Katena Products, and in December, Audax sold Distribution International Inc. to Advent International.
