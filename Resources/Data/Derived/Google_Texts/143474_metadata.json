While the act clearly benefits those at the low end of the income scale \u2014 and rich people can continue to afford even the most generous plans \u2014 people like the Chapmans are caught in the uncomfortable middle: not poor enough for help, but not rich enough to be indifferent to cost.\n\n\u201cWe are just right over that line,\u201d said Ms. Chapman, who is 54 and does administrative work for a small wealth management firm. Because their plan is being canceled, she is looking for new coverage for her family, which includes Mr. Chapman, 55, a retired fireman who works on a friend\u2019s farm, and her two sons. \u201cThat\u2019s an insane amount of money,\u201d she said of their new premium. \u201cHow are you supposed to pay that?\u201d\n\nAn analysis by The New York Times shows the cost of premiums for people who just miss qualifying for subsidies varies widely across the country and rises rapidly for people in their 50s and 60s. In some places, prices can quickly approach 20 percent of a person\u2019s income.\n\nExperts consider health insurance unaffordable once it exceeds 10 percent of annual income. By that measure, a 50-year-old making $50,000 a year, or just above the qualifying limit for assistance, would find the cheapest available plan to be unaffordable in more than 170 counties around the country, ranging from Anchorage to Jackson, Miss.\n\nA 60-year-old living in Polk County, in northwestern Wisconsin, and earning $50,000 a year, for example, would have to spend more than 19 percent of his income, or $9,801 annually, to buy one of the cheapest plans available there. A person earning $45,000 would qualify for subsidies and would pay about 5 percent of his income, or $2,228, for an inexpensive plan.\n\nIn Oklahoma City, a 60-year-old earning $50,000 could buy one of the cheapest plans for about 6.6 percent of his income, or about $3,279 a year with no subsidy. If he earned $45,000, with the benefit of a subsidy, he would spend about $2,425.\n\nWhile the number of people who just miss qualifying for subsidies is unclear, many of them have made their frustration known, helping fuel criticism of the law in recent weeks. Like the Chapmans, hundreds of thousands of people have received notices that their existing plans are being canceled and that they must now pay more for new coverage.\n\nIn an effort to address that frustration, the Obama administration announced on Thursday that it would permit people whose plans had been canceled to buy bare-bones catastrophic plans, which are less expensive but offer minimal coverage. Those plans have always been available to people under 30 and to those who can prove that the least expensive plan in their area is not affordable. But the announcement does not address the concerns of those who would like to buy better coverage, yet find premiums in their area too expensive.\n\nDavid Oscar, an insurance broker in New Jersey, another high-cost state, said many of his clients had been disappointed to learn that the premiums were much more expensive than they had expected.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re frustrated,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was thinking that Obamacare was going to come in with more affordable rates. Well, they\u2019re not more affordable.\u201d\n\nMany of the biggest provisions of the Affordable Care Act are aimed squarely at the poorest of Americans. Under the law, states have the option of expanding Medicaid to a larger pool of people with the lowest incomes. To those earning more, the law provides subsidies to people earning up to four times the federal poverty level, or $45,960 for an individual and $62,040 for a couple.\n\nNinety percent of the country\u2019s uninsured population have incomes that fall below that level, according to one recent analysis. As a result, the subsidies \u201care well targeted for people who are uninsured or underinsured,\u201d said Sara R. Collins, an executive with the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that finances health policy research. \u201cThat is really where the firepower of the law is focused.\u201d\n\nFederal assistance is based on the cost of premiums for the second-cheapest silver, or midlevel, plan in a person\u2019s geographic area and are set so the amount the person must pay for coverage does not exceed a certain percentage of income, ranging from 2 to 9.5 percent.\n\nEven before the announcement on Thursday giving people with canceled plans the option of buying catastrophic coverage, the law permitted people to select such plans if the price of premiums in their area exceeded 8 percent of their income. The catastrophic plans are often less expensive and include three doctor visits and free preventive care, but require someone to pay almost all of the medical bills up to a certain amount, which is usually several thousand dollars.\n\nThat is the option that the Chapmans say they are likely to choose when their current insurance plan, which costs $665 a month, expires in September. Anthem is the only insurer offering plans in the marketplace in New Hampshire, and prices there are higher than in many other parts of the country.\n\nSome experts dismissed the varying effects of the income cutoff, saying the law\u2019s main elements benefit most of those who could not previously buy insurance.\n\n\u201cI think that job one was to make sure that the people who clearly have the greatest difficulty affording premiums receive the greatest help,\u201d said Ron Pollack, the founding executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that favored the law.\n\nTo avoid creating such steep cliffs, federal officials would have had to spend more money on the subsidies, said Larry Levitt, an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group that is closely following the health care law. Subsidies would have been higher, and could have been more gradually phased out, he said. The design \u201cwas largely driven by budgetary decisions,\u201d Mr. Levitt said.\n\nThe subsidy cutoff can seem especially arbitrary to people whose incomes vary from year to year, even if they stand to benefit from the law.\n\nChristian Johnsen, a bakery owner who lives with his wife and two children in Big Sky, Mont., and has an income of about $88,000, will probably be eligible for subsidies next year. As a result, the family could buy a midlevel insurance plan for about $697 a month.\n\nBut if the bakery does better next year, the family could be asked to pay a lot more. Without any subsidy, the same plan would cost $822.\n\nMr. Johnsen, who is 47, said he would like to buy insurance for his family. They have gone without it for the last two years, paying out of pocket on rare visits to the doctor. But he said it is hard to justify those prices to prevent an unforeseen catastrophe when so many real-world expenses demand his attention first.\n\n\u201cI know absolutely that I\u2019m going to need a new car in two years, but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to have a catastrophic accident,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of debate that happens in our house.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131220204621, "twitter": {"description": "While the Affordable Care Act clearly benefits those at the low and high ends of the income scale, many middle-class Americans don\u2019t qualify for health care subsidies, and are facing steep premium prices.", "title": "New Health Law Frustrates Many in Middle Class", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/business/new-health-law-frustrates-many-in-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/12/21/business/Cliff/Cliff-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "New Health Law Frustrates Many in Middle Class", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 20, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "news_keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "PT": "Article", "author": "KATIE THOMAS;REED ABELSON;JO CRAVEN McGINTY", "thumbnail_150": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/12/21/business/Cliff/Cliff-thumbLarge.jpg", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By KATIE THOMAS, REED ABELSON and JO CRAVEN McGINTY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "dsk": "Business Day", "lp": "While the Affordable Care Act clearly benefits those at the low and high ends of the income scale, many middle-class Americans don\u2019t qualify for health care subsidies, and are facing steep premium prices.", "tom": "News", "thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/12/21/business/Cliff/Cliff-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "While the Affordable Care Act clearly benefits those at the low and high ends of the income scale, many middle-class Americans don't qualify for health care subsidies, and are facing steep premium prices.", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 700, "CG": "business", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "dat": "December 20, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_business.gif", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "21cliff", "utime": 20131223153816, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/business/new-health-law-frustrates-many-in-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/12/21/business/Cliff/Cliff-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "While the Affordable Care Act clearly benefits those at the low and high ends of the income scale, many middle-class Americans don\u2019t qualify for health care subsidies, and are facing steep premium prices.", "title": "New Health Law Frustrates Many in Middle Class"}, "pdate": 20131220, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000002607710, "cre": "The New York Times", "emailThisHash": "QZcVKO+BVsCXx2cAy9Fzbw", "hdl": "New Health Law Frustrates Many in Middle Class", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "That is the option that the Chapmans say they are likely to choose when their current insurance plan, which costs $665 a month, expires in September.\nMr. Johnsen, who is 47, said he would like to buy insurance for his family.\nAs a result, the family could buy a midlevel insurance plan for about $697 a month.\nSome experts dismissed the varying effects of the income cutoff, saying the law\u2019s main elements benefit most of those who could not previously buy insurance.\nUnder the law, states have the option of expanding Medicaid to a larger pool of people with the lowest incomes."}
