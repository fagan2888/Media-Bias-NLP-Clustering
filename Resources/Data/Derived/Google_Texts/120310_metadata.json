The Washington Post r eported over the weekend that the military offensive \u201chas gotten off to a rocky start, with even the Syrian rebel groups closest to the United States turning against it, U.S. ally Turkey refusing to contribute and the plight of a beleaguered Kurdish town exposing the limitations of the strategy.\u201d\n\nThese might ordinarily be the sort of developments that would warrant scrutiny from Congress. Is the U.S. policy effective? Is there a smarter approach? What can the public expect in the way of results in the short- and long-term future?\n\nBut that scrutiny, at least for now, is nonexistent. Congress gave itself another 54-day vacation, and members have never authorized the military campaign that\u2019s currently underway \u2013 a detail that most lawmakers seem to find irrelevant. Maybe Congress will have a debate during the lame-duck session in November, but as far as the House GOP leadership is concerned, it can wait\n\nTo their credit, a small group of lawmakers has said Congress should promptly return to session in order to meet its constitutional obligations. Indeed, at a Senate debate in Iowa over the weekend, Rep. Bruce Braley (D) argued, \u201cI think Congress should go back into session and have a broader and longer conversation about the nature of our involvement\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nJoni Ernst\u2019s (R) response was amazing, even by Joni Ernst standards:\n\n\u201cYes, we knew this threat was there months and months and months ago and this decision could have been made earlier this year so there\u2019s no sense in calling Congress back now when this decision could have been made several months ago.\u201d\n\nThe quote comes by way of a Democratic group that recorded the debate.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of comment that raises serious questions about Ernst\u2019s basic competence as someone seeking an important federal office. If the right-wing state lawmaker had said she\u2019s confident President Obama already has the legal authority he needs, so Congress does not need to hold a debate or a vote, there would at least be a degree of substantive consistency to the position.\n\nBut Ernst is making a very different argument. The far-right Iowan believes \u201cthere\u2019s no sense\u201d in having lawmakers meet their obligations under the Constitution now, because they could have met their obligations months ago and didn\u2019t.\n\nCan anyone explain what in the world Ernst is talking about? Since when is it sensible for a Senate candidate to argue in effect, \u201cWe should have acted before so let\u2019s not act now\u201d?\n\nIn the same debate , Ernst wouldn\u2019t say whether she wants to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency and then wouldn\u2019t say what she intended to do for those who\u2019d lose health care coverage if she successfully destroyed the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt was a reminder about the curious standards of the political world in 2014. Last week, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) struggled to dodge a straightforward question about whom she voted for in the 2012 presidential election. There\u2019s no denying it was a clumsy moment for the U.S. Senate candidate, and the media\u2019s reaction was brutal, with some going so far as to describe the 30 seconds as \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, for much of the year, we\u2019ve seen Republican candidates clumsily refuse to answer equally straightforward questions about Medicaid expansion, global warming, Personhood, the minimum wage, and repealing \u201cObamacare.\u201d In the case of Arkansas\u2019 Tom Cotton, we\u2019ve even seen one Senate candidate get caught flat-out lying", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Since when is it sensible for a Senate candidate to argue in effect, \"We should have acted before so let's not act now\"?", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ernst-theres-no-sense-congressional-vote-isis", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Since when is it sensible for a Senate candidate to argue in effect, \"We should have acted before so let's not act now\"?", "title": "Ernst: there's 'no sense' in a congressional vote on ISIS", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ernst-theres-no-sense-congressional-vote-isis", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/article-teasers/joni_ernst_ia.jpg?itok=fytacXSg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ernst-theres-no-sense-congressional-vote-isis", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/article-teasers/joni_ernst_ia.jpg?itok=KWJEmJ_N", "height": 553}, "title": "Ernst: there's 'no sense' in a congressional vote on ISIS", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Since when is it sensible for a Senate candidate to argue in effect, \"We should have acted before so let's not act now\"?"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-13T11:06:39-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "election-2014,elections,iowa,isis,islamic-state-of-iraq-and-syria,joni-ernst,national-security,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Ernst: there's 'no sense' in a congressional vote on ISIS", "published": 1, "date": "10/13/2014 11:06:39 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ernst-theres-no-sense-congressional-vote-isis"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Since when is it sensible for a Senate candidate to argue in effect, \"We should have acted before so let's not act now\"?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2014, National Security, Iowa, ISIS, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Joni Ernst"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a37\"", "article_summary": "The far-right Iowan believes \u201cthere\u2019s no sense\u201d in having lawmakers meet their obligations under the Constitution now, because they could have met their obligations months ago and didn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s been over two months since the United States started launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets, and the preliminary results aren\u2019t encouraging.\nIn the same debate , Ernst wouldn\u2019t say whether she wants to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency and then wouldn\u2019t say what she intended to do for those who\u2019d lose health care coverage if she successfully destroyed the Affordable Care Act.\nIt\u2019s the sort of comment that raises serious questions about Ernst\u2019s basic competence as someone seeking an important federal office.\nWhat can the public expect in the way of results in the short- and long-term future?"}
