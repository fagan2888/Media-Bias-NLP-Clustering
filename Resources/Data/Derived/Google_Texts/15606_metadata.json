The President\u2019s radical nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, was confirmed with ten Republican votes. Without Republican votes, Lynch could not have become Attorney General. Lynch will now replace Eric Holder, the most controversial and racially divisive Attorney General in American history.\n\nIn her testimony to Congress, Lynch made it clear that she would continue the policies of her liberal predecessor, support the Obama agenda, and had no problem with the President\u2019s highly questionable use of executive power to grant amnesty to five million illegal immigrants. According to U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), \u201cThe Senate must never confirm an individual\u2026who will support and advance a scheme that violates our Constitution and eviscerates established law and congressional authority. No person who would do that should be confirmed. And we don\u2019t need to be apologetic about it, colleagues.\u201d\n\nDespite the clear warnings from Sessions and her troubling testimony, ten Republican Senators decided to confirm her to the most important law enforcement position in the country. Among the GOP \u201cturncoat ten\u201d was the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Previously, McConnell had promised to oppose Lynch if she supported the President\u2019s executive amnesty action. Thus, McConnell lied to his constituents and caved under pressure once again. It follows a disturbing trend of GOP congressional leaders refusing to take the tough action to oppose the onslaught of liberalism.\n\nIt is so bad that McConnell is being praised by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s spokesman Adam Jentleson, who said that the Majority Leader \u201chas done the right thing by bringing bills and nominations to the floor that Democrats can support.\u201d Of course this kind of bi-partisanship was absent when Reid was Senate Majority Leader. Reid consistently torpedoed legislation passed by the House. In fact, he usually prevented these bills from even being considered.\n\nWhile McConnell placates Democrats, House Republicans are not doing any better as they have provided the funding for Obamacare and the President\u2019s executive action on amnesty. They are taking no tough action on the liberal FCC\u2019s attempt to regulate and tax the Internet. Nothing of substance has been accomplished in the investigations into Benghazi, the IRS scandal, VA scandal, Fast and Furious, etc. While Holder and former IRS official Lois Lerner have been held in contempt of Congress, no real consequences have resulted from those actions.\n\nIn a Bloomberg interview, House Speaker John Boehner called Bill and Hillary Clinton, \u201cgood people\u201d and \u201cgood public servants,\u201d but he hinted that Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server might be subpoenaed and that the House may investigate her foundation\u2019s suspicious fundraising activities. On this issue, there should be no hesitation or question as the evidence mounts that Clinton turned the position of Secretary of State into a cash machine for her dubious foundation and basically sold the office.\n\nIf Republicans had any political courage, they would be holding high profile hearings and issuing subpoenas on a non-stop basis. While Democrats know how to take political advantage of a scandal, Republicans are too worried about criticism from the media and their friends in the Democratic Party.\n\nSo, the looming question is now apparent to all voters who supported Republican candidates in the mid-term elections. Why continue to support the GOP if they are going to do nothing to stop the Democrats? If the Republicans will not oppose the liberal agenda of the Democrats, when they have the power to enact a reform oriented agenda, conservatives should stop voting for them.\n\nIn effect, the Republican leadership refuses to take the gloves off, so their agenda must be to facilitate the continuation of liberalism because they are doing nothing to promote conservatism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Latest US, Louisiana News, political and business buzz  for New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other Louisiana cities", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Jeff Crouere", "og": {"url": "http://www.bayoubuzz.com/buzz/latest-buzz/item/863996-lynch-confirmation-shows-republicans-in-congress-are-spineless-worthless", "type": "article", "description": "Latest US, Louisiana News, political and business buzz  for New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other Louisiana cities", "title": "Lynch confirmation shows Republicans in Congress are spineless, worthless"}, "title": "Lynch confirmation shows Republicans in Congress are spineless, worthless", "keywords": "US, Louisiana News, Louisiana political, Louisiana politics, Louisiana business, New Orleans, Baton Rouge,  Louisiana cities, US politics, US news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca236\"", "article_summary": "While McConnell placates Democrats, House Republicans are not doing any better as they have provided the funding for Obamacare and the President\u2019s executive action on amnesty.\nThe President\u2019s radical nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, was confirmed with ten Republican votes.\nWithout Republican votes, Lynch could not have become Attorney General.\nLynch will now replace Eric Holder, the most controversial and racially divisive Attorney General in American history.\nIt happened again yesterday, a painful reminder that the GOP leadership in Congress is worthless."}
