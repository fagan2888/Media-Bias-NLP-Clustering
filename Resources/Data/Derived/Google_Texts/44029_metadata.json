A spokeswoman for the New York Medical Examiner\u2019s Office told TheWrap on Friday that the initial autopsy did not yield a cause of death for the 81-year-old comedienne, famous for her stand up and numerous television jobs, including E!\u2019s \u201cFashion Police.\u201d\n\nBecause the cause of death is not readily apparent, the NYPD is investigating the death, which occurred a week after Rivers was initially rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital. Daughter Melissa Rivers said in a statement that the comedy icon died \u201cpassed peacefully\u201d in a private room at the Manhattan hospital, \u201csurrounded by family and close friends.\u201d\n\nSee video: Anderson Cooper Remembers Joan Rivers, and Why He Didn\u2019t Like Her as a Kid\n\nThe New York State Department of Health is also looking into the circumstances surrounding Rivers death that five out seven Yelpers who wrote reviews for Yorkville Endoscopy are certain the clinic is to blame.\n\n\u201cI am glad that Yorkville Endoscopy is being investigated and they will find out that someone screwed up big time. This was a procedure that is done on a routine basis. I believe that anyone else going to this center needs now to get whatever procedure done in a proper hospital,\u201d Sandra N. from California wrote in a review. \u201cThanks a lot Yorkville for killing a woman who the day before was just fine and healthy. I hope that you have the biggest wrongful death suit filed by Melissa on your shabby procedures.
