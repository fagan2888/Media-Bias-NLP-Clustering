But only if the world embarks quickly on an intense effort over the next 15 years.\n\nThe report, released Sunday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading world organization monitoring the issue, also found that climate change can be addressed without affecting living standards, and with only a tiny reduction in economic growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already had wake-up call after wake-up call about climate science,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThis report is a wake-up call about global economic opportunity we can seize today as we lead on climate change.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the third and final installment in a series of IPCC studies on climate change. The first two concluded that warming is \u201cunequivocally\u201d caused by humans, and that if left unaddressed, it poses an enormous threat to mankind, with the potential to cause wars and mass migrations.\n\nClose video James Cameron talks climate change Chris Hayes interviews James Cameron about the amazing new Showtime series, \u201cYears of Living Dangerously\u201d. embed like save share group\n\nIn order to keep the global temperature below the 2-degree Celsius cap previously set through U.N. talks, greenhouse gas emissions will have to drop by 40-70% by 2050, the report found. In the first decade of the 21st century, emissions rose by 2.2 peryear\u2014largely thanks to population and economic growth in China and other parts of the developing world.\n\nThe U.N. is working toward a far-reaching new global climate pact, to be completed in late 2015 and to take effect in 2020. But the major challenge has been getting rich and poor nations to agree on a plan.\n\nThat issue was on display in the preparation of the new study released Sunday. According to reports, governments of many developing countries objected to a draft that included a graphic dividing the world into four categories based on average income, fearing that doing so would leave them with too much blame for rising emissions. Many developing nations see industrialized countries like the U.S. and those of western Europe as primarily responsible for warming, and therefore argue that those countries should bear the lion\u2019s share of the burden of tackling it.\n\n\u201cThis is the first step for developed countries of avoiding responsibilities and saying all countries have to assume the responsibility for climate change,\u201d Diego Pacheco, who heads the Bolivian delegation to the IPCC, told the AP.\n\nThe graphic was ultimately deleted from the final version of the report.\n\nU.N. climate talks use a different categorization, dividing the world into developed and developing countries. But developed countries object to that scheme, saying it\u2019s wrong to lump fast-growing economies like those of China and India in with the least developed countries, allowing them all to face relatively lenient emissions standards.\n\nAs for costs, the report said transitioning to low-carbon energy sources would only reduce economic growth by about 0.06 percentage points per year\u2014and that\u2019s without accounting for the economic benefits of reducing climate change.\n\n\u201cSo many of the technologies that will help us fight climate change are far cheaper, more readily available, and better performing than they were when the last IPCC assessment was released less than a decade ago,\u201d Kerry said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It\u2019s still possible to keep the global temperature at a manageable level, a U.N. report on climate change concludes.
