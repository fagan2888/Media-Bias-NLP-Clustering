A group of protesters with anti-Clinton signs stood across the street from the museum.\n\nThe former U.S. senator from New York and secretary of state spoke from a stage surrounded by youths waving American flags and signs such as Buffalo for Hillary, Women for Hillary and Cheektowaga is 4 Hillary.\n\nPoliticians from Mayor Bryon Brown, Assemblyman Sean Ryan, State Sen. Tim Kennedy, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz and Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul warmed up the crowd before Clinton took the stage. They all urged a record turnout for Clinton on primary day April 19.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Buffalo because we\u2019ve got your back,\u201d the lieutenant governor told Clinton.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s qualified, experienced and is someone who knows how to get things done,\u201d Hochul told the audience. \u201cThis is history in the making\u201d with the first woman president, she said, urging supporters to take to social media, the streets and churches to encourage Democratic voters to turn out and vote for Clinton.\n\nThe \u201cqualified\u201d remark was left over from Thursday, when Clinton supporters jumped on remarks her primary opponent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders made when calling her unqualified.\n\nSanders initially refused to walk back the accusation, while Clinton replied to questions by remarking Sanders was better than either of the top two Republican presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Buffalo is on the rise,\u201d Clinton told the audience after touring the nearby Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus where there are 12,000 jobs. \u201cWe need more success stories like this across New York and the country.\u201d\n\nClinton related a story from her 2000 campaign for the U.S. Senate in which a hotel maid gave her a snow globe with a Buffalo in it and told her, \u201cDon\u2019t forget Buffalo.\u201d The Buffalo globe is a fixture in her home, she said. \u201cI see it every day. I\u2019m not going to forget Buffalo.\u201d\n\nTwo of the things anyone wanting to be president must consider is: \u201cCan you keep us safe and can you bring our country together instead of driving it apart?\u201d Clinton said.\n\nShe said the country needed more infrastructure jobs \u2014 roads, water and sewer, and \u201chigh-speed internet to all of Western New York and America.\u201d\n\nAdvanced manufacturing will be another key sector for jobs, she said. \u201cI want to provide tax incentives to make it in America, not somewhere else.\u201d More funding is needed for research similar to what is happening at the Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus.\n\nThe country can continue to fight climate change by emphasizing green energy such as wind, solar and geothermal. The country\u2019s largest solar-panel factory is being equipped nearby at River Bend in South Buffalo, she noted, promising a half billion solar panels would be installed in her first four-year term as president.\n\nClinton said she wanted to be \u201ca small-business president\u201d and promised to expand women and minority-owned businesses. Young people have much promise as small-business entrepreneurs as well, she added.\n\nClinton also said she was proud New York, under Gov. Andrew Cuomo, agreed to raise the minimum wage. She held out hope for equal pay for women as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a family issue,\u201d she declared. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a gender discount.\u201d\n\nClinton added, \u201cEverything I just said, Republicans disagree with.\u201d\n\nWhen her husband, Bill Clinton, first ran for president in 1992 against President George H.W. Bush, his mantra was, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d With this election, Clinton told the group, \u201cThe economy is going to be at the core of the general election.\u201d\n\nIn answer to Sanders\u2019 proposal for a free college education for everyone, Clinton has proposed a \u201cdebt-free\u201d college education at any public college or university. Students and parents should be able to refinance student loans. The loans should be pegged at a percentage of income, and become paid up after 20 years, she said.\n\nClinton reminded the audience that \u201cbefore there was Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare. I learned from that loss.\u201d While Obamacare covers 90 percent of Americans, she said, \u201cWe can do 100 percent.\u201d\n\nOn other health-care issues, Clinton said she would do more to control the cost of prescription drugs and would require mental health be treated like health. \u201cWe need to start treating addiction for the health problem it is.\u201d\n\nClinton described herself as \u201ca progressive who tries to get things done.\u201d\n\nReferring to Donald Trump\u2019s statement last week that a woman and her doctor should be punished for having an abortion, Clinton said she would defend a woman\u2019s right to control her own body. \u201cDon\u2019t just ignore it,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nShe also defended Planned Parenthood, which came under fire by Republican candidates as well as in Congress.\n\n\u201cI will also work for common-sense gun safety reforms,\u201d she promised.\n\nAfter the Pierce Arrow Museum rally, Clinton made a visit to an East Side coffee shop, Golden Cup Coffee, and later at Charlie the Butcher in Cheektowaga. She then was on the way to a campaign event in Rochester.\n\n(Contact reporter Rick Miller at rmiller@oleantimesherald.com.
