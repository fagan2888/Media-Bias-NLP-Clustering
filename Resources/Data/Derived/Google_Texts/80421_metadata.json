Obviously, it\u2019s an emotional game because you find yourself on the opposite side of the team that you played for for so many years and we\u2019ve been through so much,\u201d Gasol said.\n\nHe helped Bryant lead the Lakers to two championships during his six-plus seasons in Los Angeles. Gasol left for Chicago in the summer, hoping to make another run at a title, despite Bryant\u2019s pleas to stay. And on nights like these, it\u2019s not hard to envision the Bulls advancing in the playoffs.\n\nJimmy Butler scored 21 points, and Derrick Rose added 20 points and six assists to help the Bulls win their season-high fifth straight.\n\nWith Bryant missing his second straight game, the Lakers were unable to pull off another upset. They stunned Golden State on Tuesday night but came up short against the Central division leaders.\n\nThe Bulls hung on after a 16-point second-quarter lead dwindled to two in the third. Chicago outscored the Lakers 30-16 in the fourth, sending them to their fourth loss in five games.\n\nGasol was 9 of 14 from the field in his first game against Los Angeles as a Bull.\n\nNikola Mirotic and Aaron Brooks each came off the bench to score 13 points, and the Bulls outrebounded the Lakers 57-39.\n\nIt didn\u2019t hurt that Bryant was watching from the sideline in a dark red jacket even if the Lakers were coming off a big victory without him.\n\nCarlos Boozer scored 14 points and got booed in his return to Chicago, as he often did during his four seasons with the Bulls. The Bulls used the amnesty clause to cut him last summer and create the salary-cap space to bring in Gasol and add depth to the roster.\n\n\u201cIt was weird playing against them,\u201d Boozer said. \u201cThey were like my brothers out there, but at some point you have to put the emotions and feeling aside and try to win a basketball game.\u201d\n\nWesley Johnson led Los Angeles with 19 points. Ed Davis added 13 points and 14 rebounds. Jordan Hill finished with 16 points, but the Lakers shot about 39 percent overall and went 5 of 16 from 3-point range.\n\nThey will likely have to go without Bryant again when they visit Dallas on Friday night.\n\nBryant said his knees Achilles tendons, feet and back were all bothering him, and it is unlikely he will play against the Mavericks.\n\nThe 36-year-old Bryant, in his 19th NBA season, entered Thursday third in the league in scoring at 24.6 points per game. He passed Michael Jordan for third place on the career scoring list Dec. 14 at Minnesota.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a brother to me,\u201d said Gasol, who spent a few hours with Bryant on Wednesday.\n\nThe Bulls looked as if they were on their way to an easy victory up 16 in the second, but an 11-point halftime lead quickly shrunk to two when Los Angeles started the third on an 11-2 run. Chicago was up 81-77 in the closing seconds when Gasol drove for a layup to start a 10-2 run that bumped it back up to 12 early in the fourth.\n\n\u201cI think that right now there is a belief, a lot more than there was a couple of weeks ago,\u201d Joakim Noah said. \u201cAs a player, there\u2019s nothing better than that belief that when we\u2019re on and we\u2019re competing nobody can mess with us. That\u2019s the feeling we\u2019re starting to get.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gasol had 23 points and 13 rebounds against his former team, and the Chicago Bulls beat Los Angeles 113-93 on Thursday with Lakers star Kobe Bryant resting his sore body.", "Author": "Andrew Seligman", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Gasol had 23 points and 13 rebounds against his former team, and the Chicago Bulls beat Los Angeles 113-93 on Thursday with Lakers star Kobe Bryant resting his sore body.", "title": "Pau Gasol leads Chicago Bulls past Los Angeles Lakers with Kobe Bryant out", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/26/pau-gasol-leads-bulls-past-lakers-113-93/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/26/lakers-bulls-basketballjpeg-01e19.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/26/lakers-bulls-basketballjpeg-01e19.jpg", "title": "Pau Gasol leads Chicago Bulls past Los Angeles Lakers with Kobe Bryant", "description": "Gasol had 23 points and 13 rebounds against his former team, and the Chicago Bulls beat Los Angeles 113-93 on Thursday with Lakers star Kobe Bryant resting his sore body.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Pau Gasol, Kobe Bryant, Chicago, Chicago Bulls"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfca4\"", "article_summary": "Gasol had 23 points and 13 rebounds against his former team, and the Chicago Bulls beat Los Angeles 113-93 on Thursday with Lakers star Kobe Bryant resting his sore body.\nHe helped Bryant lead the Lakers to two championships during his six-plus seasons in Los Angeles.\nGasol was 9 of 14 from the field in his first game against Los Angeles as a Bull.\nCHICAGO \u2014 There was no getting around it for Pau Gasol, no denying this was one strange and emotional night.\nCarlos Boozer scored 14 points and got booed in his return to Chicago, as he often did during his four seasons with the Bulls."}
