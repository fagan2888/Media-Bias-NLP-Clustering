The Huffington Post is mad at Rush Limbaugh again, this time after his comments on pregnancy and women’s health.

On Wednesday, Rush Limbaugh said that pregnancy is a personal choice. It doesn’t just happen out of nowhere.

Perhaps the Huffington Post is trying to reignite their base by reliving the “horror” of Limbaugh’s Sandra Fluke comments.

Rush Limbaugh — apparently not content with having caused the Sandra Fluke firestorm — waded into the birth control debate once more on his Wednesday show. This time, the subject was the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in the so-called Hobby Lobby case.

In reference to the birth control comments, Limbaugh was reiterating a question a caller posed the day before.

“We had a caller yesterday that asked me this question,” Limbaugh said. “When did birth control pills become so important to the human condition that the federal government requires every insurance policy to cover them? Eye exams, dental exams, dental work are not mandated by Obamacare, but contraception is. Birth control pills are.”

“Which is worse?” Limbaugh asked. “To go blind from lack of regular eye exams, or to get pregnant? And again, pregnancy is something that you have to do to ’cause. It doesn’t just happen to you while you’re walking down the street except in the case of sexual abuse. But in a normal, everyday flow of events, pregnancy requires action that has consequences, and yet we treat it as a great imposition that women need to be protected from. It’s a sickness. It’s a disease, it’s whatever and there’s got to be a pill for it. And yet, they wouldn’t have the problem if they didn’t do a certain thing. It’s that simple.”
