REUTERS/Gary Cameron (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH) - RTR4HB7Q\n\n4443256\n\nObamacare architect Jonathan Gruber said that the health care law was going to sting at first for American small businesses.\n\nGruber currently awaits a call-back from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to give more testimony about how Obamacare was designed. An overlooked quote from an interview Gruber gave with a local Boston public television station highlights the deception that went into the writing process: Gruber knew that Obamacare was going to hurt small businesses, despite the Obama administration\u2019s claims to the contrary.\n\nWGBH reported in May on a Cleveland pub owner\u2019s frustration with the 20 percent health insurance rate hike his business saw due to Obamacare. Gruber was interviewed, defending the law, months before his comments on \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d and the health law\u2019s deceptions hit the pages of The Daily Caller. (RELATED: Gruber: Obamacare Will NOT Be Affordable).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a transition period, says Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at MIT,\u201d WGBH reported. \u201cIt will sting at first, he says, but, \u2018once we\u2019re in this system, we\u2019re not going to see that year-to-year variability we\u2019ve seen traditionally. We\u2019re not going to see these huge swings year to year \u2014 one of your employees gets sick and all of a sudden your rates double. That goes away now.'\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the Cleveland pub owner said that the designers of Obamacare \u201cbotched it.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s admission that Obamacare would sting for small businesses fits in with other statements that he made, whether praising an anti-business left-wing political movement or calling new taxes on Americans \u201ctrivial.\u201d\n\nGruber said in 2011 that \u201cthe Occupy movement has a good, strong message and I don\u2019t want them to muddy it up \u2026 [by] protesting economics\u201d after some students walked out of an economics class as part of Occupy Boston demonstrations because a teacher was accused of \u201cconservative bias.\u201d\n\nGruber said that \u201cbasic economics is fundamentally right wing. \u2026 It\u2019s not about bias; it\u2019s how the free market works\u201d and that to eliminate bias in teaching one must \u201cacknowledge [that fact] and \u2026 approach things even-handedly.\u201d\n\nGruber said at a Center for American Progress event with Democratic politician Martha Coakley that the penalty levied by Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate for uninsured Americans was \u201ctrivial.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he Congressional Budget Committee estimates that about 1 percent of the population will end up paying this penalty. This is not a broad new tax on the middle class. It is trivial,\u201d Gruber said.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Health law architect awaits call from Congress", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber said that the health care law was going to sting at first for American small businesses.
