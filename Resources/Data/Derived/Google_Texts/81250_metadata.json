Ryan/GLOBE STAFF\n\nThe State House is filled with activists and advocates, all hoping their lobbying efforts will yield new laws. We\u2019ve invited some of them to answer our own questionnaire.\n\nNAME: Megan Amundson\n\nORGANIZATION: NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts\n\nYEARS WORKED THERE: 3\n\nWhat\u2019s your top legislative/policy priority this session?\n\nA bill ensuring that all women in Massachusetts can access birth control with no copay, as promised by the Affordable Care Act. Insurers in our state, and across the country, are exploiting loopholes in the ACA regulations, a problem that is further exacerbated by the US Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision. We are also fighting for everyone to be able to access health care confidentially \u2014 including reproductive health care, STI testing, and mental health visits.\n\nWhom would it benefit most?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a person who wouldn\u2019t benefit from this, but low-income women generally are most impacted by barriers to affordable reproductive health care. If women can\u2019t afford out-of-pocket expenses for health care, they go without.\n\nWho are your biggest champions in the State House?\n\nA number of women in the Legislature feel passionately about this issue. But you might be also surprised by the number of men in the Legislature who sponsor and actively push our bills. And we\u2019re really excited about the state Senate\u2019s new leadership.\n\nWhat gives you reason to be hopeful?\n\nLast year the Legislature passed two new bills to expand women\u2019s safe access to health care, and in November voters elected a pro-choice majority in the Legislature. That gives us tremendous momentum. Massachusetts can buck the national trend of chipping away at access to health care and actually expand access to services for women and families.\n\nWhat gives you reason to be cautious?\n\nIssues around women\u2019s health tend to be perceived as far more controversial than they actually are. Massachusetts voters and residents are overwhelmingly supportive of access to reproductive health care. NARAL is building campaigns to get more voters to tell their legislators they support policies that will make Massachusetts a national leader on this issue.\n\nWhat\u2019s your proudest accomplishment at work?\n\nI\u2019m so proud of the response that my team put together to combat the US Supreme Court\u2019s McCullen decision to strike down the Massachusetts buffer zone law. Coupled with the Hobby Lobby decision that gave employers the right to deny their female workers access to certain kinds of birth control, it was a disheartening week for NARAL and our partners. But we channeled our disappointment into planning \u201cThe Supreme Rally\u201d and turned out over 1,000 people, pro-choice politicians, and even Governor [Deval] Patrick in downtown Boston.\n\nWho\u2019s your role model/hero?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are many women I look up to, and Congresswoman Katherine Clark is at the top of the list. She has the ability to take strong stands without alienating stakeholders or being pigeonholed. Even if she disagrees with you or doesn\u2019t support your issue, you walk away from your interaction with her respecting her more.\n\nWhat book are you reading now?\n\nJudy Blume\u2019s \u201cSummer Sisters\u201d (for probably the fifth time). There is a raw truth in her writing that so few people put into words. And her characters make the secret things you think and feel seem normal, which is so important for young women to realize.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest misconception about your group?\n\nMany people think all we do is work on abortion, and we only fight for policies to support women. At NARAL, we truly believe in the right to self-determination about our bodies, and we fight for access to the full range of reproductive health care \u2014 preventing unwanted pregnancies, accessing safe and legal abortion, and bearing healthy children. That is why we fought so hard to pass the anti-shackling law last spring \u2014 so that all women have access to safe and humane prenatal and postpartum health care. [That law banned shackling prisoners who are pregnant, in labor, or in the postpartum period.] We also support campaigns like earned sick time and raising the minimum wage because we know that economic security is essential for women and families to make the reproductive health care decisions that are right for them.\n\nWhat was your most recent interaction with the Baker administration?\n\nI called Governor [Charlie] Baker to congratulate him on his victory. He campaigned on supporting women and families across the Commonwealth, and we look forward to working with his administration.\n\nHow did it go?\n\nI hope he feels, as I do, that we can build a positive working relationship moving forward.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.1738551428", "eomportal-id": 158037, "description": "The State House is filled with activists and advocates, all hoping their lobbying efforts will yield new laws.
