Sitting in his campaign headquarters beneath a portrait of his movie-star father, Robert Mitchum, congressional candidate Chris Mitchum said his new office proves the economy needs help. \u201cOut of business,\u201d said Mitchum of the luxury brand\u2019s previous shop. \u201cThere was nobody to rent it. This is what is happening to our country.\u201d\n\nOpening the doors to the public for the first time Friday afternoon, Mitchum, 70, was surrounded by a small group of Republicans \u2014 and a self-identified Independent \u2014 who ate sushi and drank wine to celebrate the start of campaign season. Mitchum is running against incumbent Lois Capps for California\u2019s 24th Congressional District, and much of the room was draped with red, white, and blue campaign signs. On either side of the entryway to his desk space were two flags \u2014 a California and an American \u2014 strategically placed just as they are in congressional offices all over Washington.\n\nMitchum falls into the camp of movie actors who jumped into politics. And perhaps his ability to memorize scripts comes in handy when speaking with reporters. At the start of our 30-minute conversation, he stuck to his talking points, emphasizing the structure of a constitutional republic and the opportunity for success for all. \u201cSquare pegs don\u2019t fit into round holes,\u201d he said and called the current government \u201ctop heavy\u201d and \u201calmost tyrannical.\u201d\n\nThough he said little about Capps \u2014 who has held the House seat for 16 years, a point her opponents increasingly stress \u2014 Mitchum did say he could not think of one issue where the two saw eye to eye. He touched on everything from the Israel-Palestine crisis to fracking to bond measures to immigrant children to sexual assaults on college campuses.\n\nMitchum is unequivocally conservative. Obama has \u201cabsolutely\u201d not been doing enough to help the Israelis, Mitchum said, and the United States should give them whatever they ask for. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t need to do is send tens of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid into Hamas.\u201d And he feigns no political correctness. \u201cYou don\u2019t sit there and try to help your enemy against your friend,\u201d he said.\n\nMitchum also talked about energy and said that for areas rich in oil and gas, drilling means more jobs and paying down debt. \u201cAll you have to do is look at North Dakota and Texas. There\u2019s about 2 percent unemployment,\u201d he noted. Though he claims to support Senate Bill 4 \u2014 which will put in place safeguards to regulate fracking in California \u2014 he frankly opposes Measure P, which would ban fracking and acidizing on unincorporated land in Santa Barbara County. Though it would not close down existing operations immediately, the ban could require industry officials to obtain a permit from the county to repair pipes on existing operations. \u201cIt will put companies out of business,\u201d he argued and said 18,000 people in the county depend on oil companies for a living while another $10 million in royalties goes to public schools and fire departments. \u201cGone,\u201d he repeated.\n\nSpeaking of money for schools, Mitchum also described himself as an \u201canti-tax\u201d guy and said the problem with bond measures \u2014 like the $288 million bond SBCC placed on the November ballot \u2014 is that college students vote for them but skip town a few years later, leaving property owners like himself with the bills.\n\nAnd what about immigrant children? \u201cSend them home,\u201d Mitchum said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He could not say to what extent the problem exists in the area but added it\u2019s going to be a problem everywhere. \u201cThey are flying them into Massachusetts, for God\u2019s sakes.\u201d\n\nCalling Obamacare a disaster, Mitchum said there are specific things that could be done to get the cost down: major court reform on doctor malpractice and opening up the state borders to increase competition. \u201cWe have the best health care in the world. The problem was that it was too expensive,\u201d said Mitchum, and he proposed to get people involved in the process, perhaps through a system that utilizes a health-care savings account.\n\nHeading his campaign is Tab Berg, who founded Tab Communications in 2001 and has managed a number of political and public relations campaigns. According to Berg\u2019s website, his clients have included a number of California Republicans including San Luis Obispo Supervisor Debbie Arnold, Representative Brian Bilbray, and Representative Paul Cook. Prior to that, he served as chief of staff for two state legislators.\n\nWith congressional politics in the Central Coast as predictable as the weather, Berg and Mitchum have a lot of work ahead of them. And by the end of June, Capps had raised almost 10 times the money \u2014 with more than $1.6 million in her campaign piggy bank. It appears Capps can wheel and deal too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2014/07/28/07252014_Chris_Mitchum_0021.jpg", "description": "Former Actor Looks To Unseat Lois Capps In The House Of Representatives.", "title": "Meeting Congressional Candidate Chris Mitchum"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "Former Actor Looks To Unseat Lois Capps In The House Of Representatives.", "title": "Meeting Congressional Candidate Chris Mitchum"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd21\"", "article_summary": "Sitting in his campaign headquarters beneath a portrait of his movie-star father, Robert Mitchum, congressional candidate Chris Mitchum said his new office proves the economy needs help.\nMitchum is running against incumbent Lois Capps for California\u2019s 24th Congressional District, and much of the room was draped with red, white, and blue campaign signs.\nWith congressional politics in the Central Coast as predictable as the weather, Berg and Mitchum have a lot of work ahead of them.\nObama has \u201cabsolutely\u201d not been doing enough to help the Israelis, Mitchum said, and the United States should give them whatever they ask for.\nMitchum also talked about energy and said that for areas rich in oil and gas, drilling means more jobs and paying down debt."}
