PIMA, introduced by Reps. Kevin Brady (R-TX) and Jim McDermott (D-WA), would help strengthen and preserve Medicare for future generations by helping to prevent valuable resources from being stolen or misused. PIMA removes Social Security numbers from Medicare cards, fights prescription drug abuse, and includes portions of the Preventing and Reducing Improper Medicare and Medicaid Expenditures (PRIME) Act, authored by Reps. Peter Roskam (R-IL) and John Carney (D-DE), that AARP has also endorsed.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of AARP\u2019s nearly 38 million members and the many millions of Americans with Medicare, we applaud the advancement of PIMA,\u201d said AARP Senior Vice President Joyce Rogers. \u201cAARP is committed to improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our nation\u2019s health care system. This bipartisan legislation will help older Americans by rooting out and preventing waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare program.\u201d\n\nAARP has been working hard for many years to fight health care fraud, including educating its members about how to protect themselves from fraud and encouraging them to report fraudulent activity when it occurs. Waste, fraud, and abuse increase the cost of health care for both individuals and the health care system.\n\n# # #\n\n\n\nAbout AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
