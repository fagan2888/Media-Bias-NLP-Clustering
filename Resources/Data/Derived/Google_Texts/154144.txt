Notice I said “tries.”

And that’s MSNBC! I’m sure they’ve already gotten a furious phone call from the White House.

How long did our moral, ethical, and intellectual betters in the government have to put this whole Obamacare thing together? It’s been a while, right? They were supposed to be ready by today, yes? It was going to be a big deal and everything. I’m almost positive I heard that somewhere.

Well, I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before the government makes health care more efficient and less expensive. Just like the government does with everything else. Yay!!!
