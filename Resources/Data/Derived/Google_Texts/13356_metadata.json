(John Roberts deflected the last one, as you might recall.) The basics are simple. Section 1311 of the law authorizes the states to develop their own ObamaCare exchanges. Section 1321 says that, if a state declines, the feds can step in and develop their own exchange for consumers in that state instead. That\u2019s how we ended up with the technological marvel that is Healthcare.gov. The rub comes in Section 1401, which authorizes tax credits, i.e. premium subsidies, for anyone who\u2019s in \u201can Exchange established by the State under 1311\u201d. Wait a sec \u2014 does that mean that only people enrolled in state-run exchanges get subsidies? If people enrolled in the federal exchange get them too, why doesn\u2019t Section 1401 say \u201can Exchange established by the State under 1311 or the federal government under section 1321\u201c?\n\nThere\u2019s a simple explanation, say critics like Jonathan Adler: Congress intentionally limited subsidies to state-run exchanges to give the states an incentive to set up their own exchange. The feds didn\u2019t want to build Healthcare.gov; they\u2019d prefer that each state deal with this themselves. But since they can\u2019t force states to do the federal government\u2019s bidding, the best they can do is tack on monetary inducements to get them to play ball. That\u2019s where the subsidies come in. If you\u2019re a governor who\u2019s on the fence about whether to build an exchange or not, the prospect of sugar from Uncle Sam for your constituents helps sweeten the pot. Read Adler\u2019s post about this from December 2012 citing a colloquy that Max Baucus, the so-called architect of ObamaCare, had on this subject with John Ensign while the law was still being drafted. That\u2019s the proof that Congress intended to distinguish between state-run exchanges and the federal exchange on subsidies. It\u2019s not a drafting error or the result of Congress, to paraphrase Nancy Pelosi, passing the bill only to find out later what\u2019s in it. The subsidies restriction for states was always supposed to be in there.\n\nNot so, says Judge Paul Friedman, a Clinton appointee. The overall legislative history of O-Care leaves it unclear whether Congress intended this or not, one colloquy between two members notwithstanding. (In fact, he ignores what Baucus said.) When the meaning of the statute is in doubt, the court has to look to other provisions to glean intent and to the overall purpose of the statute. Would Congress really have passed the Affordable Care Act while leaving millions of consumers in dozens of states without access to subsidies to make their new coverage more affordable?\n\nThe federal subsidies are critical to the law because they reduce monthly premiums, in some cases drastically, for the vast majority of people buying coverage on new online insurance marketplaces. Starting this year, most Americans must have health insurance or face a fine\u2026 District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman sided with the federal government, saying that the phrase was out of context. \u201cOne cannot look at just a few isolated words \u2026 but also must at least look at the other statutory provisions to which it refers,\u201d Friedman wrote in his 39-page opinion\u2026 \u201cCongress did not mean to exclude residents of two-thirds of the states from premium tax credits,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a consumer advocate and health law professor at Washington and Lee University. \u201cJudge Friedman had little trouble finding that the statute clearly authorizes premium tax credits to be granted through federal exchanges.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the opinion. The key bits start halfway through page 26 and run for 11 pages. On the core question, the difference between a state exchange under Section 1311 and a federal exchange under Section 1321, Friedman says that there\u2019s no meaningful distinction at all. Don\u2019t think of Healthcare.gov as a \u201cfederal exchange\u201d; think of it as a collection of state exchanges that are being run by the feds for the state.\n\nThat idea, of the feds acting on behalf of a state rather than setting up their own qualitatively different exchange mechanism, is completely rejected by Adler and his co-author Michael Cannon. \u201cIf a state chooses not to dance,\u201d Cannon wrote in November 2012, \u201cSection 1321 doesn\u2019t instruct the federal government to step inside (read: commandeer) the state\u2019s dancing shoes. It directs the federal government put on its own dancing shoes, and to follow all the dance steps listed in Title I. Since the language restricting tax credits to state-created Exchanges appears in\u2014you guessed it\u2014Title I, federal Exchanges are bound by that restriction.\u201d\n\nThe rest of Friedman\u2019s opinion is essentially a battle with Adler et al. over inferences that can be fairly drawn from the text of the ObamaCare statute and the legislative history about Congress\u2019s intent. If you take all of Section 1312 as literally as Adler takes the part about state exchanges, argues Friedman, the federal exchange wouldn\u2019t be able to enroll anyone since there\u2019s no specific separate definition of what makes someone a \u201cqualified individual\u201d eligible for federal enrollment \u2014 and yet, neither the plaintiffs nor defendants dispute that the feds can enroll people. If you want more tea-leaf-reading about congressional intent along those lines, dive on into Friedman\u2019s opinion. The larger point here, though, I think, is that federal judges will be reluctant to nuke America\u2019s new insurance regime based on what\u2019s arguably a drafting error. To have a district court tell millions of people that they\u2019re SOL when it comes to Uncle Sam keeping his promise to help them pay for their expensive new insurance, you need evidence of congressional intent that\u2019s overwhelming, no matter what the text of the statute itself says. At least, if you\u2019re in front of a Democratic appointee you do.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Money.", "title": "Federal judge: No, the ObamaCare statute doesn\u2019t limit subsidies to state-run exchanges", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/15/federal-judge-no-the-obamacare-statute-doesnt-limit-subsidies-to-state-run-exchanges/", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fr1.jpg", "height": 225}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-15T20:21:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-15T19:45:45+00:00"}, "keywords": "exchange, federal, IRS, judge, ObamaCare, regulation, rule, subsidies,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9efd\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s the proof that Congress intended to distinguish between state-run exchanges and the federal exchange on subsidies.\nDon\u2019t think of Healthcare.gov as a \u201cfederal exchange\u201d; think of it as a collection of state exchanges that are being run by the feds for the state.\nIf people enrolled in the federal exchange get them too, why doesn\u2019t Section 1401 say \u201can Exchange established by the State under 1311 or the federal government under section 1321\u201c?\nSince the language restricting tax credits to state-created Exchanges appears in\u2014you guessed it\u2014Title I, federal Exchanges are bound by that restriction.\u201dThe rest of Friedman\u2019s opinion is essentially a battle with Adler et al.\nWait a sec \u2014 does that mean that only people enrolled in state-run exchanges get subsidies?"}
