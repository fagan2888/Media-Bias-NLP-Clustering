A stop-loss policy, which is designed to cover the occasional or rare \u201cpop-up\u201d claim, reimburses a company, not the employee.\n\nEmployers self-fund their claims because it is cheaper than paying for similar coverage in the traditional fully-insured market. Individual claims above $1 million are known as catastrophic claims as they are large enough to bankrupt a company if not properly managed.\n\nWith self-funding comes more risk. Companies or third-party administrators need an accurate handle on their claims data if they are going to self-fund their claims.\n\nThe rise in the number of catastrophic claims came from complications surrounding infants, premature births and newborns with congenital anomalies. The diagnoses stemmed from normal pregnancies that then turned into catastrophic claims, the company also said.\n\n\u201cSun Life is seeing more catastrophe stop-loss claims with higher price tags,\u201d James said.\n\nStop-loss insurance expert Ryan Siemers, a principal at Aegis Risk, told InsuranceNewsNet that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which took effect Jan. 1, would likely thrust stop-loss insurance into a new era.\n\nHigher claim severity and frequency isn\u2019t exactly a surprise. The ACA\u2019s unlimited lifetime maximum payments for underlying medical plans and the ACA\u2019s mandate that employers cover more lives has pointed to higher claims payments.\n\nClaims are more expensive and more frequent.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate costs will only continue to rise as new technologies are adopted, advanced drug therapies are introduced and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) increases access for participants,\u201d James said.\n\nRanked by aggregate cost, malignant forms of cancer were the top catastrophic medical condition from 2010 to 2013 with a value of paid stop-loss claims of $347.9 million, or 17.5 percent of all paid stop-loss payments that Sun Life made to policyholders over the four-year period, the company said.\n\nChronic and end-stage renal diseases were next with a value of paid stop loss claims reaching $164.3 million, or 8.2 percent of all paid stop-loss claims over the past four years.\n\nOther forms of cancer \u2014 leukemia, lymphoma and myelomas \u2014 were the third-most expensive conditions with $159 million reimbursed to stop-loss policyholders, or 8 percent of stop loss claims over the past four years, Sun Life said.\n\nThe top three conditions represent 34 percent of all stop-loss claims payments made by Sun Life to policyholders from 2010 to 2013.\n\nStop-loss insurance carriers, like all insurance companies, work with brokers and advisors to calculate how much companies need to set aside in reserve to pay for stop-loss claims.\n\nBefore the era of unlimited lifetime maximums, stop-loss carriers relied on predictable claims histories from employers, but that is changing: claimants in excess of $1 million, once \u201ca rare event,\u201d are more common, Siemers said.\n\nSiemers conducts the annual Aegis Medical Stop Loss Premium Survey. Last year\u2019s survey measured 224 employers covering about 450,000 with $145 million in annual stop-loss premium.\n\nSun Life and Aegis recommend employers implement wellness and early illness detection programs to limit the number of catastrophic medical claims. Sun Life and Aegis also suggest companies working with predictive modeling and data analytics companies .\n\n\u201cSelf-insured employers, brokers and third-party administrators have the chance to implement cost containment strategies that protect both their employee\u2019s quality of care as well as the company\u2019s bottom line,\u201d said Laura Rollinson, stop-loss claims director for Sun Life.\n\nDeveloping a top-notch stop-loss strategy can be a \u201cwin for all parties,\u201d Rollinson said.\n\nCyril Tuohy is a writer based in Pennsylvania.
