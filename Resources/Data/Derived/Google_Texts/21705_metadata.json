I want to see that end.\u201d\n\nHowarth \u2014 who spent his career in government, politics and nonprofit work before retiring in 2014 \u2014 is filing to run for the seat currently held by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Roanoke County.\n\nGoodlatte, a 12-term incumbent and chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, is seeking re-election and facing a primary challenge from Harry Griego of Roanoke County.\n\nGriego, a pilot, ran for the House of Delegates last year with the endorsement of the Roanoke Tea Party. He came close to upsetting an incumbent in a primary contest for the 17th District statehouse seat.\n\nIn this year\u2019s elections, Howarth is the only Democrat so far to announce for the congressional seat. The party is gathering May 21 at a district convention in Lexington to pick its nominee. Candidates have until Friday to file for consideration.\n\nThe 6th District covers part or all of 19 localities spanning from Roanoke north through the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nOn Tuesday, Howarth said he was spurred to run for office by his growing concerns about the partisan divide in D.C.\n\n\u201cWe have this bitter partisanship that is getting nothing done,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many times have Republicans in the House voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act? It\u2019s an empty gesture. They know the votes in the Senate aren\u2019t there. But they keep doing it, apparently, just to fire up their base.\u201d\n\nHowarth said he hopes to help serve as an \u201carchitect for a renewed democracy\u201d built on respect and a focus on fixing problems.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when Republicans and Democrats worked together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to that.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Howarth said he\u2019d be an advocate for strengthening the Voting Rights Act, raising the minimum wage and adopting a \u201ccomprehensive and compassionate\u201d immigration policy.\n\nPrior to retiring, Howarth spent more than nine years working in the D.C. area as director of The Father McKenna Center, a Catholic nonprofit that runs a homeless shelter, food pantry and other programs.\n\nHis resume also includes past stints working for the Department of Commerce during the Carter administration, serving as a legislative aide for U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., in the 1980s and working as a lobbyist for Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n\nHowarth is married with two adult children and three grandchildren. In January, he became chairman of the local Warren County Democratic Committee.\n\nThis is his first run for public office. He said he\u2019s in the process of setting up his campaign and plans to hold a formal kickoff shortly before the May 21 nominating convention.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "congress,6th district,goodlatte,politics,virginia", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "Calling for a renewed democracy, Tom Howarth, a Democrat from Front Royal, confirmed Tuesday he\u2019s seeking the party\u2019s nomination to run for the 6th District U.S. House of Representatives seat.", "title": "Democrat announces in 6th Congressional District race", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/democrat-announces-in-th-congressional-district-race/article_ef47165b-cf78-5a41-91ce-0959c95b439a.html", "image": {"width": 538, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/88/b8897be2-6d50-576b-989c-6cec7451c829/572946137733d.image.jpg?resize=538%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "congress,6th district,goodlatte,politics,virginia", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "description": "Calling for a renewed democracy, Tom Howarth, a Democrat from Front Royal, confirmed Tuesday he\u2019s seeking the party\u2019s nomination to run for the 6th District U.S. House of Representatives seat."}, "article_summary": "Calling for a renewed democracy, Tom Howarth, a Democrat from Front Royal, confirmed Tuesday he\u2019s seeking the party\u2019s nomination to run for the 6th District U.S. House of Representatives seat.\nHe came close to upsetting an incumbent in a primary contest for the 17th District statehouse seat.\nThe 6th District covers part or all of 19 localities spanning from Roanoke north through the Shenandoah Valley.\nIn this year\u2019s elections, Howarth is the only Democrat so far to announce for the congressional seat.\nGriego, a pilot, ran for the House of Delegates last year with the endorsement of the Roanoke Tea Party."}
