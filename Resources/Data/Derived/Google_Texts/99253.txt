A man with a bullhorn interrupted Hillary Clinton on Sunday during a speech she was giving in San Diego.

The heckler, sporting a suit and tie, sounded a loud alarm with the bullhorn and began shouting at the former Secretary of State before he was quickly removed by security. It's not immediately clear why the man interrupted Clinton's remarks.

Clinton, who was giving a speech on the importance of early language development at the American Academy of Pediatrics, was initially startled by the loud noise, but made light of the man's interruption.

"You know there are some people who miss important developmental stages," Clinton said.

And with an audience of roughly 3,000 people, Clinton also took the opportunity to tout the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, saying it has increased the number of insured children and parents.
