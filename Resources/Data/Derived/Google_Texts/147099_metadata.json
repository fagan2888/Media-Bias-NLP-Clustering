Cisco CSCO, -0.07% which had previously moved beyond networking gear to server systems, had said Whiptail\u2019s technology could help boost the performance of those systems.\n\nBut Cisco said Friday it would discontinue the resulting line of products, known as Invicta, as part of recent efforts to narrow its focus on the most promising businesses. A Cisco spokeswoman said some employees would lose their jobs, but she declined to disclose how many people would be affected.\n\nCisco entered the storage market despite the risk of angering longtime partners that sold competing hardware. Tim Stammers, a senior analyst at 451 Research, said the company tried to use other terms than \u201cdata storage\u201d when discussing Invicta, a tactic he called a \u201csilly dance.\u201d\n\nThe Invicta products also suffered from technical problems, Mr. Stammers noted. The Cisco spokeswoman said the company recently held shipments for several months while it addressed the issues.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Cisco Systems Inc. said it would stop selling data-storage hardware, a business that it entered with its $415 million acquisition of Whiptail in 2013.", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Don Clark", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Cisco Systems Inc. said it would stop selling data-storage hardware, a business that it entered with its $415 million acquisition of Whiptail in 2013.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cisco-getting-out-of-data-storage-hardware-2015-07-24", "author": "Don Clark", "parsely-title": "Cisco getting out of data-storage hardware", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-07-24T17:00:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Cisco Systems Inc. said it would stop selling data-storage hardware, a business that it entered with its $415 million acquisition of Whiptail in 2013.", "title": "Cisco getting out of data-storage hardware", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cisco-getting-out-of-data-storage-hardware-2015-07-24", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "article.id": "609A03F2-3246-11E5-866C-441BE557F8AE", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "A Cisco spokeswoman said some employees would lose their jobs, but she declined to disclose how many people would be affected.\nThe Cisco spokeswoman said the company recently held shipments for several months while it addressed the issues.\nCisco entered the storage market despite the risk of angering longtime partners that sold competing hardware.\nBy Don ClarkCisco Systems Inc. said it would stop selling data-storage hardware, a business that it entered with its $415 million acquisition of Whiptail in 2013.\nBut Cisco said Friday it would discontinue the resulting line of products, known as Invicta, as part of recent efforts to narrow its focus on the most promising businesses."}
