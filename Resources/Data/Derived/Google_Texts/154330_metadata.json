Peter King (R-NY) characterized the execution of Foley as effectively \u201ca declaration of war\u201d that demands a U.S. military response.\n\nRelated: Perry Calls for More U.S. Troops, Airstrikes in Iraq\n\nThe administration and many members of Congress share a growing alarm about the threat posed by ISIS. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other Senate Republican leaders were pressing Obama to take \u201curgent action\u201d even before the killing of Foley.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ), a leading congressional hawk, on Thursday told Fox News, \u201cWe have to defeat ISIS, and we have to do whatever is necessary,\u201d including expanding the current U.S. fighter jet attacks on ISIS forces beyond Iraq and into Syria.\n\nHe said that ISIS already has \u201cobliterated the boundary between Iraq and Syria,\u201d and that \u201cwe have to go in\u201d and do more than merely \u201cpinprick airstrikes.\u201d\n\nRelated: Failure to Rescue Foley Shows Special Ops Limitations\n\nBut exactly what the U.S. and its allies can do to thwart ISIS is a complicated question. So far, the president has authorized limited airstrikes against ISIS personnel and equipment in Northern Iraq, mainly to protect civilians and to support Iraqi and Kurdish troops who are defending the key city of Erbil and attempting to reclaim some of the territory the extremists have taken over.\n\nISIS, a hardline Sunni group, is currently fighting on multiple fronts. In Syria, it is battling the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, a man whose military has indiscriminately slaughtered hundreds of thousands of his own citizens. There is little question that attacking ISIS in Syria would have the effect of helping cement the position of a man viewed by much of the world as an egregious war criminal.\n\nThen there is the question of Iran. A Shia-dominated society, Iran is staunchly opposed to the Sunni worldview of ISIS, which sees Shi\u2019ites as apostates deserving death. Iranian fighters are currently fighting ISIS in northern Iraq. However, Iran is hardly an ally of the United States, and is an avowed enemy of U.S. ally Israel.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the fact that Iran has sent soldiers and materiel to Syria to support Assad, and has also brought in fighters from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which the United States considers a terrorist organization.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Use of ISIL, Not ISIS, Tells Another Story\n\nSo, if the U.S. starts dropping bombs on ISIS in Syria \u2013 it will also, in effect, have allied itself with terrorists.\n\nWorse, according to experts, is that there is no way to \u2013 in Kerry\u2019s words \u2013 assure that ISIS is \u201ccrushed\u201d without sending ground troops into Syria.\n\n\u201cClearly, [ISIS], which has a long history and has an origin dating back to al Qaeda in Iraq, has gained capacity as they advanced across Iraq and gained heavy weaponry,\u201d Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, told reporters Friday on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\n\n\u201cThey pose a greater threat today than they did six months ago,\u201d he said, according to the Washington Examiner. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do what\u2019s necessary to deal with this counter-terrorism challenge.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference yesterday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin E. Dempsey described ISIS as \u201can organization that has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, the current regime of airstrikes, even if expanded well beyond the current scope, would not be enough to destroy ISIS. \u201cCan they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in Syria? The answer is no,\u201d said Dempsey.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s 3 Options for Bringing Foley\u2019s Killer to Justice\n\nThough he did not come right out and say it, Dempsey\u2019s message was that dealing with ISIS will require soldiers on the ground in Iraq and Syria actively pursuing and attacking its fighters. President Obama has categorically refused to send U.S. combat troops back to Iraq.\n\nDempsey, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who appeared with him at the press conference at the Pentagon, both said they were not suggesting that increased U.S. involvement is imminent, or even likely. This leaves open the question of whether \u2013 or even if \u2013 significant action will be taken.\n\nWhile the price of a broad attack against ISIS would be high, the political costs of inaction are also becoming apparent.\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry, seen as a potential contender for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, criticized the Obama administration\u2019s response to ISIS in a speech yesterday. Perry suggested that ISIS is likely to send some of its members who hold Western passports to attack the United States, and called for an increased air campaign and more U.S. personnel on the ground. (On Friday, the Pentagon pushed back against Perry, saying there was no indication ISIS fighters had entered the U.S.)\n\nRelated: Reporter\u2019s Execution Could Unleash U.S. Against ISIS\n\nWith Congress on vacation, it is difficult to gauge the extent of sentiment on Capitol Hill for a far more aggressive strategy that potentially could result in a return of U.S. troops to Iraq and an expansion of air attacks into Syria.\n\nThe New York Times reported yesterday that \u201ca wider conflict could put lawmakers, particularly Democrats, in a difficult position, since most deeply oppose any new war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost Democrats and Republicans are extraordinarily wary of being sucked into a large occupation, both because it will kill a lot of Americans and because we saw in Iraq the last time that it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told The Times.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Politicians in the U.S. are adamant that something needs to be done about the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria \u2013 but exactly what that is will be difficult to figure out.", "title": "The ISIS Dilemma Confronting Obama", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/22/ISIS-Dilemma-Confronting-Obama", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/22/ISIS-Dilemma-Confronting-Obama", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Politicians in the U.S. are adamant that something needs to be done about the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria \u2013 but exactly what that is will be difficult to figure out.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Troops, Airstrikes in IraqThe administration and many members of Congress share a growing alarm about the threat posed by ISIS.\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Use of ISIL, Not ISIS, Tells Another StorySo, if the U.S. starts dropping bombs on ISIS in Syria \u2013 it will also, in effect, have allied itself with terrorists.\nTexas Governor Rick Perry, seen as a potential contender for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, criticized the Obama administration\u2019s response to ISIS in a speech yesterday.\nA Shia-dominated society, Iran is staunchly opposed to the Sunni worldview of ISIS, which sees Shi\u2019ites as apostates deserving death.\nWorse, according to experts, is that there is no way to \u2013 in Kerry\u2019s words \u2013 assure that ISIS is \u201ccrushed\u201d without sending ground troops into Syria."}
