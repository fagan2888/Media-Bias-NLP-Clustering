The Senate quickly followed suit, passing the measure 65-33 with many conservatives and a handful of Democrats casting \u201cnay\u201d votes.\n\nThe bill now goes to President Obama, who is expected to sign. Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement that \u201cthe agreement is not perfect, but it will help grow our economy, bolster our security, and it reflects governing by consensus, not the governing by crisis we\u2019ve seen too often of late.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, the House came together to ensure our government is open and working for the American people,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). \u201cThis bipartisan compromise secures meaningful wins for Republicans and the American people, such as the repeal of the outdated, anti-growth ban on oil exports. The legislation strengthens our military and protects Americans from terrorist threats, while limiting the overreach of intrusive government bureaucracies like the IRS and the EPA.\u201d\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, of Nevada, characterized the spending plan as \u201ca good compromise\u201d and \u201cgood legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we say \u2018compromise,\u2019 it doesn't mean anyone is doing away with their principles,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWhat it simply means is that people can't be bullheaded and unreasonable in what they are doing to accomplish their goals.\u201d\n\nBut the measure received pushback from conservatives. The House Freedom Caucus, consisting of lawmakers from the GOP\u2019s right wing, lined up in opposition.\n\n\u201cThis deal is an affront to open, accountable and limited government,\u201d the caucus said in a statement. \u201cIt plunges our nation into debt to the tune of nearly $20 trillion, busts the spending caps enacted by Congress just a few years ago, perpetuates our looming entitlement crisis by pilfering money from Social Security and contains budget and accounting gimmicks that are manifestly fraudulent.\u201d\n\nBut the caucus proved unable to stand in the way. Legislative Democrats and Republicans, along with White House representatives, having been working nonstop for weeks to arrive at a deal, which comes more than two-and-a-half months after the beginning of the fiscal year. The government has been running on stopgap spending measures until differences could be ironed out.\n\nThe final issue delaying an agreement centered on Republican desires to end the 40-year ban on crude oil exports, a measure enacted during an era of fuel shortages that the energy industry has desperately sought to repeal. Democrats sought to retain the law, citing environmental concerns.\n\nDuring negotiations, Reid said Democrats \u201cmade very clear to Republicans that if they insist on including the oil export ban, there must be included in this robust policies to reduce our carbon emissions and encourage the use of renewable energy.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth eventually proved successful: Republicans attained their goal of lifting the export ban while Democrats in return managed to insert several conservation measures. The bill extends tax incentives for wind, solar, geothermal, and other technologies that Reid said will \u201ccreate and protect over 100,000 jobs in the clean energy sector.\u201d A five-year extension of wind and solar credits is aimed at reducing carbon emissions by roughly 25 percent by the year 2020.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, of California, wasn\u2019t thrilled with the outcome but urged her party to support the omnibus nonetheless, asserting that the compromise further empowered Democrats to reject GOP demands.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I was dismayed by Republicans\u2019 insistence on lifting the oil export ban in the Omnibus,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, Republicans\u2019 desperate thirst for lifting the oil export ban empowered Democrats to win significant concessions throughout the Omnibus, including ridding the bill of scores of deeply destructive poison pill riders.\u201d\n\nReid agreed, noting that \u201cmany troublesome provisions the Democrats fought to exclude didn't wind up in the legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen this matter came from the House, there were more than 200 so-called riders and they didn't wind up in the bill,\u201d Reid said. \u201cMany of these riders represented the worst of legislative priorities: weaken Dodd-Frank banking regulations; undermine the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule; roll back the National Labor Relations Board's joint employer standard; eliminate protections for clean air, water, land, and climate; weaken the consumer protection bureau's ability to protect consumers; curb the president's powers under the Antiquities Act to create national monuments; and destroy the candidate contribution limits.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also failed in their efforts to defund Planned Parenthood in the wake of the release of undercover videos appearing to show the women\u2019s health organization negotiating over the price of selling recovered tissues from aborted fetuses for research \u2013 a claim rejected by the organization. And it doesn\u2019t block administration plans to admit about 10,000 Syrian refugees looking to escape the civil war in that country. Some Republicans sought to stop their arrival out of security concerns.\n\n\u201cI concluded that while I detest lifting the oil export ban, I will not empower Big Oil to upend so many victories for hard-working American families,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, called the oil export ban \u201ca relic of the past\u201d that \u201chas cost our economy jobs\u201d and strengthened oil exporters like Iran and Russia. The repeal, he asserted, \u201cwill support jobs and grow the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that Russia views its energy resources as a foreign policy tool,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt is no secret that Iran views its energy resources as a component of national power, nor is it a secret that President Obama recently granted the Iranian regime permission to export those resources. Many think it is time the American people were treated at least as fairly as Iran.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said the deal represents \u201ca critical step forward\u201d in bolstering national security.\n\n\u201cWe know that preventing another crisis in military readiness will require significant investments over the near, medium, and the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cFor instance, our air campaign over Syria and Iraq has our Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force flying sorties that will further stress the readiness of the force, and those planes need to be maintained, repaired, and ultimately replaced.\u201d\n\nThe package, he said, will \u201cfinally ensure our military has more of the funding it needs to train, equip, and confront the threats we face from terrorist groups like ISIL and countries like Iran.\u201d\n\nIn supporting the deal, McConnell also said it will enact critical reforms to address myriad problems within the Veterans Administration, reform the Visa Waiver Program at a time of \u201cnew and evolving terror threats, prevent the transfer of terrorists detained at Guantanamo and adopt a new cyber security information sharing measure.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also noted the spending bill will enact reforms to \u201croot out waste\u201d within the Internal Revenue Service aimed at addressing controversies like the one where the agency allegedly targeted conservative groups. And it will prevent a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare despite opposition from the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThis legislation is worth supporting,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt doesn't mean this is the legislation I would have written on my own. It doesn't mean this is the legislation Speaker Ryan would have written on his own either. It is not perfect, and we certainly didn't get everything we wanted. But it made strides in it defending our nation at a time of global unrest. It advances conservative priorities in several areas and enacts significant reform in several areas on everything from tax relief to energy policy to cyber security.\u201d\n\nReid agreed.\n\n\u201cI say again, this compromise isn't perfect, but it is good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is good for the American people. And if it weren't for Democratic efforts, it would have been a lot worse.\u201d\n\nPraise was far from unanimous, particularly among conservatives.\n\n\u201cThe cons definitively outweigh the pros in this omnibus,\u201d said Sen. David Vitter (R-La.). \u201cNot only does this massive spending bill put a tremendous burden on the taxpayers by actually increasing spending, but it continues government funding for abortion mills like Planned Parenthood and allows more Syrian refugees to come into the United States without any safeguards in place. This giant omnibus spending bill defies our core American values and it continues us on an unsustainable path of overspending and debt.\u201d\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said the Omnibus is \u201cchock full of controversial policies that never would have passed had they been exposed to the light of day.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only does this bill spend an additional half-billion dollars on an unreformed and failing Head Start program, not only does this bill airdrop an entire cybersecurity bill which lacks important protections for privacy and personal information, but according to the White House, this bill also fully funds President Obama\u2019s Paris climate fund,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cNone of these policy changes would have passed by themselves. These are highly controversial policies and merit an open and honest debate on the Senate floor. It is an insult to this body, the Constitution, and the American people, that the least trusted institution in America is planning to sneak these policies through without public scrutiny or amendment. We have doubled down on everything the American people can\u2019t stand about Washington, and many are now congratulating each other for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "'Tis the Season: Congress Passes $1 Trillion-Plus in Spending at 11th Hour", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "News and Politics", "description": "Conservative caucus calls deal 'an affront to open, accountable and limited government.'", "title": "'Tis the Season: Congress Passes $1 Trillion-Plus in Spending at 11th Hour", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2015/12/18/tis-the-season-congress-passes-1-trillion-plus-in-spending-at-11th-hour/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/news-and-politics/user-content/50/files/2015/12/shutterstock_232656265.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "updated_time": 1464306298, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative caucus calls deal 'an affront to open, accountable and limited government.'", "title": "'Tis the Season: Congress Passes $1 Trillion-Plus in Spending at 11th Hour", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2015/12/18/tis-the-season-congress-passes-1-trillion-plus-in-spending-at-11th-hour/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/news-and-politics/user-content/50/files/2015/12/shutterstock_232656265.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "'Tis the Season: Congress Passes $1 Trillion-Plus in Spending at 11th Hour", "pinterestDescription": "'Tis the Season: Congress Passes $1 Trillion-Plus in Spending at 11th Hour", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "house freedom caucus, conservative caucus, omnibus, spending bill, harry reid, mitch mcconnell", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPersonally, I was dismayed by Republicans\u2019 insistence on lifting the oil export ban in the Omnibus,\u201d she said.\n'Tis the Season: Congress Passes $1 Trillion-Plus in Spending at 11th HourWASHINGTON \u2013 After months of wrangling and backroom negotiations, the House and Senate settled on a $1.1 trillion spending package for the current fiscal year despite strong resistance from congressional conservatives.\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, called the oil export ban \u201ca relic of the past\u201d that \u201chas cost our economy jobs\u201d and strengthened oil exporters like Iran and Russia.\n\u201cI concluded that while I detest lifting the oil export ban, I will not empower Big Oil to upend so many victories for hard-working American families,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\u201cThis bipartisan compromise secures meaningful wins for Republicans and the American people, such as the repeal of the outdated, anti-growth ban on oil exports."}
