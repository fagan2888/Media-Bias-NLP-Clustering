While being nice is perceived as increasing a woman\u2019s femininity and making her more sexually attractive, women seem rather unmoved by responsive men. Although the researchers are not exactly clear on the reasoning for this, they do present rather interesting hypotheses to explain why.\n\nResponsive Individuals\n\nResearchers from the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, the University of Rochester, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign conducted a study to see why people respond differently to \u201cresponsive\u201d individuals, a recent press release reported. A responsive individual is described as someone who is supportive of another\u2019s needs and goals.\n\nPast studies revealed that men perceived a responsive woman as being more feminine, more attractive, and more sexually desirable. Heightened sexual arousal was also linked to a greater desire for a long-term relationship with that partner. \u201cWe wanted to understand the reasons for these gender differences: What makes a responsive woman sexually attractive and what makes a responsive man less sexually attractive,\u201d lead researcher Gurit Birnbaum told Medical Daily in an e-mail.\n\nResults For Females Aren\u2019t As Clear\n\nBeing responsive did not make the men seem any less masculine, but it also did not seem to affect women\u2019s sexual desires as strongly. \u201cSome women, for example, may interpret responsiveness negatively and feel uncomfortable about a new acquaintance who seems to want to be close,\u201d said Birnbaum in the press release. \u201cOther women may perceive a responsive stranger as warm and caring and therefore as a desirable long-term partner.\"\n\nThe study\u2019s authors write that their findings \u201cindicate that the elusive spark of attraction in initial encounters may be influenced by perceived responsiveness.\u201d In short it seems that it\u2019s not exactly the trait of being nice that determines sexual desirability, but rather how other perceive this trait. With men the trait of responsiveness seems to be more commonly perceived as a position attribution, where with women perception is not as clear cut.\n\nNice Guys\n\nWomen may say that they are looking for a \u201cnice guy\u201d in a potential mate but the results from the study suggest that being too nice is not likely to get you very far on a first date. Birnbaum suggested that men should \u201cslow learn to pace themselves\u2026 if their goal is to instill sexual desire.\u201d Women are more cautious towards responsive strangers, but the reasoning for this remains unknown. \u201cIt may not necessarily have to do with 'being nice. Women may perceive a responsive stranger as less desirable for different reasons,\" explained Birnbaum. The researchers hypothesized that \u201cniceness\u201d in men may be seen as being inappropriate or manipulative, being too eager to please, and even desperate. \u201cWomen may perceive a responsive man as vulnerable and less dominant,\u201d Birnbaum added.\n\nWhy We Need To Know The Laws Of Attraction\n\nBirnbaum told Medical Daily that her study emphasizes the desire-intimacy paradox. \u201cBecause sex is a prominent context in which people seek a sense of felt understanding and caring, it is easy to understand why the need for more intimacy is likely to increase the desire for sex with a partner.\u201d Deeper understanding of how the opposite sex views responsiveness can help a partner to strengthen their existing relationships. \u201cBoth scholars and lay people should be aware of these different meaning [people may assign to responsiveness] if they want to predict the effect of expressions if intimacy on sexual interest,\u201d concluded Birnbaum.\n\nSource: Birnbaum GE, Ein-Dor T, Reis HT, Segal N.
