The State Department has acknowledged that practice has tainted its open records searches, and the administration is now scrambling to deal with the legal headache Mrs. Clinton left.\n\nIn the case of the EPA, the agency has said it is trying to produce cell records, but has said the process is taking a while because staffers are blacking out phone numbers associated with Ms. McCarthy\u2019s \u201cfriends.\u201d That troubled Mr. Smith, who said those friends could also be the very folks Ms. McCarthy was talking business with, citing her close relations with environmental group leaders.\n\nIndeed, the one text message the EPA said Ms. McCarthy has received that related to business was from Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, who praised her on Feb. 5 for fighting against the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nMs. McCarthy replied back to that text by email, telling Mr. Karpinski: \u201cI do not use text messaging for work purposes.\u201d\n\nThe exchange came just days after the Science Committee informed the EPA it was looking into Ms. McCarthy\u2019s text practices, and, in his letter, Mr. Smith pointed out Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Karpinski seemed to have a long relationship, which was incongruous with the nature of her reply to his Feb. 5 text.\n\nLast year the EPA officially informed the National Archives, charged with overseeing federal records, that the deletion of thousands of Ms. McCarthy\u2019s emails may have resulted in official records being lost. The Archives is supposed to be notified any time an agency realizes records may have been destroyed.\n\nThe EPA insisted the notification was a matter of caution, and it didn\u2019t believe records were lost. The agency argues that text messages don\u2019t usually qualify as records because they are transitory in nature.\n\nEPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia told The Washington Times her agency will work to get the committee the documents it is seeking.\n\n\u201cEPA is committed to both the letter and the spirit of the law when it comes to records management and transparency,\u201d she said.\n\nChris Horner, a researcher who first tried to pry the text messages loose from the agency in an open records request, said he and the Competitive Enterprise Institute are currently battling in court to stop \u201cEPA\u2019s cyberbonfire.\u201d\n\nMr. Horner also doubted EPA\u2019s claim that Ms. McCarthy didn\u2019t regularly use text messages for business. He said data EPA has already provided show she \u201coften\u201d exchanged texts with senior aides on their EPA-assigned phones.\n\nHe said EPA officials appear to have turned to text messages to try to avoid the scrutiny that emails and other traditional communications receive from the public and Congress. But Mr. Horner said federal law is clear and considers text messages the same as emails for the purposes of records retention.\n\nBoth written and electronic federal agency records are required to be preserved, similar to emails, but not every communication is deemed to be a record. As more communications are done online, states and federal agencies are increasingly grappling with those questions.\n\nA Washington Times sample survey of federal agencies earlier this year found that most don\u2019t have a policy governing whether employees should be preserving and storing those kinds of electronic communications.\n\nMr. Smith has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on records-retention policies, and has invited officials from the National Archives to attend. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s records could be raised as an issue at the hearing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sensing a cover-up, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology issued a subpoena Wednesday demanding the EPA chief turn over her cellphone records and emails so investigators can try to figure out if she hid or deleted text messages in what one critic called a \"cyberbonfire.\"", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Sensing a cover-up, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology issued a subpoena Wednesday demanding the EPA chief turn over her cellphone records and emails so investigators can try to figure out if she hid or deleted text messages in what one critic called a \u201ccyberbonfire.\u201d", "title": "Congress subpoenas EPA chief\u2019s cellphone records", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/25/congress-subpoenas-epa-chiefs-cellphone-records/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/24/Governors.JPEG-09c2a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/24/Governors.JPEG-09c2a.jpg", "title": "Congress subpoenas EPA chief\u2019s cellphone records", "description": "Sensing a cover-up, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology issued a subpoena Wednesday demanding the EPA chief turn over her cellphone records and emails so investigators can try to fig", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Environmental Protection Agency, Lamar Smith, Gina Mccarthy, Hillary Rodham Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec78\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Smith has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on records-retention policies, and has invited officials from the National Archives to attend.\nThe agency argues that text messages don\u2019t usually qualify as records because they are transitory in nature.\nBut Mr. Horner said federal law is clear and considers text messages the same as emails for the purposes of records retention.\nBoth written and electronic federal agency records are required to be preserved, similar to emails, but not every communication is deemed to be a record.\nHe said EPA officials appear to have turned to text messages to try to avoid the scrutiny that emails and other traditional communications receive from the public and Congress."}
