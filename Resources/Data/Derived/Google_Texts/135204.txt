April 24 marks the day, 100 years ago, that Ottoman Turkey launched a systematic, pre-planned, mass extermination of its indigenous Armenian population. One and a half million Armenians perished.

The tragedy was so horrific that it led Raphael Lemkin, a Holocaust survivor and lawyer, to coin the word "genocide." He sought to fully encompass the enormity of what befell the Armenians, and what became a precursor for the Holocaust.

My father was a 6 year old at the onset of the genocide.

His father was killed outright. His mother forced into a long death march to the desert.

My father, along with other children, was also forced onto a march. He endured years of prolonged and severe deprivations. He miraculously survived.

After World War I, he and remaining orphans were taken to Lebanon by the American Near East Relief (NER). Orphanages and schools were set up by NER for their care. The director of one orphanage, Dr. Stanley Kerr, became my father's mentor. He guided my father all the way through medical school. For my family, Dr. Kerr and his wife Elsa represented the wondrousness of Americans, and the America we had all heard about.

Today Turkey relentlessly denies that the horrors begun April 24, 1915, constitute genocide.

My father's only wish was for acknowledgement.
