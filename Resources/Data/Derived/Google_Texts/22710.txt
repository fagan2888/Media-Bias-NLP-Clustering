A 19-year-old woman is accused of abandoning her dead baby in a Johnson County cave while a man allegedly burned the baby's body.

Johnson County Prosecuting Attorney Lynn Stoppy announced Friday evening that charges have been filed after two biology students found the baby's body on Tuesday in the Pertle Springs Recreation Park. The University of Central Missouri owns the park.

Latasha Wilson, 19, of Warrensburg, was charged with abandoning a corpse, which is a felony. Zakary Carter, 20, of Warrensburg was charged with tampering with evidence.

Stoppy is waiting on the results of an autopsy to determine how the baby boy died before deciding whether to file additional charges.

According to court documents, Wilson was taken into police custody on Friday and admitted that she had given birth to a son in January.

"Sometime after the delivery, Wilson discovered that the baby was deceased," according to court records. "Wilson stated that she, along with Zakary Carter, took baby boy Wilson to a cave at Pertle Springs Park to dispose of the baby inside the cave. Carter later returned to the cave and burned the body of baby boy Wilson to try and destroy evidence."

Bond has not been set.
