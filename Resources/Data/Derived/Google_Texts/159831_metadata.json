Earlier this week, President Barack Obama subjected himself to Zach Galifianakis' bumble-headed interviewer from the comedian's \"Between Two Ferns\" online series on Funny or Die \u2014 a play that led to a 40 percent jump in traffic to HealthCare.gov.\n\nToday, the Obama administration has turned to celebrities' moms \u2014 and agency Droga5 \u2014 to provide another last-minute push. In a new video released on YouTube, the mamas of actor Jonah Hill and musicians Jennifer Lopez, Alicia Keys and Adam Levine reminisce about their progeny when they were just kids \u2014 how gifted they were as little ones, and how much they had to \"put up with\" as their parents. But one thing no mother should have to worry about, the argument goes, is whether their children's health will be protected.\n\n\"Seriously, do you want your mothers to have a nervous breakdown?\" says Sharon Feldstein, Jonah Hill's mother.\n\n(There's no mention of the fact that under the government's healthcare program, children can remain insured under the parents' policies until the age of 26.)\n\nThe FLOTUS herself then caps off the vid with her own plea: \"We nag you because we love you, so go to HealthCare.gov and enroll today.\"\n\n\"As everyone's original healthcare providers, they earned the right\" to promote this cause, said Droga5 Creative Chairman David Droga of the thinking behind the mom-focus. He said each of the mothers riffed before the camera and worked with no script.\n\nOther mom-focused videos are on the way, he said, including the one below focusing on the best-friend moms of Mr. Levine and Mr. Hill.\n\n(This article first appeared on the website of Crain's sister publication Ad Age.)", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Ann-Christine Diaz", "timeCrawled": "20160526_18:57:02", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "title": "White House enlists celeb moms in last-minute Obamacare push", "taxo_Industries": "Insurance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "White House enlists celeb moms in last-minute Obamacare push"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Do you want us to have a nervous breakdown?
