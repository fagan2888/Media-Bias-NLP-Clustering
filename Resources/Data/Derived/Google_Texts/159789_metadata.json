In a copy of Schaerr\u2019s departure email to colleagues at the firm, Schaerr writes that he\u2019s taking the Utah case \u2018so that I can fulfill what I have come to see as a religious and family duty: defending the constitutionality of traditional marriage in the state where my church is headquartered and where most of my family resides.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s alarming that the reason Gene Schaerr gives for taking this position has nothing to do with the U.S. Constitution or the legal issues at play,\u2019 said Fred Sainz, HRC Vice President of Communications. \u2018Schaerr\u2019s entire motivation for taking this anti-equality case is to impose a certain religious viewpoint on all Utahns \u2014 and that\u2019s wrong. When you become an attorney, you take an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution, not any particular religious doctrine.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cSchaerr\u2019s language in his departure e-mail places a heavy emphasis on religion, which is out-of-step with many of the arguments against marriage equality that have come out of the Utah Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s interesting that his stated motivation for the new position is not one of the arguments made by the State of Utah,\u2019 added Sainz. \u2018It\u2019s fair to question whether all of the arguments they have made are just an elaborate front for some other agenda.'\u201d\n\nThis strikes me as badly wrong, and indeed deeply unfair to religious believers. Lawyers decide to take cases based on their personal moral values all the time. Lawyers decide to take government cases based on their personal moral values, and indeed seek out certain government jobs based on their personal moral values. Pro-gay-rights lawyers might choose to take pro-gay-rights cases based on their personal moral values \u2014 including ones that seek to impose a certain moral viewpoint, such as that embodied in various antidiscrimination statutes, on all citizens.\n\nNor are lawyers whose moral values are based on secular philosophical principles (e.g., a humanist commitment to equal treatment, including legally coerced equal treatment) somehow have special moral or legal rights on this score. Lawyers whose moral values are based on religious principles, or whose commitment to a case is inspired by their religious principles, have precisely the same rights.\n\nSay someone wanted to defended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in court because he has deep religious beliefs in favor of racial equality \u2014 the civil rights movement, of course, had a heavily religious dimension to it. Or say someone wants to defend environmental legislation because of his religious beliefs about human obligation to protect God\u2019s creation. Or say someone wanted to defend state opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act because of his deep anti-slavery religious principles. These lawyers stand on precisely the same moral and legal footing, I think, as lawyers who took the same views out of secular moral conviction.\n\nNor is there anything odd that the lawyer\u2019s \u201cstated motivation\u201d for his taking a case isn\u2019t \u201cone of the arguments made\u201d as a legal defense of the case. Someone may defend the Affordable Care Act in court against a Commerce Clause challenge because he believes that everyone is morally entitled to health care \u2014 indeed, because he believes that God wants everyone to get health care \u2014 even though the legal dispute is about Congressional power and the interpretation of the Constitution.\n\nIndeed, officers of the court \u201ctake an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution, not any particular religious doctrine.\u201d Likewise, they take an oath to uphold the Constitution, not the moral views of the Human Rights Campaign. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with their religious anti-same-sex-marriage ideology, or their secular pro-gay-rights ideology, leading them to choose a particular case, client, or job. Gene Schaerr, I strongly suspect, sincerely believes that the Constitution doesn\u2019t prohibit opposite-sex-only marriage rules. (A sincere belief in the theoretical constitutional soundness of one\u2019s position generally isn\u2019t a requirement for a lawyer who is working for a client, but I strongly suspect that such a sincere belief is present here.) And even if his underlying reason for choosing this particular constitutional case is his religious beliefs, there\u2019s nothing to condemn about that.\n\nNaturally, if you want to criticize Schaerr\u2019s position as constitutionally or morally misguided, that\u2019s just fine. But the fact that he chose to defend that position for religious reasons \u2014 as opposed to secular ideological reasons \u2014 should not be a basis for criticism.\n\nThanks to How Appealing for the pointer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The error in the Human Rights Campaign's condemnation of the lawyer handling Utah's defense of opposite-sex-only marriage rules.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The error in the Human Rights Campaign's condemnation of the lawyer handling Utah's defense of opposite-sex-only marriage rules.", "title": "Is it wrong for lawyers to take cases based on their religious values?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/01/23/is-it-wrong-for-lawyers-to-take-cases-based-on-their-religious-values/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@volokhc"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/01/23/is-it-wrong-for-lawyers-to-take-cases-based-on-their-religious-values/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "Lawyers decide to take government cases based on their personal moral values, and indeed seek out certain government jobs based on their personal moral values.\nLawyers decide to take cases based on their personal moral values all the time.\nLawyers whose moral values are based on religious principles, or whose commitment to a case is inspired by their religious principles, have precisely the same rights.\nPro-gay-rights lawyers might choose to take pro-gay-rights cases based on their personal moral values \u2014 including ones that seek to impose a certain moral viewpoint, such as that embodied in various antidiscrimination statutes, on all citizens.\nNor are lawyers whose moral values are based on secular philosophical principles (e.g., a humanist commitment to equal treatment, including legally coerced equal treatment) somehow have special moral or legal rights on this score."}
