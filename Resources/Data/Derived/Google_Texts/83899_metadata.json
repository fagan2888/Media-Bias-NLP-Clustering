The discussion of the agreement among Iranians at times echoes the American discussion, but is also much deeper and wider. Reports in Iranian media, as well as our own correspondence and conversations with dozens of Iranians, both in the country and in exile, reveal a public dialogue that stretches beyond the details of the agreement to include the very future of Iran. And it seems that everyone from the supreme leader to the Iranian American executive in Silicon Valley, from the taxi driver in Isfahan to the dissident from Evin Prison, is engaged. The coalitions for and against the deal tend to correlate closely with those for and against internal political reform and normalized relations with the West. The mere fact that there is such a debate says something about the nature of the Islamic Republic of Iran today. Iran is a dictatorship. One man, the supreme leader, has most of the power. He is the commander in chief and thus formally controls the military, the very powerful internal militia, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and its external wing, the Quds Force. The supreme leader appoints the head of the judiciary, the head of the Iranian national radio and television organization, and most of the National Security Council\u2014an advisory body similar to the U.S. National Security Council. He also controls tens of billions of dollars in revenues from religious endowments and foundations. And, as stated in the constitution, he is the spiritual leader of the country, combining religious and political power in one office. Related Story Iran's Incremental Revolution And yet nowadays the supreme leader does not decide everything on his own. Some formal institutions of the Iranian regime, and a myriad of informal interest-group networks, also play a role in shaping policy, including on the nuclear deal. Most importantly, the Iranian president has some political autonomy. Through his control of the Guardian Council\u2014a committee of 12 men that among other things must approve every candidate wishing to run for elective office\u2014the supreme leader decides who is allowed to run for president. But once the list of candidates is determined, the vote is usually competitive, giving the chief executive an electoral mandate directly from the people. In the last presidential election, candidates ideologically closest to the supreme leader garnered only a few million votes, while the one candidate running as a reformer, Hassan Rouhani, received more than 18 million votes. Rouhani\u2019s wide margin of victory strengthened his position as a partially independent actor within the Iranian regime. In addition to the president, other groups have obtained some political autonomy within Iran\u2019s fractured authoritarianism. Civil society is constrained but still fighting. A vibrant underground of publishing, theater, music, and poetry continues to spread. Divides exist even among the clerics. Conservatives still dominate, but several top clerics have voiced their support for Iran\u2019s reformist forces and criticized\u2014sometimes openly, sometimes more discreetly\u2014conservative policies. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\u2019s own brother, Hadi Khamenei, recently described the eight-year presidency of Rouhani\u2019s predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as some of the \u201cdarkest [years] in the history of the country,\u201d adding that the conservatives are trying to \u201cgive a bad image to the reformists.\u201d This political system\u2014authoritarian but with pockets of pluralism\u2014has created the relatively permissive conditions for a serious, public debate about the nuclear deal.\n\nMoreover, in refraining from taking a firm public position for or against the agreement, Khamenei himself has encouraged this debate. Given the extent of Khamenei\u2019s control, the Iranian negotiators could not have signed the accord without his approval. In public, however, the supreme leader has refrained from praising the work of his negotiating team, saying only that the deal must be ratified through the proper \u201clegal channels\u201d and will not change Iranian policy toward the \u201carrogant U.S. government.\u201d Khamenei\u2019s mixed signals have allowed others to speak out more forcefully on the nuclear pact. Rouhani crushed his conservative opponents in the 2013 presidential election in part because he advocated for a nuclear deal. This agreement is his Obamacare. Those supporting the deal include moderates inside the government, many opposition leaders, a majority of Iranian citizens, and many in the Iranian American diaspora\u2014a disparate group that has rarely agreed on anything until now. First and most obviously, the moderates within the regime, including Rouhani and his close friend and political ally, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, negotiated the agreement, and are now the most vocal in defending it against Iranian hawks. Rouhani crushed his conservative opponents in the last presidential election in 2013 in part because he advocated for a nuclear deal. This agreement is his Obamacare\u2014his major campaign promise now delivered. Former Presidents Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami, as well as moderates in the parliament and elsewhere in government, have also vigorously endorsed the accord. During the negotiations, Rafsanjani, for example, celebrated the fact that Iran\u2019s leaders had \u201cbroken a taboo\u201d in talking directly to the United States. Since the agreement was signed, he has said that those within Iran who oppose it are \u201cmaking a mistake.\u201d Second and somewhat surprisingly, many prominent opposition leaders also support the deal. Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a popular presidential candidate in 2009 who is now under house arrest for his leadership of the Green Movement protests against Ahmadinejad\u2019s reelection, backed the pursuit of the agreement, albeit with some qualifications. He\u2019s joined by other government critics, some only recently released from Iran\u2019s prisons. Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human-rights activist and Nobel laureate now living in exile, expressed the hope after an interim agreement was reached in April that \u201cnegotiations come to a conclusion, because the sanctions have made the people poorer\u201d; she labeled as \u201cextremists\u201d those who opposed the agreement in Iran and America. Akbar Ganji, an Iranian journalist who spent more than six years in prison in Iran, also praised the agreement, writing that \u201cstep-by-step nuclear accords, the lifting of economic sanctions and the improvement of the relations between Iran and Western powers will gradually remove the warlike and securitized environment from Iran.\u201d\n\nPolls show that most Iranians agree with these positions, and public opinion is apparent not just in the Iranian government\u2019s numbers but also in the results of earlier surveys conducted by the University of Maryland and Tehran University. The sentiments of many ordinary Iranians were manifest in the spontaneous demonstrations of joy that took place in many Iranian cities after the agreement was announced. If the deal represents Iran\u2019s reengagement with the world\u2014more trade, more investment, more travel, more normalcy\u2014all of these trends would undermine the theocracy. A new poll also indicates that two-thirds of Iranian Americans favor the agreement, and our own conversations with members of the Iranian diaspora bear this out. The Islamic Republic has long enjoyed some defense from a handful of non-governmental organizations in the West, but support for the nuclear deal stretches much deeper into the diaspora and includes those who despise Tehran\u2019s theocracy. For instance, many prominent Iranian American business leaders have told us they approve of the accord. Iranian American foundations and community-service organizations have issued statements backing the deal, while also calling for renewed focus on political reforms inside Iran. Even many of those who had to flee the country after the 1979 revolution, and have since helped fund projects to encourage democracy inside Iran (including, in the past, our own Iran Democracy Project at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution), support it. There are exceptions. Some in the diaspora still believe that only more pressure, and if need be a military attack, will bring down the Islamic Republic. But the number of Iranian Americans who are at once critical of the regime and supportive of the nuclear deal is striking. This coalition has multiple motivations for favoring the deal. A number of Iranians simply want sanctions lifted. Some moderates within the regime may want to reduce international pressure on Iran as a means to preserve the power structure. And it\u2019s safe to assume that a few Iranian American business leaders see new trade opportunities in the diplomatic achievement. But the agreement could also serve as a first step in alleviating the problems of ordinary Iranian citizens. If the deal represents the beginning of Iran\u2019s reengagement with the outside world\u2014more trade, more investment, more space inside Iran for the private sector, more travel, more normalcy\u2014all of these trends would undermine the ideological, emotional, and irrational impulses of the theocracy. Especially in the context of an aging supreme leader, a newly elected reformist president, and a young, post-revolutionary population, the nuclear deal offers an opportunity for Iran to modernize politically and economically. Even dissidents sitting in jail or exile have expressed these views. Ganji, for instance, argued that \u201cif there are friendly relations between Iran and Western powers, led by the United States, the West will be able to exert more positive influence on Iran to improve its state of human rights.\u201d Conversely, members of this coalition have voiced fears that a collapse of the deal would only reaffirm the United States as the enemy of Iran\u2014the Great Satan\u2014and thereby strengthen the hardliners internally. Issa Saharkhiz, a journalist who spent four years in prison, recently warned that such a collapse could bring \u201cIranian versions of ISIS\u201d\u2014a reference to Shiite conservatives and their militant allies\u2014to power in the country.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why the most militantly authoritarian, conservative, and anti-Western leaders and groups within Iran oppose the deal. This coalition is formidable and includes former President Ahmadinejad, the Iranian leader who denied the Holocaust and called for the elimination of Israel. Fereydoon Abbasi, who directed Iran\u2019s nuclear program under Ahmadinejad, and Saeed Jalili, the former nuclear negotiator, have repeatedly sniped at the deal. In a biting interview, Abbasi ripped into every facet of the talks, saying that the negotiators, \u201cespecially Mr. Rouhani ... have accepted the premise that [Iran] is guilty.\u201d Several conservative clerics and IRGC commanders have expressed similar sentiments. One prominent critic of the deal claimed that of the 19 redlines stipulated by the supreme leader, 18 and a half had been compromised in the current agreement. Many publications considered close to Khamenei\u2014including most noticeably the daily paper Kayhan\u2014have been unsparing in their criticism. Conservative opponents of the deal tend to emphasize its near-term negative security consequences. They point out that the agreement will roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was intended to deter an American or Israeli attack, and thereby increase Iran\u2019s vulnerability. They have denounced the system for inspecting Iranian nuclear facilities as an intelligence bonanza for the CIA. And they have issued blistering attacks on the incompetence of Iran\u2019s negotiating team, claiming that negotiators caved on many key issues and were outmaneuvered by more clever and sinister American diplomats. And yet such antagonism appears to be about more than the agreement\u2019s clauses and annexes. The deal\u2019s hardline adversaries also seem concerned about the same longer-term consequences that the moderates embrace. For instance, IRGC leaders must worry that a lifting of sanctions will undermine their business arrangements for contraband trade. In a not-too-discreet reference to these concerns, Rouhani declared them to be \u201cpeddlers of sanctions,\u201d adding that \u201cthey are angry at the agreement\u201d while the people of Iran pay the price for their profiteering. Over time, more exposure to the wider world of commerce is likely to diminish if not destroy the IRGC\u2019s lucrative no-bid government contracts for infrastructure and construction projects.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The agreement has divided Iranians into camps that could shape the future of the country.", "author": "Abbas Milani and Michael McFaul", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Comparing the debate in America and the Islamic Republic\u2014and why it matters", "title": "What Do Iranians Think of the Iran Deal?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/08/RTX10ND6/facebook.jpg?1439313107", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/iran-deal-politics-rouhani-khamenei/400985/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Rouhani crushed his conservative opponents in the 2013 presidential election in part because he advocated for a nuclear deal.\nThe nuclear deal with Iran has sparked a vigorous debate not only in the United States, but in Iran as well.\nRouhani crushed his conservative opponents in the last presidential election in 2013 in part because he advocated for a nuclear deal.\nFereydoon Abbasi, who directed Iran\u2019s nuclear program under Ahmadinejad, and Saeed Jalili, the former nuclear negotiator, have repeatedly sniped at the deal.\nRelated Story Iran's Incremental Revolution And yet nowadays the supreme leader does not decide everything on his own."}
