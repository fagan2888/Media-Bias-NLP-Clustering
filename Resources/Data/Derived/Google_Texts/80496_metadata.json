I look forward to welcoming the Barritt family to the Capitol.\"\n\nRyan's other invitations were to \"poverty fighters\" from both Wisconsin and around the country, who will sit in his box in the House gallery Tuesday night for Obama's speech.\n\n\"The answer to poverty isn't the money in Washington,\" Ryan said. \"The answer to poverty is entrepreneurs and innovators like these who are actually making a difference, community by community.\"\n\nThe \"poverty fighters\" include Rev. Melvin Hargrove of the Racine United School District and founder of Zoe Outreach Ministries in Racine, Wisc., and Antong Lucky, founder of a program in Dallas that helps end gang violence involving the city's youth, among others.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Monday that he has invited two representatives of Little Sisters of the Poor to join him at President Obama's last State of the Union address Tuesday night.\nLittle Sisters of the Poor is an order of Catholic nuns who serve the elderly poor.
