After all, many believe the long-suffering franchise is poised for bigger things and he\u2019s just the guy to lead them there.\n\n\u201cBring on the expectations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Cubs did just that this offseason, signing ace Jon Lester to a six-year deal worth $155 million at the winter meetings in December. But the move that signaled they really were ready to accelerate their rebuilding project happened in late October, when they hired Maddon away from Tampa Bay.\n\nNever mind that they had already told Rick Renteria he would be back for a second season. The Cubs couldn\u2019t resist going after one of the game\u2019s top managers.\n\nNow, he\u2019s got a team that features a three-time All-Star in Lester at the top of the rotations established young players such as shortstop Starlin Castro and first baseman Anthony Rizzo in the lineup and a line of promising prospects that the Cubs hope can help them end a World Series championship drought that dates to 1908.\n\nAll that optimism aside, the fact remains \u2014 Chicago has five straight fifth-place finishes in the NL Central. The Cubs won just 73 games last season, although that was an improvement from 66 in 2013. And while prospects such as Javier Baez and Jorge Soler arrived at the majors, there are still big questions surrounding this team.\n\n\u201cPlease hold us accountable,\u201d President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein told fans. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win. We\u2019re also continuing to try to grow the organization. That means we\u2019re going to be throwing a lot of young players out there. We ask for your patience with them because it\u2019s a process. But hold us accountable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the roster that has a different look.\n\nThe long-awaited renovation to Wrigley Field is finally underway, a five-year, $575 million overhaul of a ballpark that turned 100 last season and the surrounding area.\n\nPresident of Business Operations Crane Kenney said the organization discussed playing a year or two at Miller Park in Milwaukee but decided against that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maddon gets rousing reception from Cubs fans", "title": "Maddon gets rousing reception from Cubs fans", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Maddon gets rousing reception from Cubs fans", "title": "Maddon gets rousing reception from Cubs fans", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/18/maddon_gets_rousing_reception_from_cubs_fans/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/cubs-convention-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maddon gets rousing reception from Cubs fans", "title": "Maddon gets rousing reception from Cubs fans", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/cubs-convention-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew Seligman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca51\"", "article_summary": "That means we\u2019re going to be throwing a lot of young players out there.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Cubs fans got on their feet and roared, a rousing ovation for the person they hope will lead their favorite team to prominence.\nJoe Maddon was the man of the moment Saturday, and the reception for Chicago\u2019s new manager was every bit as warm as it was loud.\nThe Cubs won just 73 games last season, although that was an improvement from 66 in 2013.\nThe Cubs did just that this offseason, signing ace Jon Lester to a six-year deal worth $155 million at the winter meetings in December."}
