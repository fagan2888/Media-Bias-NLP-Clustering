In a strange reversal of that ethic, McDonald's has begun to instruct its own employees to avoid the products they make: burgers and fries. Offering advice from McResource Line, its employee website, the fast food giant suggests employees choose healthier options, such as a salad and sandwich, when selecting a meal from a fast-food menu.\n\nNoting that many chain restaurants are now preparing foods using other types of fat, rather than trans fats, the company\u2019s website states that it is still difficult to eat a healthy diet when you eat at fast food restaurants too often. \u201cMany foods are cooked with a lot of fat, even if they are not trans fats. Many fast-food restaurants do not offer any lower-fat foods. Large portions also make it easy to overeat. And most fast food restaurants do not offer many fresh fruits and vegetables.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the website graphically offers an example of an \u201cunhealthy choice\u201d versus a \u201chealthier choice\u201d with alternate photos of a large soda, double cheeseburger, and fries as compared to a salad, water, and a sandwich. The caption reads: \u201cAlthough not impossible, it is more of a challenge to eat healthy when going to a fast food place. ... Limit the extras such as cheese, bacon, and mayonnaise.\u201d\n\nOn another website page, the company risks even more when it directly references the incompatability of its own food and health: \u201cIn general, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease must be very careful about choosing fast food because of its high fat, salt, and sugar levels.\u201d\n\nThe Golden Arches defended itself to CNBC. \"Portions of this website continue to be taken entirely out of context,\" a McDonald's statement issued to CNBC noted. \"This website provides useful information from respected third-parties about many topics, among them health and wellness. It also includes information from experts about healthy eating and making balanced choices. McDonald's agrees with this advice.\"\n\nLate-blooming Success\n\nThe fast-food giant officially began in 1955 when Ray Kroc, then age 52, founded the McDonald\u2019s Corporation after buying exclusive rights to the name from two brothers, Dick and Mac McDonald, who ran a small but successful restaurant by producing only a limited though popular menu that focused on burgers, fries, and beverages. Kroc\u2019s vision utterly and quickly transformed McDonald\u2019s and by 1958 the chain had sold its 100 millionth hamburger. Until he died at the age of 81, Ray Kroc continued to work at McDonald's, often arriving at the offices in his wheelchair.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mcdonald's, fast-food, burgers, health food", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Offering advice from its employee website, McDonald's suggests employees choose healthier options, such as a salad and sandwich, when selecting a meal from a fast-food menu.", "title": "McDonald\u2019s Website Instructs Employees Not To Eat Its Food", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mcdonalds-website-instructs-employees-not-eat-burgers-and-fries-265738", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/mcd.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Offering advice from its employee website, McDonald's suggests employees choose healthier options, such as a salad and sandwich, when selecting a meal from a fast-food menu.", "title": "McDonald\u2019s Website Instructs Employees Not To Eat Its Food", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mcdonalds-website-instructs-employees-not-eat-burgers-and-fries-265738", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/mcd.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/mcd.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-12-24T11:03:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-24T11:03:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Offering advice from its employee website, McDonald's suggests employees choose healthier options, such as a salad and sandwich, when selecting a meal from a fast-food menu."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc8d\"", "article_summary": "In a strange reversal of that ethic, McDonald's has begun to instruct its own employees to avoid the products they make: burgers and fries.\nThe caption reads: \u201cAlthough not impossible, it is more of a challenge to eat healthy when going to a fast food place.\nOffering advice from McResource Line, its employee website, the fast food giant suggests employees choose healthier options, such as a salad and sandwich, when selecting a meal from a fast-food menu.\n\"Portions of this website continue to be taken entirely out of context,\" a McDonald's statement issued to CNBC noted.\nMany fast-food restaurants do not offer any lower-fat foods."}
