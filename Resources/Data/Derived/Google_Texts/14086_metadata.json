The victories will likely give Trump more delegates than Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio earned, but he\u2019s still a long way short of the number needed to lock up the nomination. Clinton is projected to take roughly double Sanders\u2019s delegate total. Meanwhile, Ben Carson reportedly may drop out of the race before week\u2019s end.\n\nA Major Abortion Case: The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on an abortion case for the first time in almost a decade. The question before the court is whether a Texas law\u2019s restrictions on abortion impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s constitutional right to end a pregnancy. As expected, the three conservatives and four liberals on the court stuck to their positions, so the case will come down to Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nHackers for Hire: The U.S. Department of Defense has invited hackers to test the security of its Web pages and networks by, well, hacking into them. If participants find vulnerabilities, they could win some money. But how does one become a hacker in the first place? Like in many industries, good references matter\u2014but employers know a particularly eager candidate on the other end of the line could actually be an undercover FBI agent.\n\nSnapshot\n\nQuoted\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had women who called us and said, \u2018Can you tell us how to do my own abortion with medication in my cabinet or cleaning supplies I have under my sink?\u2019\u201d\u2014Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO of an abortion clinic in Texas\n\n\u201cThey call the buses, they do the announcements, they water the plants. They truly think I just come in and unlock the doors.\u201d \u2014Kimberly Cummins, an elementary-school principal, on her students\n\n\u201cEmployees behave more like volunteers now. You have to give them work experiences that are enjoyable in order for them to really stick.\u201d \u2014Josh Bersin, the founder of an HR-research company\n\nEvening Read\n\nMolly Ball on the Trump tipping point:\n\nOver the past week, the Trump resistance began in earnest, an anguished outpouring of fed-up conservatives who swore they\u2019d had enough and would block him at all costs. A Trump nomination, they said, would be the end of everything they had worked for and believed in. \u201cA generation of work with African Americans\u2014slow, patient work\u2014I can\u2019t tell you how great it is that we\u2019ve pissed that away because of Donald Trump in one day,\u201d sputtered Rick Wilson, a Florida admaker who had been agitating for months that Trump needed to be stopped. Wilson did not relish his Cassandra-like role. \u201cFor the first three months, it was \u2018Oh, bullshit, he\u2019s a joke,\u2019\u201d Wilson told me, recounting the reception he initially got when he tried to get some of the party\u2019s big-money donors to fund an advertising effort aimed at attacking Trump. \u201cFor the next three months, it was, \u2018We\u2019re going to strategically leverage him to help our candidate.\u2019 And now they\u2019re throwing shit in the air in total panic, screaming, running for the hills.\u201d I could practically hear Wilson rolling his eyes over the phone. \u201cI was \u2018never Trump\u2019 before it was cool,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat You're Talking About\u2014or Not\n\nSpeakers at Yale yesterday debated whether free speech is threatened on college campuses. Our politics team\u2019s Conor Friedersdorf wants to know what you\u2019ve seen and heard.

For myself, however, I knew at a young age that I wanted children because I had been so raised so horribly. I knew I could do a better job. \u2026 Then, the unthinkable happened. I will skip the bad parts and just say that I was diagnosed pregnant (from rape, which is why this is anonymous) and mentally ill (depression and severe PTSD) from a homeless clinic. \u2026 I was urged by everybody around me to abort the pregnancy, as I had no support, no job, no home, nothing at all. Because I have always believed it is a CHOICE, I made the choice that I found to be best. I knew how strong I was. I was well educated and resourceful and fiercely motivated to provide the safest and best environment for my child. I also knew that if I terminated, I would fall even deeper into depression and horrible choices. I kept the pregnancy and gave birth while living in a domestic violence shelter after finally escaping some more horror. It truly was the best choice\u2014for me. \u2026 I still \u2026 cannot fathom telling another human being what their \u201cmorality\u201d should be, or forcing another human to carry a pregnancy they do not want.\n\nRead her story here.\n\nVerbs\n\nIndonesia earthquake recorded, Chris Christie Vined, emoji approval process revealed, Bob Dylan\u2019s 6,000-item private collection sold, cosmic radio bursts explored.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Super Tuesday turned into regular Wednesday, justices heard a major case, the Obama administration sought great technical minds, and more.", "author": "Marina Koren and Rosa Inocencio Smith", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Super Tuesday turned into regular Wednesday, justices heard a major case, the Obama administration sought great technical minds, and more.", "title": "The Atlantic Daily: Trump\u2019s Super Tuesday, SCOTUS and Abortion, Hackers Wanted", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/03/RTS8N0I/facebook.jpg?1456955411", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2016/03/the-atlantic-daily-super-tuesday-scotus-abortion-hackers/471963/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "A Major Abortion Case: The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on an abortion case for the first time in almost a decade.\nThe question before the court is whether a Texas law\u2019s restrictions on abortion impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s constitutional right to end a pregnancy.\nFor myself, however, I knew at a young age that I wanted children because I had been so raised so horribly.\nHackers for Hire: The U.S. Department of Defense has invited hackers to test the security of its Web pages and networks by, well, hacking into them.\nThis article is part of a feature we also send out via email as The Atlantic Daily , a newsletter with stories, ideas, and images from The Atlantic , written specially for subscribers."}
