Rand Paul is reviving his push to audit the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican and presumptive 2016 presidential candidate said he wants to bring several of the Fed\u2019s monetary activities under congressional oversight.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, Paul said it was time to end the secrecy behind the Fed. He believes an audit is the best way to do it.\n\n\u201c[An] audit of the Fed will finally allow the American people to know exactly how their money is being spent by Washington.\u201d Paul said.\n\nHe slammed the Fed\u2019s current operating practices, saying it works \u201cunder a cloak of secrecy and it has gone on for too long.\u201d\n\nPaul concluded that \u201cthe American people have a right to know what the Federal Reserve is doing with our nation\u2019s money supply.\u201d\n\n>>> Much More to Friedman Than Rule-Based Monetary Policy\n\nCalls for a Fed audit increased after the 2008 financial crisis. The ensuing collapse in the housing market and financial industry sparked an ongoing effort to bring more sunlight to the agency.\n\nNorbert Michel, a research fellow in financial regulations at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal he agreed with the senator.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification for secrecy,\u201d Michel said. \u201cThey should have a full policy audit and the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s full transcript, not just the minutes, should be released.\u201d\n\nAlthough the main goal of Paul\u2019s legislation is to have a full audit of the Fed, completed within six months, there are several other reforms he\u2019d like to implement. They include eliminating restrictions on the Government Accountability Office\u2019s ability to conduct oversight and giving Congress oversight of Fed policies like quantitative easing.\n\n>>> House Republicans Attempt to Lift \u2018Veil of Secrecy\u2019 From Federal Reserve\n\nThe bill has already gained popularity in the Republican caucus with 30 co-sponsors, including Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., potential presidential rivals in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has expanded its balance sheet fivefold, yet economic growth is still tepid, businesses are sitting on cash, and median income and household wealth are depressed,\u201d Cruz noted in a statement.\n\nCruz also slammed the Fed for its secrecy.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe Federal Reserve needs to fully open its books so Congress and the American people can see what has been going on. This is a crucial first step to getting back to a more stable dollar and a healthy economy for the long term.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
