One of the most common issues I\u2019ve encountered, whether I\u2019m speaking with moms in Kentucky or ex-offenders in Baltimore, is people living with untreated mental health problems. They live in states of constant stress\u2014they can\u2019t feed their children, they can\u2019t repair broken cars and trudge to low-wage jobs on inadequate public transportation\u2014and circumstances can push them over the edge.\n\nAmerica is depressed, anxious, panicked, and sometimes addicted, and we\u2019re not getting help. We live in a society that tries to ignore the problems caused by or leading to poverty.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gave many low-income Americans mental health coverage for the first time, but that program is struggling, according to a long, worthwhile article in The New York Times last week. To begin with, only half the states have expanded Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, which leaves those who live in the other half without help. More challenging, the mental health care providers willing to take Medicaid have to wait a long time to be approved and to receive payment\u2014and those payments are already lower than those of private insurance companies. As a result, only 40 percent of mental health care providers accept Medicaid, so even in states with the Medicaid expansion, recipients are squeezing in too few appointments with the too few providers who will see them.\n\nAll of this stems from thirty years of neglect of the mental health care infrastructure in the United States, led by the gleeful government cutter President Ronald Reagan. (Indeed, if you ever wonder when a government program that once enjoyed widespread, bipartisan support started to fail, look to his tenure.)\n\nThe problems started when we needed to replace the institutions once known as insane asylums. These asylums weren\u2019t just reserved for those who met a strict, medical definition of severe mental illness. They were a depository for groups marginalized by society, and so their makeup changed over the years\u2014women, the elderly, black men\u2014depending on how illnesses were defined and whom we decided to treat.\n\nMost of these institutions were inhumane, and advocates had been writing for more than 100 years urging for their closure. In the 1960s, serious and popular books\u2014like Erving Goffman\u2019s Asylum and Ken Kesey\u2019s One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u2014 launched a move to finally deinstitutionalize patients. When Medicaid was signed into law, in 1965, it didn\u2019t cover mental health institutions. The plan was for those with problems to be treated in their communities through a federally supported system of providers. It was never fully funded.\n\nWhen Reagan got into office, he made matters worse by giving the little money set aside to treat mental illness to the states in block grants. The block grant system left the federal government with only a minor role in shaping the system and decreased funding for mental health care by 30 percent. By 1985, only 11 percent of the budgets for the mental health care system came directly from the federal government. Predictably, state funding for mental health services is sacrificed during downturns, like the Recession we just experienced. Private providers are expensive, and they aren\u2019t evenly distributed around the country. Nearly 90 million Americans live in an area where there are too few providers to meet community needs.\n\nWe know what happens to people with severe mental illness who can\u2019t get help. They wind up on the streets or in jail, environments that will exacerbate their problems. A report released in April showed that there are ten times more people with serious mental health illnesses in jail than in state hospitals. That means they\u2019re in a different type of institution, one that\u2019s even less humane and more poorly designed to provide treatment than the asylums we stopped tolerating fifty years ago.
