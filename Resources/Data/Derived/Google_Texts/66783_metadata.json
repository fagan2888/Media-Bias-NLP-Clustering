Swing, jazz, pop and blues gave way to rock and roll, country, Gospel, heavy metal, new wave, and even rap, if rap be rightly called music. One man\u2019s Mozart is an uncivilized man\u2019s noise.\n\nStill, there\u2019s the enduring appeal of the golden oldies, celebrated in many a barroom with an a cappella tribute, for which we give thanks in robust voice. Establishments like Giacomo Jack\u2019s, a waterfront pub in Amityville, N.Y., brings out the tunes like \u201cI Only Have Eyes for You,\u201d made famous by Dick Powell in the 1934 flicker \u201cDames.\u201d Dick\u2019s hit song has immersed Giacomo\u2019s bar in a tub of hot water.\n\nLast week Warner Bros. pounced, claiming in federal court that the small pub hadn\u2019t paid the copyright fee and was stealing from the authors. The Hollywood music giant\u2019s concern for ghosts is touching, but money won\u2019t do the composers any good. Harry Warren died in 1981, and Al Dubin in 1945.\n\nThese songsmiths knew big success. Their 1934 hit lived on in covers by Al Jolson, Art Garfunkel, Bette Middler, Kenny Rogers, Frank Sinatra, the Temptations and others. Messrs. Warren and Dubin mostly wrote songs for the movies of Warner Bros., with more than 60 hits and even an Academy Award.\n\nThough gone to the great sound studio in the sky for decades, Hollywood continues to squeeze as much money out of their work as it can. (It\u2019s called capitalism.) The music industry routinely sends out spies to small-town taverns like Giacomo Jack\u2019s to see if a live band happens to perform live music written when Franklin D. Roosevelt was making his first fireside chat.\n\nIf the bar hasn\u2019t made the required payment to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, then the lawyers, as forgiving as a Las Vegas casino, file a lawsuit seeking damages of $30,000 for every time someone sings it. Warner Bros. is suing Giacomo Jack\u2019s for $60,000.\n\nThis is how Congress allowed the copyright system to get out of control. Warner Bros. can send snoops to file lawsuits, and the company can continue living off the genius of Warren and Dubin through the year 2029.\n\nThat\u2019s not what the Founding Fathers, who favored hymns, minuets and Virginia Reels, had in mind with the Copyright Clause \u201csecuring for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\u201d The limited time has become effectively unlimited as Hollywood applies star power to lobby star-struck politicians into ensuring a century of profit for every song. Al Jolson told his fans that \u201cyou ain\u2019t heard nothin\u2019 yet,\u201d and he was probably right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Musical tastes have changed over the past 80 years.
