Sometimes money isn’t everything.

Dallas certainly has the riches to woo GOP officials in the bidding for the 2016 Republican National Convention.

But Denver has the experience.

Republican Party officials are looking at four cities to host their $60 million convention.

Last week when GOP officials visited both cities, Dallas showed off by lighting up skyscrapers, trotting out singers and setting off fireworks.

The Texas city already has $45 million on the table, including $25 million expected from a tax fund.

Denver has accumulated $11 million so far in private money.

Pete Coors, Denver’s bid chair, said his group is determined to raise the necessary amount for a successful convention. But The Denver Post’s Jon Murray said it appears the group plans to have only $25 million by year’s end.

Denver has a more difficult challenge because the city is home to fewer corporate headquarters than Dallas. And while the RNC has made no secret that it is mostly about money right now, the committee should also recognize Denver’s distinct advantage in having been through this rodeo just six years ago.

Ultimately, a successful convention helps catapult a nominee to the White House. Denver did that.

A well-run convention won’t have distracting sideshows — riots in the streets, conventioneers not able to find their accommodations, transportation delays. It should be a smooth and well-run event to showcase the candidate and the party in the best light.

Denver may be lagging Dallas in fund-raising, but it came through once before, and would very likely raise enough again. And because of its previous experience, the city is almost certain to be a highly successful host. The choice seems pretty clear. But we’re biased.
