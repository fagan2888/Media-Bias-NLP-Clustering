But for us, like I said, as players, we have to focus on what we can control right now, and right now that\u2019s the football season.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not a surprising answer. Athletes usually calculate that if they speak out, they\u2019re more likely to lose fans, lose endorsements and distract from their primary jobs than to effect social change.\n\nWhen asked whether he would want to be the Muhammad Ali of his generation, a sports star who speaks his mind despite the consequences, Griffin said that\u2019s not how he sees his role.\n\n\u201cIf anything to that extent came up as a player, and you had an opportunity to be the Muhammad Ali of your generation, when it comes to oppression and just things being wrong \u2014 my parents grew up in that time, I\u2019ve heard stories about it, I\u2019ve watched movies about it, I understand that \u2014 and if it comes to that, then you make a decision at that time, but at this time particularly, we have to focus on what we can control,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nWhen the Redskins launched a Twitter campaign in defense of their name, some players joined in. Griffin did not, and he said the team didn\u2019t ask him to.\n\n\u201cThe team does those things and I don\u2019t have any statement on what they do, and those situations, but they didn\u2019t ask me to do that,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nAnyone asking Griffin to weigh in on the Redskins name is likely to come away unsatisfied: On that subject, Griffin is keeping his opinions to himself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sports stars rarely wade into divisive issues, and so it's no surprise that Robert Griffin III wants to steer clear of the controversy surrounding his team's name.
