Arrest warrants indicate that he refused to get out of the truck when it crashed and that he had to be forcefully removed from the vehicle.\n\nThe assault on a female charge, according to the arrest warrants, stems from accusations that Bunn threw wadded paper at a woman's face and hit her with it. He's also accused of punching a Zebulon police sergeant in the face.\n\nCarroll was in the Wake County Detention Center Sunday under a $65,000 bond and was expected to make his first court appearance Monday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2013-11-03 13:03:00", "description": "A Nash County man who allegedly led authorities on a 15-mile high-speed chase in Nash and Wake counties was arrested Saturday and charged with more than a half-dozen criminal counts, including assaulting a law enforcement officer.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2013-11-04 11:21:13", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13070279|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Nash County man who allegedly led authorities on a 15-mile high-speed chase in Nash and Wake counties was arrested Saturday and charged with more than a half-dozen criminal counts, including assaulting a law enforcement officer.", "title": "Bailey man charged after high-speed chase in Wake County :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/bailey-man-charged-after-high-speed-chase-in-wake-county/13070279/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2013/11/03/13070302/13070302-1383502794-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-03T13:03:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "A Nash County man who allegedly led authorities on a 15-mile high-speed chase in Nash and Wake counties was arrested Saturday and charged with more than a half-dozen criminal counts, including assaulting a law enforcement officer.", "title": "Bailey man charged after high-speed chase in Wake County :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/bailey-man-charged-after-high-speed-chase-in-wake-county/13070279/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2013/11/03/13070302/bunn-480x600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda114\"", "article_summary": "Carroll was in the Wake County Detention Center Sunday under a $65,000 bond and was expected to make his first court appearance Monday.\nThat's when he allegedly jumped into the truck, tried to ram a police car and then sped off, police said.\nArrest warrants indicate that he refused to get out of the truck when it crashed and that he had to be forcefully removed from the vehicle.\nThe assault on a female charge, according to the arrest warrants, stems from accusations that Bunn threw wadded paper at a woman's face and hit her with it.\nWitnesses said he had been behaving unusually Thursday night when he caused a disturbance inside a Bailey grocery store that made customers uneasy."}
