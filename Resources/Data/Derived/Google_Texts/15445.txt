Hundreds of residents in rural Marion County are fired up about their roads.

Last week, around 300 people packed a public meeting with county commissioners to protest the road conditions. Duwayne Suffield of rural Marion says gravel roads around his home are in such bad condition their nearly unusable.

"Shaking, I got a utility vehicle van with a shelf in it. It shakes stuff off the shelves you slide around on the rock a lot," said Suffield.

Signs are in place warning of the dangers, saying "minimum maintenance - travel at your own risk".

"We've ruined two semi tires just on what they dumped on last fall those are $500 a piece," says Lincolnville resident Mike Beneke.

Beneke says most of the gravel roads used to be bare without much rock. Now, most gravel roads that see more traffic are covered with a different issue.

"What's irritated most is they started using an oversize rock and say that's the only way they can build a base to the road and if you want to ruin every tire you've got on the place," said Beneke.

Beneke was so upset he rallied people in the county to take a stand against commissioners.

"A lot of it stems from a lack of basic maintenance," said Beneke.

Beneke tells KAKE News commissioners think the problem is not enough rock and grader use.

"Right now they're saying they need either more people more money all we see is the waste, no efficiency whatsoever," added Beneke.

The roads haven't just caused problems for farmers not being able to move equipment, others who attended the meeting say city bus routes can't get down certain roads. Residents say it's time to take care of years of poor maintenance.

"I guess they need to take some money from other budgets and put it toward the roads," said Suffield.

KAKE News reached out to Marion County commissioners for their take, but they never called back. Commissioners plan to spend their entire meeting Monday morning discussing this topic.
