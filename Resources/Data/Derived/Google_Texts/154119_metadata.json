The New York Times says he\u2019s offering \u201cincoherent mishmash.\u201d GOP rival Ted Cruz claims Trump has \u201cno idea\u201d how to fix the economy.\n\nDon\u2019t\u2019 believe it. The Trump campaign is putting forward proposals to fix problems facing the nation, from the long waits for medical care at the VA to the impending collapse of ObamaCare. Check out Trump\u2019s economic plan, for starters. Unlike Hillary Clinton\u2019s radical anti-business agenda, Trump\u2019s plan would actually help unemployed Americans get back to work.\n\nTrump slashes the corporate tax rate to 15%, down from the current 40%, the highest rate in the industrialized world. Not all American companies pay that staggering rate, but even after deductions and accounting maneuvers, companies in the U.S. end up clobbered with taxes nearly twice the global average (24%). In Ireland, a magnet for tax-weary companies, the rate is only 12.5%, and their economy is growing about three times as fast as ours. Conversely, Japan and Argentina are stuck in the doldrums along with the U.S., partly because of their high corporate tax rates.\n\nTrump also proposes a one-time 10% repatriation tax on profits U.S. companies made overseas and kept there to avoid the 40% rate. That bargain could lure back as much as $2.5 trillion in capital urgently needed here.\n\nTo promote investing in plant and equipment, Trump would allow companies to write off the purchases the year they\u2019re made, rather than over several years, as current law requires.\n\nEconomist Larry Kudlow predicts that if Trump\u2019s corporate tax plan becomes law, you\u2019ll see \u201ca tremendous movement of capital and labor back to the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lower 15% rate business rate would also apply to small businesses that usually get taxed at individual income tax rates. That would give a break to mom-and-pop operations, start-ups and other small businesses that are the source of most jobs.\n\nCompare Trump\u2019s blueprint with Clinton\u2019s nightmare scenario: Higher taxes, more tax complexity and an avalanche of new regulations. Over-regulation has depressed growth for the last 15 years. The Obama administration suffocated business with 81,000 pages of new regulations in 2015. Hillary is pushing for even more \u2014 with controls on hiring, pay, bonuses and overtime to promote \u201cfairer growth.\u201d Translation: gender and racial preferences, plus meddling in how much you get paid.\n\nRemember Obama\u2019s statement, \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that.\u201d Well, Hillary assumes \u201cyou don\u2019t own that.\u201d Government will run your business. Hillary wants companies to stop maximizing quarterly earnings for shareholders \u2014 what she derides as \u201cquarterly capitalism.\u201d She wants \u201cfarsighted investments.\u201d Companies that can get out of the U.S. will rush for the exits.\n\nShe\u2019s even promising an end to \u201cthe boom and bust cycles on Wall Street.\u201d As plausible as ending rainy days.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cmake America rich\u201d plan targets impoverished cities like Baltimore with incentives for companies to move there. For African-Americans, whose unemployment rate is twice as high as the nation\u2019s overall, Trump has a four letter remedy: JOBS.\n\nFor young blacks with no job experience, he\u2019s got plans. One is borrowed from the left-leaning Century Foundation. Every summer, the State Department brings about 100,000 young foreigners into the U.S. to work in restaurants, camps and seaside resorts under J-1 visas. Trump says convert the program into a jobs bank for our own inner city youth.\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary is stoking racial hatred, telling black voters they\u2019re victims of \u201csystemic racism\u201d and meeting with Al Sharpton. Hillary says public schools should stop disciplining and suspending black teenagers who misbehave. But self-discipline is precisely what\u2019s needed to succeed at school and on a job. While Hillary panders, Trump offers specifics to get these young people on the job ladder.\n\nClinton\u2019s always been tagged the policy wonk, but she\u2019s just a cynical politician. Trump, who\u2019s rolling out serious policies to get Americans working, is the real deal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rap on Donald Trump is he\u2019s all bluster.
