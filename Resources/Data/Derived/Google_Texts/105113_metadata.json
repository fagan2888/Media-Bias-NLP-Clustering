Innovation requires whole-system conversion.\n\nSometimes, when a problem seems completely intractable, it is because we aren\u2019t looking at it the right way. Robert Graboyes, PhD, of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University suggests in a new paper this is the case with health care.\n\nFor 50 years, we\u2019ve been trying to expand insurance coverage while holding down health costs. We haven\u2019t done a particularly good job with either, despite spending many trillions of dollars and whipsawing the entire system back and forth with new laws and regulations.\n\nCoverage expansions have included creating Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), state high-risk pools, state requirements to limit underwriting, state universal health programs, and federal continuation of coverage requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the health provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Sometimes large numbers of people have gained coverage, but often the people enrolled through the new programs are simply changing their source of coverage.\n\nThrough it all, roughly 15 percent of the population has remained uninsured while 85 percent have insurance coverage. Even Obamacare has shaved possibly three percentage points off the numbers of uninsured, and we can\u2019t be sure that will last once all of the requirements finally kick in.\n\nThen There Are The Price Controls At least as much effort has gone into cost controls, starting with President Nixon\u2019s price controls in the early 1970s, the federal encouragement of health management organizations, National Health Planning, Certificate of Need, state hospital rate-setting systems, the Resource Based Relative Value Scale and diagnosis-related group payments under Medicare, state small-group insurance reforms, and a host of pilot programs and demonstration projects on pay-for-performance, case management, second surgical opinions, and on and on.\n\nAll of the \u2018reform\u2019 efforts have involved trying to get these same actors to do things slightly differently, and slightly more efficiently. Yet health-care costs continue to increase at roughly twice the level of general inflation.\n\nNothing ever seems to work very well. Graboyes suggests this is because, for all the tumult, nothing ever really changes in the health-care system. The landscape is exactly what it was 50 years ago: marked by large hospitals fed patients by scattered physician offices and clinics, that prescribe drugs and medical devices produced by other giant corporations, for all of which enormous insurance companies or government agencies acting in the role of insurance companies pay.\n\nAll of the \u201creform\u201d efforts have involved trying to get these same actors to do things slightly differently, and slightly more efficiently. But every time there is a new regulation, it becomes harder for innovators to enter the market, so incumbent companies are protected against real change\u2014the disruptive innovators that have transformed every other area of the economy.\n\nThe Fortress Versus the Frontier Graboyes sees this as \u201ca fortress,\u201d a walled city where no one can get out and no one can get in. Everything stays pretty much the same. He contrasts this with \u201cthe frontier,\u201d which is open to innovators and entrepreneurs. He draws many examples of startling innovation from the communications and computer industries, and notes that few of these groundbreaking developments came from established companies. Established companies are incapable of real change because it would threaten their current business model.\n\nEstablished companies are incapable of real change because it would threaten their current business model. He also finds examples of similar innovation in health care, including, \u201can unheralded doctor who pioneered stem-cell therapy in a small-town hospital, a carpenter and puppet-maker who invented functional prosthetic hands costing one-thousandth the price of professionally made devices (aided by an evolutionary biologist who started a worldwide consortium of amateur prosthetists), and college students who devised a low-cost treatment for clubfoot.\u201d\n\nBut such efforts are largely doomed due to the tedious and expensive approval process of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and scores of other restrictions on real change. He writes,\n\nThe FDA\u2019s central operating principle is the precautionary principle\u2014 the notion of pre-market clearance, meaning that a drug or medical device must be proven safe and effective before it can be allowed on the market. And yet the FDA\u2019s traditional methodologies are inconsistent with personalized, molecular, precision medicine. Medicine designed (as at present) for an \u2018average\u2019 person will likely be less than optimal for any actual person. Personalized medicine offers the possibility of more efficient treatment of individuals\u2019 illnesses.\n\nGraboyes isn\u2019t the first writer to tantalize us with the whiz-bang potential of new approaches to medical care. In 2006 Andy Kessler wrote \u201cThe End of Medicine,\u201d which would have sent a tingle up Chris Matthews\u2019 leg if he had read it. It was all about nanotechnology and molecular, customized medicine being developed by oddball geniuses around the country. Star-Trek medicine right around the corner! But it all seems to get stalled in the molasses of bureaucracy and nothing ever really changes.\n\nHow to Destroy the Fortress What Graboyes does that is unique, however, is provide a strategy for tearing down the walls of the fortress\u2014the vast mountain of laws and regulations that protect established players from disruptive innovation. He calls for adopting a strategy similar to the Pacific Theater in World War II\u2014island hopping, systematically rolling back the regulations that get in the way of medical freedom.\n\nThe number of such islands is vast. Some examples:\n\nThe FDA approval process\n\nState Certificate of Need laws\n\nArchaic medical licensing laws\n\nScope-of-practice restriction on non-physician providers\n\nTort reform\n\nReform of medical education curricula\n\nMedicare price controls\n\nMandatory benefits in insurance policies Within these categories he cites several dozen specific targets, but even here he is barely scratching the surface.\n\nThe only problem with this approach is that repealing regulations is not very sexy. In fact, it is pretty boring, and it is impossible to identify the benefits other than freedom to innovate. Plus, mighty industries are invested in keeping the regulations just the way they are.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 05 Feb 2015 07:38:00 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Medical care is about the same monolithic fortress it was 50 years ago, only more expensive and complicated.
