Upon my return, I found I\u2019d missed a bunch of dumb stories, along with some real news that will ultimately prove fairly unimportant in the grand scheme of things. The final Obamacare delays of 2013, along with the December enrollment figures, are at home in the latter category. The revelation that my friend Matt Yglesias invented a fake baby to get Amazon\u2019s Mom discount was more typical of the former.\n\nThere\u2019s actually wide agreement among my peers who cover national politics that the last half of December was a news dead zone, which journalists endured by building totems out of trivia, and compiling top 10 lists.\n\nI mostly agree with this assessment, but part ways with those who dismiss the importance of the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d dust-up.\n\nHow grateful I am this holiday season that I was mostly on vacation during the Duck Dynasty debate. Indeed, I am richly blessed. \u2014 McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) December 28, 2013\n\nOn the contrary, if there\u2019s one story I wish I\u2019d been on hand to watch unfold in real time, it\u2019s the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d debate. If you write about politics for a living, and you were bored by the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d story, or wrote it off like you might write off a gaffe or some other creation of the outrage industry, you\u2019re in the wrong line of work. Phil Robertson\u2019s comments about gay and black people and social welfare \u2014 and the way they pierced public consciousness \u2014 explain more about our country\u2019s political culture than almost anything else that happened all year.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Robertson is the super-rich but conspicuously d\u00e9class\u00e9 inventor of a life-like call for duck hunters. \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d is a reality show that purports to expose the tension between his family\u2019s wealth and its poor, rural roots. Like if the Clampetts had decided to stick around the hills of Bug Tussle after Uncle Jed\u2019s fortuitous misfire, rather than move to Beverly Hills.\n\nOn the off chance that you were also in another country last month or spent December arguing with your family about Obamacare, these are Robertson\u2019s most explosive comments.\n\n\u201cI never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I\u2019m with the blacks, because we\u2019re white trash. We\u2019re going across the field\u2026. They\u2019re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, \u2018I tell you what: These doggone white people\u2019 \u2014 not a word! \u2026 Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.\u201d\n\nAnd then on homosexuality: \u201cStart with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men \u2026. Don\u2019t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers \u2014 they won\u2019t inherit the kingdom of God. Don\u2019t deceive yourself. It\u2019s not right \u2026. We never, ever judge someone on who\u2019s going to heaven, hell. That\u2019s the Almighty\u2019s job. We just love \u2019em, give \u2019em the good news about Jesus \u2014 whether they\u2019re homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort \u2019em out later, you see what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\nIt was later revealed that Robertson also once said gay people are \u201cfull of murder, envy, strife, hatred. They are insolent, arrogant, God-haters. They are heartless, they are faithless, they are senseless, they are ruthless. They invent ways of doing evil.\u201d\n\nThese sentiments are ugly and wrong for reasons other writers (see Josh Barro and Ta Nehisi Coates) explained at length as the controversy was unfolding. As such, A&E, the network that produces \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d suspended Robertson indefinitely and, in so doing, teed up one fairly boring entertainment industry story, and one fascinating political firestorm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Phil Robertson explains more about our country's political culture than almost anything else that happened in 2013", "title": "GOP\u2019s \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d problem: Why Phil Robertson was a hugely important political story", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Phil Robertson explains more about our country's political culture than almost anything else that happened in 2013", "title": "GOP\u2019s \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d problem: Why Phil Robertson was a hugely important political story", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/03/gops_duck_dynasty_problem_why_phil_robertson_was_a_hugely_important_political_story/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/duck_dynasty_screens.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Phil Robertson explains more about our country's political culture than almost anything else that happened in 2013", "title": "GOP\u2019s \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d problem: Why Phil Robertson was a hugely important political story", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/duck_dynasty_screens.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Birth Control, Bobby Jindal, Civil Rights, Civil rights movement, Contraception, duck dynasty, Gay Marriage, Gay Rights, phil robertson, Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz, Welfare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03b7\"", "article_summary": "I mostly agree with this assessment, but part ways with those who dismiss the importance of the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d dust-up.\nHow grateful I am this holiday season that I was mostly on vacation during the Duck Dynasty debate.\n\u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d is a reality show that purports to expose the tension between his family\u2019s wealth and its poor, rural roots.\nAs such, A&E, the network that produces \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d suspended Robertson indefinitely and, in so doing, teed up one fairly boring entertainment industry story, and one fascinating political firestorm.\n\u2014 McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) December 28, 2013On the contrary, if there\u2019s one story I wish I\u2019d been on hand to watch unfold in real time, it\u2019s the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d debate."}
