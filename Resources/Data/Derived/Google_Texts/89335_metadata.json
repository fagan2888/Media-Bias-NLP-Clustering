The Navajo Nation retained title to the land, but the federal government was tasked with the \u201ccare, maintenance, preservation and restoration of the prehistoric ruins, or other features of scientific or historical interest\u201d of the area.\n\nMost of the items wound up at the Western Archaeology Center in Tucson.\n\nThe court said 297 of the items were removed without tribal consent while the remaining six were removed with Navajo approval in the 1980s \u2013 after the 1979 passage of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, which created permit regulations for excavating and removing relics. It said a tribe must consent to nonmembers removing artifacts, and stipulates that any objects removed still belong to that tribe.\n\nThe law took another step in 1990 with passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. It required that museums and federal agencies inventory their collections of Native American objects or human remains to determine \u201cany tribes likely to be geographically or culturally affiliated with the items,\u201d and to return those items to the tribes as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Park Service was investigating the 303 items in June 1996, when the Navajo said they were rightful owners of the relics because they came from the tribe-controlled Canyon de Chelly. The tribe demanded a return of the items, saying tribal custom holds that disturbing graves or funerary objects can lead to illness, crop damage, bad weather and other calamities.\n\nBut the Park Service said it was required to process the items under NAGPRA before returning them. That process dragged on for 15 years until the Navajo Nation said it would sue unless the items were immediately returned. The Park Service said it could not circumvent NAGPRA, and the tribe filed suit in December 2011.\n\nA federal district judge threw out the case in 2013, saying the government enjoyed sovereign immunity from being sued until it had completed the administrative process. That sparked the Navajo appeal decided Wednesday.\n\nBut the circuit court said the Park Service had taken a \u201cfinal agency action\u201d when it made the decision to inventory the remains under NAGPRA, making it subject to being sued. Furthermore, the court said, the government\u2019s argument that the Navajo were seeking return of the remains under the rules of NAGPRA was flawed.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Navajo Nation claims the NAGPRA does not apply at all because the Navajo Nation, not the Park Service, has the right to immediately possess and control the remains and objects\u201d found in Canyon de Chelly, Judge Mary Schroeder wrote for the court.\n\nBut Ikuta\u2019s dissent noted that the Navajos are \u201crelative newcomers\u201d to the canyon, arriving around 1700, while the Hopi and Zuni were descendants of tribes that had lived there for centuries before. The Navajo suit is rushing the Park Service, she said.\n\n\u201cIn sum, the Park Service is making a good faith effort to comply with federal law,\u201d Ikuta said. \u201cThe majority\u2019s strained attempt to find a \u2018final agency action\u2019 \u2026 has no support in the record or in our precedent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A divided federal appeals court Wednesday reinstated a Navajo Nation lawsuit seeking to force the National Park Service to return remains and relics.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/04/10/navajo-due-hearing-demand-feds-return-remains-relics-164080", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/common_utilitary_ware_representing_whats_often_found_at_gravesites_arizona_state_museum_-_courtesy_kristen_hwang_cronkite_news.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Navajo Due Hearing On Demand That Feds Return Remains, Relics"}, "abstract": "A divided federal appeals court Wednesday reinstated a Navajo Nation lawsuit seeking to force the National Park Service to return remains and relics.", "dc": {"title": "Navajo Due Hearing On Demand That Feds Return Remains, Relics"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/04/10/navajo-due-hearing-demand-feds-return-remains-relics-164080", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Navajo Nation, National Park Service, Judge Sandra Ikuta, Hopi Tribe, Zuni Tribe, Archaeological Resources Protection Act, Canyon de Chelly, Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, NAGRPA, Judge Mary Schroeder, Sara Weber, Cronkite News", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2016-04-10T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Navajo Due Hearing On Demand That Feds Return Remains, Relics"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn sum, the Park Service is making a good faith effort to comply with federal law,\u201d Ikuta said.\nThe Justice Department is \u201cstill in the process of reviewing the decision,\u201d a spokesman said Wednesday, but an attorney for the Navajo Nation was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with ruling.\nThat process dragged on for 15 years until the Navajo Nation said it would sue unless the items were immediately returned.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great victory for the sovereignty of the Navajo Nation and its deeply held cultural values,\u201d said Gregory Kelly, one of the attorneys who represented the tribe.\nFurthermore, the court said, the government\u2019s argument that the Navajo were seeking return of the remains under the rules of NAGPRA was flawed."}
