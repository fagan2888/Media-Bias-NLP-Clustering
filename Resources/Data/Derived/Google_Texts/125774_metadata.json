Willaford Railroad Museum is proving to be a big draw for downtown.\n\nThe showcase of railroad memorabilia at 102 N. Palmer St. logged 434 visitors in May and 674 visitors in June. The museum also continues to attract visits by schools and daycares from across the region, including a July 10 visit by a Bartow after school care program.\n\nThe museum was named for a Plant City native and retired engineer who last year donated an extensive railroad collection that is now on display in and around the old train depot. The exhibit includes a caboose and engine.\n\nCity and business leaders say the depot area is evolving into a major tourist draw. Besides the museum, there\u2019s also a train viewing platform on the other side of a set of tracks.\n\nCity Commissioner Mike Sparkman said the museum has hosted school and daycare groups from areas such as New Port Richey, Lakeland and Bartow and hope they will see more with the start of the school year next month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to have them come because that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said.\n\nA new nonprofit, the Robert W. Willaford Railroad Museum Society, was recently formed to help manage the museum and organize fundraisers. The committee\u2019s first meeting was July 2.\n\nJerry Lofstrom, owner of the Whistle Stop Cafe, is president of the new organization. He said the society will help develop and promote the museum.\n\nSparkman said the nonprofit hopes to increase educational opportunities.\n\n\u201cProbably 99.9 percent have never seen a caboose on the inside so they probably ought to get a real thrill out of doing that,\u201d he said.\n\nTrain viewing clubs are particularly interested in visiting Plant City because the tracks next to the museum form what\u2019s known as a double diamond, where two main lines intersect north, south, east and west. Sparkman said there are few to be found in the country and it is the only double diamond in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cThere is quite a following and enthusiasm for the railroad,\u201d Sparkman said concerning the number of visitors the museum has seen since its establishment in late 2013. \u201cWe\u2019re going in the right direction for sure.\u201d\n\nThe railroad museum is open noon to 4 p.m. Monday through Wednesday; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday through Saturday. Closing hours are extended to 8 p.m. on the first and third Saturdays monthly during the Plant City Bike Fest and Strawberry Classic Car Show.\n\nThe museum is closed Sundays.\n\nFor more information or to schedule appointments or tours call (813) 719-6989.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 19 Jul 2014 06:23:00 -0400", "Description": "PLANT CITY The Robert W.
