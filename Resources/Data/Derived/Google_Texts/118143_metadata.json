Blake Farenthold Blake FarentholdOvernight Cybersecurity: House to offer bill on government hacking powers Five problems, five bipartisan solutions to advance the tech economy House to offer bill blocking government hacking powers MORE (R-Texas), have roundly rejected the argument.\n\nThey insist the measure is a necessary step to better track payouts from asbestos trusts set up to compensate workers and family members injured by a company\u2019s manufacturing of asbestos. Additionally, they say, nearly all people filing claims with asbestos trusts have already filed asbestos lawsuits, which require them to disclose similar personal data.\n\nPublic interest groups have been on a months-long crusade to block the FACT Act as it has moved through the House. The coalition has launched a parody website to raise grassroots awareness, written numerous letters and editorials, and even appealed to the House Cybersecurity Caucus.\n\nThe groups believe the bill will make it harder for asbestos victims and their families to collect compensation for diseases triggered by the toxic material. It\u2019s estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 Americans die each year from asbestos-related illnesses.\n\nAs the bill as moved closer to a final vote, the public interest coalition has focused its opposition on privacy concerns. They note the bill will require victims to disclose sensitive personal information online \u2014 full names, birth years, work histories, medical conditions and a portion of their social security numbers \u2014 when seeking claims, putting their personal security at risk.\n\n\u201cThe publicly disclosed information required by the bill could be used, disclosed and processed with few restrictions by any person, anywhere in the world,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s letter said. \u201cNo U.S. privacy law would apply to the information once it is disclosed.\u201d\n\nThe other advocacy groups who signed Tuesday\u2019s letter are: Essential Information, Government Accountability Project, Patient Privacy Rights, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Privacy Times, TURN-The Utility Reform Network and World Privacy Forum.\n\n\u2014 Updated 5:33 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Republican-backed bill is intended to cut down on asbestos lawsuit fraud.", "description": "The Republican-backed bill is intended to cut down on asbestos lawsuit fraud.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Republican-backed bill is intended to cut down on asbestos lawsuit fraud.", "title": "Groups warn asbestos bill could spur online identity theft", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/264827-groups-warn-asbestos-bill-could-spur-online-identity-theft", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/264827-groups-warn-asbestos-bill-could-spur-online-identity-theft", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-05T16:18-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Blake Farenthold,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-05T16:18:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/264827-groups-warn-asbestos-bill-could-spur-online-identity-theft", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Republican-backed bill is intended to cut down on asbestos lawsuit fraud.", "card": "summary", "title": "Groups warn asbestos bill could spur online identity theft"}, "dcterms.title": "Groups warn asbestos bill could spur online identity theft"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3656\"", "article_summary": "Additionally, they say, nearly all people filing claims with asbestos trusts have already filed asbestos lawsuits, which require them to disclose similar personal data.\nThey insist the measure is a necessary step to better track payouts from asbestos trusts set up to compensate workers and family members injured by a company\u2019s manufacturing of asbestos.\nThe groups believe the bill will make it harder for asbestos victims and their families to collect compensation for diseases triggered by the toxic material.\nPublic interest groups are launching an 11th-hour campaign to kill a Republican-backed bill aiming to reduce asbestos lawsuit fraud that could receive a vote Thursday.\nPublic interest groups have been on a months-long crusade to block the FACT Act as it has moved through the House."}
