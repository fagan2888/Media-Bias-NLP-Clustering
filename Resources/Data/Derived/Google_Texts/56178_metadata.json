(Photo: Marty Pearl/Special to The C-J)Buy Photo\n\nWilliamstown, Ky. \u2013 Less than a month after winning a legal victory in the quest for $18 million worth of state tax incentives, builders of Kentucky\u2019s second major Biblical theme park said Saturday that the giant $92 million Noah\u2019s Ark replica will be largely finished by May and is on track to open in July.\n\nOn Saturday, Ken Ham, founder of the Christian group Answers in Genesis, touted progress amid the construction at the Ark Encounter, a 510-foot wooden ship as described in the Old Testament that now rises eight stories above the rolling rural hills of Grant County near Interstate 75.\n\nSurrounding it will be a petting zoo, theater, cafes, gift shop and 4,000-space parking lot \u2013 all located 45 miles south of same group\u2019s Creation Museum, which presents a literal interpretation of Genesis and argues the Earth is only 6,000 years old and that dinosaurs and humans co-existed.\n\nAs such, the Ark will feature 132 exhibits including wooden cages with sculptures of various animals and \u201cof course there is going to be some dinosaurs,\u201d Ham said.\n\nHam predicted the new park will draw more than 1 million visitors a year, and he said a main goal is to persuade visitors that story of Noah\u2019s Ark is literal history.\n\n\u201cToday a lot of people just scoff at the idea that Noah could fit the animals onboard. This is going to help them say, \u2018Hmmm, this could have been feasible,\u2019\u201d he said, predicting that the well-known story would allow it to outstrip the 300,000 visitors who attend the Creation Museum each year.\n\nOutside the Ark, constructed of more than 3 million board feet of lumber from the western U.S. and New Zealand, the wood siding was nearly complete. The skeleton of the bow and stern were visible near several concrete towers buttressing the ship. Inside, 55-foot lodge polls reached from the concrete pad to the roof. Bays were labeled with signs reading \u201cNoah\u2019s workshop,\u201d and chandeliers made to look like oil lamps hung from the ceiling near wood cages.\n\nArk officials said the design was based on dimensions in the Bible with an eye toward 4,000-year-old shipbuilding methods. Ham said future phases will include a pre-Flood walled city and rendition of the Tower of Babel, a first-century Middle Eastern village and other elements.\n\nThe progress follows a high-profile battle with Kentucky over tourism incentives and religious-based hiring.\n\nLast year, after the Kentucky Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet rejected the group\u2019s application for up to $18 million in state tax incentives based on its \u201creligious purpose and message,\u201d the group filed a federal lawsuit. In January, a U.S. District Judge ruled the state could not exclude the ark attraction based on those reasons, and Kentucky Republican Gov. Matt Bevin declined to appeal.\n\nAiG still must get the incentives approved and no hearing has been set, but Ham said he expects they will be approved. Ark officials said they\u2019ve raised all but $6 million of the initial cost of the Ark structure from bonds, donations and memberships.\n\nCritics continue to object to the group presenting Biblical stories being backed by science, when established science runs counter to those claims.\n\nAlthough some consider it \u201can embarrassment to the state,\u201d said Dan Phelps, who heads the Kentucky Paleontological Society, \u201cthe tax incentive is what most people object to.\u201d\n\nOthers, including Americans United for Separation of Church and State, have objected to Answers in Genesis using religious preferences in hiring. On its website, an Answers in Genesis job opening based in Williamstown requires applicants to submit a \u201csalvation testimony,\u201d a \u201ccreation belief statement\u201d and a \u201cconfirmation of agreement with the AiG Statement of Faith.\u201d\n\nHam on Saturday said they haven\u2019t decided what criteria will be used once Ark Encounter hiring begins in earnest, but the group was \u201cnot going to give up our right for hiring people with religious preference.\u201d\n\nAnd he dismissed criticisms.\n\n\u201cMost of the scoffers and those who are criticizing us, they\u2019re from a small group,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile attendance projections have been disputed, Ham expects the first \u201c40 days and 40 nights\u201d starting in July, when day and nighttime tickets can be purchased, will bring heavy crowds and would be a big economic benefit to the area.\n\nReporter Chris Kenning can be reached at ckenning@courier-journal.com or 502-582-4697.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1XEyzZ8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Less than a month after AiG won a legal battle over the state's withdrawal of a potential tax incentive worth millions, Kentucky's Noah's Ark replica rising in northern Kentucky.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Less than a month after AiG won a legal battle over the state's withdrawal of a potential tax incentive worth millions, Kentucky's Noah's Ark replica rising in northern Kentucky.", "title": "After legal victory, Noah's Ark rises", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2016/02/20/after-legal-victory-noahs-ark-rises/80601668/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Less than a month after AiG won a legal battle over the state's withdrawal of a potential tax incentive worth millions, Kentucky's Noah's Ark replica rising in northern Kentucky.", "title": "Ken Ham's Noah\u2019s Ark replica on track to open in July", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a4889705c53bd4025b2ed25de50a5888ce53da7/c=600-0-3000-2400&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/20/Louisville/Louisville/635915861646881563-Ark-Park-PEARL-05.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Ken Ham", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Ken Ham", "title": "After legal victory, Noah's Ark rises", "author": "Chris Kenning", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/763a55ec1083d667fcd4e91eb1e9c61d53e85595/c=900-0-2700-2400/local/-/media/2016/02/20/Louisville/Louisville/635915861646881563-Ark-Park-PEARL-05.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/396bcec6d0023e44491786a5fc6af98e171302c6/c=600-0-3000-2400/local/-/media/2016/02/20/Louisville/Louisville/635915861646881563-Ark-Park-PEARL-05.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/033ad49c5d0519610f9ee641ebaaa62d054d8628/c=204-0-3396-2400/local/-/media/2016/02/20/Louisville/Louisville/635915861646881563-Ark-Park-PEARL-05.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b15fc3375736baeeff23d26ddf1049f3683dd7dc/c=0-183-3600-2217&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/02/20/Louisville/Louisville/635915861646881563-Ark-Park-PEARL-05.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-02-20T23:11:36.803000-05:00", "shorthed": "Noah's Ark on track to open in July", "articleid": 80601668, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/127f63e7e3335dbe71d0ef2cd9a5d0b46a09ea76/c=0-183-3600-2217/local/-/media/2016/02/20/Louisville/Louisville/635915861646881563-Ark-Park-PEARL-05.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4c393bdd7c3f3e824ce7933a066a065c090c3adb/c=1128-0-2472-2400/local/-/media/2016/02/20/Louisville/Louisville/635915861646881563-Ark-Park-PEARL-05.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "kentucky ark park, noah's ark, ken ham, answers in genisis,"}, "article_summary": "Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Ark Encounter's Ken Ham discusses the construction progress of Noah's Ark.\nArk officials said they\u2019ve raised all but $6 million of the initial cost of the Ark structure from bonds, donations and memberships.\nHam predicted the new park will draw more than 1 million visitors a year, and he said a main goal is to persuade visitors that story of Noah\u2019s Ark is literal history.\nIn January, a U.S. District Judge ruled the state could not exclude the ark attraction based on those reasons, and Kentucky Republican Gov.\nArk officials said the design was based on dimensions in the Bible with an eye toward 4,000-year-old shipbuilding methods."}
