Kansas officials are reviewing its foster care policies, sparking concerns among some advocates that the state will stop placing abused and neglected children with gays, lesbians and straight, single individuals.

But spokeswoman Theresa Freed said Tuesday that the state Department for Children and Families review will be broad and cover more than who should serve as foster parents. She says the agency isn't presuming policies need to be changed.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Douglas County District Judge Peggy Carr Kittel sent a letter last week to a regional DCF official. She asked whether the agency intends to allow only married couples to serve as foster parents.

The gay-rights group Equality Kansas also has concerns.

Republican Gov. Sam Brownback strongly supported the state's past gay-marriage ban.
