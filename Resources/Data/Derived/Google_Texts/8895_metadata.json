But the group makes its own misleading claims about premiums in the process.\n\nThe mailer falsely claims \u201cObamacare will increase premiums an average of $7,450 for families.\u201d That\u2019s the increase in national health care spending attributable to the law for every four people over nine years \u2014 as 30 million uninsured Americans gain coverage. It\u2019s not an average annual premium increase.\n\nThe mailer also wrongly says \u201cVirginians will experience between 3% and 67% in premium increases.\u201d The study it cites actually said premium changes would range from a decrease of 19 percent to an increase of 67 percent. And the estimates are only for the individual market, where 5 percent of Virginians buy insurance, and do not account for subsidies that many will receive.\n\nHeritage Action, a 501(c)4 arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, starts off by saying, \u201cObama and Virginia liberals promised a $2,500 reduction in health care premiums for families.\u201d And it goes on to falsely say: \u201cIn real dollars, Obamacare will increase premiums an average of $7,450 for families.\u201d That figure comes from a Forbes contributor who calculated the per-capita amount of the increase in health care spending over nine years because of the Affordable Care Act and then multiplied it by four.\n\nIt\u2019s a nine-year figure, compared with Obama\u2019s $2,500 one-year figure. Neither of the numbers pertains only to premiums \u2014 despite what then-candidate Obama said \u2014 and they\u2019re both based on a loose definition of \u201caverage family.\u201d\n\nAll of those points are made clear by the Forbes contributor who calculated the $7,450 number.\n\nForbes contributor Chris Conover, a research scholar at the Center for Health Policy & Inequalities Research at Duke University and an adjunct scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, debunked Obama\u2019s campaign promise in a September opinion piece by pointing out that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimated that the Affordable Care Act would increase total national health care expenditures from 2012 to 2022 by about $621 billion.\n\nCMS, National Health Expenditure Projections, 2012-2022: By 2022, the ACA is projected to reduce the number of uninsured people by 30 million, add approximately 0.1 percentage-point to average annual health spending growth over the full projection period, and increase cumulative health spending by roughly $621 billion.\n\nNational health expenditures include all national spending, from individuals, the government, businesses and insurers. Conover took CMS\u2019 projected increase in national spending due to the ACA for 2014 to 2022, divided that by the projected U.S. population and then multiplied by four to get $7,450. That would be roughly $828 per every four people in the U.S. per year.\n\n\u201cSimplistic?\u201d Conover writes. \u201cMaybe, but so too was the President\u2019s campaign promise. And this approach allows us to see just how badly that promise fell short of the mark.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed the same simplistic calculation that the Obama campaign used to come up with its figure on savings. We first questioned Obama\u2019s claim five years ago. He said on the campaign trail in 2008 that his health plan would \u201clower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year,\u201d a prediction we called \u201coverly optimistic\u201d and \u201cmisleading.\u201d More than half of his projected savings would come from widespread use of electronic health records, his camp said, and he\u2019d get there by the end of his first term, a claim one expert we consulted called \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d\n\nWe also explained the \u201cbit of misleading math\u201d the campaign used: It divided an estimate for national health care savings by the U.S. population and, as an Obama adviser told us, \u201cconsider[ed] a 4 person family.\u201d The president said he would \u201clower premiums,\u201d but the Obama camp was counting on trickle-down savings that would affect families in the form of reduced taxes, higher wages or lower premiums. As we said at the time: \u201cObama claims families will save $2,500 under his plan, but they won\u2019t see at least some of those savings directly in the form of lower premiums. And they may not see them indirectly either.\u201d\n\nObama was talking about a reduction in health care spending compared with what would have happened without his health plan \u2014 not a straight reduction, though he didn\u2019t explain that in his comments.\n\nIn 2009, before health care legislation had taken shape in Congress, Obama offered a new version of the claim, saying \u201ccomprehensive reform,\u201d plus some effort to reduce costs from labor unions, and insurance, drug and medical industries, \u201ccould save families $2,500 in the coming years \u2014 $2,500 per family.\u201d We called it \u201cstill optimistic.\u201d When experts told us the big 9 percent jump in employer-sponsored family premiums in 2011 was primarily due to rising medical costs \u2014 with 1 percent to 3 percent caused by the Affordable Care Act \u2014 we pointed out that an increase still wasn\u2019t a decrease. And in 2012, we dissected a new shaky White House claim that \u201c[f]amilies who purchase private health insurance through state-based exchanges could save up to $2,300 on their health care each year.\u201d\n\nWe haven\u2019t heard the president continue to make the $2,500-in-savings claim recently. When Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney resurrected the claim in the first presidential debate last year, Obama only said \u201cthe fact of the matter is that when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.\u201d\n\nCMS doesn\u2019t expect that to happen through 2022. But that\u2019s no justification for Heritage Action to foist more misleading claims on Virginia voters.\n\nJust as the president\u2019s figure includes indirect savings, Conover\u2019s $7,450 figure includes indirect costs, spending by businesses and insurers that are ultimately passed down to Americans in some form. Conover never presented the figure as an estimate on premium costs, as the mailer claims.\n\nHeritage\u2019s wording leaves the impression that families with insurance now would pay $7,450 more in premiums. That\u2019s not the case at all.\n\nWe asked Conover how he felt about his figure being used in this way. He said the \u201cway the number was used was sort of misleading in the particulars\u201d \u2014 he didn\u2019t say it was a premium increase, for instance, and it was over nine years, not one. The mailer was \u201ca little bit sloppy in how they\u2019ve proven their case.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Conover said, \u201cI think it\u2019s very legitimate to point out that the promise was broken.\u201d\n\nWe have no argument with that last point, but we\u2019d offer there are accurate ways of doing so.\n\nNot So \u2018Typical\u2019\n\nThe $7,450 figure is spreading. An ad from Republican Ken Cuccinelli in the Virginia governor\u2019s race says that \u201chis opponent, Terry McAuliffe supported the Affordable Care Act, \u201ccosting middle class families thousands\u201d as a graphic is shown saying \u201c$7,450 for a typical family.\u201d But there\u2019s nothing \u201ctypical\u201d about lumping together every four people in the U.S.\n\nSimilarly, in an ad released this week attacking Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity said \u201cObamacare will increase health spending by $6,777 for a typical family of four,\u201d which is the $7,450 number in today\u2019s dollars. Neither of these ads gives any time frame for this increase, nor do they mention Obama\u2019s savings claim.\n\nConover used the word \u201ctypical,\u201d mimicking the president\u2019s wording in his 2008 campaign promise. Readers of the column would know that. But viewers of these ads wouldn\u2019t.\n\nInstead, they may think a \u201ctypical family\u201d is one that has insurance, and has it through an employer, since that\u2019s where 56 percent of non-elderly Americans get their health care coverage. The vague \u201ctypical\u201d is like the label \u201cmiddle class,\u201d which is also used in the Cuccinelli ad. Most Americans think they are middle class, as we explained before, and politicians often use the term, without defining it.\n\nReaders of Conover\u2019s column can understand why and how he uses the $7,450 figure and draw their own conclusions from it, knowing that this nine-year average would mean more spending for some and less for others, as 30 million of the uninsured gain coverage. But these political messages strip the figure of that context, and, in the case of the Heritage Action mailer, wrongly call it a premium increase to boot.\n\nIf we did want to look at how a family\u2019s health care spending would increase, Josh Gordon, policy director of the nonpartisan Concord Coalition, suggests a more relevant figure would be changes in premiums and out-of-pocket costs. \u201cIf you wanted to say something about how a family of four\u2019s health care spending will either increase or decrease, you probably should be talking about health care spending in the way that they understand health care spending,\u201d he told us. \u201cNot by dividing some huge number \u2026 to create a mythical family of four.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say much to say that total health care expenditures are going to grow \u2014 when adding 30 million more people,\u201d he added.\n\nOmitting Premium Decreases\n\nThe Heritage Action mailer also says: \u201cResearch indicates Virginians will experience between 3% and 67% in premium increases.\u201d It attributed the numbers to the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, which did an analysis of premiums under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Heritage Action misquotes the study, which actually said the premium change would range from a decrease of 19 percent in price to an increase of 67 percent. Plus, the mailer neglects to say the analysis was only about premiums on the individual market \u2014 where about 418,000 Virginians, 5 percent of the state\u2019s population, now purchase their own insurance, according to numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe Manhattan Institute report compared the lowest cost premiums on the individual market before the exchanges, adjusted for preexisting condition denials or rate hikes, in each state to the lowest cost premiums on the new exchanges. The methodology explains that it included the five least expensive plans on a county basis before the law took effect and those now being sold on statewide exchanges, excluding catastrophic plans, for 27-, 40- and 64-year-old males and females who don\u2019t smoke.\n\nThe institute didn\u2019t adjust the level of benefits or coverage of these plans. As we\u2019ve said before, the law requires certain minimum benefits, which many individual market plans don\u2019t meet. Not everyone will take advantage of, or welcome, those expanded benefits, of course, and the study was looking only at the cheapest plans available on the market before and after these regulations kicked in and the exchanges opened.\n\nUsing that methodology, it calculated a wide-range of premium changes on the individual market in Virginia \u2014 from a 67 percent increase in premiums for 27-year-old males to a 19 percent decrease for males aged 64.\n\nIt didn\u2019t include premiums for catastrophic plans, which could offer a cheaper option to those 27-year-olds. Those under age 30 can purchase catastrophic plans, which cover less than 60 percent of the average cost of health care, but these young adults won\u2019t be eligible for subsidies if they choose such a plan.\n\nThe lowest cost catastrophic plan we found on HealthCare.gov for a young person living in Fairfax County, Va., outside of Washington, D.C., was $123.93 per month, for example. That\u2019s $58 less than the average of the five lowest cost state plans, $182, as calculated by the Manhattan Institute without catastrophic plans. But it\u2019s higher than the average of the five lowest cost plans before the Affordable Care Act, $109.\n\nThe figures used in the Heritage Action mailer also don\u2019t account for subsidies, which the Manhattan Institute estimates will be available to 51 percent of uninsured Virginians, or 606,000 people. Subsidies are available to those earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which is nearly $46,000 for a single person and about $94,000 for a family of four.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what percentage of Virginians who currently buy their own insurance would be eligible for subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that about 80 percent of all those buying exchange plans would qualify for subsidies.\n\nIt is inherently difficult to make general comparisons between old individual market premiums and the exchange plans. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation said it couldn\u2019t do so in a report it issued on exchange premiums. It said the changes in this market \u2014 including minimum benefit requirements and no denial or price variation based on health status \u2014 \u201cmake direct comparisons of exchange premiums and existing individual market premiums complicated, and doing so would require speculative assumptions and data that are not publicly available.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve said several times, some Americans will pay more, some will pay less, depending on several individual factors, including age, health status and where they live. Experts have long said younger, healthier Americans would likely pay more on the individual market, while older or less healthy folks would pay less. And the study supports that.\n\nAgain, we wouldn\u2019t fault Heritage Action for criticizing Obama for having promised a premium decrease of $2,500 per family. We\u2019ve done it plenty of times ourselves. But the group attempts a fight-fire-with-fire tactic that presents more spin to voters.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ae6\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not an average annual premium increase.\n\u201cIf you wanted to say something about how a family of four\u2019s health care spending will either increase or decrease, you probably should be talking about health care spending in the way that they understand health care spending,\u201d he told us.\nBut these political messages strip the figure of that context, and, in the case of the Heritage Action mailer, wrongly call it a premium increase to boot.\nHe said the \u201cway the number was used was sort of misleading in the particulars\u201d \u2014 he didn\u2019t say it was a premium increase, for instance, and it was over nine years, not one.\nAgain, we wouldn\u2019t fault Heritage Action for criticizing Obama for having promised a premium decrease of $2,500 per family."}
