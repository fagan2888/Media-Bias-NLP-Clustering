And from the time he was 11, he longed to play football\u2019s glamour position like his favorite player \u2014 Peyton Manning.\n\nGrayson even dreamed of following his hero\u2019s footsteps to the University of Tennessee, but the Volunteers didn\u2019t come calling. He settled for wearing Manning\u2019s No. 18 jersey once he arrived at Colorado State.\n\nSo Grayson has no trouble admitting that when he received a voice mail in March from Archie Manning, Peyton\u2019s father, saying he had been invited to the prestigious Manning Passing Academy in Thibodaux, La., the CSU quarterback didn\u2019t exactly play it cool.\n\n\u201cI had a number on my phone from Louisiana, and I didn\u2019t answer it because I thought it was a wrong number,\u201d Grayson recalled. \u201cThen I listen to the voice mail and it says, \u2018Hey, this is Archie Manning \u2026\u2019 and boom, I called him right back. I was freaking out. I called my mom and my dad right away. It\u2019s one of those moments that gives you butterflies.\u201d\n\nWhen the Manning camp begins Thursday, Grayson will serve as a counselor to the 1,000-plus high school players in attendance, working alongside peers such as Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston of Florida State, Brett Hundley of UCLA and Marcus Mariota of Oregon. There also are periods that give the college quarterbacks an opportunity to spend meeting time with the Mannings. That time essentially serves as question-and-answer sessions with football royalty.\n\nIt\u2019s easily the part of the camp Grayson is most looking forward to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a dream of mine to pick (Peyton Manning\u2019s) brain,\u201d said Grayson, who has never met the Broncos quarterback. \u201cI hope I can learn just one thing and bring it back here.\u201d\n\nGrayson and the Rams are hopeful the experience will be the launching point of a successful senior season for him. After throwing for a school-record 3,696 yards last year, Grayson will enter August camp as CSU\u2019s unquestioned leader, filling in a role vacated by center Weston Richburg, who was selected 43rd overall by the New York Giants in the NFL draft in May.\n\n\u201cGarrett\u2019s done a great job of embracing the leadership role last season and into this offseason,\u201d said Ty Sambrailo, the starting left tackle on CSU\u2019s offensive line. \u201cHe has to know what everyone is doing at all times. He has a lot of responsibility, and he\u2019s figured that all out.\u201d\n\nA year ago, Grayson was just trying to earn the starting job. He was entrenched in an intense, three-way battle with young talents Conner Smith and Nick Stevens. Grayson was named the starter just before the Rams\u2019 season opener against Colorado, but comfort didn\u2019t immediately come with the job title.\n\nGrayson struggled throwing the ball in a 41-27 loss to the Buffaloes. Then, in Week 2 against Tulsa, he completed only 12-of-29 passes and threw two interceptions in a 30-27 loss.\n\nThe demons of self-doubt were knocking. Grayson\u2019s sophomore season had ended in disappointment when he suffered a broken collarbone. Now, it seemed as if his opportunity to take control of the position he worked so hard to regain was slipping away.\n\nGrayson didn\u2019t eat for 36 hours after the loss to Tulsa. He sat on the couch, sick to his stomach, trying to figure out what went wrong.\n\n\u201cGarrett can be real tough on himself,\u201d Sambrailo said. \u201cNo matter what happens, even if it\u2019s not his fault, he takes the blame. That\u2019s what makes him such a great leader.\u201d\n\nOn the Sunday night after that devastating loss, Grayson drove to coach Jim McElwain\u2019s office, chasing answers he didn\u2019t have.\n\nMcElwain quickly gave Grayson a vote of confidence and a mandate to lift some of the weight he was putting on himself.\n\nThen they went over plays from the first two games, breaking down small details Grayson had missed.\n\n\u201cIt made me look at everything differently,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the Tulsa game, the Rams went 8-4 \u2014 including a thrilling comeback win in the New Mexico Bowl over Washington State. The quarterback who was searching for answers produced a record-setting season.\n\nNow, Grayson is hopeful that a week with the First Family of Quarterbacks in Louisiana can open the door to even greater heights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to go down there and get my name out there and represent CSU the best I can.\u201d\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516 or nkosmider@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU Rams QB Garrett Grayson eager to help at Manning Passing Academy", "title": "CSU Rams QB Garrett Grayson eager to help at Manning Passing Academy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/06/csu-rams-qb-garrett-grayson-eager-to-help-at-manning-passing-academy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__20140707_B1_SP07FBCGRAYSON1p1.jpg", "height": 486}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__20140707_B1_SP07FBCGRAYSON1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T21:18:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:43:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce47e\"", "article_summary": "After the Tulsa game, the Rams went 8-4 \u2014 including a thrilling comeback win in the New Mexico Bowl over Washington State.\nGrayson was named the starter just before the Rams\u2019 season opener against Colorado, but comfort didn\u2019t immediately come with the job title.\nGrayson didn\u2019t eat for 36 hours after the loss to Tulsa.\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 As soon as Garrett Grayson was old enough to understand what playing quarterback involved, he wanted to be one.\nThat\u2019s what makes him such a great leader.\u201dOn the Sunday night after that devastating loss, Grayson drove to coach Jim McElwain\u2019s office, chasing answers he didn\u2019t have."}
