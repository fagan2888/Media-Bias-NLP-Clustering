Do you like fun? Do you like THE PRESIDENT? (Be careful about how you answer that last one, because he\u2019s like kind of in charge and stuff and I don\u2019t want to get into a big argument right now.)\n\nWell if you like all those things, then you\u2019re gonna love President Barack Obama\u2018s appearance on Ellen tomorrow. I know personally I\u2019m psyched for it, because I\u2019m one of those people who watches his previous appearance whenever I need a quick pick-me-up. Just a reminder of the fact that the people in charge are human beings and sometimes they like to dance around a bit. Or remind Zach Galifianakis that he\u2019s a pudgy little pancake by going on Between Two Ferns.\n\nI know it bothers a lot of people that our president is willing to go on lower-profile shows like that and show a side of himself other than the dour politician, but I personally love it. Especially because he\u2019s doing it in order to get the word out about the impending deadline to sign up for Obamacare \u2014 March 31st! He\u2019s aware of the kind of healthcare users who might typically slip through the cracks and miss the deadline, so he\u2019s doing everything he can to raise awareness, and I think that\u2019s great.\n\nAfter all, he\u2019s in his second term already, so he has nothing to be campaigning for right now. What better time for him and Michelle to focus on the things that they personally enjoy, whether that\u2019s dunking with the Miami Heat or going on TV with Jimmy Fallon. I LOVE IT.\n\nEspecially if it gives me a whole new bumper crop of GIFs of our Commander-In-Chief dancing around with Ellen when it\u2019s NOT EVEN CHRISTMAS.\n\nAnd a tip of the hat to Ellen\u2019s old hairstyle, just while we\u2019re here.\n\n(Image: Reddit)", "article_metadata": {"aol-te-auth": "ef8ea7a7-f212-45b1-a0d0-01f39622c4fe", "description": "President Obama is going on Ellen tomorrow to discuss the Obamacare deadline, which is coming up on March 31st!", "og": {"url": "http://www.crushable.com/2014/03/19/entertainment/president-obama-on-ellen-march-20-2014-obamacare/", "site_name": "Crushable", "image": "http://cdn2.crushable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Barack-Obama-dancing-on-Ellen-with-Ellen-DeGeneres-146x104.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "President Obama Is Gonna Go On Ellen, Which Is Excellent News For Fans Of Dancing GIFs"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Crushable", "description": "President Obama To Go On Ellen To Discuss Obamacare Deadline", "title": "President Obama To Go On Ellen To Discuss Obamacare Deadline", "url": "http://www.crushable.com/2014/03/19/entertainment/president-obama-on-ellen-march-20-2014-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://cdn2.crushable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Barack-Obama-dancing-on-Ellen-with-Ellen-DeGeneres.jpg"}, "creator": "@mindtheclam", "site": "@crushabledotcom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 165437286826999}, "msvalidate.01": "D933B1BD473038E1B6D6DB2686AF7352"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c6c\"", "article_summary": "Well if you like all those things, then you\u2019re gonna love President Barack Obama\u2018s appearance on Ellen tomorrow.\nI know personally I\u2019m psyched for it, because I\u2019m one of those people who watches his previous appearance whenever I need a quick pick-me-up.\nEspecially because he\u2019s doing it in order to get the word out about the impending deadline to sign up for Obamacare \u2014 March 31st!\nEspecially if it gives me a whole new bumper crop of GIFs of our Commander-In-Chief dancing around with Ellen when it\u2019s NOT EVEN CHRISTMAS.\nAfter all, he\u2019s in his second term already, so he has nothing to be campaigning for right now."}
