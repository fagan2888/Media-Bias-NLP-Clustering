ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) â€” Anchorage Mayor Dan Sullivan estimates the city needs about $300 million in additional funding to complete the Port of Anchorage construction project.

The Alaska Dispatch News reports (http://bit.ly/VCUMfy ) Sullivan spoke about the troubled project Monday after a week of meetings with shippers, port administrators and employees of CH2M Hill, the company managing the project.

The city has spent more than $300 million over the past decade on a rail line, roads, utilities, drainage systems, acreage and a new dock. Construction stalled in 2009, after initial cost estimates soared from $211 million to $1 billion.

Sullivan says the city expects to have a new plan by November and construction could resume in 2015.
