John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nThey were even included in a 2009 House Republican bill that was supposed to be the GOP alternative to the ACA, but that the Congressional Budget Office said would only reduce the ranks of the uninsured by 3 million people over a decade (in contrast to Obamacare, which has reduced the uninsured by 20 million since 2013).\n\n\"We can and should and must fix that,\" Ryan said in response to a question from a student who said his family had benefited from Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"The smarter way, in my opinion, is that we as a society make a decision at the government level that we will buck up and subsidize those people with pre-existing conditions.\" Ryan said. Reuters first reported Ryan's remarks.\n\nThe problem is, high-risk pools -- which existed in 35 states before the Affordable Care Act made them virtually obsolete -- always failed to achieve their goal of providing a true insurer of last resort to those who needed it.\n\nThe biggest reason is money: Covering the medical costs of the sickest people in the country is very expensive, and the government has never devoted the funds necessary to make this work.\n\n\"High-risk pools are never successful in providing affordable coverage for people who otherwise had no alternative,\" said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Conceptually, it doesn't work. You can keep throwing money at it, but it's a losing proposition over time.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "It took him six years to come up with a policy invented in the 1970s.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-04-29 16:40:12 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "It took him six years to come up with a policy invented in the 1970s.", "title": "Paul Ryan's Big Plan To Replace Obamacare Is An Old Idea That Doesn't Work", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-obamacare-replacement_us_57222c59e4b01a5ebde4b236", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/57222db8160000e40031cf90.jpeg?cache=gq4ybxnwpu", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It took him six years to come up with a policy invented in the 1970s.", "creator": "@JeffYoung", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/57222db8160000e40031cf90.jpeg?cache=gq4ybxnwpu", "height": 1000}, "title": "Paul Ryan's Big Plan To Replace Obamacare Is An Old Idea That Doesn't Work", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-28 16:40:12 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_57222c59e4b01a5ebde4b236", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Health Care,Health Care Reform,Obamacare, obamacare replacement,Paul Ryan,Health Insurance,Jeffrey Young on Health Care,high-risk pools", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Health Care,Health Care Reform,Obamacare, obamacare replacement,Paul Ryan,Health Insurance,Jeffrey Young on Health Care,high-risk pools", "published_time": "2016-04-28 16:40:12 -0400", "modified_time": "2016-04-28 16:41:25 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/jcydc"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- If you were hoping Republicans had fresh new solutions for health care reform up their sleeves, you might find the recent hints from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) a bit disappointing.\nHigh-risk pools have been part of countless conservative reform platforms, including a recent plan from the House Republican Study Committee and a not-so-recent one from the 2008 presidential campaign of Sen.
