Tyler Chatwood has tunnel vision.

He’s sharply focused on getting back on the mound for the Rockies this season, and now there is some light at the end of the tunnel.

The 25-year-old right-hander, who underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time last July, threw a 40-pitch bullpen on Sunday. He threw mostly fastballs and changeups, with a few curveballs at the end of the session.

“I think I’m ahead of where they expected me to be, throwing-wise, so that’s always good,” Chatwood said. “I really don’t want to set a schedule, but the plan is to come back this season.”

Chatwood’s first Tommy John surgery came when he was 16 and playing for Redlands East Valley High School in Southern California.

“I feel like that surgery went smoothly, and this has gone ever better,” he said. “I feel better and I’m more confident. I’m doing rehab every day, so that’s a lot different than high school.”

Chatwood has been traveling with the team because it helps him stay connected.

“The mental part is sometimes the toughest part, so it’s good to be around the guys,” he said.

Manager Walt Weiss said Chatwood is ahead of schedule, “but still a ways out.”

“I think he’s been ahead of schedule all along,” Weiss said. “But with his history and this being his second (surgery), we are going to take our time and make sure he’s ready to go out and compete.”

Asked if he thinks Chatwood can return to the big leagues this season, Weiss deferred, saying: “That’s such a ways out, I don’t want to put expectations on Tyler right now. He’s coming back from a tough injury and it’s been a pretty tough road for him. But he’s doing very well.”

In 70 big-league games (61) starts, Chatwood is 20-22 with a 4.34 ERA.
