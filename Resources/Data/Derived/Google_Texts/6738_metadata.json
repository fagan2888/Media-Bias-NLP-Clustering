There is no credible evidence that ingesting a plant that has been swiftly genetically modified in a lab has a different health outcome than ingesting a plant that has been slowly genetically modified through selective breeding. The National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the World Health Organization have concluded that GMOs are safe to eat. ... Yet Whole Foods promises \u201cfull GMO transparency\u201d by 2018. Its Web site emphasizes \u201cyour right to know.\u201d But you will search the site in vain for any explanation of how or why GMOs are harmful, because an actual assertion would not withstand scrutiny. Evidently your right to know does not include serious scientific arguments. Chipotle co-chief executive Steve Ells set out his rationale this way: \u201cThey say these ingredients are safe, but I think we all know we\u2019d rather have food that doesn\u2019t contain them.\u201d ... But Chipotle, Whole Foods and those who follow their examples are doing real social harm. They are polluting public discourse on scientific matters. They are legitimizing an approach to science that elevates Internet medical diagnosis, social media technological consensus and discredited studies in obscure journals. They are contributing to a political atmosphere in which people pick their scientific views to fit their ideologies, predispositions and obsessions. And they are undermining public trust in legitimate scientific authority, which undermines the possibility of rational public policy on a range of issues. Whatever the intention of those involved, embracing pseudoscience as the centerpiece of an advertising and branding effort is an act of corporate irresponsibility.\n\nYes.\n\nAlthough Whole Foods' \"GMO transparency\" effort also kowtows to pseudoscience, it is somewhat less objectionable because vendors using ingredients from biotech crops are still free to offer their products in Whole Foods stores. Keep in mind that Whole Foods still sells quack homeopathic (quack is a bit redundant here) remedies as well.\n\nIn any case, both the FDA and the USDA are developing non-disparaging voluntary labeling guidelines. Voluntary GMO labeling will express essentially religious views and strictures much like halal and kosher labels do now.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Chipotle's pseudoscientific anti-GMO foods advertising campaign does not express \"food with integrity.\"", "title": "Chipotle Feeds Anti-Scientific Derangement Syndrome, Says WaPo Columnist", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/15/chipotle-feeds-anti-scientific-derangeme", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14317019101826.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14317019101826.jpg", "description": "Chipotle's pseudoscientific anti-GMO foods advertising campaign does not express \"food with integrity.\"", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chipotle Feeds Anti-Scientific Derangement Syndrome, Says <em>WaPo</em> Columnist"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Anti-Technology Activism", "published_time": "2015-05-15T16:21:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7db\"", "article_summary": "They are contributing to a political atmosphere in which people pick their scientific views to fit their ideologies, predispositions and obsessions.\nVoluntary GMO labeling will express essentially religious views and strictures much like halal and kosher labels do now.\nAlthough Whole Foods' \"GMO transparency\" effort also kowtows to pseudoscience, it is somewhat less objectionable because vendors using ingredients from biotech crops are still free to offer their products in Whole Foods stores.\nYet Whole Foods promises \u201cfull GMO transparency\u201d by 2018.\nBut Chipotle, Whole Foods and those who follow their examples are doing real social harm."}
