You won\u2019t. Federal labeling regulations \u2013 called country-of-origin labeling \u2013 apply only to identifying food that originated outside the U.S., not where it was processed.\n\nThe decision to partially lift the ban was made just before the Labor Day weekend, as reported by the news website Politico, although so far no chicken is being processed in China.\n\nConsidering China\u2019s checkered reputation for following food-safety guidelines \u2013 the deadly bird-flu outbreaks, and tainted baby formula and pet food, among other issues \u2013 lawmakers have blocked the USDA from allowing China to ship chicken to the U.S. for years.\n\nNot surprisingly, critics slammed the new decision, especially because the plants approved to sell to the U.S. will not have USDA inspectors on site.\n\nBloomberg News, in an opinion piece headlined \u201cDon\u2019t Trust a Chicken Nugget That\u2019s Visited China,\u201d said that food-safety problems have become so bad in China, \u201csome consumers now smuggle quantities of infant milk formula from foreign countries into China so as to avoid buying potentially tainted Chinese dairy products.\u201d\n\nGet discounts on health products and services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\n\u201cWhat was the USDA thinking when it decided to sign-off on Chinese processed chicken exports for humans?\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Shanghai correspondent Adam Minter asked.\n\nSome also predicted that this is China\u2019s toe in the door, and eventually it will be allowed to raise chickens and turkeys to be sold in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis is the first step towards allowing China to export its own domestic chickens to the U.S.,\u201d Tony Corbo, senior lobbyist for Food & Water Watch, an advocacy group that works to promote food safety, told the New York Times.\n\nThe safety of imported food, which is overseen not by the USDA but by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has long been a source of concern. The website Wired, which has written extensively about China\u2019s controversial history of food-safety problems, notes that the FDA \u201chas been struggling for years with guaranteeing the safety of imports.\u201d\n\nAs Wired pointed out: \u201cReports by the Government Accountability Office, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Pew Charitable Trusts and Center for Science in the Public Interest all found that the FDA could not keep up with the task; estimating that its inspectors were able to lay hands on no more than 2 percent of imported foods.\u201d\n\nThe poultry industry took a cautious, wait-and-see stance in response to the new decision.\n\n\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t look forward to any more imports, but we also realize free trade is a two-way street,\u201d Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, told the New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the Chinese will look a little more favorably on our chicken products and on other U.S. agricultural imports.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, chicken inspections here in the U.S. could be taking a turn for the worse. The USDA has been testing a new program at 25 plants in this country that would allow plants to greatly speed up the processing lines under inspection. As the Washington Post reported, the proposed program would allow the agency to expand from the pilot plants to most of the country\u2019s 239 chicken and 96 turkey plants.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office has criticized the USDA pilot program as being based on questionable, incomplete data that raises \u201cquestions about the validity\u201d of the USDA\u2019s conclusion that the program would help reduce food contamination.\n\nThe USDA contends otherwise. In a commentary for the website Food Safety News, a spokesman wrote that \u201cthis new inspection system would enable [USDA inspectors] to better fulfill our food safety mission. Nothing in the GAO\u2019s report contradicts this basic fact.\u201d\n\nPhoto: yoppy/Flickr\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Everyone from chefs to health experts to the first lady has touted eating locally grown food, praising it for its freshness because it doesn\u2019t have to travel far to get to consumers.
