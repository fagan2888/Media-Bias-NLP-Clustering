We had a hard time stopping them on the run and we had a hard time running the ball ourselves. They were very physical at the point of attack on both sides of the ball. We had a hard time matching up with them.\u201d\n\nNavy trailed by 14 points in the fourth quarter but pulled to within a touchdown on a 14-yard pass from Reynolds to Brendan Dudeck with 5:26 left. The Midshipmen got down to the 6 in the final minute, but could not convert.\n\nReynolds was 12 of 22 for 231 yards with a touchdown and ran for two more scores.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t do enough,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at the film Monday, get it corrected and get ready for next week. We can\u2019t let this loss turn into a second.\u201d\n\nJames left the game with an apparent leg injury with 11:01 left in the second quarter. He had 96 yards on seven carries before being helped off the field.\n\nQuarterback Gary Nova ran for a pair of touchdowns and the Scarlet Knights (3-1) amassed 284 yards rushing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a tough football team,\u201d Nova said. \u201cIn a game like this, we knew we were going to have to fight until the end against a good team like Navy.\u201d\n\nTrailing 24-14 at the half, Reynolds found Jamir Tillman for 53 yards on the second play of the third quarter, setting up a 35-yard field goal by Nick Sloan. However, the Midshipmen (2-2) could not contain Rutgers, which increased the margin back to 14 on the next drive on a 1-yard run by Nova.\n\nNavy mounted a comeback but could not overtake the Scarlet Knights.\n\n\u201cI thought our defensive coaches had an excellent plan,\u201d Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said. \u201cOur staff has spent a lot of time studying what they do here. Even when you do spend a lot of time studying what they do, they are really hard to defend because they make great adjustments. They have an excellent staff.\u201d\n\nMidshipmen linebacker James Britton suffered a broken left foot in the second quarter.\n\nNavy got off to a quick start as linebacker Jordan Drake forced a fumble on the first play from scrimmage that was recovered by Quincy Adams on Rutgers\u2018 25. Two plays later, Geoffrey Whiteside scampered 19 yards, setting up a 1-yard touchdown run by Reynolds.\n\nRutgers tied the game with 3:45 left in the first quarter on a 38-yard touchdown run by James. On the ensuing possession, a Reynolds fumble eventually led to a 21-yard field goal by Kyle Federico, increasing the Scarlet Knights\u2019 lead to 10-7 with 14:53 left in the half.\n\nNavy has lost five fumbles in three games this season after losing six all of last year.\n\nThe Scarlet Knights increased the margin to 17-7 midway through the second quarter with a 10-play, 80-yard drive, capped by a 1-yard run by Nova. Navy responded on the next possession with a 7-yard touchdown run by Reynolds.\n\nRutgers scored then again with 27 second lefts on a 91-yard drive that ended with a 3-yard run by Goodwin for a 24-7 lead at the half. It was the longest scoring drive of the season for the Scarlet Knights.\n\n\u201cThey had some big guys up front,\u201d Navy safety Parrish Gaines said. \u201cAs a defensive unit we are disappointed in ourselves. We just have to come back next week.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Navy trailed by 14 points in the fourth quarter but pulled to within a touchdown on a 14-yard pass from Reynolds to Brendan Dudeck with 5:26 left.
