(Photo: Kevin White/Missouri State University)\n\nMissouri State University will no longer offer a health insurance plan for the bulk of its students, those from the U.S.\n\nStarting this fall, it will only offer the plan to international students.\n\nDavid Muegge, director of health and wellness services at Taylor Health Center on campus, said the administrative council recommended ending the coverage for domestic students after studying usage trends.\n\n\"What they had seen was a decreasing use by domestic students and an increasing use by international students,\" he said.\n\nAn internal review showed up to 30 percent of Missouri State students go without health insurance of any kind each year. At one point, up to 400 domestic students participated in the university's coverage plan, but that dwindled to just 188 last year.\n\n\"It's never been huge,\" he said.\n\nMuegge said some domestic students simply go without insurance while others participate in plans offered through the Affordable Care Act or take advantage of a law that allows college students to stay on parents' health coverage plans until age 26.\n\n\"We are finding domestic students have a lot of other options,\" he said.\n\nThe number of international students paying to be part of the university's health insurance plan has grown from under 200 a few years ago to 1,200 last year. A steady increase in the number of international students has helped fuel that increase.\n\nMuegge said many international students are required, as part of their visa, to carry coverage while studying in the U.S.\n\nMissouri State is not alone in making the change. Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville and Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, among others, have recently dropped coverage for domestic students.\n\nMuegge said the recent review also showed domestic students who elected to participate in the university's plan often did so because they had ongoing health issues, which drove up the premiums. Students must pay to participate.\n\nLast year, the premium for health coverage through the university for any student \u2014 domestic or international \u2014 was $1,434. By dropping the coverage for domestic students, the university was able to lower premiums by $218 a year.\n\nThis year, international students can obtain individual coverage for $1,216. The annual cost goes to just over $2,000 if a spouse is added and more than $3,600 if the entire family is covered.\n\nWhile the university will no longer offer coverage for domestic students, it is putting together information on private and government programs. For example, domestic students can customize a plan through Academic HealthPlans, the same company the university uses for its international student coverage.\n\nTaylor Health Center, which is located on campus, also provides free basic office visits and reduced rates for lab work, X-rays and prescriptions. Muegge said each year, 66 percent of students have some contact with the health center \u2014 either calling with a question or receiving a flu shot \u2014 and up to 45 percent schedule an office visit.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1IYVbid", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Missouri State University will continue to offer a health insurance plan for international students.", "og": {"site_name": "Springfield News-Leader", "description": "Missouri State University will continue to offer a health insurance plan for international students.", "title": "MSU drops health insurance plan for U.S. students", "url": "http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/education/2015/07/14/msu-drops-health-insurance-plan-us-students/30163625/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-leader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Missouri State University will continue to offer a health insurance plan for international students.", "title": "MSU drops health insurance plan for U.S. students", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ec822acab9500e1eb24eb96757cd50d499fc53ae/c=577-0-2423-1846&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/14/Springfield/B9317935197Z.1_20150714192311_000_G9DB82IS0.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@springfieldNL", "site": "@springfieldNL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805766992", "fb": {"app_id": 164654783578465}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fda\"", "article_summary": "\"What they had seen was a decreasing use by domestic students and an increasing use by international students,\" he said.\nMissouri State University will no longer offer a health insurance plan for students from the U.S.\n(Photo: Kevin White/Missouri State University)Missouri State University will no longer offer a health insurance plan for the bulk of its students, those from the U.S.\nAn internal review showed up to 30 percent of Missouri State students go without health insurance of any kind each year.\nThe number of international students paying to be part of the university's health insurance plan has grown from under 200 a few years ago to 1,200 last year."}
