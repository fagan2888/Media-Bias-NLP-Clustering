Currently, RegionalCare owns and operates eight hospitals in Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas.\u200b\n\n\u200b\u200bArmed with fresh capital from Apollo Investment Fund VIII LP, an $18.4 billion vehicle raised in 2014, the firm is looking at further opportunities in the field, leveraging on the firm\u2019s deep experience in the credit side of health-care investing. The firm, which also makes real estate and distressed investments, has about $10 billion of health care-focused credit holdings in its $115 billion credit portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe growth of health care in our credit business has allowed us to benefit from their insights and focus on areas that fit with our value-oriented strategy,\u201d said Mr. Nord. \u201cIt is interesting to see, with the correction in the equity and debt markets, whether there [are] going to be more opportunities.\u201d\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Expecting a shakeout in the health-care space, Apollo Global Management is diving into private equity investment in the sector.", "title": "Apollo Delves into Health-Care Investing, Leverages Credit Experience", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/08/apollo-delves-into-health-care-investing-leverages-credit-experience/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Apollo Delves into Health-Care Investing, Leverages Credit Experience", "description": "Expecting a shakeout in the health-care space, Apollo Global Management is diving into private equity investment in the sector.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Expecting a shakeout in the health-care space, Apollo Global Management is diving into private equity investment in the sector.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-01-08T20:25:18-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/08/apollo-delves-into-health-care-investing-leverages-credit-experience/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19416", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Expecting a shakeout in the health-care space, Apollo Global Management is diving into private equity investment in the sector.", "title": "Apollo Delves into Health-Care Investing, Leverages Credit Experience", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/08/apollo-delves-into-health-care-investing-leverages-credit-experience/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19416", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-01-08T20:28:23-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Expecting a shakeout in the health-care space, Apollo Global Management is diving into private equity investment in the sector.\nThe firm, which also makes real estate and distressed investments, has about $10 billion of health care-focused credit holdings in its $115 billion credit portfolio.\n\u201cThe growth of health care in our credit business has allowed us to benefit from their insights and focus on areas that fit with our value-oriented strategy,\u201d said Mr. Nord.\n\u201cIt is interesting to see, with the correction in the equity and debt markets, whether there [are] going to be more opportunities.\u201dWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com\n\u201cIn the last couple of years, the receptiveness on the credit market and the low interest rates meant that some mistakes were made,\u201d said Matthew Nord, a private equity partner who leads investments in health care and business services at the New York firm."}
