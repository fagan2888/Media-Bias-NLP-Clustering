But there\u2019s some pretty significant macro-level lessons that I think other large urban districts would do well to really spend some time and look at what these guys are developing,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nThe secretary spent Thursday morning at McGlone Elementary in Montbello, where DPS officials highlighted the use of teacher leadership roles, enrollment zones and innovation status that gave principal Sara Gips autonomy in the school\u2019s budget.\n\nDuncan also participated in a roundtable discussion where he listened to three teachers and two school parents talk about the turnaround they\u2019ve seen in the past four years.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing for me is having a team,\u201d teacher leader Amy Lovell said. \u201cWe see everything as \u2018our kids\u2019 rather than \u2018these are the students that were assigned to me.\u2019 We\u2019re not flying alone in our classrooms.\u201d\n\nMcGlone is one of several schools in Denver that is piloting a \u201cdifferentiated roles\u201d program where teachers are able to spend half of their time teaching in the classroom and half of their time coaching or leading other teachers in shared planning.\n\nTeachers get a stipend for taking on the additional roles, but on Thursday all three teachers talked about the benefits they see professionally to learn from each other and to have support for difficult days.\n\nDuncan said later that the Department of Education\u2019s Teach to Lead initiative was influenced heavily by the DPS pilot program.\n\nMcGlone is also part of the far northeast enrollment zone \u2014 another innovation that Duncan cited as interesting \u2014 where multiple schools share a large boundary and kids are guaranteed a seat at any of the included schools, instead of only at one.\n\nThe idea was discussed as a way to create economic, social and racial integration.\n\n\u201cHaving the chance to be around kids that come from different backgrounds and having that social experience to build friendships and be comfortable in that environment, that\u2019s, I would argue, as important as the academic side,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cThere\u2019s some great creativity here that I think is part of the answer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go back home and figure out, can we incorporate some of that thinking?\u201d\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Education Secretary Duncan learning lessons from DPS programs", "title": "Education Secretary Duncan learning lessons from DPS programs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/14/education-secretary-duncan-learning-lessons-from-dps-programs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150514__CD15DUNCAN_RJ28828p1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150514__CD15DUNCAN_RJ28828p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-14T17:22:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T09:47:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "K-12 education"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce009\"", "article_summary": "U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan finished a two-day trip to Denver on Thursday and said his frequent, just about annual, visits are not a coincidence.\nDuncan said later that the Department of Education\u2019s Teach to Lead initiative was influenced heavily by the DPS pilot program.\nDenver Public Schools is a source of inspiration for the federal government.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go back home and figure out, can we incorporate some of that thinking?\u201dYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles\nBut there\u2019s some pretty significant macro-level lessons that I think other large urban districts would do well to really spend some time and look at what these guys are developing,\u201d Duncan said."}
