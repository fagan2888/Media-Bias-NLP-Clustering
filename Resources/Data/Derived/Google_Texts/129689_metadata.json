While one thinks Democrats are just trying to distract Americans from Obamacare, the other thinks the report can be dismissed since \u201cAmerica is awesome.\u201d\n\nIn a related report by the Inquisitr, the CIA torture report reveals the \u201cbrutal\u201d tactics used by officers within the Central Intelligence Agency, and the report was considered so bad that American offices overseas had their security increased in preparation for its release. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the CIA interrogation techniques used on terrorists at the same time that he asked Congress for authorization to send American ground troops against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama turned the page on these policies when he took office and during week one banned the use of torture and closed the detention and interrogation program. It was right to end these practices for a simple but powerful reason: they were at odds with our values. They are not who we are, and they\u2019re not who or what we had to become, because the most powerful country on earth doesn\u2019t have to choose between protecting our security and promoting our values.\u201d\n\nWhen talking about the CIA torture report on Fox News\u2019 Outnumbered, Andrea Tantaros argue that the Senate-produced report was strategically launched upon Americans by the Democratic Party. California Senator Dianne Feinstein will no longer serve as Chairwoman of the Committee in 2015 and Tantaros believes the Senate Democrats wanted to diminish the awesomeness of the United States before they relinquish control to Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America is awesome,\u201d Andrea Tantaros argues. \u201cWe are awesome. But we\u2019ve had this discussion. We\u2019ve closed the book on it. The reason they want the discussion is not to show how awesome we are. It\u2019s to show us how we\u2019re not awesome. They apologized for something. They don\u2019t like this country. They want us to look bad and all this does is have our enemies laughing at us.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Jesse Watters believes the timing of the CIA torture report was intended to be a distraction from the alleged woes of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know about it,\u201d said Watters. \u201cI think people do nasty things in the dark, especially after a terrorist attack. I find it ironic that they\u2019re dropping this report on the same day that Gruber\u2019s testifying, to knock that out of the front pages.\u201d\n\nThe report happened to come out when Jonathan Gruber testified before Congress about the Affordable Care Act. Gruber came under fire since he recently commented that Americans were \u201cstupid\u201d when it comes to Obamacare and he also suggested subsidies for health insurance were only available to those who received insurance on state-based exchanges, an issue that will be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015.\n\nAndrea Tantaros also believes the timing of the CIA torture report was suspicious.\n\n\u201cSunlight at the CIA? I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s one place I don\u2019t need sunlight. I don\u2019t think they need to give me a lot of transparency at the CIA. Look, thousands of Americans were killed after 9/11. The Bush administration did what the American public wanted, and that was do whatever it takes to keep us safe. These terror tactics have been stopped because as a country, we decided we are better than this. Which is my point. Then why are we putting out this memo?\u201d asks Tantaros. \u201cIt\u2019s about Democrats being so fundamentally lost as a party, Harris, they have to return to an old playbook. The plays that they ran right when Obama got into office trying to prosecute CIA officials for these terror tactics \u2014 and that same playbook that they feel got them the House of Representatives back, even under Tom DeLay\u2019s electoral map. They have nothing else to talk about,\u201d Tantaros added. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t want to talk about Gruber or health care or the IRS or anything else.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about the comments of Andrea Tantaros and Jesse Watters?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox News' Andrea Tantaros and Jesse Watters had an interesting response to the recent release of the CIA torture report, with both dismissing the claims", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Fox News\u2019 Andrea Tantaros and Jesse Watters had an interesting response to the recent release of the CIA torture report, with both dismissing the claims", "title": "Andrea Tantaros: CIA Torture Report A Distraction From Obamacare, Says Fox News [Video]", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1668969/andrea-tantaros-cia-torture-report-a-distraction-from-obamacare-says-fox-news-video/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/World-War-3-A-U.S.-Conspiracy-Ukraines-Nuclear-Weapons-Claimed-To-Be-An-American-Plot.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-10T11:02:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T14:01:17+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/World-War-3-A-U.S.-Conspiracy-Ukraines-Nuclear-Weapons-Claimed-To-Be-An-American-Plot.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-12-10T11:02:50+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,cia,cia torture report,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/World-War-3-A-U.S.-Conspiracy-Ukraines-Nuclear-Weapons-Claimed-To-Be-An-American-Plot.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Fox News\u2019 Andrea Tantaros and Jesse Watters had an interesting response to the recent release of the CIA torture report, with both dismissing the claims"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Andrea Tantaros also believes the timing of the CIA torture report was suspicious.\nFox News\u2019 Andrea Tantaros and Jesse Watters had an interesting response to the recent release of the CIA torture report, with both dismissing the claims contained within.\n\u201cThe United States of America is awesome,\u201d Andrea Tantaros argues.\nThey want us to look bad and all this does is have our enemies laughing at us.\u201dFox News\u2019 Jesse Watters believes the timing of the CIA torture report was intended to be a distraction from the alleged woes of Obamacare.\nI don\u2019t think they need to give me a lot of transparency at the CIA."}
