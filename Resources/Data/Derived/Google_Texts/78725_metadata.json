It proposes that Washington spend more on education, infrastructure and job training. He argues that spending will fuel economic growth.\n\n\n\nIt provides new tax breaks for those with modest incomes\u2014and raises taxes on Wall Street and high-income Americans to pay for them. It proposes to hold the budget deficit, which has declined lately, at a stable level relative to the size of the economy. But it does not eliminate the deficit.\n\n\n\nRead More I need to declare what on my taxes?!? Obamacare confusion\n\n\n\nRepublicans propose to cut precisely the kinds of domestic spending Obama wants more of. They argue that higher spending levels and taxes would retard future growth.\n\nThey would repeal \"Obamacare\" outlays for health insurance subsidies and sharply cut spending on the Medicaid program that provides health insurance for the poor. They would eliminate the deficit over 10 years, though they use some budgetary sleight of hand to do it\u2014assuming the government would find some other sources for the Obamacare tax revenues they'd repeal, and that their unspecified tax reforms would ramp up growth.\n\n\n\nThe competing approaches reflect the electoral coalitions and well as the underlying philosophies of each party. Democrats rely heavily on younger, low-income and nonwhite voters who disproportionately benefit from their tax and spending plans.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The stark contrast between President Obama and GOP lawmakers on the budget will frame the debate in the evolving 2016 race to elect Obama's successor.", "news_keywords": "President Barack Obama, Obamacare, Social Secuity, GOP, Congress, federal spending", "author": "John Harwood", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The stark contrast between President Obama and GOP lawmakers on the budget will frame the debate in the evolving 2016 race to elect Obama's successor.", "title": "Brawl over budget will frame 2016 presidential race", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/19/gop-budget-fights-will-frame-2016-presidential-race.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/19/102519020-463181532.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The stark contrast between President Obama and GOP lawmakers on the budget will frame the debate in the evolving 2016 race to elect Obama's successor.", "creator": "@johnjharwood", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/19/gop-budget-fights-will-frame-2016-presidential-race.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/19/102519020-463181532.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Brawl over budget will frame 2016 presidential race", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Elections, US: News, US Economy, Elections, Federal Budget (U.S.), Congress, Politics, Washington DC, White House, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-03-19T09:19:42-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Elections", "modified_time": "2015-03-19T10:41:31-0400", "tag": "White House"}, "pageNodeId": 102518996, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde411\"", "article_summary": "They would repeal \"Obamacare\" outlays for health insurance subsidies and sharply cut spending on the Medicaid program that provides health insurance for the poor.\nObamacare confusionRepublicans propose to cut precisely the kinds of domestic spending Obama wants more of.\nDemocrats rely heavily on younger, low-income and nonwhite voters who disproportionately benefit from their tax and spending plans.\nIt provides new tax breaks for those with modest incomes\u2014and raises taxes on Wall Street and high-income Americans to pay for them.\nIt proposes to hold the budget deficit, which has declined lately, at a stable level relative to the size of the economy."}
