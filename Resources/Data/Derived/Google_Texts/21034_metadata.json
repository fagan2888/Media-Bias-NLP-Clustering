Of the 26 Medicare Advantage plans available in Allegheny County, most have out-of-pocket maximums of $6,700, which is the highest dollar limit allowable under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nExceptions include one of the HumanaChoice PPOs (at $3,400), and four UPMC For Life HMO plans, three of which have out-of-pocket maximums of $3,400 and another with a $4,000 cap.\n\nThe cap is a safety net for senior citizens who might otherwise be wiped out by co-insurance costs, and \u201cthat safety net becomes a critical factor for people who have a lot of service needs,\u201d Mr. McKendree said.\n\nAnother change this year is that \u201cthe cost of non-generic prescriptions has gone up noticeably,\u201d Mr. McKendree said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, for those seniors using several prescribed medications, it\u2019s a good idea to review a plan\u2019s 2015 drug formulary to make sure medications are still covered and affordable, particularly if a physician prescribes brand-name or \u201cnon-preferred\u201d medications.\n\nSeniors should also review their finances each year to see if they are income-eligible for either of Pennsylvania\u2019s two pharmacy programs, PACE and PACENET, which sometimes can be a better fit than Medicare\u2019s drug benefit.\n\nPrices and cost-sharing also are rising on big-ticket items such as outpatient surgery, chemotherapy, complex procedures or durable medical equipment, Mr. McKendree said.\n\nEvery year Apprise fields calls from people whose plans have been canceled or consolidated into other plans. This year is no exception: Highmark is discontinuing its Medicare Advantage Freedom Blue PPO high-deductible plan, meaning those subscribers will have to select a new Advantage plan, or else they will be automatically enrolled in the traditional Medicare program.\n\nHighmark is folding its Security Blue HMO high-deductible plan into the Security Blue ValueRx HMO plan. Highmark\u2019s changes will affect about 13,000 people in the region, including 4,000 in Allegheny County.\n\nMost Americans choose the traditional, government-operated Medicare plans, known as Parts A and B. Medicare Part A covers hospitalization and hospice care, and Part B covers doctors\u2019 services and outpatient care.\n\nPart C, also known as Medicare Advantage, offers plans from private insurers that cover Part A and Part B costs and some prescription drug coverage plus vision and dental coverage. Medicare Part D is the 8-year-old benefit that covers prescription drugs, an optional plan that has its own monthly premium.\n\nIn 2014, 30 percent of the nearly 54 million Medicare subscribers are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage, a share that grows every very year. In Pennsylvania, about 39 percent on Medicare have a Part C plan, and the rest use the original plans.\n\nFor the many area seniors who stick with the traditional A and B plans, most won\u2019t have to pay a Part A premium, and for Part B most will pay a monthly premium of $105 a month. Those buying a separate Part D plan will see the average monthly cost rise slightly to $32.\n\nFor most, except those who become Medicare-eligible in the coming calendar year, the open-enrollment period, Oct. 15 to Dec. 7, is the main time to make changes to plans. The new plans will take effect Jan. 1.\n\nApprise plans several Medicare-related informational meetings, including one from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday at the Apprise offices, 6401 Penn Ave., East Liberty.
