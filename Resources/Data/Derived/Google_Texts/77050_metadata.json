Cummings\n\n\n\nFor the conservative movement, Ted Cruz was going to be a savior. The anointed one. His father told us that Ted was \u201canointed\u2026to bring the spoils of war to the Priests.\u201d The congregation of the New Beginnings Church in Irving, Texas, laid hands on Ted and he was invited to speak in tongues. And the high priests of National Review solemnly said \u201camen.\u201d\n\nLike Cummings\u2019 Buffalo Bill, Ted would \u201cride a watersmooth-silver stallion\u201d and break Donald Trump. Because the self-styled conservative movement had pronounced Ted to be an authentic \u201cconstitutionalist,\u201d and nothing else mattered.\n\nNot when Cruz alienated an entire state \u2014a large one \u2014 as when he accused Trump of representing \u201cNew York values.\u201d Some Jews felt not a little uncomfortable with that, as \u201cNew York values\u201d was often used as an anti-Semitic dog whistle. This sense of unease was heightened for some of us when Cruz told a New Hampshire audience that for Trump to attack him for taking loans from Goldman Sachs \u2014 where Cruz\u2019 wife Heidi works \u2014 was \u201cto use a New York term\u2026the height of chutzpah,\u201d apparently exaggerating the guttural \u201cch\u201d in chutzpah.\u201d As Dana Milbank wrote in the Washington Post, chutzpah \u201cis not a \u2018New York\u2019 term. It\u2019s a Yiddish \u2014 a Jewish \u2014 one.\u201d\n\nNow, many folks use the work \u201cchutzpah\u201d without offending anyone. It\u2019s a convenient term to describe extreme nerviness, and it\u2019s entered into the English language. Like \u201cbagels.\u201d For example, President Obama used \u201cchutzpah\u201d to describe Senate Republicans when they passed a bill to repeal Obamacare knowing he\u2019d veto.\n\nPersonally, I think that it was Cruz\u2019s clumsiness in the way he used the term that caused us to pause. A sort of extreme self-consciousness. As if his first draft of the speech had read \u201cto use a Jew-boy term,\u201d and then he changed it when he realized that some might find it offensive. This is an admittedly subjective feeling on my part. Rather like the hilarious Easter dinner scene in Woody Allen\u2019s Annie Hall, where the Woody character is so ill at ease with Annie\u2019s \u00fcber Wasp family that at one point he imagines himself looking like an ultraorthodox Jew to Annie\u2019s grandmother. Ted Cruz can come across as a very creepy guy.\n\nAnd neither does Cruz\u2019s utter cluelessness matter to the soi disant movement conservatives. As when he slandered all of the southeastern states:\n\nDonald has done well in the southeastern states.\u2026 Now Donald has a harder problem in the west, it\u2019s interesting, his location he does well in the southeast. He does well with a certain demographic of voter.\n\nAnd what demographic would that be? \u201cVoters who have relatively low information, who are not that engaged, and who are angry.\u201d Cruz blithely writes off the voters in huge swathes of America.\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting in this interview, however, is how Cruz manages to highlight an essential difference between him and Donald Trump. Trump had said that he loved \u201cthe poorly educated.\u201d Unlike the elitist Cruz, Trump does not think that a person\u2019s level of education is equivalent to his level of information or intelligence.\n\nWhat Trump said about \u201cthe poorly educated\u201d indicates his belief that these qualities don\u2019t correlate with one\u2019s level of education. Trump knows that an Ivy League education doesn\u2019t confer intelligence, and Ted Cruz is evidence of that fact. Just as in Cummings\u2019 poem, where the invocation of Jesus serves to highlight Buffalo Bill\u2019s arrogance, Ted Cruz betrays his false religiosity by his lack of humility.\n\nAnd now Ted Cruz has cemented his relationship with Mr. Death by being one of the first to blame Trump for the University of Illinois-Chicago riots that deprived him of his First Amendment right to free speech. (Surprisingly, Cruz was followed by Marco Rubio and John Kasich.) So much for Cruz\u2019s constitutional principles. He has allied himself with the likes of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Communist Party, and Bill Ayers, the terrorist who helped Barack Obama get started in politics.\n\nAnd at NRO, the magazine that fired Mark Steyn because he wrote somewhat harshly, but truthfully, about the Islamic terrorist groups that want to annihilate us, we have Kevin Williamson, a Defender of the Faith, advocating a final solution to the bothersome American Middle Class that supports Donald Trump:\n\nThe truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible.\u2026 The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles.\n\nGot that folks? The very people who made America possible, the bedrock of our culture that told the world that if only you were willing to work hard, you could make it in America. And if not you, then you could provide your children with a leg up the social ladder. These people \u201cdeserve to die.\u201d\n\nSadly, the conservative movement, in its histrionic, narcissistic pique \u2014 engendered by the realization that it no longer has a following \u2014 has completed the circle. The ideological right that filters reality through an artificial prism it calls \u201cconservative principles\u201d has become intertwined with the psychotic left, and the two untenable extremes are locked into a dance of death. And this is why Ted Cruz can never become president of the United States. He\u2019s defunct. Mr. Death doesn\u2019t have enough of a following in our country. Even after seven years of the Obama administration, this kind of nihilism has not gained a sufficient foothold to elect Ted Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Just as in Cummings\u2019 poem, where the invocation of Jesus serves to highlight Buffalo Bill\u2019s arrogance, Ted Cruz betrays his false religiosity by his lack of humility.\nAnd this is why Ted Cruz can never become president of the United States.\nCummingsFor the conservative movement, Ted Cruz was going to be a savior.\nEven after seven years of the Obama administration, this kind of nihilism has not gained a sufficient foothold to elect Ted Cruz.\nAnd the high priests of National Review solemnly said \u201camen.\u201dLike Cummings\u2019 Buffalo Bill, Ted would \u201cride a watersmooth-silver stallion\u201d and break Donald Trump."}
