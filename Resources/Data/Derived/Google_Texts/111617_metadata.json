It\u2019s not like he has a good left hand as it is,\u201d Malone said in jest. \u201cHe\u2019s a very strong, right-hand-dominant player. But after the game, the next day, the swelling, it did blow up. So why risk putting him out here? Not only hurting himself more, but when a guy tries to play like that, in the end sometimes he winds up hurting the team. And I know that\u2019s the last thing Jameer wants to do.\u201d\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nNurkic update. Nuggets center Jusuf Nurkic did not play against the Pacers because of left knee soreness. There is no real timetable for his return, just hope from Malone that it will be soon.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still out right now,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI think he\u2019s feeling better, but they still want to make sure there\u2019s nothing structurally wrong with his knee before they give him the go-ahead.\u201d\n\nNurkic tweaked the knee, which had surgery to repair a partially torn patellar tendon, in the spring. He played in six games before aggravating it.\n\n\u201cYou have to be smart about it,\u201d Malone said. \u201cOn one hand, you want to throw him out there because he\u2019s a load for us, offensively and defensively. Our defensive numbers with him on the floor are really good. But it\u2019s the same knee he\u2019s just come back from, being out as long as he has. You don\u2019t want to jeopardize his long-term, big picture for \u2018this\u2019 game. He\u2019s such a big part of what we\u2019re trying to do, we want to be smart and prudent about bringing him back at the right time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jameer Nelson missed Nuggets game with sprained wrist", "title": "Jameer Nelson missed Nuggets game with sprained wrist", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/jameer-nelson-missed-nuggets-game-with-sprained-wrist/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__Jameer-Nelson-Nuggetsp1-4.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__Jameer-Nelson-Nuggetsp1-4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T22:22:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:21:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Jameer Nelson missed Sunday\u2019s game against Indiana because of a sprained left wrist, but Nuggets coach Michael Malone doesn\u2019t believe the ailment will shelve his reserve point guard for many games.\nBut it\u2019s the same knee he\u2019s just come back from, being out as long as he has.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any serious damage to the wrist, but it\u2019s still very sore and swollen,\u201d Malone said.\nNelson injured the wrist Friday during the Nuggets\u2019 loss to Miami but played the rest of that game after sitting out for a short time.\nNuggets center Jusuf Nurkic did not play against the Pacers because of left knee soreness."}
