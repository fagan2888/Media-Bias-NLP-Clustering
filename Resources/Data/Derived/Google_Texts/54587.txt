@SabrinaSiddiqui Ted Cruz will vote against deal but won't delay because "the timing has no impact on the outcome."

Well, well, well.That was pretty much true 16 days ago, too, before he conned the House into following his kamikaze plan. For his part, Cruz's puppy dog Mike Lee has folded, too . So that means that the House probably won't have to go first, as Boehner had agreed to do, because there won't be procedural roadblocks—a filibuster—to make it necessary.

That doesn't mean that Cruz has stopped being an asshole, as he made this announcement during a mini-press conference deliberately held while McConnell was speaking on the floor.





@mmurraypolitics RT @brikeilarcnn: Cruz coming to stakeout during McConnell floor speech is Washington's equivalent of a middle finger.



@igorvolsky Asked what he has gained in the last 3 weeks, Cruz says that more than 2 million people signed his petition to defund Obamacare.

Meanwhile, Cruz apparently thinks this is a personal win.So now he's got a kick-ass list of rubes to con more money out of. That's what the last 16 days of shutdown has been all about.

Please sign our petition thanking President Obama and Democrats in Congress for standing up to Republicans during the shutdown.
