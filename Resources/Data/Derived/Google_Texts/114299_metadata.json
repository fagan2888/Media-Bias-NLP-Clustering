The incident brought global attention to the extent of the group\u2019s operations in Europe, far afield of its traditional home base of Lebanon, where it was founded with a mission to fight Israel. But today, despite a European Union ban on the group's military wing, Hezbollah is just as strong on the continent as it was two years ago. Hezbollah\u2019s European networks are so strong, in fact, that just this month it was revealed that Hezbollah procurement agents bought parts and technologies in Europe for the surveillance drones the group deploys in Syria and Israel. And U.S. lawmakers are worried. On Tuesday, the House unanimously passed a bill that, if enacted into law, would allow the U.S. to take the unprecedented step of sanctioning European banks found to be doing business with the group. Related Story The Origins of Hezbollah\n\nNor was the Burgas plot Hezbollah's only operational venture in Europe at the time. Indeed, a similar Hezbollah plot targeting Israeli tourists en route to a Bulgarian ski resort had been foiled just six months earlier. To be sure, Hezbollah had been active in Europe for decades, but evidence uncovered in the weeks leading up to the Burgas bombing indicated Hezbollah's financial, logistical, criminal, and even operational activities in Europe were on the upswing, and those activities have not diminished. How did it get to the point that the U.S. would consider sanctioning banks in Europe to combat a movement spawned in Lebanon? Last year, Bulgarian investigators lifted the veil on Hezbollah\u2019s growing operational efforts in Europe when they found the group responsible for the Burgas bombing, which killed not only Israeli tourists but a Bulgarian bus driver. Hezbollah has long operated abroad at the behest of its sponsor and strategic partner, Iran. But the group had not carried out a terrorist operation on European soil in many years, making the Burgas attack a watershed event for European counterterrorism officials. A new twist in the case came just last week, when Bulgarian authorities revealed that one of the bombers was a dual Lebanese-French citizen. In other words, Hezbollah dispatched a European operative to carry out an attack on European soil in which a European citizen (among others) was killed.\n\nHezbollah does not suddenly have Europe in the crosshairs, as it did for a period of time in the 1980s. Then, Hezbollah carried out operations in Europe primarily at the behest of Iran, for example carrying out bombings in Paris to pressure France into ending arms sales to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. Other Hezbollah plots were aimed at securing the release of jailed comrades serving time for previous plots in Europe, such as plots in Germany aimed at freeing jailed TWA 847 hijacker Mohammad Hamadi. Today, Hezbollah operatives primarily take advantage of Europe\u2019s open societies and borders and use Europe as a preferred venue for support activities like arms procurement, logistics and fundraising. Hezbollah's decision to target Israeli civilians on European soil\u2014even if Europeans themselves were not the intended targets\u2014took things to another level. But its decision to target Israeli civilians on European soil\u2014even if Europeans themselves were not the intended targets\u2014took things to another level. When otherwise \u201clocal\u201d terrorist groups operate abroad, in this case in Europe, the networks they develop for logistics and fundraising can just as easily be leveraged to support terrorist operations as well. Hezbollah has sent operatives to the continent on a regular basis\u2014to places like Cyprus, France, and the Netherlands\u2014in some cases to collect intelligence and prepare for possible operations. In other cases, Hezbollah has recruited new operatives and held operational meetings across Europe, from Denmark to Poland. What European authorities discovered two years ago is emblematic of the group\u2019s continuing reach. For example, on July 7, 2012, just days before the Burgas bombing, Cypriot authorities raided the hotel room of Hossam Taleb Yaacoub, a 24-year-old Lebanese-Swedish dual national. Yaacoub\u2014a European citizen traveling on a European passport\u2014later testified to being a paid and \u201cactive member of Hezbollah\u201d sent to Cyprus to conduct surveillance. He claimed he did not know what his reconnaissance was for, but knew \u201csomething weird was going on\u201d and speculated it was \u201cprobably to bring down a plane, but I don't know, I just make assumptions.\u201d Later, he put it to police differently: \u201cIt was just collecting information about the Jews, and that is what my organization is doing everywhere in the world,\u201d he said, according to the Cypriot police transcript of his deposition. In the course of the investigation, police determined that before sending Yaacoub on his mission to Cyprus, Hezbollah first used him as a courier\u2014a role facilitated by his European passport\u2014dispatching him to deliver packages to operatives in places like Amsterdam and Lyon, France. Yaacoub was convicted in March 2013 on multiple charges, including participation in a criminal organization and in the preparation of a criminal act, and sentenced to four years in prison.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two years after bombing a Bulgarian airport, the group remains as strong as ever on the continent.", "author": "Matthew Levitt", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Two years after bombing a Bulgarian airport, the group remains as strong as ever on the continent.", "title": "What Is Hezbollah Doing in Europe?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/RTR352U9/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/what-is-hezbollah-doing-in-europe/374973/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe195a\"", "article_summary": "Today, Hezbollah operatives primarily take advantage of Europe\u2019s open societies and borders and use Europe as a preferred venue for support activities like arms procurement, logistics and fundraising.\nIn other cases, Hezbollah has recruited new operatives and held operational meetings across Europe, from Denmark to Poland.\nHezbollah does not suddenly have Europe in the crosshairs, as it did for a period of time in the 1980s.\nRelated Story The Origins of HezbollahNor was the Burgas plot Hezbollah's only operational venture in Europe at the time.\nTwo years ago this month, Hezbollah operatives murdered six people\u2014five tourists and their bus driver\u2014and wounded many more in a bus bombing at the airport in Burgas, Bulgaria."}
