Kauffman and his colleagues at the Wyoming Migration Initiative had reams of data from radio-collared animals but no established method of showing it off to the public.\n\n\u201cI was describing how we should do it like Raiders of the Lost Ark,\u201d Kauffman said this week. In the travel scene from that movie, Indiana Jones\u2019s globe-hopping is depicted by a line growing across a 1930s-style map.\n\nKauffman\u2019s dream comes true in a video \u201cWyoming\u2019s Big Game Migrations and 50 Years of Wilderness,\u201d which depicts the importance of wilderness to the migrations of bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, moose and pronghorn antelope. The five-minute piece may not be groundbreaking science, but it could be a breakthrough in conveying scientific information to the public.\n\nThe same kinds of animated lines seen in the classic movie starring Harrison Ford also grow in the wildlife video. The University of Oregon\u2019s InfoGraphics Lab produced the animated maps.\n\nThey show moose traversing the Teton Wilderness from Jackson Hole to southern Yellowstone National Park. Elk migrate from eastern Yellowstone through three wilderness areas to winter grounds south of Cody. Bighorn sheep traverse wilderness areas near Dubois, and deer and pronghorn make other wilderness treks.\n\nAccompanied by a soundtrack, stunning still photography and eye-candy footage of migrating animals, the package paints a picture of the role wilderness plays in the survival of Wyoming\u2019s wildlife. It was released during the 50th anniversary year of the Wilderness Act, the 30th anniversary year of the Wyoming Wilderness Act.\n\nSome of the most dramatic shots are of wild animals being released by biologists and field workers after being caught and collared. Their zest for escape reveals wildlife\u2019s insatiable desire for freedom and open spaces.\n\nMost surprising to Kauffman was how much wilderness animals used during migrations. In Southeast Wyoming\u2019s Platte Valley, mule deer pass through four wilderness areas in Wyoming and Colorado during a yearlong cycle.\n\nKauffman and his migration team are working on a migration atlas that will show many of the routes he and others have discovered. The video is an offshoot of that, another way to show the public that if it values wildlife, it needs to protect the migrations that allow animals to live across the landscape.\n\nUntil now, \u201cwe haven\u2019t taken the reams of data and figured out how we illustrate and visualize those migrations,\u201d Kauffman said.\n\nWilderness visitors might see deer or elk in the high country in summer and figure their future is secure, protected by the Wilderness Act. But those animals can\u2019t survive in the mountains during the winter, and wilderness visitors might not immediately understand what other lands are necessary for their survival.\n\nThe best example is the mule deer migration from the Red Desert to Hoback Junction. Between 4,000 and 5,000 deer make the 150-mile journey, crossing a mix of public and private property.\n\nOne bottleneck included private land that could have been developed, potentially cutting the route off. Kauffman and others\u2019 research identified that parcel and the Conservation Foundation is now in the process of trying to buy it to prevent development.\n\n\u201cMigration only works if you do the whole thing,\u201d Kauffman said of preservation. \u201cOnce we mapped the wilderness areas, we had to say something about the connectivity areas.\u201d\n\nWilderness travelers who value their summertime wildlife experiences may learn from the video, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the multiple-use landscapes \u2014 that\u2019s where the work needs to be done.\u201d\n\nAnimals migrate because they have to.\n\n\u201cOne of the things coming into focus to us is migration is a key strategy,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the solution these animals have in making a living on the Wyoming landscape.\u201d\n\nThey can no more live year-round on their winter range than they can on their high summer pastures. By moving uphill in the spring, wildlife take advantage of vegetation as it greens up and is most nutritious.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t live off the forage that\u2019s on the low-elevation range,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t live well. I think people are increasingly making that connection.\u201d\n\nKauffman and others are seeking to convey scientific information in ways that engage the general public. In one presentation, he showed a slide of a typical scientific paper, complete with small type, inaccessible verbiage, extensive footnotes and an exhaustive bibliography.\n\nSuch dry work quickly shelved in bureaucrats\u2019 offices to collect dust. In contrast, slide shows, illustrated booklets, beautiful maps, and now videos with \u201cRaiders\u201d cartographic animation, quickly get the message to the public and their policy- and decision-making representatives.\n\n\u201cThese journeys are fascinating to us,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cI think the public wants to understand these, which is why we\u2019re trying to tell these stories.\u201d\n\nBryce Tugwell, director of New Media, directed the video. James Meacham of Oregon was the chief cartographer while Brad Watson narrated. Mark Gocke, Joe Riis, Morgan Heim, Randy Travis and Ray Hageman contributed footage while still photography came from Scott Copeland.\n\nPrimary funders for the Atlas of Wildlife Migration was provided by the Knobloch Family Foundation, George B. Storer Foundation, University of Wyoming Biodiversity Institute, and U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nAngus M. Thuermer Jr. is the natural resources reporter for WyoFile.
