The National Park Service says a Montana man found dead in Yellowstone National Park was the victim of a grizzly bear attack.

Based on tracks found at the scene and other evidence, it appears that an adult female grizzly and at least one cub were likely involved. However, authorities were not releasing an official cause of death until an autopsy is done Monday and additional evidence is reviewed.

The victim's name has not been released, pending notification of relatives.

The man's body was found Friday afternoon in a popular off-trail area near Lake Village.

Bear traps were set in the area on Friday evening and the area closed until further notice. If bears are trapped and identified as having been involved in the attack, they will be euthanized.
