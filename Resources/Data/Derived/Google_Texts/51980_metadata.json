They wrote:\n\nThe left is orchestrating an effort to harass and intimidate people who support conservative causes, a persecuted class. Part of their attack forces organizations like yours to report the names and addresses of your donors to the government, and then exposing those names and addresses on government websites for anyone to see.\n\nThe Jan. 15 memo, headlined \u201cStop the Momentum Forcing Donor Disclosure,\u201d cited multiple cases of donors to conservative groups who were \u201couted\u201d and later faced repercussions.\n\nBrendan Eich, the former Mozilla CEO, for example, was forced out of the tech company after the Los Angeles Times revealed he had made a political donation in 2008 to the Proposition 8 ballot initiative in California preserving the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\n\nThe Conservative Action Project said the left\u2019s new campaign, spearheaded by progressives fighting \u201canti-corruption\u201d efforts such as RepresentUs, is an effort to \u201cchoke off [the] air supply of funding\u201d from conservative organizations.\n\n\u201cJust as the right to pull the curtain closed behind us as we vote for our chosen candidates is sacrosanct, so too is our right to support charities and interest groups without the government standing over our shoulder and sharing the information with the wider world,\u201d the coalition of leaders wrote.\n\nIn 2015, they said, at least six states\u2014Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington\u2014either proposed or geared up to introduce bills to force donor disclosure.\n\nThe coalition said bills introduced in South Carolina and Texas, supposedly intended to eliminate corruption among state officials, ended up forcing private groups to report the names and addresses of their supporters to the government:\n\nThis is an affront to the deeply held values that are enshrined in the First Amendment. Every American has the right to support causes they believe in. To keep that right a reality, we must protect individual privacy.\n\nThe Conservative Action Project was founded by former Attorney General Edwin Meese, currently the Ronald Reagan distinguished fellow emeritus at The Heritage Foundation. The coalition includes leaders of more than 100 groups across the conservative movement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coalition pushes back against what it calls renewed efforts on the left to force disclosure of donors to right-leaning organizations.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Coalition pushes back against what it calls renewed efforts on the left to force disclosure of donors to right-leaning organizations.", "title": "Conservatives Denounce New Efforts to 'Expose' Donors", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160119_CAPMemo_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-19T17:54:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ZzwLA7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Coalition pushes back against what it calls renewed efforts on the left to force disclosure of donors to right-leaning organizations.", "title": "Conservatives Denounce New Efforts to 'Expose' Donors", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160119_CAPMemo_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "transparency", "published_time": "2016-01-19T17:36:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T17:54:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Conservative Action Project, CAP,  donor disclosure, conservative organizations, donor transparency, Citizens United, tea party"}, "article_summary": "Conservative leaders are coming together to push back against what they call renewed momentum on the left to force right-leaning organizations to disclose their donors.\nThe Conservative Action Project was founded by former Attorney General Edwin Meese, currently the Ronald Reagan distinguished fellow emeritus at The Heritage Foundation.\nThey wrote:The left is orchestrating an effort to harass and intimidate people who support conservative causes, a persecuted class.\nThe Jan. 15 memo, headlined \u201cStop the Momentum Forcing Donor Disclosure,\u201d cited multiple cases of donors to conservative groups who were \u201couted\u201d and later faced repercussions.\nThe Conservative Action Project said the left\u2019s new campaign, spearheaded by progressives fighting \u201canti-corruption\u201d efforts such as RepresentUs, is an effort to \u201cchoke off [the] air supply of funding\u201d from conservative organizations."}
