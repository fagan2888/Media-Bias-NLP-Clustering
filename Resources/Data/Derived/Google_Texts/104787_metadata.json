But the billionaire frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination continued to insist that there isn\u2019t much violence at his events.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t condone violence, and we have very little violence. Very, very little violence at the rallies,\u201d he told ABC News host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday morning. And what violence there is, he suggested, is the result of protesters going to great lengths to provoke his supporters.\n\nRelated: Hopes for Trump\u2019s Foreign Policy Debut Are\u2026Not High\n\nThe attack at the Tucson rally occurred after two men, one wearing an improvised Ku Klux Klan hood, interrupted Trump\u2019s speech. (The man appeared to be wearing the hood not in support of the white supremacist group, but as a protest against what many see as bigotry inherent in Trump\u2019s campaign.)\n\nAs the men were being led out of the arena, an African-American man in attendance lunged from his seat and struck the second protestor, who was not wearing a hood, but an American flag t-shirt.\n\nAsked to condemn the violence, Trump demurred, saying the protesters \u201care very disruptive people.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cHe or his partner was wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit. This happened to be an African-American man, a person at the rally, who was very, very incensed at the fact that somebody, a protester, would be wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit, and he went wild. And frankly, that was a tough thing to watch, and I watched that, but why would a protester walk into a room with a Ku Klux Klan outfit on?\u201d\n\nRelated: Could a Trump Candidacy Flip the House to Democrats?\n\nThe assault was the low point of a weekend that saw protesters temporarily block a road leading to the site of one Trump event in order to prevent his supporters from attending, as well as a large protest outside Trump Tower, the iconic New York headquarters of Trump\u2019s offices.\n\n\u201cThey are really stopping our first amendment rights if you think about it,\u201d Trump said to Stephanopoulos. \u201cAt what point do people blame the protesters? These are people that are professional agitators?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re blaming the protesters, not the person who punched and kicked the protester?\u201d the host asked incredulously.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying this,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cThese are professional agitators. I think that somebody should say, when a road is blocked going into the event so that people have to wait sometimes hours to get in, I think it\u2019s very fair that there should be blame there too.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Republicans Gear Up to Stop Trump, Kasich Plays Spoiler\n\nTrump also complained about what he called an unfair double standard.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really unfair that these, really, in many cases, professional, in many cases really sick protesters, can put cars in the road blocking thousands of great Americans from coming to a speech, and nobody says anything about that. But they\u2019ll say something about\u2026whatever\u2026let me just tell you it\u2019s a very unfair double standard.\u201d\n\nHe also praised his controversial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was caught on video wading into the protesters with a private security guard and personal grabbing one young man by the collar. Lewandowski is already facing a criminal complaint filed by a reporter who claims that he assaulted her after a Trump event in Florida.\n\n\u201cWhy is your campaign manager out in the crowd engaging protesters?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t touch him,\u201d Trump replied, despite the fact that hours before, virtually every major news outlet in the country had started running footage that showed Lewandowski reaching out and grabbing the young man\u2019s shirt collar. (The video also seemed to show that a private security guard next to Lewandowski, not the campaign manager, exerted the force that spun the young man around and pulled him backward.)\n\nRelated: Trump vs. Clinton Rewrites Elections by Class, Race and Gender\n\n\u201cI give him credit for having spirit,\u201d Trump said of Lewandowski.\n\nThe fact that Lewandowski was personally helping physically remove protesters mystified Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus, who also spoke to Stephanopoulos Sunday.\n\nWithout even being asked to address Lewandowski\u2019s actions, he said, \u201cLeave it to the professionals. I mean, the Sheriff was there in the crowd, and the Secret Service was there, and that\u2019s their job.\u201d He added, \u201cObviously, my point would be leave those things to the professionals. Don\u2019t get involved in crowds in those altercations, and that\u2019s why the pros are there.\n\nThe fresh incidence of violence at a Trump rally came just days after he predicted that there would be riots if he were to win the most delegates in the Republican presidential primary but fail to achieve a majority and lose the nomination at the convention.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but I will say this, you\u2019re going to have a lot of unhappy people,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Conservative-Backed Third-Party Candidate Will Have to Wait\n\nAsked if he would tell his supporters not to riot if he loses, Trump said he would, but made it clear that he wasn\u2019t sure he could control them.\n\n\u201cI would certainly tell them that but look, these people are fervent. They want to see positive things happen for our country. I would certainly say that. I don\u2019t want to see riots. I don\u2019t want to see problems.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Another person was attacked at a Donald Trump rally this weekend \u2013 in this case a Trum", "title": "Once Again, Trump Blames the Protester for Getting Punched and Kicked", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/20/Once-Again-Trump-Blames-Protester-Getting-Punched-and-Kicked", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTSB9GU.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/20/Once-Again-Trump-Blames-Protester-Getting-Punched-and-Kicked", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTSB9GU.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Another person was attacked at a Donald Trump rally this weekend \u2013 in this case a Trum", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f2a\"", "article_summary": "Related: Trump vs. Clinton Rewrites Elections by Class, Race and Gender\u201cI give him credit for having spirit,\u201d Trump said of Lewandowski.\n\u201cWhy is your campaign manager out in the crowd engaging protesters?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked.\nThese are people that are professional agitators?\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re blaming the protesters, not the person who punched and kicked the protester?\u201d the host asked incredulously.\nAsked to condemn the violence, Trump demurred, saying the protesters \u201care very disruptive people.\u201dHe continued, \u201cHe or his partner was wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit.\n\u201cThey are really stopping our first amendment rights if you think about it,\u201d Trump said to Stephanopoulos."}
