Federal employees -- especially younger ones with fewer connections -- tend to get walled off in silos, which limits their ability to foster new skills, cultivate relationships and voice their ideas. By bringing its Silicon Valley philosophy to human capital management, 18F believes it can eliminate many of those obstacles.\n\n18F is working with OPM on its GovConnect initiative, which attempts to sidestep organizational silos by connecting employees with specific skills to projects that match those abilities. Former OPM Director Katherine Archuleta launched the program in 2014, with pilot projects cropping up at several agencies across government.\n\nAs OPM was looking to expand those pilots and learn what was working well and what was not, it decided to hire 18F to help build a blueprint for a creating a successful skills match program.\n\nGSA runs a program called Open Opportunities, which helps federal employees connect with tasks outside their day-to-day jobs. The technology Allen helped build for that program, Midas, has played a key role in several GovConnect pilot projects. Allen said lending 18F\u2019s experience to GovConnect allows her and her team to engage with agencies \u201cthat are doing the same kinds of things\u201d they are working on.\n\n\u201cThis is a chance for us to really dig in and do some amazing research,\u201d Allen told Government Executive.\n\nAs it typically does, 18F has conducted that discovery research before preaching any best practices. Nunnally led that effort, meeting with project mentors, pilot agencies and programs not tied to GovConnect to glean whether a top-down or bottom-up approach to these initiatives is more successful, how to expand a pilot to a full-blown government program, how employees were able to work their side projects into their daily responsibilities and other lessons from the federal guinea pigs.\n\nNunnally, who spent more than 8 years in private sector technology consulting before recently joining 18F, said there was a bit of a learning curve when he first joined the relatively young GSA component.\n\n\u201cI thought I knew what a big organization was,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil I came to government.\u201d\n\nAfter conducting the reviews, Nunnally and 18F will put together a \u201cstarter kit\u201d with \u201cproven techniques\u201d to help agencies start and scale GovConnect programs. Allen said the goal is to not just \u201cwrite a report that no one\u2019s going to read.\u201d 18F held a multi-day workshop this week to bring pilot participants to validate that there is an interest and to allow pilot participants to bounce ideas off each other.\n\n\u201cWe already have a group of people that are interested in reading it,\u201d Allen said of the forthcoming starter kits. Nunnally added that by involving the participants in the workshops, they will see their ideas and voices in the final report, further increasing the odds that it will actually go to good use.\n\n\u201cWe hear their stories and bring their stories together,\u201d Nunnally said. \u201cWe just packaged it together.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Allen said, the projects 18F is helping to launch and build can help plug the holes left open by a government model that \u201cpredates current technology and management practices.\u201d The current civil service system lacks opportunities for professional development and leaves managers -- who are facing shrinking budgets -- without the people to do the work they need to get done, she said.\n\nAllowing employees with the right skills for a specific project or task to fill a gap somewhere else in their agency or across government is likely to be more efficient than sending someone to training or a conference, Allen said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of problems that don\u2019t require an interagency work group,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe new programs will also benefit employees, who can forge new relationships and learn new skills. They will also provide more avenues for the rank-and-file to make their ideas heard.\n\nIn the government\u2019s old way of thinking, an idea at the grassroots level \u201cgoes up the chain then it goes back down the chain, and often it gets stuck in that hierarchy,\u201d Allen said.\n\nShe added that 18F was created by \u201chacking bureaucracy,\u201d and this latest imitative is simply an example of how it is continuing that tradition.\n\n(Image via ra2studio / Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Katz", "description": "18F hopes to match agencies with employees while benefiting both.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "18F hopes to match agencies with employees while benefiting both.", "title": "How Government Techies Can Usher in the Next Generation of Federal Workers", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/management/2015/09/how-government-techies-can-usher-next-generation-federal-workers/120248/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/03/090315networking_V3qbez0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "18F hopes to match agencies with employees while benefiting both.", "creator": "@EricM_Katz", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/03/090315networking_V3qbez0/open-graph.jpg", "title": "How Government Techies Can Usher in the Next Generation of Federal Workers", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-03T20:27:50Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/03/090315networking_V3qbez0.jpg", "sailthru.title": "How Government Techies Can Usher in the Next Generation of Federal Workers", "keywords": "opm, recruitment, gsa, federal hiring, 18f, govconnect", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/03/090315networking_V3qbez0/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "recruitment,gsa,channel-management,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "18F hopes to match agencies with employees while benefiting both."}, "article_summary": "GSA runs a program called Open Opportunities, which helps federal employees connect with tasks outside their day-to-day jobs.\nFormer OPM Director Katherine Archuleta launched the program in 2014, with pilot projects cropping up at several agencies across government.\nThe technology Allen helped build for that program, Midas, has played a key role in several GovConnect pilot projects.\nFederal employees -- especially younger ones with fewer connections -- tend to get walled off in silos, which limits their ability to foster new skills, cultivate relationships and voice their ideas.\nThe federal government is applying its technology experts to fix what ails its workforce."}
