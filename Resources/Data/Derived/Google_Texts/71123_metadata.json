Kay Hagan, D-N.C.and Thom Tillis had their first debate for the race for U.S. Senate on Wednesday. Photo by Claire Collins\n\nSen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., and state Speaker of the House Thom Tillis, R-Mecklenburg , met at the UNC-TV studios in Research Triangle Park to challenge their opponent\u2019s positions on health care, immigration and education spending.\n\nThe tight race has received increased national attention compared with past congressional elections in the state \u2014 and may prove to be crucial in deciding which political party will control the Senate for the remainder of Obama\u2019s term. Nearly $30 million has been spent by the candidates and outside groups thus far, the second-most of any state this cycle.\n\nHagan has maintained a slight advantage over Tillis in recent polls, with a late August Suffolk University-USA Today poll showing Hagan leading Tillis by 2 percentage points \u2014 well within the poll\u2019s 4.4 percent margin of error.\n\nTeacher pay came up multiple times during the hour-long debate, with Tillis trumpeting the average 7 percent pay raise for teachers that passed the state legislature this summer.\n\nTillis said the pay raise makes the state regionally and nationally competitive.\n\nBut Hagan said the pay raise does little to benefit senior teachers and is not enough to stem the exodus of teachers leaving the state for higher paying teaching jobs.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is 48th in the nation on what we spend per pupil, and Thom Tillis is bragging about that?\u201d\n\nHagan also criticized Tillis on his support of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision in June, which deemed that closely-held corporations cannot be required to offer contraception if it goes against their religious beliefs.\n\nTillis said he supports corporations\u2019 reli gious freedom, as well as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u2019 idea to increase contraceptive access by offering oral contraception over the counter without a prescription.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom is a bedrock principle of our country,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cTaxpayer funding is different from access.\u201d\n\nTillis, in turn, attacked Hagan for her and Obama\u2019s claims that families and doctors could keep their previous health insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Charlotte Republican frequently tied Hagan to Obama and his policies, calling her a \u201crubber stamp.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s popularity has languished below 50 percent since April 2013, according to Gallup, and Tillis took aim at Obama.\n\n\u201cThe President considers the three branches of government to be the executive branch, his pen and his phone,\u201d he said of Obama\u2019s immigration policy.\n\nHagan attempted to distance herself from Obama by highlighting her votes against trade deals that hurt the state\u2019s economy and referred to herself as the most moderate senator, according to the Congressional Quarterly.\n\nMitch Kokai, policy analyst for the right-leaning John Locke Foundation, said presidents and their political parties often suffer in the sixth year of their tenures, and N.C.\u2018s Senate seats often switch parties.\n\n\u201cThe flip side is that even though the historical factors are going against Kay Hagan, all the polling has shown her even \u2014 or slightly ahead of Thom Tillis,\u201d Kokai said.\n\nKokai said the debate offered the candidates an opportunity to reach voters beyond the campaign ads.\n\nLibertarian candidate Sean Haugh was not invited to participate in the debate.\n\nEarlier in the day Haugh tweeted, \u201cSeriously, if my Democratic and Republican opponents are afraid to face little ol\u2019 me, how can they stand up to our enemies?\u201d\n\nThe debate was the first of two sponsored by the North Carolina Association of Broadcasters. The second debate will be held on Oct. 7.\n\nstate@dailytarheel.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "DURHAM \u2014 The two major party candidates in North Carolina\u2019s highly competitive U.S. Senate race touted their platforms to voters in the first televised debate of this election season Wednesday.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Tar Heel", "description": "DURHAM \u2014 The two major party candidates in North Carolina\u2019s highly competitive U.S. Senate race touted their platforms to voters in the first televised debate of this election season Wednesday.", "title": "US Senate candidates faced off in first debate of season", "url": "http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2014/09/us-senate-candidates-faced-off-in-first-debate-of-season", "image": "http://d39xfl750sfsi8.cloudfront.net/201604217ygrp9dscZ/dist/img/DTH-fb-icon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.dailytarheel.com", "site": "@dailytarheel", "card": "summary"}, "publish_date": "2014-09-03 16:21:48", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailytarheel"}, "google-site-verification": "CHlXbXA4sWralvQUEv7pJfpAAlXw8V34QT7XXWre_aU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0db\"", "article_summary": "US Senate candidates faced off in first debate of seasonNick Niedzwiadek | Published 09/03/14 4:21pmSen.
