That fight could lead to the underfunding of Medicaid and the closing of hospitals and nursing homes across the state.\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives presented a bill to raise the tax on a pack of cigarettes by dollar fifty to fund Medicaid, but when they realized they didn\u2019t have the votes needed to pass the measure they suspended everything leaving the bill open for hours.\n\nRepublicans didn\u2019t have enough votes by themselves, so they needed Democrats, and democrats won\u2019t back the plan until Republicans agree to accept hundreds of millions of dollars in Obamacare money.\n\n\u201cYou will see our caucus stay lock step in our opposition to the cigarette tax until they use a portion of that money to bring nine hundred million dollars home,\u201d said Representative Scott Inman (D) House Minority Leader.\n\nHouse Speaker Jeff Hickman (R) District 58 said, \u201cSo if that\u2019s the position they\u2019re taking that without Obamacare coming into the state and full expansion of Medicaid and they\u2019re willing devastate the rest of state government for it then they\u2019re going to have to answer at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nIn an unusual move, Governor Mary Fallin worked the floor of the house and talked with the media. She said accepting Obamacare dollars isn\u2019t that easy for political reasons. \u201cYou have to deal with political realities. So what I\u2019m saying is let\u2019s get the money on the table from the cigarette tax.\u201d\n\nThe governor said democrats have to cave. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for them to come to the table. The legislators are very prepared to stay here as long as they need to.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. After republican house members made their comments to the press, we followed them as many attended an end of the session party at an Oklahoma City ranch, nowhere near the Capitol.\n\n\u201cBut instead of negotiating in good faith as they should do knowing that they need our support they simply put a vote on the board and demand we vote for something without any particular cost or thought to how we could expand healthcare coverage,\u201d said Inman.\n\nThe vote could have stayed open until midnight, but with most representatives not returning to the Capitol, leaders gaveled out just after 10 p.m. Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "It\u2019s been a very unusual night as Republicans and Democrats fight over a proposed cigarette tax.", "author": "Aaron Brilbeck", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/32010998/house-republicans-demand-action-over-proposed-cigarette-tax-then-party", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10590045_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It\u2019s been a very unusual night as Republicans and Democrats fight over a proposed cigarette tax.", "title": "House Republicans Demand Action Over Proposed Cigarette Tax Then Party"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10590045_G.jpg", "description": "It\u2019s been a very unusual night as Republicans and Democrats fight over a proposed cigarette tax.", "card": "summary", "title": "House Republicans Demand Action Over Proposed Cigarette Tax Then Party"}, "wnreadableurl": "house-republicans-demand-action-over-proposed-cigarette-tax-then-party", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/05/18", "KEYWORDS": "Taxes, Capitol, cigarette, Republicans, Democrats, proposed, debate, Medicaid, okc, news 9, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS08", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "Taxes, Capitol, cigarette, Republicans, Democrats, proposed, debate, Medicaid, okc, news 9, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s been a very unusual night as Republicans and Democrats fight over a proposed cigarette tax.\nShe said accepting Obamacare dollars isn\u2019t that easy for political reasons.\nThat fight could lead to the underfunding of Medicaid and the closing of hospitals and nursing homes across the state.\nRepublicans didn\u2019t have enough votes by themselves, so they needed Democrats, and democrats won\u2019t back the plan until Republicans agree to accept hundreds of millions of dollars in Obamacare money.\nSo what I\u2019m saying is let\u2019s get the money on the table from the cigarette tax.\u201dThe governor said democrats have to cave."}
