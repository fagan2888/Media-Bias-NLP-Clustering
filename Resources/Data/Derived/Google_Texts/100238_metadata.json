Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, told The Daily Signal after the vote. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for two and a half years\u2014we\u2019ve been lied to, put off, and dissed by the different regulatory agencies, and we\u2019ve prevailed.\u201d\n\n>>> Scroll to the bottom to see how your member of Congress voted.\n\nOperation Choke Point was launched by the Justice Department in 2013 as a way to fight fraud by pressuring banks to \u201cchoke off\u201d access to credit and other banking services by merchants and industries the administration considered a high risk for fraud.\n\nWithout access to banking services, it is difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014for a business to survive.\n\nRepublicans who have been fighting the program believe that the Obama administration abused its power under Operation Choke Point by targeting entire lines of legal industries. Some members view the tactics as \u201creminiscent of the IRS targeting of conservatives,\u201d as Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., said Thursday on the House floor.\n\nBusinesses targeted under Operation Choke Point include gun sellers, pawn shops, and short-term lenders. The National Rifle Association is among groups that have strongly come out against it.\n\n\u201cCongressman Luetkemeyer\u2019s legislation puts an end to the Obama administration\u2019s unwarranted attacks upon a legal and thriving sector of the American economy,\u201d said Chris Cox, executive director of NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action. \u201cOn behalf of the NRA\u2019s 5 million members, I\u2019d like to thank Congressman Luetkemeyer for his steadfast support of the Second Amendment and congratulate him on the passage of H.R. 766.\u201d\n\nLuetkemeyer\u2019s bill, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, bans federal agencies that oversee banks from requesting or ordering that banks terminate customer accounts \u201cunless the regulator has material reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are debating a bill on the floor of the House that says the government can\u2019t force banks to shut down legal banking accounts,\u201d Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said on the House floor. \u201cThe fact that we have to have this debate frightens me.\u201d\n\nThe measure requires that any requests to close a customer\u2019s banking account that come from a federal official be made in writing and rely on information other than \u201creputational risk.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201creputational risk\u201d has become a sticking point in the Operation Choke Point debate, as critics of the program believe that the term has been used to provide federal regulators a way to close bank accounts of legal and legitimate businesses the Obama administration doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cReputational risk\u201d is a commonly used term in the banking industry to describe businesses\u2014often illegal\u2014that are at high risk for fraud.\n\nIn 2011, guidelines created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) labeled firearms and ammunition sellers as \u201creputational risks,\u201d pinning them alongside pornography and other enterprises like Ponzi schemes and racist materials.\n\nAccording to investigations conducted by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, that list was adopted into the Justice Department\u2019s Operation Choke Point. After its adoption, many gun sellers, pawn shops, and short-term lenders reported their bank accounts being shut down.\n\nIn an effort to protect these business owners, which Republicans say are \u201cMain Street\u201d mo-and-pop shops, Luetkemeyer re-introduced his bill to choke off Operation Choke Point.\n\nLuetkemeyer had the full support of Republicans in the House, including Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee. On the House floor, Hensarling called the program an \u201coutrage\u201d to the American people.\n\n\u201cWe are losing the rule of law to the discretion of regulators,\u201d he said. \u201cFor legally constituted businesses to have to fear that in the dark of night they\u2019re going to be shut down by the awesome power of the Obama administration is an outrage.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Operation Choke Point has been shrouded in secrecy. Although the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act passed with bipartisan support\u2014with 10 Democrats voting in favor of the bill\u2014many on the left have likened its to a conservative conspiracy theory.\n\nIn a change of pace Thursday, some Democrats on the House floor acknowledged instances of innocent business owners losing access to basic financial services and even applauded Luetkemeyer for his efforts. However, those Democrats stopped short of supporting the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act.\n\n\u201cWe had a problem in a lot of communities around the country with businesses getting access to the banking system, and I know [Luetkemeyer] worked this very hard last year,\u201d Rep. Denny Heck, D-Wash., said. \u201cUnfortunately, this bill goes farther.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen some closures of accounts that I think are not adequately justified, but this bill doesn\u2019t just solve that problem,\u201d Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said. \u201cIt goes far beyond just simply calling for a justification of arbitrarily closed accounts.\u201d\n\nThose Democrats, led by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, argued the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act would give Wall Street a \u201cget out of jail free card.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Republicans] refuse to tell you what\u2019s really in this bill,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThey cannot stand up and defend why in the world they would take away the [Justice Department\u2019s] ability to investigate bad banks.\u201d\n\nWaters pointed to a section that would amend the the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, the statute that the Justice Department uses to carry out Operation Choke Point.\n\nUnder that law, Justice Department officials pursued civil penalties against banks doing business with fraudulent customers.\n\n\u201cThe DOJ has relied heavily on the powers granted under [the reform law] since the financial crisis,\u201d Waters said. \u201cWhy would anybody want to take away the Justice Department\u2019s investigative powers?\u201d\n\nLuetkemeyer accused Waters of spreading \u201cmisinformation,\u201d insisting her interpretation of the changes included in the bill are \u201cabsolutely, positively, 100 percent incorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it does do is stop DOJ from filing charges against banks for fraud whenever the bank\u2019s customer commits a crime or is doing something nefarious with one of their customers. In other words, you can\u2019t be responsible for what your customer is doing,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cI have a 35-year-old son. If he goes out and robs a quick shop, should I be responsible for him?\u201d\n\nThe White House voiced opposition to the bill, issuing a veto threat Tuesday against what the administration calls \u201cunnecessary, overly burdensome\u201d requirements.\n\n\u201cRestricting the federal banking agencies in this way could unnecessarily and dangerously hinder or compromise important law enforcement and national security efforts,\u201d The White House said in a formal statement.\n\nLuetkemeyer told The Daily Signal that he\u2019s pleased to get the attention of the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cIt tells me that they\u2019re afraid of what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Justice Department's secretive program pressures banks to \u201cchoke off\u201d access to credit by merchants and industries the administration opposes.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Justice Department's secretive program pressures banks to \u201cchoke off\u201d access to credit by merchants and industries the administration opposes.", "title": "See If Your Lawmaker Vote to End Operation Choke Point", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven681984_chokepointfeb.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-08T12:01:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1TH7dS8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Justice Department's secretive program pressures banks to \u201cchoke off\u201d access to credit by merchants and industries the administration opposes.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven681984_chokepointfeb.png"}, "title": "See If Your Lawmaker Vote to End Operation Choke Point", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach", "published_time": "2016-02-04T16:42:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T12:01:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "operation choke point, choke point, doj, justice department, doj choke point, guns, firearms, payday lending"}, "article_summary": "The House of Representatives concluded a tense debate Thursday by voting 250-169 to end a controversial Obama administration program called Operation Choke Point.\nBusinesses targeted under Operation Choke Point include gun sellers, pawn shops, and short-term lenders.\nRepublicans who have been fighting the program believe that the Obama administration abused its power under Operation Choke Point by targeting entire lines of legal industries.\nIn an effort to protect these business owners, which Republicans say are \u201cMain Street\u201d mo-and-pop shops, Luetkemeyer re-introduced his bill to choke off Operation Choke Point.\nAccording to investigations conducted by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, that list was adopted into the Justice Department\u2019s Operation Choke Point."}
