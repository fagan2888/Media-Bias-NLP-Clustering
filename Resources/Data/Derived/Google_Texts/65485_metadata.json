Rajasthan has perfected the art of converting these forts, palaces and pleasure pavilions of the Rajas of yore into beautiful hotels, creating examples for Sustainable and Responsible Tourism. These ancient properties still hold their charm, despite market interventions of modern luxury hospitality services. P Krishna Kumar tries to capture the USPs of the hotels from their heartland, Rajasthan\n\n\n\nAs a travel destination, it is the culture, heritage, and the life of the people built around it, including the colourful festivals, that are the key highlights of Rajasthan. This painted picture has helped Rajasthan gain a pre-eminent position in the tourism map of the country through the decades. The role played by heritage hotels in this context is remarkable for Rajasthan tourism. In fact, the concept of converting royal palaces, havelis, and forts into accommodation units originated in Rajasthan and flourished over the years. While on one hand, this rather innovative initiative has helped in conserving the royal legacy, on the other the same also supported the spirit of Responsible Tourism by generating direct and indirect employment for people living in the margins in the society.\n\n\n\nRajasthan is known for its rich history and heritage hotels have played a crucial role in sustaining this culture, informed Sunil Sikka, Head \u2013 Marketing & Business Development, WelcomHeritage. \u201cAt present many heritage properties owned by the royal families of Rajasthan have been converted into heritage hotels. The presence of these heritage hotels has contributed to the tourism of Rajasthan and created a niche for this state. Also, tourist traffic to India is primarily for heritage, and Rajasthan is the right destination for such an experience. The hotels preserve a part of the history where travellers can explore the charm and grandeur of India\u2019s rich culture and history. Rajasthan\u2019s Heritage Tourism should be promoted extensively in order to generate more traffic for heritage properties,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the vital role of heritage hotels in promoting destinations, K P Singh, Director - Sales & Marketing, Samode Hotels said, \u201cHeritage hotels play an important role in drawing travellers to the destination. They are a part of the local culture, folklore and history, and create a unique niche for themselves by attracting foreign and domestic tourists alike who are looking for a more immersive experience. Each heritage hotel has its own personality and ambience driven by its owners. Heritage hotels offer the perfect blend of the old and the new, the past and the present, the ancient and the modern.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrior to the sixties, there was no tourism infrastructure in Rajasthan. The conversion of palaces and forts into hotels and tourist attractions enabled Rajasthan to become a tourist attraction, informed Sandeep Arora, General Manager, Ranbanka Palace Jodhpur. \u201cHeritage hotels have been the catalyst for the growth of tourism in the state. The uniqueness of Rajasthan is that it is the \u2018Land of the Kings\u2019. The rich history and culture of Rajasthan is bes understood through the heritage hotels which have maintained some of the royal essence of that era,\u201d observed Arora.\n\n\n\nWhile in Europe, most of the travellers like to stay in boutique heritage hotels, said Gaurav Jain, Managing Director, Aamod Resorts. This applies to Rajasthan also with most of foreign travellers, he said. \u201cJust as the destinations to visit have to have something unique to draw tourists, so should the hotels; and if in Rajasthan, then it has to be heritage hotels,\u201d Jain said.\n\n\n\nModels of Sustainable & Responsible Tourism\n\nThe conversion of heritage structures into revenue-generating hospitality units have directly or indirectly helped the conservation of these structures. The integration of princely states into Union Territories after independence and the stoppage of privy purse by the government in 1971, made it extremely difficult for royal families and their inheritants to maintain these palaces abuzz with art works, valuable paintings, artefacts, furniture, valuable furnishings and fixtures. Moreover, the structure itself, were architectural marvels in sandstone, marble and granite. This led to conversion of these units into heritage hotels. While, these structures became self-sustaining units, they also provided employment opportunities to the local people, who otherwise have no major bread earning avenues around them, except farming.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe homes of the bygone era be it old forts, castles, palaces and havelis have not only preserved the interest for the younger generations in our culture, but have also rekindled the idea of Indian hospitality which sets these units apart from their metropolis counterparts. The establishment of these into revenue generators was not an easy task and due credit must be given to the owners who had the vision to utilise their respective properties and create a USP where many viewed them as one of the many such available properties,\u201d said Raghavendra Rathore, a renowned fashion designer, who owns Ajit Bhavan Palace and Rawla Narlai, two sought-after heritage hotels in Rajasthan. \u201cClearly, in the far distant future what will stand apart is the charm of the old-world style of design over the ghastly cement jungle structures that resemble any other part of the world,\u201d he asserted.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the challenges of converting these heritage structure into hotels, Aditi Balbir, Founder & Managing Director, V Resorts - Fort Auwa which runs Fort Auwa in Jodhpur said, \u201cBeing century-old structures, the maintenance of these properties becomes quite difficult. One has to take a lot of care, so that in the process of maintaining, the property doesn\u2019t lose its original charm. Since, they are such old structures, getting modern facilities embedded in these properties also becomes tough.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to sustain the beauty of havelis, forts and palaces unless they are converted into useful self sustaining entities, remarked Sikka. It also helps in strengthening the rich culture and history of the country. \u201cThese havelis, forts and palaces are generally located at places where there are not many employment opportunities for local citizens. These heritage hotels increase the opportunities and act as a source of income for these local citizens,\u201d informed Sikka.\n\n\n\nStaying Relevant\n\nWhile, the luxury hospitality in Rajasthan was the monopoly of heritage hotels for a very long time, the advent of modern hospitality units across the state has changed the business scenario for heritage properties. Yes, of course, these classic properties have their relevance and a niche clientele who look nowhere else but palatial royal experiences.\n\n\n\nIn the modern era, the owners of these hotels have been able to promote and sell their spaces to special occasions like hi-end weddings, etc. Spelling out the advantages, heritage hotels have over modern hotels, Arora said, \u201cAs a heritage hotel, we have a number of advantages that most modern hotels do not have. The biggest advantage that we have is \u201cheritage\u201d and that is what we need to highlight the most. A heritage hotel provides guests an opportunity to witness the history and culture and experience the royal ambience, which a modern hotel can never provide. It is that royal experience and service that is the biggest differentiator for heritage hotels. At Ranbanka Palace, we have introduced the Jodhana Service for our Suite and Club guests. This is an extension of the service provided to the guests of the royal family, thereby recreating the regal charm.\u201d\n\n\n\nHeritage and modern hotels have their \u201cdistinct space\u201d, felt K P Singh, Director - Sales & Marketing, Samode Hotels. \u201cWhile on one hand both Indian and foreign tourists are seeking modern, sleek hotels and international brands they are familiar with, on the other hand luxury and boutique heritage hotels offer a more personalised and local experience that cannot be found elsewhere. With reference to market share - there are many heritage hotel players in the market now who are attracting domestic guests with affordable pricing to retain their market share,\u201d Singh observed. In order to stay relevant, these hotels have to employ \u201cexperiential marketing\u201d, admits Singh. This has helped Samode Bagh and Samode Palace to become most-sought after \u201coffbeat venues\u201d for hi-end weddings, he informed.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cproduct appeal\u201d is something that keep heritage hotels in good stead, believed Jain. But, they need to translate this into actual occupancies and ARRs, he admitted. \u201cThe challenge is to not just sit comfortably with the heritage tag, but to go the extra mile on creating the complete package by creating experiences, through service/cuisine, personalised services and more. Once that is done, clearly the media has a big role to play in promoting these properties and the concept overall. The other challenge clearly is to reach out to potential customers in a cost effective manner,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nBeing stand-alone or part of small groups, heritage hotels by and large lack the distribution strength the large modern chain of hotels possesses. But, they are no more lagging behind when it comes to leveraging various technology tools and communication networks and social media sites to be in the race and stay relevant. \u201cSocial media is playing an important role in today\u2019s tech savvy world. Being active on social media increases the brand\u2019s familiarity. Also, Internet is the most commonly used medium for searching hotels especially for inbound tourists which can act as an important tool for marketing. Also, the stand-alone heritage hotels can tie up with existing heritage hotel brands for their marketing and distribution because these heritage properties are generally located at quaint places which are not easy to market and it is difficult to reach the target audience,\u201d said Sikka. Synonymous with its culture and heritage, Rajasthan is wrapped immaculately in its forts and palaces. These crafty edifices built by the Maharajas of yesteryear are abound with folklores and stories of valour, war expeditions, conquests and more that continue to inspire the locales and visitors alike. In order to preserve the historical wealth, many of them have been converted into heritage hotels by their inheritants over a period of time. To stay in one of these hotels is an overwhelming experience which fills the guests with a sense of royalty. The glory of palace hotels like Rambagh Palace, Jai Mahal Palace, Ajit Bhawan, Samode Palace, Shiv Niwas and Fateh Prakash, Ranbanka Palace and other innumerable heritage hotels have reached beyond the boundaries of India and won many global accolades for their royal hospitality.As a travel destination, it is the culture, heritage, and the life of the people built around it, including the colourful festivals, that are the key highlights of Rajasthan. This painted picture has helped Rajasthan gain a pre-eminent position in the tourism map of the country through the decades.
