(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nDeere & Co. and the United Auto Workers have started negotiations on a new master labor agreement that covers about 10,000 manufacturing workers at 12 facilities, including plants in five Iowa cities.\n\nThe Moline, Ill.,-based farm and construction equipment manufacturer said Tuesday the current six-year master agreement expires at midnight Sept. 30.\n\nIn Iowa, the contract covers factory workers at the Davenport Works, Des Moines Works, Dubuque Works, Ottumwa Works and Waterloo Works, as well as three other plants in Waterloo \u2014 its tractor and cab assembly, engine works and foundry. The Illinois plants include the Harvester Works in East Moline.\n\nDeere said it has agreed with the UAW to make no further public comment during negotiations except through news releases distributed by the two organizations.\n\nThe negotiations begin as Deere has struggled with falling profits.\n\nOn Friday, Deere lowered its net income forecast for the year to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion to reflect soft agricultural spending and a weak energy sector that has curtailed equipment purchases. Agriculture and turf sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to drop 25 percent in 2015, with the biggest decline coming from higher-horsepower models.\n\nFor the third quarter, Deere posted a profit of $512 million, or $1.53 a share, down from $851 million, or $2.33 a share, a year earlier. Total revenue for the quarter ended July 31 declined 20 percent to $7.59 billion.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1EhFW3P", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Deere & Company and the UAW have started negotiations on a new master labor agreement.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Deere & Company and the UAW have started negotiations on a new master labor agreement.", "title": "Deere, UAW begin talks on contract covering 10,000 workers", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2015/08/25/deere-uaw-begin-talks-contract-covering-10k-workers/32322405/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Deere & Company and the UAW have started negotiations on a new master labor agreement.", "title": "Deere, UAW begin talks on contract covering 10,000 workers", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4f6dd2e187e9a11ca3ee8fb8bcd739e50c2937d8/c=69-412-2892-3235&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/13/DesMoines/B9318444952Z.1_20150813133504_000_G9BBK7EOS.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/United Auto Workers", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/United Auto Workers", "title": "Deere, UAW begin talks on contract covering 10,000 workers", "author": "Donnelle Eller", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/business", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6f7506052baa0e932c843701652db9d693852ef/c=422-412-2539-3235/local/-/media/2015/08/13/DesMoines/B9318444952Z.1_20150813133504_000_G9BBK7EOS.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9fd9c62acd87e83cd028d8be3c8238f53c9f1705/c=69-412-2892-3235/local/-/media/2015/08/13/DesMoines/B9318444952Z.1_20150813133504_000_G9BBK7EOS.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/11b5cd9c3baa3ba6b6be82e862c1aefed068ee1a/c=0-711-2960-2937/local/-/media/2015/08/13/DesMoines/B9318444952Z.1_20150813133504_000_G9BBK7EOS.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d9b7141bcf9ce292651f67e0fd7bd5347ebe7af/c=0-987-2960-2659&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/13/DesMoines/B9318444952Z.1_20150813133504_000_G9BBK7EOS.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-25T10:47:30.960000-05:00", "shorthed": "Deere, UAW begin labor talks amid falling profits", "articleid": 32322405, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0d1ce2dc6fd3396f18f3ba16f692b4ac9b8cfe07/c=0-987-2960-2659/local/-/media/2015/08/13/DesMoines/B9318444952Z.1_20150813133504_000_G9BBK7EOS.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ddcbacb1490396e0764dc2b3d3c6aa22aa53b469/c=690-412-2271-3235/local/-/media/2015/08/13/DesMoines/B9318444952Z.1_20150813133504_000_G9BBK7EOS.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Deere & Co.'s Des Moines Works factory in Ankeny.\nIn Iowa, the contract covers factory workers at the Davenport Works, Des Moines Works, Dubuque Works, Ottumwa Works and Waterloo Works, as well as three other plants in Waterloo \u2014 its tractor and cab assembly, engine works and foundry.\nFor the third quarter, Deere posted a profit of $512 million, or $1.53 a share, down from $851 million, or $2.33 a share, a year earlier.\nDeere said it has agreed with the UAW to make no further public comment during negotiations except through news releases distributed by the two organizations.\n(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy PhotoDeere & Co. and the United Auto Workers have started negotiations on a new master labor agreement that covers about 10,000 manufacturing workers at 12 facilities, including plants in five Iowa cities."}
