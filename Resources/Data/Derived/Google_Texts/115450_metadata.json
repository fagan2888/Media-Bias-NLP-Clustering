There, 1.3 million Texans have enrolled, including nearly 383,000 people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nBerndt of AARP, which represents 2.3 million aging Texans, told the Senate Business and Commerce Committee that his group wants a tougher law.\n\nIt will try to pass one in next year\u2019s session, he said.\n\nAARP is working toward that goal with patient groups such as the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, American Cancer Society-Cancer Action Network and American Heart Association, as well as the center-left think tank the Center for Public Policy Priorities, he said.\n\nIn March, Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed and GOP Gov. Rick Scott signed a law that banned balance bills for emergency room visits, whether at a hospital or a freestanding one, Berndt noted.\n\nIn Texas, there are about 220 freestanding emergency clinics. One reason for their rapid proliferation, he said, is they can resist joining insurers\u2019 networks and then hit unsuspecting patients with big bills.\n\n\u201cTexas has kind of left the consumer holding the bag \u2026 because if you don\u2019t understand what a balance bill is, you\u2019re probably going to pay it,\u201d Berndt said.\n\nAARP favors an approach taken by Florida that lets insurers and providers battle it out in \u201cdispute resolution\u201d as to what\u2019s a fair price for an out-of-network treatment or service. Eight other states have passed something similar. (See p. 5 of Berndt\u2019s testimony for the list.)\n\nSince 2009, Texas has had a mediation process. But the patient has to trigger it. Mediation only covers six types of doctors who practice in hospitals. It doesn\u2019t apply to out-of-network facilities, whether hospitals or freestanding ERs.\n\nTop health insurer lobbyist Jamie Dudensing, who heads the Texas Association of Health Plans, said it could live with a ban on surprise bills for emergency care.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t oppose it. We support getting the consumer out of it,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nBeaumont anesthesiologist Ray Callas, representing the Texas Medical Assciation, told senators the state\u2019s main doctor\u2019s group favors expanding mediation for surprise bills from all hospital-based doctors and care provided at freestanding ERs.\n\nFlorida\u2019s state medical society supported the recently passed ban there, though subspecialty groups of radiologists and anesthesiologists fought it unsuccessfully.\n\nFor several years, we\u2019ve reported her on how a top insurance regulator named by former Gov. Rick Perry rescinded rules that would have helped consumers avoid the pitfall of big bills for out-of-network care.\n\nThe rules were meant to give more than 4 million Texans covered by preferred provider organization health plans, or PPOs, more information about whether they\u2019d pay the higher out-of-network costs if they were hospitalized and seen by a specialist.\n\nThough the Department of Insurance eventually put into effect a weaker version, a 2014 report by the Center for Public Policy Priorities found many gaps remained in the state\u2019s protection of consumers. As I reported here, the adequacy of many carriers\u2019 networks of providers remained suspect.\n\nFor instance, 56 percent of Texas hospitals that contracted with Humana had no in-network emergency room physicians, the center\u2019s report said.\n\nLast year, the Legislature passed a bill to expand mediation on surprise medical bills. The law lowered to $500, from $1,000, the size of a bill that triggers patients\u2019 ability to enlist the Texas Department of Insurance\u2019s help.\n\nIn such instances, the department sets up a phone call between the patient, his insurer and the doctor\u2019s practice group to negotiate a lower amount. If the call yields no agreement, the state\u2019s chief administrative law judge must name an impartial mediator to try to resolve the impasse. The insurer and doctor bear the costs. If that fails, which is rare, the case can go to an administrative law judge.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wNS90ZXhhcy1zaG91bGQtZG8tbW9yZS10by1kaXNjb3VyYWdlLXN1cnByaXNlLW1lZGljYWwtYmlsbHMtY29uc3VtZXItZ3JvdXBzLXNheS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert T.
