The metro area will be sunny and warm on Sunday, but breezes will kick up for the beginning of the work week with winds gusting on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

“The main thing is going to be some wind,” said Kyle Frieden, NWS meteorologist, on Sunday. “Today will be pretty nice, with highs in the low to mid-60s, but it will be a bit windier for Monday and Tuesday.”

The mercury should stay in the 60s on Monday with a high temperature of 64 degrees and wind gusts of up to 29 mph in the afternoon.

Tuesday will be mostly sunny, with a high near 50. The wind, which could gust as high as 35 mph on Tuesday will calm down on Wednesday and Thursday.

Wednesday will be mostly sunny with a high near 48 degrees and Thursday will bring a slight chance of precipitation, Frieden said.

“The next best chance for snow will be Thursday into Friday,” Frieden said.

The NWS has posted a hazardous weather outlook for northeast and north central Colorado and predict snow will move across the mountains on Monday and Monday night.

Snow is expected to fall above timberline. By Friday morning, up to 10 inches is possible with about one foot of snow in some areas.
