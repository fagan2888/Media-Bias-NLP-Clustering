BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) — Central African Republic’s Seleka rebels, who once overthrew the government, say they’re entitled to a $5 million award from the U.S. because they handed over a wanted international war crimes suspect to American troops.

Dominic Ongwen, a commander with the Ugandan rebel group Lord’s Resistance Army, is now being held by the International Criminal Court and is expected to be flown later Monday to The Hague for trial on war crimes charges.

The Seleka rebels say they captured Ongwen and then handed him over to the American forces in Central African Republic who are assisting the hunt for the top LRA commander Joseph Kony, who remains at large.

Ongwen identified himself as “Moussa” and only later did the rebels learn they had handed over an international war crimes suspect with a reward on his head, said Mounir Ahamat, a Seleka officer in the Sam-Ouandja area.

“We continue to ask the Americans for the money promised,” he said Monday. “The soldiers based at Obo promised to meet with us on Tuesday to pursue discussions.”
