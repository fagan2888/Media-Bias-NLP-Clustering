On Monday, the Michigan Board of Canvassers unanimously approved the signatures from the “NO Taxes for Abortion Insurance” petition drive. The Election Division of the Secretary of State concluded its review of the more than 316,000 signatures and found the validity rate to be nearly 95 percent.

Registered voters from every county in Michigan signed petitions to initiate the Abortion Insurance Opt-Out Act. This legislation will keep tax dollars and health insurance premiums from paying for abortion as part of standard health insurance offered in Michigan.

The Michigan Constitution allows the people to initiate legislation through a petition. With the Michigan Board of Canvassers verifying the signatures, the Abortion Insurance Opt-Out Act will now be in the hands of Michigan representatives and Michigan senators. Because the legislation was initiated by the citizens, it does not need a signature from the governor to become law. Only a simple majority vote is required in the Michigan House and Senate. Right to Life of Michigan is advocating for a vote to be taken as early as possible.

Right to Life of Michigan President Barbara Listing said, “We are thankful for the people of Michigan who participated in the NO Taxes for Abortion Insurance petition drive to allow our elected officials the opportunity to vote on the Abortion Insurance Opt-Out Act again.”

Support for this policy is clear in Lansing. It is the same legislation which passed the House and Senate less than a year ago, but was vetoed by Governor Rick Snyder.

Listing said, “Michigan citizens do not want to pay for someone else’s abortion with their tax dollars or health insurance premiums. Abortion is not health care; abortion kills a living, developing human being.”
