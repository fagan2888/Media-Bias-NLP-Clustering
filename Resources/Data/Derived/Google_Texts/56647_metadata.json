The screenings often result in costlier follow-up tests. Matthew Mientka\n\nConsumer watchdog Public Citizen accused 20 hospitals and health systems across the United States of \u201cfear mongering\u201d to upsell patients on expensive medical tests. Public Citizen says low-cost health screenings advertised by hospitals often lead to more expensive \u2014 and even riskier \u2014 exams in a classic bait-and-switch. Health screenings beneficial for some patients should not be marketed as necessary testing to the general public, the group said in a press statement. Specifically, the group requested that hospitals end sponsorships with HealthFair, a provider of medical screenings conducted in vans specially outfitted as mobile clinics.\n\n\u201cHealthFair [based in Winter Park, Fla.] and most of its hospital and medical institution partners \u2014 peddles inexpensive cardiovascular disease screening packages to people living near the hospitals and institutions without identifying who has relevant risk factors that would make each of the screening tests medically appropriate,\u201d Public Citizen said in a press statement. \u201cThe screening tests are performed in buses, often bearing the names and logos of both the partner hospital or medical institution and HealthFair. The buses roam the surrounding geographic areas of the partner hospitals and medical institutions.\u201d\n\nMost egregiously, the group says, HealthFair bundles four cardiovascular tests into a $179 package \u201cvalued at $2,300.\u201d Consumers whose tests suggest heart problems might then receive follow-up tests costing much, much more, according to Michael Carome, who directs Public Citizen\u2019s health research.\n\n\"That $179 may seem like a bargain, but zero dollars would be the real bargain,\" Carome told USA Today. \"You don't need to spend any money on these tests unless you fit into a very narrow population, and no one needs to be screened with six at once.\"\n\nHealthFair declined to comment to media on Public Citizen\u2019s letter, but the merits of the health screenings were defended by Nanette Bentley, a spokeswoman for sponsor Mercy Health in Cincinnati. \"Health screenings can be a lifesaving tool,\" she said in a statement. \"Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the American Heart Association. Our implementation of these screenings is consistent with our values of compassion and human dignity while expanding access to care in the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nBentley said the hospital\u2019s local hospital workers were \u201cclosely involved in managing patient care.\u201d\n\nYet experts such as Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, remain critical of hospital marketing tactics intended to bring such health screenings to the mass market. \u201cI have seen people in my own practice who have been unnecessarily harmed\u201d by unnecessary tests,\u201d he told USA Today. Patients who receive unnecessary CT scans, for example, are exposed to radiation that might possibly harm them, he said.\u201cThis is a serious problem.\u201d\n\nTellingly, a business strategy group in the industry recommends \"Nine Dos and Don'ts\" of marketing for services delivered in busses and vans. The first rule of mobile health marketing? \"Your goal is to make connections and increase awareness, NOT to make immediate sales.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "healthfair and public citizen, hospital marketing, hospital marketing practices deceptive, hospitals sponsor mobile health screenings, mobile health screenings unnecessary", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Watchdog group Public Citizen on Thursday urged hospitals across the United States to stop sponsoring mobile health screenings they say use \"fear mongering\" to upsell patients on costlier follow-up tests that might even present additional risk.", "title": "Hospital Marketing Criticized By Consumer Watchdogs As \u2018Fear Mongering\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/public-citizen-criticizes-hospitals-fear-mongering-market-expensive-medical-testing-289048", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/public-citizen-urges-end-hospital-sponsored-mobile-health-screenings.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watchdog group Public Citizen on Thursday urged hospitals across the United States to stop sponsoring mobile health screenings they say use \"fear mongering\" to upsell patients on costlier follow-up tests that might even present additional risk.", "title": "Hospital Marketing Criticized By Consumer Watchdogs As \u2018Fear Mongering\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/public-citizen-criticizes-hospitals-fear-mongering-market-expensive-medical-testing-289048", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/public-citizen-urges-end-hospital-sponsored-mobile-health-screenings.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/public-citizen-urges-end-hospital-sponsored-mobile-health-screenings.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-19T16:54:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T17:35:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Watchdog group Public Citizen on Thursday urged hospitals across the United States to stop sponsoring mobile health screenings they say use \"fear mongering\" to upsell patients on costlier follow-up tests that might even present additional risk."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf30\"", "article_summary": "Matthew MientkaConsumer watchdog Public Citizen accused 20 hospitals and health systems across the United States of \u201cfear mongering\u201d to upsell patients on expensive medical tests.\nWatchdog group Public Citizen accused hospitals Thursday of unfair marketing practices advertising low prices for health screenings most might not need.\nPublic Citizen says low-cost health screenings advertised by hospitals often lead to more expensive \u2014 and even riskier \u2014 exams in a classic bait-and-switch.\nSpecifically, the group requested that hospitals end sponsorships with HealthFair, a provider of medical screenings conducted in vans specially outfitted as mobile clinics.\nHealth screenings beneficial for some patients should not be marketed as necessary testing to the general public, the group said in a press statement."}
