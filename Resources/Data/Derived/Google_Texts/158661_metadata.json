That remains to be seen.\n\nThough local advocates have been pushing back against the standardized tests and the nationwide Common Core curriculum for the past few years, a report last month by the Council of Great City Schools may have helped give the moment even more attention. In the two-year study of 66 of the country\u2019s largest school districts, it was determined that between pre-K and 12th grade, the average American public school student takes 112.3 standardized tests, which averages out to around eight tests per year. In the eighth grade, not including test preparation and sample tests, student testing takes up 4.2 days of school, or around 2.3 percent of the entire school year.\n\nIn conjunction with the release of the Council of Great City Schools study, the U.S. Department of Education acknowledged its own complicity in the prevalence of standardized tests, and released an action plan which seeks to give students \u201cfewer and smarter\u201d assessments.\n\nOn the official White House Facebook page, President Barack Obama recalled his own education in public schools.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on the great teachers who shaped my life, what I remember isn\u2019t the way they prepared me to take a standardized test,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I remember is the way they taught me to believe in myself, to be curious about the world, to take charge of my own learning so that I could reach my full potential, to inspire me \u2026 Learning is about so much more than filling the right bubble.\u201d\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said he agreed with the federal perspective, saying there was a need to \u201creverse the overemphasis on testing that has become the norm in too many of our schools.\u201d\n\nBut locally there\u2019s some skepticism that any change is around the corner. Jolyn Safron, a co-founder of local education advocacy group Kingston Action for Education (KAFE), said the timing of the announcement was suspect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with my totally cynical perspective, and it\u2019s that elections are coming up, and everyone is realizing that Common Core is a sinking ship, and they want to abandon the ship and try and figure out how to start saving face,\u201d said Safron. \u201cI want to be hopeful that there is some validity and genuineness behind them, but I feel that they\u2019re just political gains. And time will tell, particularly in Gov. Cuomo\u2019s case. We are in the state we are because of Gov. Cuomo with regards to the testing and the immense tie-in with the teacher appraisal system to this testing. And now for him to start saying, \u2018We were wrong\u2019 \u2014 well, yeah, we\u2019ve been telling you that for a long time.\u201d\n\nKingston City School District Superintendent Paul Padalino also questioned Cuomo\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure which side of the argument the governor is falling on sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe APPR [Annual Professional Performance Review] legislation with 50 percent of teachers\u2019 evaluations being used through the state assessments, that\u2019s his legislation. To then turn around and say standardized testing is out of control, those two things don\u2019t make sense together.\u201d\n\nIn addition to how the standardized tests are impacting students, opponents have also expressed concern about the influence standardized test results have on a teacher\u2019s APPR. As Padalino noted, Cuomo\u2019s office enacted a standard of 50 percent; in Kingston, the percentage is currently 20 percent while local teachers\u2019 unions continue contract negotiations with the district.\n\n\u201cIs 50 percent too much? I\u2019d say yes, 50 percent is too much,\u201d said Padalino. \u201cIs 20 percent too much? I don\u2019t think it is. 80 percent of a teacher\u2019s evaluation is based on what they do every day in the classroom, on observations from a building principal or building administrator. 20 percent, I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\nPadalino added that he believed the president\u2019s perspective had been taken out of context.\n\n\u201cI think what the president was talking about was rote drill of test questions, and it was very skillfully, politically stated,\u201d Padalino said, noting that students in public school districts like Kingston already spend fewer than two percent of their academic year taking standardized tests. \u201cCurrently in New York, we\u2019re spending about 1 percent of the school year on testing. That\u2019s not test prep, the actual testing of students. [In Kingston] none of our curriculum pacing involves test prep. Every day of school is preparation for meeting the standards, for meeting proficiency. Ninety-nine percent of our time is preparing our students to be assessed to see if they meet the standards, and one percent is spent assessing them.\u201d\n\nSafron said that public school students in the state are still over-tested.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Kingston Times", "description": "With the controversy over standardized testing in public schools still at a rolling boil, some national and state politicians are publicly calling for a reduction in the amount of time devoted to t\u2026", "title": "Obama, Cuomo diss standardized tests, but what does it mean for Kingston?", "url": "http://www.kingstonx.com/2015/11/07/obama-cuomo-diss-standardized-tests-but-what-does-it-mean-for-kingston/", "image": {"width": 290, "identifier": "http://www.kingstonx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ktx-sq-K103-padalino.jpg", "height": 290}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-07T13:16:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-06T18:57:00+00:00"}}, "article_summary": "In the two-year study of 66 of the country\u2019s largest school districts, it was determined that between pre-K and 12th grade, the average American public school student takes 112.3 standardized tests, which averages out to around eight tests per year.\nBut what will that mean for local students in the Kingston City School District?\n\u201cWhen I look back on the great teachers who shaped my life, what I remember isn\u2019t the way they prepared me to take a standardized test,\u201d he said.\nThough local advocates have been pushing back against the standardized tests and the nationwide Common Core curriculum for the past few years, a report last month by the Council of Great City Schools may have helped give the moment even more attention.\nTo then turn around and say standardized testing is out of control, those two things don\u2019t make sense together.\u201dIn addition to how the standardized tests are impacting students, opponents have also expressed concern about the influence standardized test results have on a teacher\u2019s APPR."}
