It also appears to have some major privacy issues in at least one state that\u2019s participating in the exchange.\n\nConservatives\u2019 favorite phrase to describe the Affordable Care Act is \u201cnot ready for prime time,\u201d and the problems many are having just getting on the HealthCare.gov website show why.\n\nThe Weekly Standard\u2019s Jeryl Bier decided to give it a try and actually had the patience to subject himself to the mind-numbing, interminable process. He eventually reached a point where he was required to check a box to indicate he\u2019d read, understood and agreed to the site\u2019s privacy policy.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen these requirements before. Each time we update our software, pay our American Express bill or buy something on iTunes, we have to check a box. No one actually reads the terms and conditions \u2014 they go on forever. We just check the box and go on with our business. Bier actually took the time to read them, and after what he found, maybe I\u2019ll start doing the same.\n\nAfter listing terms one might expect, the policy said, \u201cwe may share information provided in your application with the appropriate authorities for law enforcement and audit activities.\u201d\n\nBecause the site doesn\u2019t define exactly what constitutes \u201cappropriate authorities,\u201d someone may be inclined to shoot an email off for clarification \u2014 then again, maybe not.\n\nThe site\u2019s policy on email communications stipulates:\n\nIf you send us an e-mail, we use the information you send us to respond to your inquiry. E-mail correspondence may become a public record. As a public record, your correspondence could be disclosed to other parties upon their request in accordance with Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act.\n\nAs The Weekly Standard reported, such emails \u201ccould conceivably involve private matters regarding finances, health history, and other sensitive issues.\u201d Do we really want them to become a part of the \u201cpublic record\u201d and presumably available to anyone via a Freedom Of Information Act request?\n\nBier encountered the policy while on Maryland\u2019s health insurance exchange, Maryland\u2019s Health Connection. In a previous post, Bier said the exchange gave him a \u201cno doctors are found\u201d message, with this explanation:\n\nSearch for your physician. If you are interested in understanding which health plans a particular doctor participates in, please visit https://providersearch.crisphealth.org \u2013 a new service sponsored by Maryland Health Connection. For the time being, doctors and other providers are not yet available in Maryland Health Connection; therefore, if you choose to search for them on the website, you will receive a message that \u201cno doctors are found\u201d message.\n\nMaryland is considered something of a poster child for Obamacare \u2014 it planned early, developed and tested its online exchange software over the summer and gave it a clean bill of health. The state also trained over 5,000 \u201cnavigators,\u201d according to RedState.\n\nYet through it all, Bier reported that as of noon, Oct. 7, the state had signed up only 326 people.\n\nIf that\u2019s Maryland\u2019s record, what chance do the rest of us have?\n\n[poll id=\u201d123\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "It turns out the Affordable Care Act has larger issues facing it than just navigating through the site.
