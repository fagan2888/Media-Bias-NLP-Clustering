When a Bald Eagle is flying the last thing you'd expect is another bird using the eagle as a landing strip. Well that has happened and photos were taken to prove it.

These photographs were captured by the California-based Phoo Chan. Chan said that crows are known to be aggressive when flying in and around their territories, but the crow here did not harass the eagle or seem to care the eagle was there.

The crow actually landed on the eagles back for a moment while in mid-flight and used the eagle like a plane. The eagle did not seem to even notice or care.

Incredible images, ones of which I never thought I would see are all shown below. Enjoy!
