Even when the inspector general's staff monitored their actions openly, USDA inspectors still did not understand or carry out their humane slaughter mandate.\n\nRecords just obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Lewis and Clark Law School's animal legal clinic and my organization indicate that little to nothing has been done over the past year to improve the situation.\n\nOf the 10 USDA districts charged with enforcing the law, the Des Moines district has both the worst record and the plant with the most violations. There were two plants with similarly dismal humane slaughter records, but the other one was shut down by the Jackson, Miss., USDA district office. Des Moines' office should do the same with its worst plant, Triple J Family Farms in Buffalo Lake, Minn.\n\nA report on the plant from the Des Moines office was gruesome: The plant manager shot a cow through the head and then tormented the animal for more than 10 more minutes. Instead of even trying to put the animal down, as he was legally obligated to do, the plant manager electrocuted the cow with an electric prod, over and over, trying to get her to leave the stunning box, where two cows were trapped in a space intended to hold one.\n\nThe USDA inspector who filed the report noted that because the gate to the stun box was halfway down, the cow's escape was a \"physical impossibility.\" But that didn't stop the plant manager from trying. The cow's screaming brought two USDA inspectors and the plant's \"slaughter QA supervisor\" to the scene. But their presence did not deter the plant manager from continuing to electrocute this poor cow.\n\nBecause the electrocution was so painful, the cow tried to cram her body through the gate. The report indicates that due to her attempting the impossible, her \"hide [was] peeled back ... and there was blood and hair throughout the wound, as well as blood and hair on the lift gate.\"\n\nThe report goes on, but I'll spare you the (literally) bloody details.\n\nOver the next eight months, this plant was cited 13 more times for violations of federal law, including seven \"noncompliance reports\" that should have resulted in suspensions, according to USDA's own policy requirements.\n\nIndeed, one of the problems explicitly identified by the inspector general a year ago was precisely this \u2014 that inspectors were far too lenient and were violating USDA's official policy both by neglecting to cite lawbreaking plants at all, and by neglecting to suspend plants for egregious abuse.\n\nAs just one example from our FOIA response, a USDA report documents a terrified cow who was shot through the head and remained completely conscious, bellowing and foaming at the mouth. Blood streamed from what the USDA veterinarian called a \"penetrating wound.\" It took the plant more than two minutes before this suffering animal was finally put down.\n\nThe Des Moines USDA office knows this should have resulted in a suspension. They suspended the plant three other times over six months for almost identical violations.\n\nEvery one of these 14 administrative actions was a federal crime, punishable by up to a year in jail and up to $1,000 in fines. But the USDA appears never to have referred a USDA-inspected slaughterhouse for criminal violation of the Humane Slaughter Act, no matter how severe the illegal activity.\n\nMy organization is calling on USDA to refer egregious cruelty to federal prosecutors, as the agency is statutorily empowered to do, and also to withdraw federal grants of inspection from repeat violators. The USDA should start with this specific plant, and unless it does, the agency should not be believed when it claims to take its humane slaughter mandate seriously.\n\nAnimals are suffering horrible abuse in our nation's slaughterhouses, USDA is charged with stopping it, and it is past time the agency took these basic steps to do so.\n\nTHE AUTHOR:\n\nBRUCE FRIEDRICH is director of policy and advocacy for Farm Sanctuary, a national farm animal protection organization based in Watkins Glen, N.Y.
