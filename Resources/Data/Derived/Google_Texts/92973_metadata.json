Dr. Matthew Dunn, a dentist in Phoenix, holds a letter from Humana canceling the policy for him, his wife and their 13 employees. - Valeria Fernandez\n\nJust like people with individual health insurance polices, small businesses are grappling with unexpected changes to their policies and premiums because of the standards set by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn Arizona, Drs. Courtney and Matthew Dunn own DunnOrthodontics in central Phoenix. It\u2019s a small but profitable practice, which they\u2019ve had for about seven years. They don\u2019t have to offer health insurance, but Matthew Dunn says, they choose to.\n\n\"We\u2019ve always offered health insurance. It was easy in the beginning because we only had one employee, now we have 13 full-time employees.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Dunns received a letter from their health insurer, Humana. It was labeled, \"Important information regarding your coverage.\" It informed them that they would not be able to continue with their current medical plan in 2014, as it did not meet all of the ACA requirements. The letter included information on a new Humana medical plan did comply with the ACA's standards, but it would raise the Dunns' premiums by 60 percent.\n\nCourtney Dunn says she was shocked.\n\n\"I got a text from Matt letting me know, and my heart just stopped.\"\n\nShe thought they had a good plan. Their employees have used their existing plan to cover surgeries, births and emergency room visits. Dunn says she'd figured they could keep their plan, hang onto it for a year and see how the Affordable Care Act played out before jumping into the marketplace.\n\nNow the Dunns have about six weeks to figure out what their plan lacks and what they want to do. In the meantime, they\u2019re meeting with their employees to explain the situation and get input.\n\nKaren Yant is Dunn Orthodontic's receptionist. She has a bad back. She wondered whether, if her employers no longer offered health insurance, employees would get extra money to pay for it themselves.\n\nCourtney Dunn told Yant that was one option they were talking about, but it's still early and they just don't know.\n\n\"We still need to weigh what's going to be the best for you guys and what's going to be fair.\"\n\nDunn says they're talking to their insurance broker and reaching out to other small businesses owners for advice.\n\n\"I wish I could just say, 'It\u2019s going to be OK. It\u2019s all going to work itself out,' but it\u2019s just the unknown at this point. We're still hoping that we can go on the marketplace and find something better, but this is the first time that I\u2019ve been really nervous.\"\n\nHer husband trying to be open about their situation since they still have limited information.\n\n\"I\u2019m trying not to over-react to it,\" he says. I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s best for us and our employees, but I just don\u2019t know right now.\"", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2013/11/07/health-care/now-small-businesses-are-receiving-health-insurance-cancellation-notices", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/Dunn%20letter.JPG?itok=XyMLyIQW", "type": "article", "description": "A dental practice in Phoenix learns it's losing its health-insurance policy for the two dentists and 13 employees.", "title": "Now small businesses are receiving health insurance cancellation notices"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "wAiODuSvzFxLFCK0x3nEeZRTBwZrKYf1HUXchvmhWZ81FgQbALS5Di/rtA+JQB53Oe7/2NaUuhNFE+6gC6nKEQ==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c21\"", "article_summary": "\"We still need to weigh what's going to be the best for you guys and what's going to be fair.\"\nShe wondered whether, if her employers no longer offered health insurance, employees would get extra money to pay for it themselves.\nSmall businesses are getting cancellation notices from their health insurers, saying current policies don't meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n- Valeria FernandezJust like people with individual health insurance polices, small businesses are grappling with unexpected changes to their policies and premiums because of the standards set by the Affordable Care Act.\n\"We\u2019ve always offered health insurance."}
