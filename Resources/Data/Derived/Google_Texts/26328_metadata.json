They were medical personnel not contracted with her insurance company.\n\nWhen her son arrived at Mercy San Juan Hospital in Carmichael, California, the people who checked him in accepted Gillen\u2019s Blue Shield insurance plan. But unbeknownst to her, that didn\u2019t mean everyone who treated her son was automatically covered.\n\nYou don\u2019t think about this. All you\u2019re worried about is if your kid is going to live. Susan Gillen, Blue Shield customer\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think about this,\u201d Gillen told Healthline. \u201cAll you\u2019re worried about is if your kid is going to live.\u201d\n\nMatthew would be fine. But after his injury in July 2014, Gillen found out there were plenty more headaches to come.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the whole thing is a mess and I see it as fraudulent,\u201d she said.\n\nRead More: Slammed with a Huge Bill for an Out-of-Network Doctor? \u00bb\n\nThe Doctor Is in but Is Also \u2018Out\u2019\n\nFirst, Gillen says the hospital demanded she pay $6,250 before they would treat her son.\n\n\u201cI told them to send me a bill,\u201d she said.\n\nThen, in January, she received a bill for $721 from Acute Care Surgery, an Ohio company.\n\n\u201cI had no idea what it was for,\u201d Gillen said. \u201cI assumed it was for my son\u2019s injury.\u201d\n\nAfter calling the company and prodding them for information, Gillen learned the bill was for the doctor who had treated Matthew in the emergency room.\n\nWhile Mercy San Juan was part of her insurance network, the attending doctor that day was not contracted with them, so the bill wasn\u2019t covered by her insurance or billed as emergency care.\n\nSusan Gillen\n\n\u201cHow could this be? I didn\u2019t pick my doctor. The hospital should only have doctors that accept the same insurance as they do,\u201d Gillen said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not my fault. Most people would have given up and paid it. I could just pay my bill, but I\u2019m mad.\u201d\n\nGillen fought it, along with a separate $1,400 bill that went to collections that she said she never received in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is a game, as far as I see it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe consumer is bullied into paying these amounts, whether they\u2019re correct or not, in fear of collections.\u201d\n\nMercy San Juan officials said in an email to Healthline, \u201cOur top priority is the care and safety of our patients. We respect the privacy of our patients and legally cannot discuss the specifics of their care. We believe this is an issue between the patient and the insurer.\u201d\n\nRead More: Some Hospitals Overcharging by as Much as 1,000 Percent \u00bb\n\nConsumer Advocate Groups Join the Fight\n\nGillen\u2019s case is not unique.\n\nSince the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), cases like hers are on the rise. The systemic problems with surprise hospital bills have gained the attention of groups like Consumers Union that want loopholes closed to prevent doctors, specialists, labs, and hospitals from pitting patients against their insurance companies when they\u2019ve played by the rules.\n\nIn California, Consumer Watchdog and others have sued Blue Shield in particular for misleading its customers about the breadth of coverage their new ACA plans offered.\n\nToday, California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care announced a settlement with Blue Shield on the matter. Not all of the consumer advocates are pleased, however. In a press release, Consumer Watchdog said the settlement \u201cdoes not ensure that Blue Shield customers are fully reimbursed for the costs they incurred as a result of the company\u2019s misrepresentations regarding its network of doctors and hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe state reached a similar settlement with Anthem Blue Cross.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t know is when you think you\u2019ve paid your bills and then, out of left field, you\u2019re hit with another one for hundreds of dollars that you shouldn\u2019t have been billed for in the first place. Liz Helms, California Chronic Care Coalition\n\nLiz Helms, president and CEO of the California Chronic Care Coalition (CCCC), has herself been socked with an unexpected bill for healthcare she had presumed was covered. She has become a patient rights advocate because she doesn\u2019t want anyone to have to go through the same thing.\n\nThe CCCC launched MyPatientRights.org in July, a site dedicated to helping people navigate this often exhausting and expensive process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very confusing to a lot of people. What you don\u2019t know is when you think you\u2019ve paid your bills and then, out of left field, you\u2019re hit with another one for hundreds of dollars that you shouldn\u2019t have been billed for in the first place,\u201d Helms told Healthline. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger problem than we realize. We don\u2019t know how many people this is happening to.\u201d\n\nRead More: You Survived Cancer, Now How Do You Pay Your Bills \u00bb\n\nA Third of Patients Report Receiving Surprise Bills\n\nAccording to a Consumer Reports survey, one-third of Americans report receiving a surprise medical bill within the past two years when their health insurance paid less than they expected.\n\nConsumers Union, the consumer advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, is pushing to change these practices at the state level.\n\nDeAnn Friedholm, director of health reform for Consumers Union, said avoiding these surprise bills can be tough enough when you can anticipate a doctor visit, but emergency situations make it even more difficult.\n\n\u201cFor years we have heard horror stories from consumers hit with surprise medical bills following routine and emergency procedures,\u201d she said in a press release. \u201cEven if you go to a hospital in your network, the unfortunate truth is that there is no guarantee that all your treatment \u2014 whether it\u2019s the radiologist, anesthesiologist, or lab work \u2014 will be treated as in-network, leaving patients owing thousands of dollars they never anticipated.\u201d\n\nGillen\u2019s story doesn\u2019t have a happy ending. After about 12 hours on the phone and months of haggling with the hospital and her insurance company, the system finally got to her.\n\n\u201cI gave in and paid, but at least I put up a fight,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter today\u2019s settlement, she might be able to seek reimbursement from Blue Shield. A lawsuit pending in a San Francisco Court will determine whether customers like Gillen are entitled to a refund for all of their out-of-pocket costs, or just a fraction.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/campaign-launched-to-fight-back-against-massive-surprise-out-of-network-medical-bills-110315", "news_keywords": "out of network, medical bills, unexpected medical bills, Consumer\u2019s Union, mypatientsrights, patient rights, surprise medical bills, huge hospital bills, protest hospital bill, out of pocket expenses", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "A third of patients report receiving surprise bills for treatment they believe would\u2019ve been covered by their health insurance plans.", "title": "Campaign Launched to Fight Back Against Massive, Surprise \u2018Out of Network\u2019 Medical Bills", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/campaign-launched-to-fight-back-against-massive-surprise-out-of-network-medical-bills-110315", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/110315_outofnetwork_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/110315_outofnetwork_THUMB.jpg", "description": "A third of patients report receiving surprise bills for treatment they believe would\u2019ve been covered by their health insurance plans.", "card": "summary", "title": "Campaign Launched to Fight Back Against Massive, Surprise \u2018Out of Network\u2019 Medical Bills"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-03", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A third of patients report receiving surprise bills for treatment they believe would\u2019ve been covered by their health insurance plans."}, "article_summary": "Susan Gillen, Blue Shield customer\u201cYou don\u2019t think about this,\u201d Gillen told Healthline.\nWhen her son arrived at Mercy San Juan Hospital in Carmichael, California, the people who checked him in accepted Gillen\u2019s Blue Shield insurance plan.\nAfter today\u2019s settlement, she might be able to seek reimbursement from Blue Shield.\nToday, California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care announced a settlement with Blue Shield on the matter.\nIn California, Consumer Watchdog and others have sued Blue Shield in particular for misleading its customers about the breadth of coverage their new ACA plans offered."}
