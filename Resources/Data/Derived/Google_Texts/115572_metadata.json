Bush speaks to employees in late July 2015.\n\nThe Big Conversation\n\nIn a weekend story, the Austin American-Statesman's J. David McSwane reported on a sizable reduction in force at the General Land Office under the tenure of George P. Bush, raising questions about the long-term effects caused by the agency's \"reboot.\"\n\nIn all, at least 111 GLO employees have left during Bush's time in office. McSwane reports that amounts to about 17 percent of the agency's workforce. Former Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson told the Statesman that the downsizing represents \u201ca purge of the best agency in Texas government and a purge of people who have done wonderful things.\u201d\n\nOne former employee told the Statesman that some of the terminations came as a surprise:\n\n\u201cThey were just brought in one day and told, \u2018OK you guys, you\u2019re gone,\u2019\u201d (former disaster recovery manager Dennis) Ku said. \u201cIt just seems to me like they\u2019re just getting rid of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe communication down through staff \u2014 none of that\u2019s happening. Nobody knows why.\u201d ... Ku said he\u2019s worried the agency will languish because \u201cthey\u2019ve gotten rid of the kind of institutional knowledge that\u2019s been there a long time.\u201d \u201cIf you look at who the leadership is at the GLO now, they\u2019re mostly under 40,\u201d Ku said. \u201cThey\u2019re more enamored with Twitter and that stuff than actually doing a good job of running the agency.\u201d At least 16 employees, including agency spokesman and Bush\u2019s speechwriter, Jim Suydam, left the agency last week, Eck said.\n\nDisclosure: The Texas General Land Office has been a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.
