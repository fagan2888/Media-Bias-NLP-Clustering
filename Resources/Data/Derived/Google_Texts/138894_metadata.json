They can treat a flu visit or small injury for a fraction of the cost of the ER.\n\n\"The advantage is the average cost is going to be $150 to $200, \" Mark Duffer of Doctor's Express said. That's far less than the $800 bill you can expect from an emergency room in most major hospitals.\n\nMake Sure Doctor is In-Network\n\nOne more thing to watch for in 2015: More out of network fees.\n\nConsumer Reports Magazine says while the hospital may be in your network, the doctor who stitches you up may not be.\n\nDitto for the anesthesiologist if you need minor surgery. Make sure if you are planning any surgery in advance that you check out the facility, doctor, and anesthesiologist to make sure all are in-network.\n\nObviously, you can't do that if you have just had an accident. But if it is not an absolute emergency, ask questions before you go in.\n\nAnd check with a great free online service called Healthcarebluebook.com, to see what that procedure should cost.\n\nThat way you don't waste your money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether you have company insurance, use the Affordable Health Care Exchange, or are on Medicare, look for higher doctor and hospital costs in 2015.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Fox17", "description": "Whether you have company insurance, use the Affordable Health Care Exchange, or are on Medicare, look for higher doctor and hospital costs in 2015. \u00a0 Beware the Emergency Room \u00a0 Today&#82\u2026", "title": "How to avoid higher doctor fees in 2015", "url": "http://fox17online.com/2015/01/09/how-to-avoid-higher-doctor-fees-in-2015/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://tribwxmi.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/promo245078428.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwxmi.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/promo245078428.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox17", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox17"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather, Traffic and Sports for Grand Rapids and West Michigan.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=593636323", "fb": {"pages": 307582000539}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox17online.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/288b65c5171c9f04de9e65215f6a4d7d?s=16", "application-name": "Fox17", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox17online", "published_time": "2015-01-09T13:29:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T13:29:38+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox17online"}, "keywords": "news,", "google-site-verification": "NSPbua0tLdVnRQbakGRZKFFd73lsjqW8d53L7t4RfUg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Make Sure Doctor is In-NetworkOne more thing to watch for in 2015: More out of network fees.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoWhether you have company insurance, use the Affordable Health Care Exchange, or are on Medicare, look for higher doctor and hospital costs in 2015.\nWhat Will Cost More in 2015The New York Times reports that for 2015, expect to see:Higher out of pocket costs.\nBut high out of pocket costs are now common with high deductible health plans, whether from your company or in an Obamacare exchange.\nConsumer Reports Magazine says while the hospital may be in your network, the doctor who stitches you up may not be."}
