Passed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it went into effect at the start of 2013. Measures in both the House and Senate to repeal the tax have had bipartisan support, and each chamber has several proposed bills to do just that.\n\nA sticking point for some pro-repeal Democrats is a so-called \u201cpay-for\u201d to cover the revenues that would be lost by killing the medtech tax.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been the position that the medical device tax should be paid for, in part because it sits alongside a broader set of gives for other industries,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told the website. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get the medical device tax by itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly care much more about the Cadillac tax than I care about the medical device tax,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all worried about how we support the Affordable Care Act and some of us are really worried about the giant tax extender package,\u201d added Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). \u201cSo yes, some of us are more worried about the fiscal result of repealing a bunch of taxes or extending tax breaks in terms of what we\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill said she supports a temporary delay of both taxes, but said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll go so far as a repeal.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are hoping to use the medical device tax as a chip to be trading in exchange for agreeing on the Cadillac tax.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a major Democrat ask, so there needs to be something proportionate in terms of achievement on our side,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told reporters this week, The Hill reported.\n\nThe Senate voted Dec. 3 to gut key provisions of the Affordable Care Act and do away with the medical device tax, but the measure faces certain death as soon as it hits President Barack Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nThe upper chamber voted 52-47 to pass the bill, with 2 Republicans crossing the aisle to join Democrats in voting against H.R. 3762, the \u201cRestoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\u201d The measure must still be reconciled with the original version passed by the U.S. House of Representatives before it can be sent to the White House for a veto.\n\nIn June, 46 Democrats joined the vote to approve H.R. 160, the \u201cProtect Medical Innovation Act of 2015; last month, the House passed the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which included the Protect Medical Innovation Act\u2019s provision to eliminate the levy.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s corresponding repeal bid, sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), is S. 149 or the \u201cMedical Device Access & Innovation Protection Act.\u201d The Hatch measure has 39 co-sponsors, including Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Ben Casey of Pennsylvania, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken.\n\nA pair of Democrat-led bills would also repeal the tax, but unlike the Hatch and Paulsen measures, those bills would replace the lost revenue by closing tax loopholes for the energy industry.\n\nA bill by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), S. 844 or the \u201cNo Taxation on Device Innovation Act,\u201d has no co-sponsors. Its counterpart in the House, H.R. 1533 or the \u201cMedical Device Tax Elimination Act\u201d sponsored by Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.), has 10 co-sponsors, all Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,3dcadforums.com,3dcadworld.com,analogictips.com,connectortips.com,couplingtips.com,datasheetpro.com,designworldonline.com,devicetalks.com,digitalsignalprocessingtips.com,edaboard.com,eeworldonline.com,electro-tech-online.com,engineeringexchange.com,engineeringwhitepapers.com,fluidpowerworld.com,fpgatips.com,hoseassemblytips.com,linearmotiontips.com,makepartsfast.com,massdevice.com,mcadcentral.com,mechatronictips.com,medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com,microcontrollertips.com,mobilehydraulictips.com,motioncontroltips.com,page.wtwhmedia.com,pneumatictips.com,powerelectronictips.com,sensortips.com,solarpowerworldonline.com,testandmeasurementtips.com,windpowerengineering.com,wireandcabletips.com", "og": {"site_name": "MassDevice", "description": "Democrats in the U.S. Senate this week said they\u2019re wary that a proposed delay of the medical device tax and another Obamacare tax would be the thin end of the wedge, opening up the Affordable Care Act to other industries looking to evade the healthcare law.
