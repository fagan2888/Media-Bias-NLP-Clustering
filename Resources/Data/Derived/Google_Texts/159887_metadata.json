This means returning unspent dollars to the Treasury and closing grants, collecting improperly spent dollars, and preventing more from going out the door.\u201d\n\nThen he made his still-unproven claim: \u201cOver $200 million of the original grant awards have already been returned to the Federal Government, and we\u2019re now in the process of collecting and returning more,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hearing was intended to examine the 17 state-based exchanges, and to see how they spent the $4.6 billion in federal grants that President Barack Obama\u2019s deputies had sent them. The committee was especially interested in details about the four failed state exchanges in Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon.\n\nOf the four, Oregon is the most notorious because it blew through a jaw-dropping $305 million on call centers, computer infrastructure and marketing before it was shut down without ever registering a single Oregon resident. It was so outrageous that liberals such as John Oliver took a shot at the Oregon trail of lost dollars.\n\nThe day after Slavitt\u2019s $200 million testimony, the establishment media trumpeted Slavitt\u2019s testimony as evidence that the Obama administration was judiciously dealing with waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nBut the congressmen and staffers were trying to track down what $200 million Slavitt was talking about. That day, Committee staffers emailed CMS staff asking for the details about $200 million.\n\nThe committee estimated that CMS clawed back $21.5 million at most from the state exchanges by withholding promised funds.\n\nThe $200 million claim came as a complete surprise because of the regular practice between congressional and administration staffers to pre-brief questions and testimony before an hearing. The decades-old practice makes for stilted hearings, but serves the purposes of both sides.\n\nNot this time \u2013 and the staff requested more information about the $200 million three times in December and four times in January, according to a report prepared by the committee\u2019s staff.\n\nThe Chairman of the Energy and Commerce\u2019s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Rep. Timothy F. Murphy (R.-Pa.) phone Slavitt and was told by Slavitt that agency staff was working quickly to produce the documentation.\n\nSlavitt sent nothing.\n\nMurphy again called Slavitt March 15 and the subcommittee chairman was told the CMS staff was still working on the numbers.\n\nDuring the whole routine, Slavitt\u2019s Chief of Staff Dr. Mandy Cohen and the CMS staffers continued to promise that the data was on its way.\n\nDepending on what happens at the committee\u2019s deadline, Capitol Hill conservatives are preparing to go after Slavitt\u2019s job. He holds that job job as a temporary \u201cacting\u201d appointee because even the Senate Republican leadership recoiled at confirming Slavitt, even after Obama gave Slavitt special ethics waiver. He got the waiver because he led Optum, the company that was the lead contractor who built healthcare.gov.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Committee Tries To Find $200 Million Hidden by Obama's Medicare Deputy", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "House Committee Tries To Find $200 Million Hidden by Obama's Medicare Deputy", "title": "House Committee Tries To Find $200 Million Hidden by Obama's Medicare Deputy - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_220352623601.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/25/house-ec-panel-demands-slavitt-explain-200-million/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Committee Tries To Find $200 Million Hidden by Obama's Medicare Deputy", "creator": "@neilwmccabe", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/AP_220352623601.jpg", "title": "House Committee Tries To Find $200 Million Hidden by Obama's Medicare Deputy - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Andy Slavitt, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Congress, healthcare.gov, House Energy and Commerce Committee, obamacare, Optum, President Barack Obama, Rep.
