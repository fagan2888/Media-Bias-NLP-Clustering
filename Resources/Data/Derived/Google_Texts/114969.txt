FLINT, MI -- A Mott Community College administrator was recently named president of a national group of her colleagues.

Amy Fugate, vice president of Academic Affairs at Mott Community College, has assumed the presidency of National Council of Instructional Administrators, which is an affiliate council for the American Association of Community Colleges.

Fugate was elected to an at-large position on the NCIA Board in 2009 and has previously served as secretary and vice president for the organization.

A Michigan native, Fugate came to Mott in 2006 as vice president of Academic Affairs after serving as dean of Humanities and Fine Arts at Kansas City Kansas Community College.

"I am honored to have been chosen by my fellow board members to serve as this year's president," said Fugate in a written statement. "NCIA is a valuable resource for community college administrators through its work sponsoring exemplary practices initiatives, providing research on community colleges, and developing mentoring program for new academic officers."

NCIA represents all community college academic leaders throughout the country, and promotes professional development and enhances the performance of instructional administrators, as well as serves as the national voice for the involvement of community college instructional administrators in policy planning and decision making, according to a press release.

Most recently, the organization was very active in analyzing the Affordable Care Act and identifying what its impact will be on adjunct faculty at community colleges nationwide, the press release stated.
