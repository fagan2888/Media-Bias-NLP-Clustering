Circuit would affect almost 5 million Americans without employer-provided health plans who are receiving tax credits to pay their premiums for health coverage under a federal exchange.\n\nWriting the court's majority opinion, Judge Thomas Griffith, an appointee of former President George W. Bush (R), argued that the law\u2019s insurance subsidies apply only to states that have created their own exchanges, thereby invalidating an IRS regulation permitting nationwide subsidies.\n\n\"This case is about Appellants\u2019 not-so-veiled attempt to gut the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\" Edwards wrote in his dissent Tuesday. \"This claim is nonsense, made up out of whole cloth. There is no credible evidence in the record that Congress intended to condition subsidies on whether a State, as opposed to HHS, established the Exchange.\"\n\nThis case is about Appellants\u2019 not-so-veiled attempt to gut the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d). The ACA requires every State to establish a health insurance \u201cExchange,\u201d which \u201cshall be a governmental agency or nonprofit entity that is established by a State.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18031(b)(1), (d)(1). The Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) is required to establish \u201csuch Exchange\u201d when the State elects not to create one. Id. \u00a7 18041(c)(1).\n\nTaxpayers who purchase insurance from an Exchange and whose income is between 100% and 400% of the poverty line are eligible for premium subsidies. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 36B(a),(c)(1)(A). Appellants challenge regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and HHS making these subsidies available in all States, including States in which HHS has established an Exchange on behalf of the State. In support of their challenge, Appellants rely on a specious argument that there is no \u201cExchange established by the State\u201d in States with HHS-created Exchanges and, therefore, that taxpayers who purchase insurance in these States cannot receive subsidies.\n\nAs explained below, there are three critical components to the ACA: nondiscrimination requirements applying to insurers; the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requiring individuals who are not covered by an employer to purchase minimum insurance coverage or to pay a tax penalty; and premium subsidies which ensure that the individual mandate will have a broad enough sweep to attract enough healthy individuals into the individual insurance markets to create stability.\n\nThese components work in tandem. At the time of the ACA\u2019s enactment, it was well understood that without the subsidies, the individual mandate was not viable as a mechanism for creating a stable insurance market.\n\nAppellants\u2019 proffered construction of the statute would permit States to exempt many people from the individual 2 mandate and thereby thwart a central element of the ACA. As Appellants\u2019 amici candidly acknowledge, if subsidies are unavailable to taxpayers in States with HHS-created Exchanges, \u201cthe structure of the ACA will crumble.\u201d Scott Pruitt, ObamaCare\u2019s Next Legal Challenge, WALL ST. J., Dec. 1, 2013. It is inconceivable that Congress intended to give States the power to cause the ACA to \u201ccrumble.\u201d\n\nAppellants contend that the phrase \u201cExchange established by the State\u201d in \u00a7 36B unambiguously bars subsidies to individuals who purchase insurance in States in which HHS created the Exchange on the State\u2019s behalf. This argument\n\nfails because \u201cthe words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644, 666 (2007) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). When the language of \u00a7 36B is viewed in context \u2013 i.e., in conjunction with other provisions of the ACA \u2013 it is quite clear that the statute does not reveal the plain meaning that Appellants would like to find.\n\nBecause IRS and HHS have been delegated authority to jointly administer the ACA, this case is governed by the familiar framework of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Under Chevron, if \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,\u201d we defer to the agency\u2019s construction of the statute, so long as it is \u201cpermissible.\u201d Id. at 843. The Government\u2019s permissible interpretation of the statute easily survives review under Chevron. The Act contemplates that an Exchange created by the federal government on a State\u2019s behalf will have equivalent legal standing with State-created Exchanges. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18041. And the ACA would be self-defeating if taxpayers who purchase insurance from an HHS-created Exchange are deemed ineligible to receive subsidies.\n\nAppellants\u2019 argument cannot be squared with the clear legislative scheme established by the statute as a whole.\n\nApparently recognizing the weakness of a claim that rests solely on \u00a7 36B, divorced from the rest of the ACA, Appellants attempt to fortify their position with the extraordinary argument that Congress tied the availability of subsidies to the existence of State-established Exchanges to encourage States to establish their own Exchanges. This claim is nonsense, made up out of whole cloth. There is no credible evidence in the record that Congress intended to condition subsidies on whether a State, as opposed to HHS, established the Exchange. Nor is there credible evidence that any State even considered the possibility that its taxpayers would be denied subsidies if the State opted to allow HHS to establish an Exchange on its behalf.\n\nThe majority opinion ignores the obvious ambiguity in the statute and claims to rest on plain meaning where there is none to be found. In so doing, the majority misapplies the applicable standard of review, refuses to give deference to the IRS\u2019s and HHS\u2019s permissible constructions of the ACA, and issues a judgment that portends disastrous consequences.
