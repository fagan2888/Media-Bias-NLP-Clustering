Once again, WHNT News 19 is Taking Action to help you get your 2016 taxes done.\n\nSeveral members from the Alabama Society of CPAs (ASCPA) were on hand during the three-hour event to answer your questions on Tuesday, February 9. Our team of licensed CPAs answered more than 200 phone calls and emails from viewers with tax questions.\n\nThe questions ranged from retirement income to dependent claims to inheritance tax. Christopher Taylor, Vice President of the Huntsville ASCPA, said he also continues to see challenges with the Affordable Health Care Act and its penalties for taxpayers who do not have minimum essential health care coverage.\n\n\u201cThe individual mandate penalty is still there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually increased from last year. It\u2019s up to $325 per person, or it\u2019s up to two percent of their household income, whichever is greater.\u201d\n\nThe event is all about maximizing your tax returns, too, so our volunteers helped callers find key deductions.\n\n\u201cThe above-the-line deduction for teachers for all of their supplies and materials bought for the classroom still stands,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cMortgage interest premiums are deductible, as well.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget to be on the look out for possible tax season scams. The IRS releases a list of the top 12 most common scams annually.\n\nWhile the WHNT News 19 Tax Action Line is over, WHNT News 19 is still offering a free tax service to local working families throughout this tax season. The United Way of Madison County and Impact Alabama are sponsoring the SaveFirst Initiative.
