Ryan Rigdon considered suicide after completing two tours in Iraq, but Obama explained how Joining Forces \u2013 the initiative she started with Dr. Jill Biden \u2013 helps to support both veterans and military families. Rigdon thankfully received the care he needed.\n\nIn her piece, she also salutes Her Royal Highness, Catherine, The Duchess of Cambridge for her own initiative to highlight the importance of young children\u2019s mental health. Both the First Lady and the Duchess wrote pieces as part of the Young Minds Matter editorial series for the site to raise awareness.\n\nMichelle Obama also talked about the importance of acknowledging mental health troubles within families \u2013 instead of downplaying them:\n\nSadly, too often, the stigma around mental health prevents people who need help from seeking it. But that simply doesn\u2019t make any sense. Whether an illness affects your heart, your arm or your brain, it\u2019s still an illness, and there shouldn\u2019t be any distinction. We would never tell someone with a broken leg that they should stop wallowing and get it together. We don\u2019t consider taking medication for an ear infection something to be ashamed of. We shouldn\u2019t treat mental health conditions any differently. Instead, we should make it clear that getting help isn\u2019t a sign of weakness \u2013 it\u2019s a sign of strength \u2013 and we should ensure that people can get the treatment they need.\n\nRead more of her piece here and find out more about the five signs of mental health issues with the group Change Direction, here.\n\nSOURCE: The Huffington Post | PHOTO CREDIT: Getty\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nBridging The Gap \u2013 The Intersection Between Black Lives Matter & The Black Panther Party\n\n\u201cFirst Spouse?\u201d Michelle Obama Coins New Name For Successor", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Michelle Obama Takes A Stand On Mental Health In Compelling Op-Ed", "image": "https://ionenewsone.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/14526526817165.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1", "description": "The conversation about\u00a0mental health in America is one First Lady Michelle Obama refuses to ignore.
