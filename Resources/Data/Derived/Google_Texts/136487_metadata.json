Her older son plays baseball. His younger brother has developed a passion for theater in classes at Moco Arts subsidized by Keene Housing. The youngest boy, who is five, went to camp last summer.\n\nSpending time at these activities has kept her boys busy when they\u2019re not in school, Marsh said.\n\n\u201cUsually every night is something,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re out of trouble.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also learning new skills doing activities they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to afford, she said.\n\nHer 14-year-old, the theater buff, told her he\u2019s become braver as a result of his classes.\n\n\u201cHe can go out on stage and sing a solo,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cMy knees would be knocking together, but he has the confidence to do that because he has the tools.\u201d\n\nThe potential for individual benefit is great, Meehan said, but programs like the Kids Collaborative go beyond giving one kid the confidence to sing a solo.\n\nPatrick Dolenc, a professor of economics at Keene State College and a member of the Keene Housing Kids\u2019 Collaborative board of directors, said access to extracurricular activities can change the structures that keep families poor generation after generation.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that the Kids Collaborative is a very conscious attempt to try and break the cycle of poverty,\u201d Dolenc said.\n\nAs the gap between rich and poor families widens, children like the ones growing up in Keene Housing are falling farther behind their peers, Dolenc said.\n\n\u201cWe all know that kids who grow up in poverty are more likely to end up being parents in houses that are struggling economically,\u201d he said. \u201cIncreasingly, we\u2019re not dealing with a level playing field.\u201d\n\nParticipation in sports, arts classes and after-school activities can level that playing field, Dolenc said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a whole host of reasons that (the kids) are going to start adulthood in a better-off place with more of an advantage,\u201d he said.\n\nMoco Arts Executive Director said Reagan Messer said he has heard from the parents of Keene Housing residents who take dance or theater classes at the school that the benefits are clear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just learning how to dance, or how to sing or act, the kids are learning life skills that they\u2019re going to learn to apply in their lives,\u201d Messer said.\n\nLiz Chipman, a former Big Brothers, Big Sisters program director, began as executive director of the Keene Housing Kids Collective two weeks ago.\n\nChipman said she plans to spend the first weeks in her new post getting to know Keene and deciding which new organizations the collaborative could partner with.\n\n\u201cI feel so very excited about being here and starting this organization,\u201d she said, calling Meehan and Keene housing \u201creally forward thinking\u201d for establishing the collaborative.\n\nFor its first three years, Keene Housing will support the collaborative with money it has generated through the Moving to Work program, a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development deregulation program that gives 39 public housing authorities nationwide more flexibility to test approaches to affordable housing.\n\nBy exempting Moving to Work housing authorities from many of the rules set out by the United States Housing Act of 1937, housing authorities like Keene Housing can reduce their costs and spend their money more efficiently.\n\nKeene\u2019s participation in the program since its inception in the early 1990s has given the organization the freedom to experiment with projects like the Kids Collective, Meehan said.\n\nMarsh hopes the Kids Collaborative will mean a better future for her kids, and maybe help them avoid the mistakes she said she made.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to follow my lead and end up in the same place,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can go on and do something bigger and better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "Josh Meehan wants to put Keene
