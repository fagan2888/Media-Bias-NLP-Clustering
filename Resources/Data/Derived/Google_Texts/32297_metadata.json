The program was introduced at three MRESC schools in September 2014 and included providing each student with a Google Chromebook to use during school hours.\n\n\"Given how technology has exploded, particularly over the past decade, it is critical to offer a classroom experience for students reflective of our changing world,\" said Gary Molenaar, assistant superintendent for Learning/Educational Services.\n\nThe MRESC was also designated as the official Hybrid Learning model in New Jersey by the HLI.\n\nHybrid Learning is being implemented at the following MRESC schools:\n\n\u2022 The NuView Academy, which collaborates with Princeton House to serve students ages 5-21 who have a diagnosis of depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and conduct, thought or anxiety disorders.\n\n\u2022 The Raritan Valley Academy, for students ages 10-21 with behavioral, learning and/or language disabilities.\n\n\u2022 The Middlesex County Academy, for students ages 12-21 who are at-risk or classified.\n\nThe MRESC operates seven schools, providing a range of services for students ages 3-21 with autism, multiple disabilities and at-risk behavior, and facilitates a clinical support program for students 5-21 years old. Founded in 1977, the MRESC also manages a Co-op Pricing System, the largest state approved cooperative, and coordinates transportation services for more than 14,000 students throughout New Jersey.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1amXCx9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "NuView Academy teacher Nicole Elmini was named a \"Hybrid Learning Rock Star\" in the \"Best New Artist\" category, from the Hybrid Learning Institute", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "NuView Academy teacher Nicole Elmini was named a \"Hybrid Learning Rock Star\" in the \"Best New Artist\" category, from the Hybrid Learning Institute", "title": "Academy teacher named Hybrid Learning Rock Star", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2015/04/02/educator-named-best-new-artist/70768952/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NuView Academy teacher Nicole Elmini was named a \"Hybrid Learning Rock Star\" in the \"Best New Artist\" category, from the Hybrid Learning Institute", "title": "Academy teacher named Hybrid Learning Rock Star", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/022a3801857142121cf9d9821a0da4eee7f4d6ed/c=0-0-641-641&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2015/04/01/B9316634515Z.1_20150401110758_000_G76A8DGQO.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "NuView Academy, teacher, Hybrid Learning, Piscataway"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb4e\"", "article_summary": "NuView Academy teacher Nicole Elmini was named a \"Hybrid Learning Rock Star\" in the \"Best New Artist\" category, from the Hybrid Learning InstituteNuView Teacher Nicole Elmini, shown with student Brian Rodriquez, was recently named a \u201cHybrid Learning Rock Star\u201d in the \u201cBest New Artist\u201d category, from the Hybrid Learning Institute.\nNuView Academy teacher Nicole Elmini has been named a \"Hybrid Learning Rock Star\" in the \"Best New Artist\" category, from the Hybrid Learning Institute (HLI).\n(Photo: Photo courtesy of Middlesex Regional Educational Services Commission) Story Highlights NuView Academy teacher Nicole Elmini was named a Hybrid Learning Rock Star.\nHybrid learning combines digital and face-to-face instruction, resulting in more personalized learning opportunities in an effort to improve student academic performance.\nThe MRESC was also designated as the official Hybrid Learning model in New Jersey by the HLI."}
