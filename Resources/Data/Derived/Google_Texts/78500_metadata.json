(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nNew Jersey this week issued its first standards for edible forms of medical marijuana, a move that could clear the way for the state\u2019s three dispensaries to start making and selling the products.\n\nBill would end federal ban on medical pot in some states\n\nThe state Department of Health told The Associated Press on Friday that the standards, intended to assure patient and employee safety, were sent to the clinics on Tuesday.\n\nExecutives at the three clinics did not immediately return calls to The Associated Press on Friday afternoon, so it\u2019s not clear whether the standards will be enough to jumpstart production of a form of the drug that some advocates have long said should be made available, especially for children.\n\nDiverse groups converge to push for legal marijuana\n\nBut Ken Wolski, executive director of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana-New Jersey, said parents have been adapting.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been forcing parents to make their own edibles,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just seems like it\u2019s an awful long delay to make it available from the Department of Health.\u201d\n\nMedical marijuana advocates pushed for years for Gov. Chris Christie to do more to ease access to medical marijuana for children who could be helped by it, especially those with Dravet Syndrome, a form of epilepsy that is rare and often fatal.\n\nIn 2013, Christie signed a bill to allow edible forms of marijuana \u2014 but for children only \u2014 and to let dispensaries grow and sell more than the three strains of cannabis they were each initially allowed. All the changes were aimed at allowing children to have the strains and forms of marijuana that could help them.\n\nIt was a significant step for Christie to make changes to the medical marijuana program. He had been reluctant to do anything to expand access, and critics said Christie\u2019s administration was making implementation burdensome.\n\nHis predecessor, Jon Corzine, made allowing medical marijuana one of his last acts as governor.\n\nIt took nearly three years before the state\u2019s first dispensary opened. And now, five years after Christie took office, there are only three running, though the state has selected three other groups to start others.\n\nChristie said last year that he might consider in the future changing the law to allow edible forms of medical marijuana for adults, too.\n\nThe standards, which take effect immediately, include details on lighting and ventilation requirements for areas where edibles as well as lozenges and topical versions of marijuana are to be made, as well as required label information and procedures for recalls.\n\nHealth Department spokeswoman Donna Leusner said the department plans to make the standards into more formal regulations with input from the industry. But she said the state wanted to allow the additional forms of the drug to be sold before that process is completed.\n\n\u201cThe Department expects the Alternative Treatment Centers to embrace this standard for the safety of its patients and its workers,\u201d Leusner said.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
