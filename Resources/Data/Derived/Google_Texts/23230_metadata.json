This disparity in perceptions of how things are going personally vs. nationally is not unusual for various social and mood issues, but highlights that the current efforts to reform health care are taking place even as the majority of Americans give their own health care relatively high ratings.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama recently apologized for the millions of Americans who are losing their current health plans due to the Affordable Care Act and for the disastrous rollout due to the technically-plagued HealthCare.gov website. Obama has called on states to allow consumers to be allowed to keep their canceled health plans.\n\nA CBS News analysis found that nearly 5 million Americans would lose their current health plans due to Obamacare.\n\nJust over 106,000 Americans were able to enroll in Obamacare in the first month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A majority of Americans are happy with their current health care plan.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/11/25/poll-69-percent-of-americans-satisfied-with-personal-health-care-plan/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/185481441.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/185481441.jpg?w=1500", "height": 967}, "type": "article", "description": "A majority of Americans are happy with their current health care plan.", "title": "Poll: 69 Percent Of Americans Satisfied With Personal Health Care Plan"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/185481441.jpg?w=1500", "description": "A majority of Americans are happy with their current health care plan.", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Poll: 69 Percent Of Americans Satisfied With Personal Health Care Plan"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, cbs washington, health, politics, gallup, health care, healthcare.gov, obamacare, president barack obama", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "gallup, health care, healthcare.gov, obamacare, president barack obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcadb2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAmericans remain generally positive about the quality of health care they personally receive, their health care coverage, and what they pay for health care,\u201d Gallup noted.\nWASHINGTON (CBS DC) \u2014 A majority of Americans are happy with their current health care plan.\nA new Gallup poll finds that 69 percent of Americans rate their personal coverage as excellent or good, but only 32 percent say the same about health care coverage in the country.\nA CBS News analysis found that nearly 5 million Americans would lose their current health plans due to Obamacare.\n\u201cThey are significantly less positive about these health care issues for the nation as a whole."}
