A man pleaded guilty in Jefferson County court on Tuesday to driving under the influence of alcohol in a May 2014 hit-and-run in Wheat Ridge that left an 18-year-old dead.

Alton Edward Kirkland, 23, pleaded guilty to nine counts, including vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of an accident causing death, menacing and driving under the influence, according to the county district attorney’s office.

Kirkland was speeding southbound in an Oldsmobile Aurora on Kipling Street from West 44th Avenue when he ran a red light and slammed into the passenger side of a car driven Jordan Sprouse, killing him.

“He was moving at a very, very high rate of speed,” police told The Denver Post after the crash.

Kirkland’s girlfriend and her two small children were in his car when the crash happened and were injured, the office said. A third car was involved in the crash, though no one inside of it was injured.

After the crash, Kirkland fled the scene on foot and was later arrested at his Lakewood apartment. He was then taken to a hospital where he was treated for minor injuries before being booked into jail.

“To get this news was overwhelming beyond what you would expect as a parent,” Jordan’s father, Jamie Sprouse, told 7News at a May vigil for the teen that was attended by about 100 people.

The teen’s mother posted on his Facebook page in November asking to keep Sprouse’s memory alive and pleading with people to stop drinking and driving.

“It is not uncommon for young adults to see themselves as invincible,” she wrote. “Guess what? You’re NOT! Drinking and driving kills!”

Two blue signs memorialize the spot where Sprouse’s car was hit that say “PLEASE DRIVE SAFELY” and “IN MEMORY OF JORDAN SPROUSE.”

Kirkland, who had a prior criminal record, is set to be sentenced on Jan. 27. He faces possible prison sentences of 4-12 years on each of the most serious counts.
