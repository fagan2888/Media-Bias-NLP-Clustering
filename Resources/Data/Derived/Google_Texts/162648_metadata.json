I think there\u2019s a lot of demand out there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two men have learned that it\u2019s possible to operate on their own without a lot of overhead. \u201cThe local coffee shop is our office. With work done online, the only overhead is a cup of coffee,\u201d said Richardson, speaking from a table at the thirty-thirty coffee shop on Main Street.\n\nThe Internet plays a big part in the work the pair are able to do. \u201cPeople have found me online. Social media is gold. LinkedIn is pretty big,\u201d said Newton.\n\nRichardson said that with most of his work experience in central Illinois, he stays involved in local networking, including meeting with other consultants.\n\n\u201cI try to stay up with some of the entrepreneurial groups in the area like One Million Cups that meet every week,\u201d said Richardson.\n\nNewton also is familiar with much of the work going on in central Illinois. \u201cI know all the funders in town. I also know that funding is harder to get than ever, but there are ways to get it if you know how. I\u2019m doing a lot of grant writing these days,\u201d he said.\n\nHelp doesn\u2019t have to carry a high price tag, said Newton. \u201cNon-profits are chronically underfunded, but my services start at $95. I can write a basic grant for $100,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the concerns for both men about going into business for themselves was the matter of acquiring health insurance. \u201cI went to the marketplace that I\u2019d never tried before,\u201d said Richardson, referring to options provided by the Affordable Care Act. \u201cLast summer when I went out on my own, I found an option that was one-third less than the COBRA payment I had been making,\u201d he said.\n\nNewton found another health care solution. \u201cMy wife, Jill, and I found coverage through Samaritan Ministries. Not only does it provide good coverage, but there are a number of discounts available \u2014 such as 30 percent off prescriptions at Walgreens,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s one of the advantages of the Affordable Care Act that you don\u2019t hear much about: It frees one up to work on their own.\u201d\n\nBoth maintain websites that list information about the services they provide: perennialpartnersci.com and pivot4solutions.com.\n\nSteve Tarter is the Journal Star business editor.
