A home assessed at the township\u2019s average of $100,000 would have a tax bill of $2,010, which is an increase of $130 from the previous year.\n\n\u201cThe largest increase is both a revenue and an appropriation, which is $1.3 million shared services agreement where the township is funding improvements [for the East Brunswick Board of Education]. Last year we agreed to fund $6 million to be paid back in five years. This is the first year of the five so one of the first items in the increase from $59.47 million to $63.01 million is the board item,\u201d said Lou Neely, chief financial officer for the township.\n\n\n\nNeely also added that insurance costs have also seen an increase over the past year.\n\n\u201cNext, pension costs jumped by $431,400 and insurance is up because of the Affordable Care Act by $1,144,573. These are factors beyond the control of the mayor,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTake out the mandatory pension and health benefits and the change is very small.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe proposed budget, which is scheduled to have a public hearing at the council\u2019s May 23 meeting, is supported by a $40.62 million tax levy on residential and commercial property owners. Last year\u2019s budget was backed by a $38.08 million tax levy on those same property owners.\n\nThe total does not factor in school or county taxes.\n\nContact Michael Nunes at mnunes@gmnews.com.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Michael Nunes", "og": {"site_name": "Greater Media Newspapers", "description": "By MICHAEL NUNES Staff Writer EAST BRUNSWICK \u2013 Without much fanfare, the Township Council introduced its 2016 municipal budget.
