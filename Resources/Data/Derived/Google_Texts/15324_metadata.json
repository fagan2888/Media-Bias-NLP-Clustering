So, the rates don\u2019t apply to the vast majority of Minnesotans, including those in the Medicare or Medicaid health insurance programs or to people in large employer-sponsored health plans.\n\nOne reason the individual and small group markets are seeing different rates of increase is because they\u2019re starting from different premium points. Individual market rates apparently are catching up with those for small groups, said Roger Feldman, a health policy researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, the individual market was underpriced,\u201d Feldman said, \u201cand the small group market was overpriced.\u201d\n\nAt Eagan-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, individual market rates next year will increase an average of 45 percent to 49 percent, depending on the product. But in the small group market, average rates at Blue Cross will increase 1.4 percent in some cases, while decreasing an average of 4.8 percent in others.\n\nThe small group market experienced turbulence in 2014 as the federal Affordable Care Act imposed new rules that eliminated premium discounts and penalties for small groups based on the collective health status of enrollees. The change created winners and losers during those years, but the changes are now complete and the market is stable, said Jim McManus, a Blue Cross spokesman.\n\n\u201cThis is in sharp contrast to what is happening now with the individual market, where the overall risk mix continues to transition as new people enter the market and change plans with greater frequency,\u201d McManus said in a statement.\n\nIn the individual market, one of the big changes with the health law in 2014 was the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions that insurers previously used to control costs. As part of the change, Minnesota closed its high-risk pool for people with costly health problems, and many have moved to the individual market.\n\nPremium increases in the market for 2016 reflect an \u201cadjustment to what the rates really need to be,\u201d said Doug Smith, senior vice president of health solutions, sales and account service at Bloomington-based HealthPartners. He added: \u201cMy sense is the vast majority of that adjustment is happening in this cycle.\u201d\n\nMinnesota saw enrollment in small group health plans decline from about 320,000 people in 2013 to about 268,000 people last year. Insurance agents said some small groups opted to drop coverage because workers could find better rates in the individual market.\n\nAs individual market premiums catch up with small group rates, \u201cfewer employers will dump their group insurance, and more employers will come back to the group market,\u201d said Dave Wiest with Emex Benefit Systems in Medina.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Rates are expected to increase an average of 1 percent for 2016.", "title": "Small business health insurance premiums will see only small bumps", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/small-business-health-insurance-premiums-will-see-only-small-bumps/331167261/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Rates are expected to increase an average of 1 percent for 2016.", "title": "Small business health insurance premiums will see only small bumps", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/small-business-health-insurance-premiums-will-see-only-small-bumps/331167261/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Rates are expected to increase an average of 1 percent for 2016."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe362d\"", "article_summary": "The average small business in Minnesota should see a relatively small increase in health insurance premiums next year, as rates in the market continue to be more stable than for people who buy individual policies.\nAs individual market premiums catch up with small group rates, \u201cfewer employers will dump their group insurance, and more employers will come back to the group market,\u201d said Dave Wiest with Emex Benefit Systems in Medina.\nInsurance agents said some small groups opted to drop coverage because workers could find better rates in the individual market.\nIndividual market rates apparently are catching up with those for small groups, said Roger Feldman, a health policy researcher at the University of Minnesota.\nSo, the rates don\u2019t apply to the vast majority of Minnesotans, including those in the Medicare or Medicaid health insurance programs or to people in large employer-sponsored health plans."}
