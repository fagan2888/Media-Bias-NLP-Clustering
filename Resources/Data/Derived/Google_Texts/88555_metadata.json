There is no freeze watch. The warning was also in effect from 2 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Monday.\n\nTemperatures are expected to be in the upper 20s to lower 30s.\n\n\"The day will continue to be colder than usual -- like typical day in November, not October. Despite having ample sunshine, with occasional fair weather clouds rolling past, the sunshine will have a hard time warming the air past the middle and upper-40s in most of the state,\" WFSB Meteorologist Mike Cameron said.\n\nWind gusts could be more than 20 mph.\n\nCameron said the cause of the cold is a \"low pressure system centered to the northeast of New England,\"\n\n\"The pressure gradient around the storm will be the supply of the wind which will, in turn, fan the cold air situated to our northwest right into Connecticut,\" Cameron said.\n\nThe National Weather Service said \"sensitive vegetation and outdoor plants may be damaged or killed due temperatures at or below freezing.\"\n\n\"In all likelihood, some of the plants in the garden that were green yesterday are brown now,\" Cameron said.\n\nTo see the complete technical discussion, click here.\n\nFor weather alerts and updates on smartphones and tablets, click here or text \u201cweather\u201d to 38324 to download the WFSB app.\n\nCopyright 2015 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).
