China devalued the yuan (renminbi) currency by 2% against the dollar. This means, for example, that Chinese-manufactured goods being sold in the United States, or any other country, will now be 2% cheaper. It also means that any goods manufactured in the US or Japan or any other country being sold in China will now be 2% more expensive.\n\nObviously, this has big implications for global trade. It means that China\u2019s goods will sell better in countries around the world, and that other countries\u2019 goods will sell worse in China. So what is good for China will be bad for everyone else.\n\nSo stocks on Wall Street and in Europe fell sharply on Tuesday. But the implications go farther than that.\n\nAccording to an analyst in India:\n\nThe devaluation will affect India\u2019s exports not only to China but to other countries also with increasing competitiveness of Chinese exports. This may swell the trade deficit further, which is already touching $50 billion, as imports from China may increase particularly as China is having excessive capacity in diverse sectors of manufacturing.\n\nIndia\u2019s rupee currency fell sharply against the dollar, apparently because currency traders are expecting India\u2019s central bank to be forced to devalue the rupee as well to compete with China. Other currencies fell sharply on Tuesday for the same reason: the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira.\n\nThere was a \u201ccurrency war\u201d during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the countries that moved the fastest to devalue their currencies were the countries that suffered the least unemployment. During the last ten years, there have been concerns raised occasionally about a new currency war. The China yuan devaluation is raising those concerns to a fever pitch.\n\nAnd with good reason. It is quite possible that central banks in China\u2019s neighbors in Asia will be the first to be forced to devalue their own currencies to compete with China. Europe may then follow suit, in what was called in the 1930s the \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d Devaluation of all of these currencies will make the dollar stronger, which could eventually crush American exports and harm American multinational firms, so the US may be forced to follow suit.\n\nRight now, this is just speculation, but it is a concern that is being expressed widely today.\n\nI\u2019ve been amazed the past few years with the willingness of governments to paper over problems by blanketing the problems with a tsunami of money. Trillions of dollars have been thrown into global stock markets by quantitative easing, and Wall Street stocks are in a huge bubble. Obamacare is a financial disaster held together by the $710 billion Medicare insurance fund, which has essentially been thrown into the garbage with nothing to show for it.\n\nThe claim by politicians is always that the tsunami of money is only temporary, because it buys time for the problems to solve themselves. Thus, flooding the stock market with money is OK, because soon economic growth will take over. Flooding Obamacare with money is OK, because soon the various Rube Goldberg Ponzi Scheme businesses will become self-sustaining.\n\nThose assumptions are now provably wrong, and the only way to keep things from collapsing is to keep the tsunami going and growing. But even a tsunami eventually runs out of water.\n\n\n\nS&P 500 Price/Earnings ratio at astronomically high 21.69 on August 7 (WSJ)\n\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, a major global financial crisis is coming, and something will trigger it. China\u2019s stock market bubble is imploding. Global trade is slowing significantly. The S&P 500 price/earnings ratio is at an astronomically high 21.69, indicating a major Wall Street stock market bubble.\n\nAt some point, something will trigger the global financial crisis. Maybe the China devaluation will be the trigger, by creating a domino effect of some kind. Or, maybe the central banks of the world will find a way to increase the tsunami of money still further, flooding the problems for a while longer. They are certainly going to try \u2014 though of course that\u2019s exactly what would create a currency war. All we can do is watch to see what happens next. Reuters and Bloomberg and New Delhi TV\n\nYuan devaluation a humiliating setback for \u2018China dream\u2019\n\nThe \u201cChina dream\u201d is for China to replace the United States militarily, by taking control of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and financially, by replacing the dollar with the Chinese yuan as the global reserve currency. This is the second disastrous setback to the \u201cChina dream\u201d within the last month.\n\nFirst, in order to prove that it can replace the United States economically, China has to prove that it can provide a world-class stock market that can operate free of government intervention. And that objective is completely in shreds, after the multi-trillion dollar tsunami of money that was used to intervene in the Shanghai stock market, almost completely destroying it as a market.\n\nAnd now China has its second disaster with the surprise yuan devaluation, effectively declaring war on other countries\u2019 currencies.\n\nThe humiliating devaluation was a move of almost complete desperation. China\u2019s economy is in serious trouble, and that\u2019s not the worst of it. China has a history of massive \u201cpeople\u2019s rebellions\u201d against an oppressive government, the last one being Mao\u2019s Communist Revolution that ended in 1949. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, China is now overdue for the next one, and a Chinese financial crisis could be the trigger.
