It\u2019s an unbelievable feeling.\u201d\n\nThe kids were given a chance to buy anything in the store \u2013 except weapons and firearms. Shoes, clothing and sports equipment were popular items.\n\nInflatable swimming pools, back packs and even a basketball goal were just some of the other items that wound up at the registers Thursday.\n\nFor Isby, the event was the time of his life.\n\nAfter battling store employees Bayle Bryant and Maddy Lukens with foam swim noodles, he declared confidently, \u201cthis is the most fun I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 7-year-old Kiersten Gibbs had her shopping cart filled with a pair of shoes, a backpack, a bag, a hula hoop, a pool, a pool noodle, a Hello Kitty ball, a swimsuit, shorts, a badminton set and a toy Z-Curve Bow.\n\n\u201cI got everything I wanted,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cand I got something for my brother and sister, too.\u201d\n\nBoyd said she was overwhelmed by Academy\u2019s generosity as much as she was impressed by the 30 kids who were invited to the shopping spree.\n\n\u201cIt was based on their behavior, attendance and participation, and not even their parents knew they were coming to this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have been wonderful. \u2026 there was one little girl who bought everything she needed for school \u2013 it\u2019s all she wanted. So many of them are buying things to share . \u2026 that says a lot about them. It really makes you feel good.\u201d\n\ndennis.seid@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @dennisseid", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Jay Isby wanted shoes \u2013 but not just any shoes. \u201cI need boots for a tough little man doing big work,\u201d the spunky 9-year-old said of himself, smiling broadly. \u201cI\u2019m helping fix our neighbor\u2019s house across the street. \u2026 I really need the boots.\u201d And he got those \u2026", "title": "30 Boys & Girls Club members each get $200 shopping spree - Daily Journal", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://djournal.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/42/files/2015/07/07021506-Sports-Academy-Give-Away-e1435927541798.jpg", "height": 502}, "url": "http://djournal.com/news/30-boys-girls-club-members-each-get-200-shopping-spree/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Jay Isby wanted shoes \u2013 but not just any shoes. \u201cI need boots for a tough little man doing big work,\u201d the spunky 9-year-old said of himself, smiling broadly. \u201cI\u2019m helping fix our neighbor\u2019s house across the street. \u2026 I really need the boots.\u201d And he got those [\u2026]", "creator": "@djournalnow", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/djournal.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/42/files/2015/07/07021506-Sports-Academy-Give-Away-e1435927541798.jpg?fit=800%2C502", "title": "30 Boys & Girls Club members each get $200 shopping spree - Daily Journal", "site": "@djournalnow", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=486426430, affiliate-data=1l3vpBD, app-argument=http://djournal.com/news/30-boys-girls-club-members-each-get-200-shopping-spree/", "fb": {"admins": 26506061, "app_id": 441890629197277}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/djournalnow", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-07-03T07:01:50-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=1075"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0966\"", "article_summary": "By Dennis SeidDaily JournalTUPELO \u2013 Jay Isby wanted shoes \u2013 but not just any shoes.\nIsby was among 30 area youth from the Boys & Girls Club of North Mississippi who were invited by Academy Sports + Outdoors to take part in a shopping spree Thursday, prior to today\u2019s opening.\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d said Zell Long, the chief professional officer for the Boys & Girls Club.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t tell them about the shopping cards.\u201dIn fact, she was only told each child would receive a $100 card to spend.\n\u201cI need boots for a tough little man doing big work,\u201d the spunky 9-year-old said of himself, smiling broadly."}
