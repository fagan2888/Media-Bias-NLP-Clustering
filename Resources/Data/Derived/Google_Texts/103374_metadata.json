In 2013, Cruz took to the Senate floor and promised to speak out against Obamacare \u201cuntil I am no longer able to stand.\u201d To fill the time, he even read Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham.\u201d His filibuster, and the government shutdown over Obamacare it sparked, launched Cruz into the political stratosphere \u2014 inspiring conservatives eager for a principled fighter who does not back down.\n\nBut while the shutdown may have helped boost Cruz into the top tier of Republican presidential contenders, it had zero impact on undermining Obamacare.\n\nRubio, by contrast, didn\u2019t read Dr. Seuss on the Senate floor, but he has quietly pushed Obamacare into what may prove to be a death spiral.\n\nWhen the Obama administration was crafting Obamacare, it came up with a crony capitalist solution to entice reluctant insurers to join the exchanges. Many insurers worried that there would not be enough healthy people paying in to cover the costs of sick people. So the administration created a \u201crisk corridor\u201d program to help prop up insurers who lost money in the first three years of the law. Profitable insurers would pay some of those profits into a pool to help insurers who lost money. If the amount insurers lost exceeded what the companies paid in, the government would step in and make up the difference.\n\nCalling this \u201ca taxpayer-funded bailout for insurance companies,\u201d Rubio last year quietly inserted language into the omnibus government spending bill that barred the Department of Health and Human Services from dipping into general funds to pay failing insurers. \u201cWhile the Obama administration can still administer the risk-corridor program, for one year at least, they won\u2019t be able to use taxpayer funds to bail out insurance companies,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nHis provision sparked little opposition at the time, but it has proved to be a poison pill that is killing Obamacare from within.\n\nLast year, insurers lost $2.9 billion more than expected on Obamacare. But insurers had paid only $362 million into the program \u2014 leaving it more than $2.5 billion short. Thanks to Rubio\u2019s provision, the administration was allowed to pay only 13 cents of every dollar insurers requested. Without the taxpayer bailouts, more than half of the Obamacare insurance cooperatives created under the law failed. One, Health Republic of Oregon, was expecting a $7.9 million bailout from the government. Instead, thanks to Rubio, it got only $995,000 \u2014 not a penny of it from the taxpayers. The Oregon co-op announced in October it was closing its doors. Soon, two other insurers \u2014 WinHealth Partners in Wyoming and Moda Health in Washington state \u2014 pulled out of the exchanges. And United Healthcare, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, announced that it may leave the Obamacare exchanges in 2016. If that happens, and other insurers follow United\u2019s lead, that could spell disaster for Obamacare.\n\nThe Hill newspaper called Rubio\u2019s provision \u201cthe biggest blow in the GOP\u2019s five-year war against Obamacare.\u201d The New York Times declared in a front-page story, \u201cFor all the Republican talk about dismantling the Affordable Care Act, one Republican presidential hopeful has actually done something toward achieving that goal,\u201d adding that Rubio\u2019s provision has \u201ctangled up the Obama administration, sent tremors through health insurance markets and rattled confidence in the durability of President Obama\u2019s signature health law.\u201d\n\nNow that the Obama administration understands the grave threat Rubio\u2019s provision poses to Obamacare, Democrats are pushing to block it from this year\u2019s omnibus spending bill so that they can bail out the insurers. According to Politico, \u201cHHS officials . . . maintained that insurers will eventually receive the requested payments during the next two years of the temporary program.\u201d\n\nThe insurers are joining the fight. In talking points obtained by BuzzFeed, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association\u2019s chief executive, Scott Serota, warned congressional Democrats that Rubio\u2019s provision \u201cwill result in massive premium increases and could cause private insurers to become insolvent.\u201d In other words, Rubio\u2019s provision poses a mortal threat to Obamacare.\n\nRubio maintains that if it takes a taxpayer bailout of big business to save Obamacare, that alone proves the law is unsustainable. He is pushing to keep his bailout ban in the final bill. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, the reason these health insurance companies are enduring a financial loss is that Obamacare is a disastrous law,\u201d Rubio declared in a letter to House and Senate leaders. \u201cIt broke the promise to lower health insurance premiums . . . Now the very architects of this law are attempting to place taxpayers on the hook.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right \u2014 and now it\u2019s up to GOP leaders to back him by refusing to agree to any omnibus spending bill that allows a taxpayer bailout for insurance companies that made a bad bet on Obamacare.\n\nAnd Rubio deserves credit at Tuesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate as the only candidate on the stage who has done more than talk about killing Obamacare.\n\nRead more from Marc Thiessen\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He deserves more credit for this than any other GOP candidate.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "He deserves more credit for this than any other GOP candidate.", "title": "How Marco Rubio is quietly killing Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-marco-rubio-is-quietly-killing-obamacare/2015/12/14/c706849a-a275-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/14/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Rubio-01184.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcthiessen"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-marco-rubio-is-quietly-killing-obamacare/2015/12/14/c706849a-a275-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, marco rubio killing obamacare, affordable care act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen"}, "eomportal-uuid": "c706849a-a275-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obamacare, marco rubio killing obamacare, affordable care act"}, "article_summary": "Rubio, by contrast, didn\u2019t read Dr. Seuss on the Senate floor, but he has quietly pushed Obamacare into what may prove to be a death spiral.\nWithout the taxpayer bailouts, more than half of the Obamacare insurance cooperatives created under the law failed.\nAnd Rubio deserves credit at Tuesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate as the only candidate on the stage who has done more than talk about killing Obamacare.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, the reason these health insurance companies are enduring a financial loss is that Obamacare is a disastrous law,\u201d Rubio declared in a letter to House and Senate leaders.\nRubio maintains that if it takes a taxpayer bailout of big business to save Obamacare, that alone proves the law is unsustainable."}
