The new documentary \u201cHarmontown\u201d (to be released Oct. 3) depicts the period of Harmon\u2019s life immediately following his firing, during which he busied himself by procrastinating on pilots for CBS and Fox, neither of which ever saw air, and by undertaking a booze-fueled national tour for his Harmontown podcast.\n\nNeil Berkeley, the documentary\u2019s director, told Salon that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of stuff in the movie that is honest and I know people find that abrasive\u2026 The drinking is part of his lifestyle, and it is an issue for his health. He shouldn\u2019t drink so much.\u201d And yet Harmon\u2019s slow-motion deterioration, getting blackout drunk onstage as his fans cheer him on, also reveals his deep anxieties as a comedy creator and his wearying perfectionism. Many scenes depict Harmon, drink in hand, endlessly revising overdue scripts. It hardly looks easy to be Harmon.\n\nThings turned around after the Harmontown tour; the creator was reinstated for the fifth season of \u201cCommunity,\u201d and a sixth season with Harmon on staff is to air on Yahoo! Screen. Harmon spoke to Salon about the state of the television business and taking criticism.\n\nWhich comes more easily to you \u2014 performing as yourself, or writing for characters?\n\nIt\u2019s certainly easier to perform, because writing is like that in 100 iterations. The first step of writing is to be yourself, and talk about things, and try to find stories within that. It\u2019s much easier to barf stuff into a microphone.\n\nIn the documentary, we see you \u201cbarfing\u201d \u2014 speaking pretty freely to small audiences. We also see you getting endless notes from CBS executives while working on a pilot script that never made it to air. Given the level of scrutiny your scripts get from networks and how free you\u2019re able to be when acting as a free agent, is it worth it to keep trying to make TV?\n\nEither one is what you make of it. If you want to reach millions of people in a beloved medium like television, you can make the best or the worst of the fact that it comes with executives giving you notes. You can recognize people have seen a lot, and they might have valuable reactions. The truth is \u2014 either one. All feedback is just feedback and you can do good things with it or bad things with it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for reasons to get upset with broadcast television as a medium, you\u2019ll find them at every turn. But there are opportunities\u2026 Despite what people may think about me because they read my blog and think \u201cdifficult to work with\u201d means not taking notes\u201d \u2014 I find that aspect of the process therapeutic. It releases me from a dangerous level of perfectionism and pretentiousness that might cause what I write to be less accessible. The side of me that says \u201cI want this to be the best thing ever\u201d \u2014 that perfectionist guy might make something brilliant someday but he\u2019s not going to accidentally make \u201cCheers,\u201d either. When it\u2019s edited together on film, hearing every note you get \u2014 it seems overwhelming. But the alternative to that would be a non-contractual collaborative environment where they could come to your house and watch you type. You schedule these calls instead and they have a window to make their thoughts clear. Why CBS is the best, and why they\u2019re winning, is that they have a machine working. They give page numbers and notes, and you execute them.\n\nDo you worry that your reputation will cause you to never work in TV again?\n\n\u201cWorry,\u201d maybe, is the wrong word? I\u2019m cognizant of the possibility that the things I do will affect everything in my next list of options. If I\u2019m not ever going to write a script for a certain network that they\u2019re going to like, let\u2019s find that out. It\u2019s a big, fragmented business with a lot of desire to find anything that might work. In this new age, there\u2019s room for loudmouths like me that are just a little more visible. Maybe it counts against me in one room and counts for me in another room. Maybe television falls off the map, but in an alternate timeline where it doesn\u2019t, I spend my life focusing on television instead of a movie I might write. All we can do is be honest and try to make people happy. Me worrying about how this is going to affect me if I say or do this \u2014 that version of me is the least charismatic in the world. He makes the least people happy. I\u2019m not a strategist and I\u2019m not a diplomat. When I am allowed to say what I want, I\u2019m not saying things that are bad. I don\u2019t recommend my path to anybody but me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s working more than a different path, but I\u2019m not good at any other.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Community\" creator on his new documentary, his polemical career and why he is rooting for network TV", "title": "Dan Harmon: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like an underdog\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Community\" creator on his new documentary, his polemical career and why he is rooting for network TV", "title": "Dan Harmon: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like an underdog\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/27/dan_harmon_i_dont_feel_like_an_underdog/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/dan_harmon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Community\" creator on his new documentary, his polemical career and why he is rooting for network TV", "title": "Dan Harmon: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like an underdog\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/dan_harmon.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Community, dan harmon, Editor's Picks, harmontown", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s working more than a different path, but I\u2019m not good at any other.\nHarmon spoke to Salon about the state of the television business and taking criticism.\nIf I\u2019m not ever going to write a script for a certain network that they\u2019re going to like, let\u2019s find that out.\nThe first step of writing is to be yourself, and talk about things, and try to find stories within that.\nMany scenes depict Harmon, drink in hand, endlessly revising overdue scripts."}
