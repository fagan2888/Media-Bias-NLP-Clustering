Boehner, who has tangled repeatedly with the right wing of the Republican Party, has not been invited to this week\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference, a major snub at the annual gathering and a sign of the top Republican officeholder\u2019s struggle to find common ground with grass-roots activists.\n\nPeople familiar with CPAC\u2019s planning, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said the American Conservative Union, which hosts the event, never sent an invitation to Mr. Boehner, in part because it wanted the focus this year to be on leading conservative thinkers at the grass-roots level and not at the congressional or party leadership level.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who addressed the conference last year, was not asked to give his own speech, but rather to serve on one of the conference\u2019s panels.\n\nSEE ALSO: Ex-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay to join The Washington Times\n\n\u201cWe wanted this to be about conservatives, not party leaders in Washington,\u201d one source said.\n\nDespite that, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who has fallen out of favor with some grass-roots conservatives and faces a tea party-backed challenger in the party primary this year, will address the conference, his office said.\n\nMr. Boehner, Ohio Republican, used to be a regular at CPAC, but the three-day gathering that begins Thursday will mark the second in a row that he has missed after passing up an invitation last year. The speaker has grown increasingly vocal in recent months about his frustration with tea party members of the House Republican caucus who have broken with leadership on key votes.\n\nThe antipathy is mutual.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough curse words in the English language to describe how movement conservatives think of John Boehner,\u201d said Ford O\u2019Connell, a party strategist. \u201cThey see him as only slightly better than President Obama.\n\n\u201cBut, I think, John Boehner is wise not to attend CPAC because he does not want to become a distraction, and fodder for the news media, by highlighting the rift between establishment conservatives and the movement conservatives,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connell said. \u201cMovement conservatives are right to question Boehner\u2019s moves, but what they can\u2019t question is his heart in terms of him wanting to maximize electoral returns in the 2014 midterms.\u201d\n\nThe speakers lineup at the annual gathering is always a good test for who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out with conservative leaders.\n\nLast year, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was left off the list just weeks after he battled congressional Republicans, demanding that they approve emergency federal aid for Superstorm Sandy that would add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit.\n\nMr. Christie is back on this year\u2019s list, alongside other possible 2016 GOP presidential candidates, including Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, as well as Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.\n\nMr. Boehner\u2019s office refused to say whether the speaker was offered a slot.\n\n\u201cThe speaker will be on the road next weekend for House Republicans,\u201d said Cory Fritz, Mr. Boehner\u2019s political spokesman. \u201cOur office does not comment on invites or requests.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the RNC, said Mr. Priebus was asked to take part on a panel that will explore how to break the political clout of unions in the states because of the experience he gained fighting them in his home state of Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cHe was excited and thought it was the best opportunity for him to address the grassroots on an important subject,\u201d Ms. Kukowski said.\n\nMr. Boehner, who holds a 87 percent lifetime conservative rating with the American Conservative Union, used his CPAC speech four years ago to talk about the GOP relationship with the emerging tea party movement and praised it as an engine that could drive Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party should not attempt to co-opt the tea parties,\u201d Mr. Boehner said at CPAC 2010, after being introduced to a standing ovation. \u201cI think that is the dumbest thing. What we will do as long as I am leader is respect them, listen to them and walk amongst them.\u201d\n\nSince then, though, the relationship has been rocky, in part reflecting Mr. Boehner\u2019s conflicting duties as a top GOP figure and the man who must maintain operations on Capitol Hill.\n\nAfter some spending and debt fights led to GOP victories, Mr. Boehner and his lieutenants have increasingly locked horns with his party\u2019s right flank over the best tactics for advancing conservative policy goals.\n\nA battle last fall over whether to tie a spending deal to a fight over defunding Obamacare ended up in a government shutdown. Although polls showed the Republican Party\u2019s image was tarnished, Mr. Cruz \u2014 who pushed to link Obamacare and the spending bills \u2014 has become more popular among grass-roots conservatives.\n\nMr. Boehner\u2019s frustration with limited-government groups \u2014 including Heritage Action and the Club for Growth \u2014 boiled over at a December press conference, where he said those attacking the bipartisan budget deal that Rep. Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, negotiated had \u201clost all credibility.\u201d\n\nLast month, tea partyers slammed Mr. Boehner for giving in to Democrats\u2019 demands for an unconditional increase in the federal debt ceiling. Tea party Republicans refused to sign off on any deal. The speaker was forced to turn to Democrats for the votes to pass the borrowing increase that President Obama wanted.\n\nTea partyers now are looking to remove Mr. Boehner from the top House job.\n\nTea Party Patriots, led by CPAC speaker Jenny Beth Martin, started a \u201cFire the Speaker\u201d petition that has almost 93,000 signatures.\n\nThe Tea Party Leadership Fund announced last week that it is backing a high school teacher, J.D. Winteregg, against Mr. Boehner in Ohio\u2019s May 6 primary election.\n\nMike McKenna, a Republican Party strategist, said Mr. Boehner\u2019s opponents should be careful what they wish for.\n\n\u201cIn about two years, folks on the right are going to be complaining about whoever the next speaker is and remembering Boehner fondly,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cThey are angry at the world. For some reason, they have focused some of this anger at Boehner. I have no clue why.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker John A.
