It began with a simple idea to help patients



BEDFORD - Nick Vailas started Bedford Ambulatory Surgical Center with a half-dozen doctors and the idea that certain specialties and procedures could be done outside of a hospital.



BASC has expanded a great deal in 22 years, going from primarily an orthopedics-based practice to covering most anything that can be done on an outpatient basis. The latest addition is a diagnostics center, including a new MRI system that allows patients to be examined outside the tight confines commonly associated with the imaging procedure.

Opening in June



The imaging center is scheduled to open June 1 and is the latest development in BASC's 15-year partnership with Catholic Medical Center. Services will include low-radiation CAT scanning, ultrasound and the first "open" Magnetic Resonance Imaging machine in the Granite State, Vailas said.

..

The Hitachi Oasis is "boreless," which means it doesn't require the enclosed tunnel that MRI patients often dread.



"You don't even have to be claustrophobic. Just think of yourself being put into a tight fitting culvert," said Vailas, CEO and founder of BASC. "I've been in one, and for me it was intimidating. I can see why people get scared."

..

The technology allows imaging on patients of all sizes, from infants to obese adults, that may otherwise not be able to have an MRI. Vailas estimated the cost will be $600 to $700 for an MRI and that the price will be readily available to consumers who shop around before deciding where to go for the procedure.

..

Not a replacement



Dr. Joseph Pepe, CEO of CMC, said the Imaging Center in Bedford will not replace the existing services offered by the Diagnostic Imaging Department at the hospital on MacGregor Street. It's more of an expansion that allows the hospital and BASC to keep costs down by bringing the services to an off-campus location.

..

"Consumers want the freedom to choose. They want alternatives to hospital-based imaging for routine tests, and they want a more affordable option," Pepe said. "The imaging center will not be hospital based, which means it will be more affordable for patents that face high deductibles or large co-pays - which at this point in time seems to be everyone."

..

CMC also recently moved its Breast Care Center to Bedford Medical Park, the complex that is home to BASC headquarters and the building that is being remodeled for the Imaging Center.



"They'll have easy convenient access to catscan, radiology, ultrasound and breast surgery right across the street," Pepe said.

..

High overhead



Health care does not come cheap, nor does the overhead costs of running a large hospital like CMC.



"We knew there was value in providing (a) safe and cost effective, convenient environment for procedures that don't require hospitalization. The less intense environment helps reduce health care costs," Pepe said.

..

Advances in technology and medicine have vastly increased the number of procedures that can be done on an outpatient basis since Vailas opened BASC in 1993. His introduction came the year before during a conference on "ambulatory surgical centers."

..

"I didn't know anything about ambulatory surgery. The only time I've been in a surgical facility I was under anesthesia," he said. "There were less than 700 ambulatory surgical centers. Now there are over 7,000."

..

Many advances



Vailas said the outpatient clinics at that time were mostly for gastroenterology and ophthalmology with few focused on orthopedics. A former college football player, Vailas knew a thing or two about musculo-skeletal injuries and the advancements made in orthopedic treatment.

..

"You remember the old days of knee surgery? You got a railroad track (scar) up your leg. Now it's just a few holes, and that's it," he said. Orthopedics remains one of the top specialties at BASC. "We're doing total joints now," he said. "Even 10 years ago, if someone said to you 'We're doing total joints in an ambulatory surgical center' you would have thought they were a cowboy or crazy."

..

Always evolving



The health care industry continues to evolve, especially when it comes to how to pay for it. The days of making a co-payment, meeting a deductible and leaving the rest to the insurance company are in the past.

..

"Not long ago it was a blank check," Vailas said. "Now people are saying what's it going to cost me?"



Vailas said that means consumers have an opportunity to shop around, which he hopes will improve competition and bring down overall prices.

..

That's hardly a new economic theory, but Vailas said the lack of simple economic laws have been a huge part of a problem many have attempted to fix with little success.



While he is not a fan of the Affordable Care Act as it is written, Vailas credits the Obama administration for getting further on the issue than the many previous attempts to revamp health coverage.

..

"Whatever your political persuasion is, the Affordable Care Act forces us now to figure it out," Vailas said. "President Obama stopped kicking it down the road. Like it or not, one thing that's good about it is that it is forcing us to make tough decisions about how we want health care to be in this country going forward."
