Because that conservative and close-minded family of yours is about to hammer you at the Thanksgiving table over Obamacare, and it\u2019s going to be hard to hear \u2014 and we know how difficult hard things are for you to hear.\n\nBut chin up little camper! The machine you believe in has some talking points to toss around in response \u2014 with your trademark false intellectual snobbery and Kruschev-like, self-righteous table pounding \u2014 when grandpa starts in on what a wreck that new healthcare system has turned out to be. And, lucky for you, there\u2019s no thinking required at all. Just memorization and regurgitation. A common core of policy response, if you will. The Huffington Post makes it easier for you by including all those .gifs you like, and using some of your vernacular.\n\nEmily: GOP Governors are largely responsible for the struggling health care rollout in the first place. And Democrats are wimps, so that\u2019s not a surprise to anybody.\n\nThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s the Republicans fault\u2026and the Democrats? Not sure who Emily (read: you, little camper) is supposed to be representing at this point, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get talking points on that around Christmas. Never mind that talk of \u201csubsidies for all!\u201d and \u201cObamacare pays for itself, you hateful racist!\u201d isn\u2019t supported by any fact. As Allahpundit notes:\n\nThey might be eligible for a subsidy, but then again they might not. And their subsidy might be illegal depending upon where they buy the plan: If they get it from Healthcare.gov or directly from an insurer, the rug could be pulled out from under them next year. Buying one of the cheaper \u201cbronze\u201d plans on the exchanges will help cut their cost, but they need to be careful and read the fine print. The bronze plans are the ones with the highest deductibles and the smallest provider networks. They might be better off with silver or even gold, if they can afford it. At around this point, someone at the table\u2019s going to pipe up and say, \u201cBut why are they so expensive?\u201d That\u2019s when the real fun begins.\n\nActually, I think that last bit explains why OFA is doing this, as creepy as it seems. They know ObamaCare\u2019s going to come up at a lot of dinner tables this year and they know that most of what\u2019s said won\u2019t be happy. The talking-points memo isn\u2019t meant to be followed to the letter \u2014 I hope \u2014 it\u2019s just a way of nudging liberals to encourage people to reserve judgment when the subject does come up.\n\nAt some point, if you do your job well, people will sign up in spite of themselves and Obamacare will be self-sufficient, right? Wait, it doesn\u2019t matter if that\u2019s right. That\u2019s what you should say.\n\nRemember: we\u2019ve always been at war with Eastasia, Winston.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "groupthink,Health Insurance,hope and change,Huffington Post,ObamaCare,OFA,Subsidies,talking points,Thanksgiving,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "Thanksgiving and Obamacare It&#8217;s tough being a smarty-pants, know-it-all, dismissive-of-logic-in-favor-of-groupthink, 25-35 year old true believer in Hope and Change this holiday season.
