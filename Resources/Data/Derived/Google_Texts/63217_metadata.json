Robert Bentley and the state Legislature for not expanding Medicaid and infringing upon the voting rights of African Americans by closing 31 driver\u2019s license offices.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed your state government did not expand Medicaid,\u201d Clinton said in a packed ballroom of the Wynfrey Hotel in Hoover. \u201cA lot of folks in this state would have been better off if the governor had, at no cost to the state additionally, but he put ideology ahead of the well-being of the folks he represents.\u201d\n\nAs for the closing of driver\u2019s license offices in predominantly African-American counties, Clinton called it a \u201cblast from the Jim Crow past.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in Alabama, without the right kind of ID, it\u2019s nearly impossible to vote,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI followed when Governor Bentley and his administration closed 31 driver\u2019s license offices across the state. They include every county where African Americans make up 75% of the voters. The closings will make getting license and personal identification cards much harder for many African Americans, particularly the elderly, erecting a big barrier to voting.\u201d\n\nClinton pointed out that Alabama is one of 17 states not offering early voting. If elected, the former U.S. secretary of state said she would work to restore the Voting Rights Act in its entirety, enact a 20-day period of early in-person voting for all states, and have voters register automatically once they turn 18 years old.\n\n\u201cIf a law is working, we should let it keep working,\u201d Clinton said of the changes made to the Voting Rights Act by the U.S. Supreme Court. \u201cWe have to defend the most fundamental right in our democracy: the right to vote. No one in this state should ever forget the history that enabled generations of people left out and left behind to be able to vote.\u201d\n\nRegarding education, Clinton said she has a plan to get students to college without borrowing money. She also said she had a plan to increase funding for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during the Alabama Semi-Annual Democratic Conference on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015, at the Hyatt Regency Wynfrey Hotel in Hoover, Ala (Photo: Albert Cesare / Advertiser)\n\n\u201cHBCUs have done an amazing job of educating generations of African-American students, but they are scrambling for resources,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cMy new college compact has a special fund set aside to help HBCUs.\u201d\n\nOf course, Clinton is not running for office in Alabama and addressed some national platforms as well.\n\nShe reaffirmed her support of the Affordable Care Act and outlined plans to raise income, raise minimum wage, lower the cost of prescription drugs, help small businesses get started, and keep communities safe from gun violence.\n\nShe also wants to rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure and focus on the renewable energy industry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what Republicans have against building roads, bridges and airports, and fixing our railroad system, and expanding broadband so we can be more competitive economically,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe can create millions of new job by transitioning to clean renewable energy.\u201d\n\nClinton even went so far as to say that the economy is best when \u201ca Democrat is in the White House.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1ROLeWs", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Clinton spoke at length about the problems plaguing the state of Alabama.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Clinton spoke at length about the problems plaguing the state of Alabama.", "title": "Clinton jabs GOP on voting rights, Medicaid in Alabama", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/17/clinton-jabs-gop-voting-rights-medicaid-alabama/74141538/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinton spoke at length about the problems plaguing the state of Alabama.", "title": "Clinton jabs GOP on voting rights, Medicaid in Alabama", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03f3e28667a162bf61b3fe1129bae6dce8c2ae99/c=0-83-1902-1985&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/17/Montgomery/Montgomery/635806916030409615-101715HillaryClinton07.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Colleges and universities", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Places/Colleges and universities", "title": "Clinton jabs GOP on voting rights, Medicaid in Alabama", "author": "Andrew J.
