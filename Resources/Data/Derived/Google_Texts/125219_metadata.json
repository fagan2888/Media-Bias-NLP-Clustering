Fred Upton, R-Mich., called the \u201cKeep Your Health Plan Act,\u201d allowing insurance companies to continue offering plans that don\u2019t meet ObamaCare's standards.\n\nThirty-nine Democrats joined in voting for the bill and Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor, said that without the president\u2019s concession Thursday, that number would have been exponentially higher.\n\n\u201cIf he hadn't done that, shift the blame without really changing what happens on the ground, who gets this policy or not, there would have been 100 Democrats, or 120. That would have been a huge embarrassment,\" Krauthammer said.\n\n\u201cThat's why he had to do the press conference because that would have been a rebellion against him and he would lose as a second term president complete control of the party, and been a lame duck less than a year into the second term. So, I would say the 40 is a substantial number.\u201d\n\nKrauthammer also told viewers that the problem now lies with Democrats in the Senate, particularly vulnerable incumbents facing re-election next year:\n\n\u201cThe ones who are really in trouble and who need a bill so they can have a vote on the record that says 'I voted to maintain the plans.\u2019 If they don't, their opponent in the election next year are going to play over and over and over their own statements, the Democrats statements, 'if you like your plan you can keep it' and they will all lose.\u201d", "article_metadata":
