Jabil makes products for technology companies like Apple Inc., which accounted for 24% of its revenue last year.\n\nGuess on Wednesday warned it would swing to a first-quarter loss as it lays off workers as part of a broader cost-cutting effort following a steeper-than-projected profit decline during the holiday quarter.\n\nMichaels said profit rose 17% in the latest quarter as sales easily topped forecasts, though the company warned its business would continue to battle unfavorable exchange rates and a weakened Canadian dollar.\n\nRofin-Sinar Technologies, a laser-products company contending with a harsh proxy fight, has struck a $942 million deal to be bought by Coherent.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma on Wednesday gave downbeat projections for the current quarter and year following disappointing results in the holiday quarter, weighed down by a comparable-sales decline at its Pottery Barn brand.\n\nHerman Miller third-quarter profit rose 33%, as the office-furniture company reported continued progress in its North American business.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Among the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Thursday's session are Caterpillar, FedEx and Jabil Circuit.", "title": "Stocks to Watch: Caterpillar, FedEx, Jabil Circuit, Guess, Michaels", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/03/17/stocks-to-watch-caterpillar-fedex-jabil-circuit-guess-michaels/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MU623_CATRUC_P_20160226163205.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Stocks to Watch: Caterpillar, FedEx, Jabil Circuit, Guess, Michaels", "description": "Among the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Thursday's session are Caterpillar, FedEx and Jabil Circuit.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Jenny Roth and Maria Armental", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Among the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Thursday's session are Caterpillar, FedEx and Jabil Circuit.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-03-17T13:13:55-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/03/17/stocks-to-watch-caterpillar-fedex-jabil-circuit-guess-michaels/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-47484", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Among the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Thursday's session are Caterpillar, FedEx and Jabil Circuit.", "title": "Stocks to Watch: Caterpillar, FedEx, Jabil Circuit, Guess, Michaels", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/03/17/stocks-to-watch-caterpillar-fedex-jabil-circuit-guess-michaels/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MU623_CATRUC_P_20160226163205.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-47484", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-03-17T13:14:34-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The comments came as FedEx reported a 19% third-quarter profit decline largely due to legal settlements regarding its former independent contractor-driver model at its ground segment.\nENLARGE Photo: Daniel Acker/BloombergAmong the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Thursday\u2019s session are Caterpillar, FedEx and Jabil Circuit.\nHerman Miller third-quarter profit rose 33%, as the office-furniture company reported continued progress in its North American business.\nCaterpillar offered a downbeat revenue and profit forecast for its first quarter, though it backed its full-year guidance, as the company continues to see its business challenged by falling demand.\nMichaels said profit rose 17% in the latest quarter as sales easily topped forecasts, though the company warned its business would continue to battle unfavorable exchange rates and a weakened Canadian dollar."}
