On Friday evening’s edition of “Real Time with Bill Maher,” Maher found a way to compare the Baltimore’s riots with what is, in Maher’s eyes, the true number one evil: the Catholic Church.

“I don’t understand why the police are infallible,” he said. “They remind me a lot of the Catholic Church. Well they do. Here’s the stat: They were sued, the police, the Baltimore police, I think 317 suits, they paid about $5.7 million since 2011. This does remind me of the Catholic Church and in the Catholic Church of course not every priest is a pedophile but the institution covered up for the pedophiles.”
