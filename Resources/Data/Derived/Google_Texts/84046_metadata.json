But the kidnappers were not bent on harming the boy; they were, in fact, his concerned parents, Brett and Naghmeh King, who say that they took him from the hospital in a last-ditch attempt to pursue what they believe is a promising alternative treatment for his brain tumor. Proton-beam therapy is relatively new and not offered at Southampton General Hospital, and the doctors there reportedly questioned its healing potential in Ashya\u2019s case.\n\nTheir action set off an international manhunt for the King family, resulting in the arrest of Ashya\u2019s parents in Spain. Brett and Naghmeh were forced to spend two days in a Spanish prison, separated from their dangerously ill son. After international outrage erupted, the Crown Protective Services (CPS) quickly backtracked and dropped their controversial arrest warrant.\n\nIn the United States, cases similar to Ashya\u2019s have been popping up with worrisome regularity. Consider, for instance, the Justina Pelletier saga that came to a close earlier this summer. The Boston Globe reported in late 2013 that Justina\u2019s story was one of five similar cases involving Boston Children\u2019s Hospital over the last two years. Medically based custody cases occur at other hospitals around the United States as well. Parents are growing wary of the medical community\u2019s intrusion into their private decisions regarding various reasonable treatments.\n\nSome on the right have also voiced concern that such abuses on the part of the medical community will only become more common as the United States shifts toward a more centralized medical system under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The U.K. operates under a similar public health-care system, run by the National Health Service (NHS). It was an NHS panel \u2014 not unlike the much-derided \u201cdeath panels\u201d here in the United States \u2014 that made the decision to refuse the request of Ashya\u2019s for the proton-beam-therapy, forcing his parents to consider options abroad while they struggled to figure out how to pay for the treatments.\n\nEven Prime Minister David Cameron expressed concern about the response of the medical community and the CPS. In a tweet, he welcomed \u201cthe prosecution against #AshyaKing\u2019s parents being dropped. It\u2019s important this little boy gets treatment & the love of his family.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, Sarah Wollaston MP, chairman of the parliamentary health select committee in the United Kingdom, commented: \u201cAnyone looking at this case would feel that the top priority has to be to reunite a frightened little boy with his parents.\u201d She continued: \u201cIt cannot be right to criminalise these parents in the way that has seen them handcuffed.\u201d\n\nBut there are still concerns that the public is not hearing both sides of the story fairly. Owing to confidentiality regulations, Southampton General Hospital may not be able to respond adequately to the allegations being hurled at them by the public and the media.\n\nDr. Douglas Diekema, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, explains to National Review Online: \u201cIf parents attempt to remove a child from the hospital, and in doing so deprive the child of important treatments, that might justify attempts to bring the child back. For example, if the child was dependent on tube feedings and the parents had not been trained to care for the lines and provide the feedings outside of the hospital, the hospital would have grounds for calling police to have the child returned until they could assure that the child would not come to significant harm by being discharged.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a video posted shortly before his arrest, Brett King pointed out that Ashya was being attentively cared for by his family. \u201cYou can see my son is not neglected, he\u2019s doing very well,\u201d he commented, pleading with the United Kingdom to call off the search. \u201cWe just want the best medical treatment,\u201d he explained.\n\nAll currently available evidence points to Ashya\u2019s parents\u2019 exemplary intentions in removing Ashya from Southampton General Hospital. In his video, Brett King expressed concern that Ashya had just \u201cbeen processed\u201d by the NHS and the medical community, without adequate concern for his personal situation.\n\nStories like the Kings\u2019 should cause concern among citizens of the United States and warn us of the potential harm of increasing government involvement in personal medical decisions. Different cases will have different facts, but when the first impulse of a hospital administration when parents remove a child is to call the cops, that should tell us something about the arrogance of power that results from government domination of health care.\n\n\u2014 Caroline Craddock is an Agostinelli Fellow and research intern at National Review.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Fri, 2014-09-05 04:00", "sailthru.author": "Caroline Craddock", "description": "Last Thursday, five-year-old Ashya King was kidnapped from his hospital room at Southampton General Hospital in the United Kingdom.
