An e-mail from a mathematics faculty member to his grad instructors explaining why he was crossing the picket line and why they should too went viral. For the prof, named Alexander Coward, also saw reason to protest: to dissent against the silly notion of solidarity in the first place. Ad Policy\n\nHe wrote: \u201cWhatever the alleged injustices are that are being protested about tomorrow, it is clear that you are not responsible for those things, whatever they are, and I do not think you should be denied an education because of someone else\u2019s fight that you are not responsible for.\u201d\n\nSo what are they responsible for?\n\nYou need to optimize your life for learning. You need to live and breath [sic] your education. You need to be *obsessed* [sic] with your education. Society is investing in you so that you can help solve the many challenges we are going to face in the coming decades, from profound technological challenges to helping people with the age old search for human happiness and meaning. That is why I am not canceling class tomorrow. Your education is really really important, not just to you, but in a far broader and wider reaching way than I think any of you have yet to fully appreciate.\n\nSociety, and one\u2019s education, apparently have nothing to do with issues of decent wages and working conditions and keeping higher education affordable and its institutions accountable. Good to know.\n\nThere is something about the very grown-up action of sacrifice for the sake of solidarity that turns some professors into patronizing asses. For Professor Coward also wrote, \u201cAll this may sound like speaking in platitudes. However it is a point worth making to all of you because you are so young. One of the nice things about being young is that your thinking can be very clear and your mind not so cluttered up with memories and experiences. This clarity can give you a lot of conviction, but it can also lead you astray because you might not yet appreciate just how complicated the world is.\u201d According to his CV, Coward was born in 1981. That makes him a grizzled thirty-one or thirty-two years of age.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/grad_students_union_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Rick Perlstein", "description": "Professors just don't get why graduate students deserve labor unions, revealing a dangerous myopia about how academia works in the age of austerity.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Professors just don't get why graduate students deserve labor unions, revealing a dangerous myopia about how academia works in the age of austerity.", "title": "Professors to Grad Students: Focus on Studies, Not Wages", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/professors-grad-students-focus-studies-not-wages/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/grad_students_union_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T05:53:43+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Professors just don't get why graduate students deserve labor unions, revealing a dangerous myopia about how academia works in the age of austerity.", "title": "Professors to Grad Students: Focus on Studies, Not Wages", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/professors-grad-students-focus-studies-not-wages/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/grad_students_union_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/grad_students_union_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "December 4th, 2013", "sailthru.title": "Professors to Grad Students: Focus on Studies, Not Wages", "keywords": "Labor unions, Graduate students, Adjunct professors, Alexander Coward, Margaret Mary Vojtko, Rick Perlstein, The Nation", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 109276, "sailthru.tags": "Activism,Higher Education,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "The Nation", "published_time": "2013-12-04T20:12:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T05:53:43+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "Professors just don\u2019t get why graduate students deserve labor unions, revealing a dangerous myopia about how academia works in the age of austerity.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/grad_students_union_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20f8\"", "article_summary": "There is something about the very grown-up action of sacrifice for the sake of solidarity that turns some professors into patronizing asses.\nAn e-mail from a mathematics faculty member to his grad instructors explaining why he was crossing the picket line and why they should too went viral.\nFor the prof, named Alexander Coward, also saw reason to protest: to dissent against the silly notion of solidarity in the first place.\nSociety, and one\u2019s education, apparently have nothing to do with issues of decent wages and working conditions and keeping higher education affordable and its institutions accountable.\nFor Professor Coward also wrote, \u201cAll this may sound like speaking in platitudes."}
