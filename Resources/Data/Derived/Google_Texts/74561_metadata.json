I said 'Oh my God, he's not going to stop,'\u201d she said. \u201cThe dad tried to pull the daughter out of the way.\u201d\n\nThe Mustang struck the stroller.\n\n\u201cWe saw the car pushing the stroller and it was going under the car. We saw bits of the stroller flying through the air,\u201d she said, adding her husband has first aid training, so they immediately did what they could to help.\n\nCarolyn said at first the little girl was limp and lying on the pavement, but then she began to cry, \u201cwhich was a very good thing.\u201d\n\nA puppy that was also struck was alive, but bleeding from the mouth Carolyn said.\n\nCarolyn was shocked at the behaviour of the driver.\n\n\u201cThe driver was out of it. He was not rational. The elderly driver didn't even seem to know what happened,\u201d she said, adding the father of the child was irate with the elderly driver who wandered around the scene seemingly without comprehension he had struck the child.\n\nUnderstandably, Carolyn and her husband were rattled by what they had just witnessed and have a warning for everyone to check for traffic before stepping out into a crosswalk even if the lights are activated.\n\nShe also has concerns over the competence of some elderly drivers.\n\nA three-year-old girl was rushed to Kelowna General Hospital Sunday afternoon after being thrown from her stroller when she was struck by an elderly driver.\n\nAccording to police on the scene, a mother who is eight months pregnant was pushing her three-year-old daughter in a stroller across Bernard Avenue at Richmond Street, with her husband and dog.\n\nDespite the fact they were in a marked and signalled crosswalk, the stroller was struck by an elderly male driver in a Mustang.\n\nPolice say the man didn't appear to see them and drove right into them. Witnesses say the man was driving slowly, approximately 30 km/h, but did not slow down.\n\nThe stroller was thrown in the air and the child ended up several feet away. She was rushed to hospital, where she is in stable condition. She is believed to have suffered from bruises, abrasions and possible broken bones.\n\nWhile the parents were not hit, the mother was taken to hospital to be checked over as she is pregnant and was under extreme stress.\n\nThe dog was also reportedly injured in the incident, but its condition is unknown.\n\nThe elderly man's car is set to be towed away. Police say they will be recommending charges and he may lose his licence.\n\nBernard Avenue was closed off by police for just over an hour Sunday afternoon.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/142644/Child-thrown-from-stroller", "image": "http://www.castanet.net/content/2015/6/unnamed-6_p3057365.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "UPDATE 7:10 p.m. A witness has come forward with a harrowing first-hand account of an accident that sent a three-year-old girl to hospital Sunday afternoon.", "title": "Child thrown from stroller - Kelowna News"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Castanet.net"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1495581714056366}, "twitter": {"site": "@CastanetNews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "UPDATE 7:10 p.m. A witness has come forward with a harrowing first-hand account of an accident that sent a three-year-old girl to hospital Sunday afternoon."}, "article_summary": "A three-year-old girl was rushed to Kelowna General Hospital Sunday afternoon after being thrown from her stroller when she was struck by an elderly driver.\nThe elderly driver didn't even seem to know what happened,\u201d she said, adding the father of the child was irate with the elderly driver who wandered around the scene seemingly without comprehension he had struck the child.\nThe stroller was thrown in the air and the child ended up several feet away.\nThe elderly driver of the Mustang got Carolyn's attention well before the accident happened.\nDespite the fact they were in a marked and signalled crosswalk, the stroller was struck by an elderly male driver in a Mustang."}
