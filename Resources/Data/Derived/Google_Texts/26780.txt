The Kansas Highway Patrol says the weather is to blame for several crashes on Interstate 235 in Wichita.

Both crashes happened around 12 p.m. Sunday as light sleet began to build up on bridges and overpasses. At I-235 and Meridian, a Ford pickup was heading north when its 20-year-old driver lost control on the ice and hit a light pole.

Minutes later at I-235 and West Street, a 17-year-old was driving south when her car veered off the road and rolled down an embankment.

Both drivers were hospitalized with minor injuries.

"With the weather the way it is, people just need to slow down and be cognizant of the fact that the roads are going to ice over and be very slippery," Tauer said. "Even though they don't have snow or anything on them, they're always going to be slick, especially on the overpasses, the bridges, on-ramps and off-ramps."

Several more accidents were reported in the area early Sunday afternoon. No one was seriously hurt.
