Many Ohio labor union officers and employees make big bucks taking money from workers’ paychecks.

A total of 413 union leaders in the state were paid more than $100,000 in 2013, based on annual reports to the U.S. Department of Labor.

Of those 413 union officers and employees, 75 were paid at least $150,000 — 25 more than the previous year — and there were 16 paid more than $200,000.

Topping the statewide list were the bosses of United Food & Commercial Workers Local 75 in Dayton. UFCW 75 paid secretary treasurer Steve Culter $355,400, and president Lennie Wyatt $328,116.

UFCW’s motto is “A voice for working America.”

Laborers International Union of North America Local 860 in Cleveland paid secretary-treasurer/business manager Anthony Liberatore $314,245.

“It might strike rank and file union members as more than a little hypocritical that leaders tasked with benefiting the working person often seem to be raking in the kind of big bucks for which those same leaders attack private business owners and executives,” Greg Lawson, a policy analyst for the free market Buckeye Institute, told Watchdog.org.

“This is doubly true for those in the public sector where those salaries are ultimately supported through union dues obtained from salaries paid for by taxpayers,” Lawson added.

Parry Norris, the 50th-highest-paid union officer or employee in Ohio last year, received $160,726 as an Ohio Education Association regional director. Of Ohio’s 50 highest-paid union officials, 19 worked for OEA.

Because Ohio is a forced unionism state — as are the other 25 U.S. states without right-to-work laws — unions can take mandatory “fair share” fees from workers as a condition of employment. Those fees help pay union bosses’ six-figure salaries.

Ohio labor union officers and employees in both the public and private sectors benefited from this policy last year, as the following list shows.
