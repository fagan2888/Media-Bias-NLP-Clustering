Hot Springs, SD

A Hot Springs man convicted of raping a bridesmaid on his wedding night has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison.



Fall River County State's Attorney Jim Sword says a jury in January found Cleve Janis Jr. guilty of third-degree rape.



Sword says Janis was married in August of 2013. After the ceremony, the wedding party went to a local Hot Springs bar. Sword says Janis later found the victim sleeping at his home and raped her.



The victim testified against Janis and the incident was investigated by the state Division of Criminal Investigation.



Sword argued for a 25-year sentence since Janis has "never taken responsibility."



He was eventually sentenced to 15 years with 7 ½ years suspended. He must register as a sex offender.
