A-list celebrities are joining the latest push to get Americans educated and enrolled in Obamacare.

The "Tell a Friend -- Get Covered" campaign is teaming up with YouTube to produce a live, six-hour variety show on Thursday, with content from Funny or Die, skits and educational segments meant to inform viewers of their affordable health care options.

The campaign has already confirmed Jennifer Hudson, Olivia Wilde and Elizabeth Banks for appearances in viral videos that will air during the event. A video featuring "Whose Line Is It Anyway" host Aisha Tyler was released Tuesday as part of the campaign to encourage young people to sign up for health care.

The marathon event comes after a Monday enrollment report revealed that young, healthy Americans are seeking coverage at a much lower rate than President Barack Obama's administration initially projected. According to the report, less than a quarter of the 2.2 million Americans enrolled in Obamacare are between the ages of 18 and 34; the administration expected 38 percent of enrollees to be within that age range.

CORRECTION: This post has been updated to note the event on Thursday is six hours, not eight. Language has also been added to indicate that some of the celebrities will not appear in person.
