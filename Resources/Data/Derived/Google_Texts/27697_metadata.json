They actually made us do work while they helped us. They put the information together for us, but we had homework every time we talked with these guys,\" Leidinger said. \"It made us think about things. It kind of tied all of our thinking together to drive it in one direction.\"\n\nNow, UW Extension's Mark Lange is hoping to make growth-minded business expertise available to many more Wisconsin companies.\n\nWith the help of a $50,000 grant from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Lange plans to create and train \"business intelligence teams\" \u2014 small groups of experts who eventually could work with more than 100 state companies a year.\n\nLange noticed that, while there are various efforts to help new companies get started and to lure larger firms to the state, lots of local companies in Wisconsin could grow \u2014 and add jobs as a result \u2014 if only someone would provide planning help that they couldn't afford or were too busy to seek.\n\nSo-called second-stage companies \u2014 those that have moved beyond the survival stage and have 10 to 99 employees \u2014 are the target of UW Extension's new program.\n\n\"Their CEOs, as intelligent as they are, don't recognize the kinds of things they should be doing to grow their business,\" said Lange, who is executive director of the UW Extension's Division for Business and Entrepreneurship.\n\n\"They are busy working inside of it. So all of a sudden with this, they are spending some time talking with someone else about strategy, and they create a whole other way of how they think about their company.\"\n\nThe business intelligence teams include experts in market research, web marketing and geographic information systems.\n\nThe companies involved receive 30 to 40 hours of assistance from the experts, all of it online or via telephone or teleconferences.\n\nThrough the program, companies can learn to focus on and coordinate growth and marketing efforts, and end up with \u2014 as Mathison did in the pilot \u2014 a strong list of potential customers to call on as they expand.\n\nCompanies also will receive recommendations for improving the marketing capabilities of their website and connecting with customers through social media.\n\nIn the pilot program last year, which included Urethane Systems Plus Inc. and Bliffert Lumber & Hardware as well at Mathison Manufacturing, the company leaders worked with a regular team of experts drawn together by Lange from other states.\n\nLange wants to form new teams, each consisting of four members \u2014 a leader, a market research specialist, an expert on finding and mapping prospective customers, and a web and social media expert \u2014 who will be dedicated to expanding existing businesses in Wisconsin.\n\nThe experts will come from consulting companies in Wisconsin and, after training and certification, be paid roughly $100 an hour for their services, with that money generally coming from local economic development organizations that want to assist companies in their communities.\n\nThe $50,000 grant from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. will launch UW Extension's Business Intelligence Center. The money will be used to train the teams of experts who will work with state companies, Lange said.\n\nJason Scott, community development director for WEDC, said UW Extension's new program shares some economic development objectives with his agency.\n\n\"We're going to partner with them when possible,\" Scott said. \"We are going to work with them to identify individuals who will be used to train the second-stage companies. We'll also be helping to identify second-stage companies that will be able to use the services provided by the team.\"\n\nSeveral other states have programs to help existing companies grow, often called \"economic gardening.\"\n\nIn the Milwaukee area, Scale Up Milwaukee, an effort organized by the Greater Milwaukee Committee to spur business growth, has some goals similar to UW Extension's Business Intelligence Center.\n\nLange said he supports Scale Up Milwaukee's work and there may be things the two initiatives can do together.\n\nBut he said the UW Extension program expects to work with more companies around the state in faster fashion.\n\n\"What we're saying is, if we build this program up, we are going to be working with hundreds of companies over time in really quick, short bursts that get them the information they need,\" Lange said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "UW Extension program to create 'business intelligence teams'", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/uw-extension-program-to-create-business-intelligence-teams-b99486852z1-301316331.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "With the help of a $50,000 grant from the WEDC, the UW Extension plans to create and train business experts who eventually could work with more than 100 state companies a year.", "title": "UW Extension program to create 'business intelligence teams'"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "With the help of a $50,000 grant from the WEDC, the UW Extension plans to create and train business experts who eventually could work with more than 100 state companies a year.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary", "title": "UW Extension program to create 'business intelligence teams'"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb471\"", "article_summary": "In the Milwaukee area, Scale Up Milwaukee, an effort organized by the Greater Milwaukee Committee to spur business growth, has some goals similar to UW Extension's Business Intelligence Center.\nThe $50,000 grant from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. will launch UW Extension's Business Intelligence Center.\nJason Scott, community development director for WEDC, said UW Extension's new program shares some economic development objectives with his agency.\nNow, UW Extension's Mark Lange is hoping to make growth-minded business expertise available to many more Wisconsin companies.\nBut he said the UW Extension program expects to work with more companies around the state in faster fashion."}
