But there\u2019s time for the numbers to improve, Greenberg said.\n\n\u201cThe reason why Democrats are in play is that they\u2019ve successfully changed the issues on why people are voting,\u201d Greenberg said.\n\nViews of the Affordable Care Act are improving slightly from an earlier poll in July.\n\nAnd while the president's approval rating remains poor, his approval among Democrats has rebounded in Greenberg's polling.\n\nOn issues like the ACA, the poll indicated that there is a lot of variance on why people disapprove of the legislation, including some who think that the bill should go further than it does.\n\nThe poll, however, also found that voters in the battleground states are in a \"dark\" mood: 70 percent of those responding in both July and the new poll said the country is on the wrong track.\n\nThe battleground states included Arkansas, Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina and West Virginia.
