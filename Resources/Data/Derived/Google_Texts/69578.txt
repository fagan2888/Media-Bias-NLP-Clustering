Thomas Aquinas College has planned a day of fasting and prayer when the Supreme Court hears its case involving birth control coverage.

The small Catholic college in Santa Paula has argued that it should not have to include birth control in its insurance coverage because to do so would violate its religious beliefs.

The case, Zubik v. Burwell, has now reached the Supreme Court, and justices are expected to hear it starting at 10 a.m. March 23. Thomas Aquinas is one of 35 plaintiffs in the case.

The federal Affordable Care Act requires employers to offer health insurance that covers birth control services, including contraception, sterilization and medications such as the "morning after" pill. Institutions that don't comply face a penalty that the college says could cost them up to $3 million a year.

Thomas Aquinas says the mandate violates its religious freedom. The government counters that the college and other objectors could use a system that provides coverage through a third party without them paying directly for it.
