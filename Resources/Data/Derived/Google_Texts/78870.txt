Navy to open elite SEAL teams to women

The Navy is planning to open its elite SEAL teams to women candidates who can pass a famously tough six-month training course, Adm. Jon Greenert, chief of naval operations, said Tuesday. "Why shouldn't anybody who can meet these (standards) be accepted? And the answer is, there is no reason," Greenert said in an exclusive interview with Navy Times' sister publication Defense News. Two female soldiers on Friday will become the first women to graduate from the Army's elite Ranger School.
