Chris Christie\u2019s proposed 2015-2016 budget. Administration officials say there\u2019s a good reason for the cuts: the Affordable Care Act has dramatically reduced the ranks of the uninsured. But hospitals contend that it\u2019s too soon to know how much they\u2019ll be getting from the ACA or if that money will offset the proposed reductions.\n\nChristie cut charity-care funding by $148 million -- or 22.8 percent -- from $650 million to $502 million.\n\n\u201cWhile we recognize the immense financial challenges that are facing New Jersey, access to healthcare for the poor and vulnerable should be an important priority,\u201d said Sister Patricia Codey, president of the Catholic HealthCare Partnership of New Jersey. Her organization includes the state\u2019s Catholic hospitals.\n\n\u201cThose most in need should not be sacrificed for balancing the budget,\u201d she said, adding that the proposed cuts will be \u201cdevastating to our hospitals and ultimately to our patients.\u201d\n\nThe administration argues that the shortfall will be partially offset by a $45 million proposed increase in the amount that doctors are reimbursed through New Jersey FamilyCare, the state\u2019s main Medicaid program. State officials said that many formerly uninsured patients are now covered by FamilyCare, under the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a dramatic reduction in documented charity-care claims,\u201d at the same time the number of residents covered by FamilyCare rose 1.28 million to 1.67 million, state Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said, defending the cuts But advocates for \u201csafety-net\u201d hospitals said the cuts were too soon and needed further analysis. The hospitals, they argued, may not be able to provide the current level of service without substantial charity-care payments.\n\nStill, the ACA and Medicaid expansion help the state budget in a variety of ways, such as providing 100 percent federal funding for some people whose Medicaid costs were previously shared by the state and the feds. The state is projected to save $416.9 million from this in the coming fiscal year, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.\n\nThat helped lower the overall proposed increase in the state\u2019s Department of Human Services budget to 0.8 percent, from $6.69 billion to $6.74 billion. When federal spending is included, DHS is the largest single line in the state\u2019s budget.\n\nThe proposed spending plan also includes a $27 million increase in the Department of Health budget, from $369 million to $396 million.\n\nGroups representing hospitals that serve the largest share of uninsured resident and Medicaid recipients \u2013 known informally as \u201csafety-net\u201d hospitals -- expressed concern about how the charity-care cut will affect them. Hospital representatives argued that it\u2019s not yet clear how the influx of Medicaid recipients -- when combined with a significant number of residents who remain uninsured -- will impact them financially.\n\nJersey City Medical Center President and CEO Joseph F. Scott said it\u2019s important that the state concentrates the remaining charity-care aid on the safety-net hospitals.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very difficult for us to see that kind of cut for a hospital that has 49 percent charity and Medicaid,\u201d Scott said of his hospital. \u201cAll of a sudden, we\u2019re depending on Medicaid (which) doesn\u2019t fully cover our costs, and at the same time you\u2019re going to cut charity care, and I\u2019m still seeing charity care\u201d patients at the hospital.\n\nScott is chairman of the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, an association of urban hospitals. Alliance President and CEO Suzanne Ianni said that patients who are newly covered by Medicaid will use healthcare services more, but with the low Medicaid reimbursement rate, hospitals would lose money.\n\nIanni pointed out that Jersey City Medical Center \u201creceived additional payments, but the payments did not offset the additional cost.\u201d She continued, \u201cin essence, Medicaid expansion cost Jersey City Medical Center $10 million more.\u201d\n\nShe noted an estimated that Jersey City Medical Center in 2014 \u2013 the first year of the Medicaid expansion -- had a $10 million larger shortfall between the cost of providing care to low-income patients and the amount they received than it did in 2013.\n\nRichard A. Pitman, executive director of the Fair Share Hospitals Collaborative, said hospitals had been hearing rumors that the charity-care cut would be twice as large as Christie proposed. His organization represents 26 hospitals that serve areas with fewer low-income patients than those in Ianni\u2019s organization.\n\nHe said a cut would be worrying, adding of the administration\u2019s position: \u201cI think there\u2019s no question as to whether Medicaid has increased, so their position is not illogical.\u201d\n\nAssemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. (D-Burlington) said, \u201con the one hand, I imagine the hospital systems are breathing a little bit of a sigh of relief,\u201d that the proposed cut wasn\u2019t larger. But he emphasized that the Legislature would be looking closely at whether the institutions could withstand the cut.\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing that very large cuts will imperil a number of hospitals \u2013 basically, drive them out of business, endanger jobs and communities, and we have seen that when the state hasn\u2019t been as supportive as it ought of hospitals, that we have lost hospitals,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Jersey Hospital Association President and CEO Betsy Ryan also said the budget proposal needs more analysis, but appreciated areas where Christie increased aid..\n\nThat includes a significant boost in the amount of money that will go to graduate medical education funding, which would add $27.3 million to the $100 million in the current budget.\n\n\u201cWe certainly are very appreciative of his additional support for graduate medical education,\u201d said Deborah Briggs, president and CEO of the New Jersey Council of Teaching Hospitals. She also said that more information is needed to understand the total effect of the budget proposal on hospitals.\n\nAside from the hospital aid, the proposed budget includes $2.3 million to create a single point of entry for addiction services, with Rutgers Behavioral Health Care tabbed for a management contract to help uninsured or FamilyCare patients with addictions access services anywhere in the state.\n\nChristie also included $8.5 million more to expand the drug-court program, in which nonviolent offenders with addictions undergo mandatory drug treatment instead of jail time, to Bergen, Burlington, and Monmouth counties. It\u2019s already in nine other counties: Atlantic, Cape May, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Warren.\n\nThe spending plan also includes $72.5 million in new state and federal money for residents with developmental disabilities to live in community group homes. This effort has been supplemented by the funds from the closing of two developmental centers, which has raised protests from family members of residents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare is helping state with budget problems, but hospitals worry the cuts will leave people in need.", "og": {"site_name": "WNYC", "description": "Obamacare is helping state with budget problems, but hospitals worry the cuts will leave people in need.", "title": "Christie's Budget Cuts $148M from Hospital Charity Care", "url": "http://www.wnyc.org/story/christies-budget-cuts-148m-hospital-charity-care/?utm_source=sharedUrl&utm_medium=metatag&utm_campaign=sharedUrl", "image": "https://media.wnyc.org/media/img/wnyc/logo_wnyc.gif", "type": "article"}, "is_article": "True", "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 470219771, "googleplay": "org.wnyc.android"}}, "site": "@WNYC", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=470219771", "fb": {"app_id": 151261804904925}, "keywords": "npr, new york, WNYC, arts, culture, news, public, radio", "overhaul/config/environment": "%7B%22wnycURL%22%3A%20%22http%3A//www.wnyc.org%22%2C%20%22googleAPIv3Key%22%3A%20%22AIzaSyCDbxxvbl0Zj6af28IfWjJ-S0SKxwDXnkc%22%2C%20%22renderGoogleAds%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22modulePrefix%22%3A%20%22overhaul%22%2C%20%22ember-metrics%22%3A%20%7B%22includeAdapters%22%3A%20%5B%22google-analytics%22%2C%20%22data-warehouse%22%5D%7D%2C%20%22something%22%3A%20%22test%22%2C%20%22metricsAdapters%22%3A%20%5B%5D%2C%20%22contentSecurityPolicy%22%3A%20%7B%22script-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%27unsafe-inline%27%20%27unsafe-eval%27%20data%3A%20%2A%22%2C%20%22img-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20data%3A%20%2A%22%2C%20%22frame-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A%22%2C%20%22style-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%27unsafe-inline%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20%2A.wnyc.org%20cloud.typography.com%20fonts.googleapis.com%20www.google.com%20platform.twitter.com%22%2C%20%22connect-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20ws%3A//%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%22%2C%20%22object-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20%2A.wnyc.org%20%2A.moatads.com%20%2A.googlesyndication.com%22%2C%20%22font-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20data%3A%20fonts.gstatic.com%22%7D%2C%20%22featureFlags%22%3A%20%7B%22embedded-components%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22django-page-routing%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22persistent-player%22%3A%20false%7D%2C%20%22ember-cli-mirage%22%3A%20%7B%22usingProxy%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22useDefaultPassthroughs%22%3A%20true%7D%2C%20%22EmberENV%22%3A%20%7B%22FEATURES%22%3A%20%7B%7D%7D%2C%20%22locationType%22%3A%20%22auto%22%2C%20%22APP%22%3A%20%7B%22version%22%3A%20%220.0.0%2B%22%2C%20%22name%22%3A%20%22overhaul%22%7D%2C%20%22sentry%22%3A%20%7B%22development%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22whitelistUrls%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22includePaths%22%3A%20%5Bnull%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22dsn%22%3A%20%22https%3A//62cc19caee0944219c038a6287eff1c5%40sentry.wnyc.org/3%22%2C%20%22debug%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22ravenOptions%22%3A%20%7B%22ignoreUrls%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22ignoreErrors%22%3A%20%5B%22adsafeprotected%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%20%22baseURL%22%3A%20%22/%22%2C%20%22googleAnalyticsKey%22%3A%20%22UA-283599-12%22%2C%20%22wnycEtagAPI%22%3A%20%22https%3A//www.wnyc.org/api/v1/browser_id/%22%2C%20%22environment%22%3A%20%22production%22%2C%20%22exportApplicationGlobal%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22wnycAccountRoot%22%3A%20%22https%3A//account.wnyc.org%22%2C%20%22wnycStaticURL%22%3A%20%22//media.wnyc.org/static/%22%2C%20%22wnycAPI%22%3A%20%22//api.wnyc.org%22%7D", "has_audio": "False", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "revision": "38c95afd1495bd1d3d3aac5bf07d20e1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd25b\"", "article_summary": "New Jersey hospitals will be getting a lot less money from the state government to deliver charity care to uninsured people under Gov.\nAdministration officials say there\u2019s a good reason for the cuts: the Affordable Care Act has dramatically reduced the ranks of the uninsured.\nThe proposed spending plan also includes a $27 million increase in the Department of Health budget, from $369 million to $396 million.\nChris Christie\u2019s proposed 2015-2016 budget.\n\u201cAll of a sudden, we\u2019re depending on Medicaid (which) doesn\u2019t fully cover our costs, and at the same time you\u2019re going to cut charity care, and I\u2019m still seeing charity care\u201d patients at the hospital."}
