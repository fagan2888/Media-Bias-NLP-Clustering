Washington, D.C. (March 19, 2014)— The veteran political commentator and author David Frum is joining The Atlantic as a senior editor beginning March 31, James Bennet, editor in chief of The Atlantic, announced today. In his new role, Frum will write for the Web site and the magazine and participate in Atlantic events.

“David is a gutsy, heterodox thinker and a lovely writer—the very definition of the sort of contributor who has distinguished The Atlantic all these years,” said Bennet. “I look forward to his bracing work appearing across all our platforms.”

Frum comes to The Atlantic after an extended absence from full-time journalism. He joins an Atlantic politics and national affairs team that includes writers Molly Ball, Ta-Nehisi Coates, James Fallows, Conor Friedersdorf, Peter Beinart, and Andrew Cohen, as well as editors David Graham and Jennie Rothenberg Gritz.

“In a media world of quick takes and fast reacts, The Atlantic offers something indispensable: news that stays news,” said Frum. “I hope to offer readers content they will continue to think about even after the browser window closes and the latest Facebook status update is buried beneath the Twitter feed.”
