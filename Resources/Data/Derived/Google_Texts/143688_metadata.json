We have to think big, and we have to be committed to pursuing multiple approaches at the same time.\u201d\n\nKerry called on world leaders to come together and be \u201con the same page\u201d for the United Nations Climate Conference in Paris to push \u201cfor an ambitious, durable, and inclusive agreement that will finally put us on the path towards a global clean-energy future.\u201d He cited reducing food waste and using natural resources, including fisheries, more wisely, as key and called for increasing agriculture productivity \u201cin a way that\u2019s sustainable over time.\u201d He also argued that food systems should reduce greenhouse emissions and be able to adapt to changes in climate.\n\n\u201cTogether, we can harness our energy in order to cultivate food and feed the mouths of the world, and in the process we will protect the food security of billions of people on this planet,\u201d he added.

They want to capitalize on trends that show many consumers are willing to shell out more money for meat produced close to home. But there aren\u2019t enough government-regulated slaughterhouses to accommodate the demand in a cost-effective way, and the alternatives, so-called custom slaughter houses, restrict which cuts of meat producers can sell, the story says. That can mean long drives for farmers to get their meat to slaughterhouses, upping the overall production costs.\n\nThat\u2019s where legislation introduced by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), a producer of grass-fed beef, comes in. The bill, dubbed the Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption Act, would clear the way for farmers to get meat processed at custom slaughterhouses that are occasionally inspected by the USDA but don\u2019t have meat inspectors providing daily oversight. It's legal for farmers to use custom slaughterhouses to cut animals into frozen quarters and halves, but these large quantities cannot be labeled and sold commercially, the story states. Massie\u2019s bill would allow farmers to do so within state lines. Read the bill here: http://bit.ly/1LXtsLA.

We may soon have an idea: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is planning to make some announcements later this fall about how the city is doing at meeting its sodium reduction goals, Sonia Angell, deputy commissioner, said Friday at a New York Academy of Sciences' obesity policy conference.\n\nIn 2008, the city launched the National Salt Reduction Initiative, a network of more than 90 state and local health groups that worked with the packaged food and restaurant industries to set voluntary sodium reduction targets for more than 80 food categories. Close to 30 companies, including Mars, Campbell Soup Company, Kraft and Starbucks, committed to the targets, which took effect in 2012 and 2014.\n\nOne of the key ways city health officials are measuring the impact of the initiative is by looking at sodium intake through a 24-hour urinary sodium analysis. When the city measured its baseline in 2010, it found consumption by New Yorkers overall was pretty close to the national average \u2014 at about 3,240 milligrams of sodium a day \u2014 but African-American residents had significantly higher sodium intake, Angell said.\n\nThe hope is that the city's sodium reduction efforts will help close that gap, she said.\n\nNYC is about to kick its sodium strategy up a notch: Starting Dec. 1, the city will require warning symbols be placed next to menu items at chain restaurants if the dishes contain more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium. See more about that here: http://on.nyc.gov/1ZP6mBb.\n\nREVISITING THE NY SODA WARS: While we\u2019re here: A behind-the-scenes account of the \u2018soda wars\u2019 in New York City has been published by Tom Farley, former commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Farley has written a book called \u201cSaving Gotham: A Billionaire Mayor, Activist Doctors, and The Fight for Eight Million Lives,\u201d an excerpt of which was just published in Salon, here: bit.ly/1LElTO8\n\nWhen New York was mulling a soda tax \u201cthe serious combat took place in back rooms,\u201d writes Farley. \u201cIn New York State in 2009, the American Beverage Association had increased its donations to state legislators from nothing to $900,000, and the two soda companies increased their state lobbying spending to $3 million. ... In 2010 ... the companies went into higher gear. Coke and Pepsi sent workers to meet with the governor to tell him the tax would kill their jobs. They brought in the Teamsters, whose members drive soda delivery trucks, to pressure union-friendly legislators. The ABA opened its wallet further, spending nearly $13 million \u2013 more than lobbyists spent on any other issue.\n\n\u201cThe tax proposal went nowhere in the legislature,\u201d he continues. \u201cCoke and Pepsi had shown that they were stronger than a governor, a mayor, and the state\u2019s health commissioners, hospitals, and most powerful union combined.\u201d\n\nFarley concludes: \u201cThe fight over sugary drinks \u2013 health advocates versus the soda companies \u2013 is only growing. Obesity is now an epidemic around the world, with some countries rivaling the United States, and the battle has spread to them.\u201d\n\nFull court press: Farley penned an op-ed for the New York Daily news over the weekend arguing that the idea of soda taxes should be resurrected:nydn.us/1XdrIpw.\n\n** A message from the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food: The Coalition for Safe Affordable Food is fighting for a uniform, national food labeling standard that brings transparency and consistency to the marketplace while protecting American farmers and families from needless price hikes. http://bit.ly/1LprXGN **\n\nWATCHDOG PUSHES INVESTIGATION OF ORGANIC PROGRAM: Organic industry watchdog group the Cornucopia Institute is pushing the Agriculture Department to complete an investigation into the National Organic Program and its head, Deputy Administrator Miles McEvoy. Leaders of the group claim that USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General is looking into ethic complaints they have filed over the way the program is being run, according to a statement. The IG\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t comment on whether it is, in fact, conducting an investigation, a spokesman told MA. Of the nearly 4,160 complaints received in 2015, more than 4,000 were referred to law enforcement agencies, so the vast majority of complaints are getting reviewed.\n\nMark Kastel, director of Cornucopia, told MA that he met twice this summer with an investigator over his group\u2019s allegations. Making the group\u2019s complaint public is a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d to get the IG\u2019s office to finish its investigation and release the findings, he said. Cornucopia alleges that the National Organic Program is giving favorable treatment to large food companies and producers and has failed to investigate the group\u2019s concerns that certain large organic livestock and poultry farms are not following the law. Cornucopia details its concerns here: http://bit.ly/1jPuuml.\n\nHowever, an organic industry source tells MA McEvoy \u201cis doing some great work, I think the fact is that politically its difficult to get things done in Washington.\u201d The source added, \u201cMiles is managing a program to the best of his abilities. It\u2019s not him that\u2019s limiting the perfectness of organic.\u201d\n\nUSDA CONSIDERS CHANGE OF \u2018ROASTER\u2019 CHICKEN DEFINITION: The deadline for public comment on the Food Safety and Inspection Service\u2019s proposed change to the definition and standard of identity for the \u201croaster\u201d chicken ends tonight. The National Chicken Council requested the change, which would remove the minimum 8-week-old age to any bird under 12 weeks and raise the ready-to-cook carcass weight from 5 pounds to 5.5 pounds. Right now, the description of roaster is \u201ca young chicken (between 8 and 12 weeks of age) ... with a read-to-cook carcass weight of 5 pounds or more, that is tender-meated with soft, pliable, smooth-textured skin and breastbone cartilage that is somewhat less flexible than that of a broiler or fryer.\u201d\n\nGenetic changes and management techniques have reduced the growth period and increased the ready-to-cook weight of the class of poultry.\n\nOne commenter has pushed back against the proposal to do away with the minimum age: \u201cThe older the bird gets the more firm and less fatty the meat is,\u201d the comment says. \u201cRoasters have a much superior texture and flavor spectrum because of the age of the animal. It's not just that they have reached the weight limit. Please leave the 8-12 week time restriction in place.\u201d Read the proposal here: http://1.usa.gov/1GcYoeW.\n\nGUIDANCE OUT FOR EVALUATING E. COLI DRUG FOR COWS: The FDA has published its final guidance to industry for evaluating the effectiveness of new animal drugs intended to reduce pathogenic, Shiga toxin-producing E. Coli in cattle. The document recommends study designs and criteria that drug manufacturers can develop to perform evaluations. The guidance doesn\u2019t establish legally enforceable responsibilities but just presents the FDA\u2019s thinking on the subject.
