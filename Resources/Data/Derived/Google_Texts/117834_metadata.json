An earlier AP toll of 23 injured had double-counted those rescued.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari sent condolences to families of victims, said the attack exposed the perpetrators as \"mere criminals who have no place among civilized people,\" and promised that \"the final end of Boko Haram is in sight.\"\n\nIt was the second attack in five months on the Molai-Umarari mosque. Twin suicide bombers in October killed six people.\n\n\"Do you know that among those in the mosque, only the chief imam survived\" on Wednesday, said resident Adam Modu. The second bomber had her back to a child when she exploded, blowing the kid into pieces, he said.\n\nThe mosque was closed after the October attack and had only reopened three days ago, residents said.\n\nUmar Usman said he escaped because he was late: \"We were just a few meters away from the mosque when a loud bang erupted and all we could see was dark smoke and bodies littered around.\"\n\nThe mosque is on the outskirts of Maiduguri, the city that is the military command center of the war against Boko Haram.\n\nSeveral suicide bombers have exploded recently at roadblocks leading into the city, preventing attackers from reaching crowded areas.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Umarari is not a Boko Haram stronghold.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Haruna Umar contributed to this report from Abuja, Nigeria.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rescuers: Female suicide bombers kill 24 at Nigerian mosque - AP News: MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 Two female suicide bombers killed at .05/26/2016 12:05:23PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 Two female suicide bombers killed at least 24 worshippers and wounded", "title": "AP News - Rescuers: Female suicide bombers kill 24 at Nigerian mosque", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/03/16/rescuers-female-suicide-bombers-kill-22-at-nigerian-mosque-n2134651", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\76\\84e363c5-e465-45f3-8512-38e63456085c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 Two female suicide bombers killed at least 24 worshippers and wounded", "title": "AP News - Rescuers: Female suicide bombers kill 24 at Nigerian mosque", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/03/16/rescuers-female-suicide-bombers-kill-22-at-nigerian-mosque-n2134651", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/76/84e363c5-e465-45f3-8512-38e63456085c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Rescuers: Female suicide bombers kill 24 at Nigerian mosque, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35d1\"", "article_summary": "Several suicide bombers have exploded recently at roadblocks leading into the city, preventing attackers from reaching crowded areas.\nTwin suicide bombers in October killed six people.\nIt was the second attack in five months on the Molai-Umarari mosque.\nMAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 Two female suicide bombers killed at least 24 worshippers and wounded 18 in an attack during dawn prayers Wednesday on a mosque on the outskirts of the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri, officials said from the birthplace of Boko Haram.\nThe mosque is on the outskirts of Maiduguri, the city that is the military command center of the war against Boko Haram."}
