(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nIn addition to the damage done to the GOP by his penchant for right-wing antics, of which the shutdown fiasco was only the latest, Jim DeMint, the president of Heritage Foundation, has ushered in a new era in the once-proud conservative think tank\u2019s history.\n\nUnder DeMint, Heritage Foundation has been subsumed to the interests of its sister organization, Heritage Action. As a result, Heritage Foundation is suffering a grievous slide in intellectual integrity and influence. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is the latest of many conservatives openly to express concern about the think tank. He told MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd this week, \u201cRight now, I think it\u2019s in danger of losing its clout and its power around Washington, D.C. There\u2019s a real question in the minds of many Republicans now, and I\u2019m not just speaking for myself, for a lot of people that [question is]: is Heritage going to go so political that it really doesn\u2019t amount to anything anymore.\u201d\n\nWe saw this play out during the immigration reform fight when Heritage did an about face on prior research and analysis and put out an embarrassingly shoddy report by an author who previously claimed Hispanic were genetically less intelligent. Contrary to every other right-leaning think tank and years of free-market research, Heritage claimed that immigration is bad for the U.S. economy. Opponents of the Senate immigration reform effort tried to peddle the report. However, the author subsequently was forced to resign and wound up helping to discredit Heritage\u2019s argument.\n\nHeritage\u2019s new and overtly politicized role played out again in the shutdown fight when its president became the public face of Heritage Action\u2019s insistence on the failed defund strategy and vilification of conservative opponents. In the Wall Street Journal, DeMint last week engaged in some revisionist history. For example, he wrote, \u201cIf the Republicans had not fought on ObamaCare, the compromise would have been over the budget sequester. Instead, they have retained the sequester and for the past three months ObamaCare and its failings have been front and center in the national debate.\u201d This is preposterous. The so-called Cantor-plan put forth by the House majority leader would have locked in the sequester and moved Obamacare fight to the debt limit; it was actively opposed by the defund advocates. Likewise, DeMint pledged this week to fight on in the battle against Obamacare. Only a few months ago he was arguing that it was vital to fight the Obamacare battle because once it was enacted the public would be hooked on subsidies. This argument has been echoed and amplified by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). The argument has turned out in the wake of the Obamacare rollout meltdown and the meager sign-ups to be egregiously wrong. Yet, Heritage and others aligned with DeMint admit no error or inconsistency.\n\nIt is one thing for a political operator or a senator to engage in such intellectual contortions, but it is quite another for the head of a think tank, presumably dedicated to truthful public policy analysis and study.\n\nLast week it was also reported by Foreign Policy that DeMint personally spiked a scholarly report by former Bush administration attorney Steven Bradbury, attesting in a detailed statutory and Constitutional analysis to the legality of the NSA surveillance program. (Not knowing this background, I previously had cited his exceptionally detailed and persuasive analysis, which was eventually published by the Brookings Institute.)\n\nI asked Heritage about the report and whether, like other think tanks, it kept senior management and board members out of the approval and publishing process. VP of Communications Michael Gonzalez responded via e-mail, \u201cHeritage decided not to publish the paper (we do discuss most issues here at some length). We notified the author promptly so that the paper could be published elsewhere. I can also tell you that Jim DeMint did not make the decision not to use the paper and that we are planning to write Foreign Policy and ask for a correction.\u201d He refused to answer repeated questions as to whether DeMint weighed in or affected the decision. He also refused to specify if Heritage makes certain that publishing decisions are made by the scholars in that field. (In the case of the immigration paper, a since departed Heritage scholar told Right Turn that multiple questions were raised about the credibility of the paper but that the DeMint crew, newly arrived at the time, insisted on going forward.) As for Foreign Policy, as of this writing, it has not received any request for correction from Heritage and indeed never heard back from Heritage after its reporter described the piece to Heritage and requested comment.\n\nBradbury refused to speak to us about the incident. I did however talk with Brookings about its decision to publish the piece. Benjamin Wittes, who heads the widely respected Lawfare blog and has overseen Brookings new research paper series on National Security told me, \u201cI thought the paper was enormously compelling It is a very cogent argument for the program\u2019s legality.\u201d He added, \u201cBradbury is an important voice, one of the few people who has worked on [these issues].\u201d He declined to speak about the Heritage controversy, as did Brookings vice president of communications, David Nassar, who spoke to me by phone. \u201cBrookings does not have institutional positions on issues,\u201d Nassar said. (This is generally the case at the respected think tanks. At the American Enterprise Institute, for example, scholars take different positions on banking regulations and tax reform.) He pointed to Brookings motto: \u201cQuality, independence, impact.\u201d\n\nAs to the importance of the paper series, Nassar added, \u201cThe breadth and depth of the scholarship demonstrates its value. It\u2019s an important discussion to have.\u201d (The Lawfare research paper series is also a bold attempt to replace the academic, stodgy law review articles. As Wittes wrote, \u201cWe focus only on scholarship we think is actually useful and important to policymakers and national security practitioners.\u201d) From my vantage point \u2014 as a recovering lawyer and former law school student \u2014 it is inconceivable that the paper would have been rejected on grounds of quality or readability.\n\nIt speaks volumes that a generally center-left think tank will publish the important scholarly contributions of a conservative attorney on a key national security matter, but Heritage will not. (Apparently the new anti-surveillance isolationist bug is too inviting to Heritage to undermine with actual scholarship.) The failure to separate intellectual inquiry from raw partisan politics troubles conservatives and has contributed to a number of scholars\u2019 departures during the short DeMint regime. The lack of intellectual rigor and the primacy of partisan food fights under DeMint \u2014 who still talks and writes like a partisan attack dog and not the head of a scholarly institution \u2014 deeply worry conservatives, including this one, who remember the \u201cold Heritage\u201d fondly.\n\nRELATED: The Right\u2019s 25 most influential voices", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim DeMint has ushered in a new era in the once-proud Heritage Foundation's history.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Jim DeMint has ushered in a new era in the once-proud Heritage Foundation's history.", "title": "Jim DeMint\u2019s destruction of the Heritage Foundation", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/10/21/jim-demints-destruction-of-the-heritage-foundation/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/05/06/Production/Daily/A-Section/Images/Immigration_Opponents.JPEG-07f06.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/10/21/jim-demints-destruction-of-the-heritage-foundation/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "jim demint undermines heritage, heritage foundation politicized, heritage foundation rejects NSA paper, Steven Bradbury and Heritage,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "jim demint undermines heritage, heritage foundation politicized, heritage foundation rejects NSA paper, Steven Bradbury and Heritage,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2182\"", "article_summary": "Under DeMint, Heritage Foundation has been subsumed to the interests of its sister organization, Heritage Action.\nContrary to every other right-leaning think tank and years of free-market research, Heritage claimed that immigration is bad for the U.S. economy.\nSen.
