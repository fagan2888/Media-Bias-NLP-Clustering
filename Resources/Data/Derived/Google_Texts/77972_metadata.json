Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., gestures while speaking to nurses during a visit to the National Nurses United office, Monday, Aug. 10, 2015, in Oakland, Calif.\n\nNational Nurses United has chosen Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as its preferred candidate for president, dealing a blow to other candidates who had sought the union\u2019s endorsement \u2014 namely, Hillary Clinton.\n\nNNU announced its decision on Monday at an event in Oakland, California. The group, which represents approximately 185,000 nurses and is the largest of its kind in the country, said Sanders\u2019 policies \u201calign with nurses from top to bottom.\u201d Specifically, the group cited his support for the Affordable Care Act and Medicare, and his desire to fight climate change.\n\nThe endorsement is Sanders\u2019 first from a national union, and while it\u2019s not expected to bring in large amounts of cash to his campaign, it is at least somewhat important. NNU has thousands of members in early primary states like New Hampshire and Iowa, and Sanders\u2019 two biggest Democratic rivals \u2014 Clinton and Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley \u2014 had also competed for the endorsement. Nurses are also consistently rated the \u201cmost trusted\u201d professionals in the country, with the vast majority of Americans giving them high ratings of honesty and ethics.\n\nBut why did Sanders secure union members\u2019 votes over Clinton or O\u2019Malley? In the minutes following the announcement, Buzzfeed News reported that the Keystone XL pipeline was \u201cthe deciding factor,\u201d noting Clinton\u2019s now-infamous refusal to say whether she would approve the controversial project. Conversely, Sanders has staunchly opposed the pipeline for the same reasons NNU has, saying a spill would exacerbate health problems like asthma and nosebleeds.\n\nHowever, NNU spokesperson Martha Wallner said the decision to choose Sanders ran deeper than Keystone XL. In a phone interview, Wallner said all three candidates had competed for the endorsement by filling out a seven-question survey about issues that aligned with NNU\u2019s values \u2014 and only Sanders scored a 100 percent. O\u2019Malley scored 86 percent, and Clinton scored just 43 percent, she said.\n\n\u201cWe want it all,\u201d Wallner said. \u201cIt goes far beyond just Keystone XL.\u201d\n\nThinkProgress reviewed a copy of each candidates\u2019 answers to the survey, and the resulting scorecard created by the NNU Executive Council. Clinton answered \u201cno commitment\u201d on four out of seven issues. One of those was, of course, in response to whether she would oppose the Keystone XL pipeline. But Clinton would also not commit to supporting \u201ca publicly administered, single-payer, universal healthcare system,\u201d nor would she commit to supporting legislation to impose a .5 percent tax on Wall Street speculation. She also would not commit to publicly opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which nurses oppose because they say it allows pharmaceutical companies to block distribution of cheaper generic medications.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just been vague,\u201d Wallner said. \u201cSanders has taken clear positions on the areas that we care about.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley supported nearly all of NNU\u2019s preferred policies, but would not commit to supporting a law that would require minimum, specific nurse-to-patient ratios at all times in all U.S. hospitals, a policy which nurses say would prevent chronic understaffing. O\u2019Malley also added a caveat to his support for a single-payer healthcare system \u2014 he said he was for it, but would not specifically commit to federal legislation.\n\nClinton also added caveats to a number of union issues she said she would support. For example, she said she would \u201cwork to establish\u201d minimum nurse-to-patient ratios, but would not fully commit to a federal policy. She also said she would support giving collective bargaining rights to employees in the Veterans Health Administration, but would not specifically commit to the VA Employee Fairness Act, which, among other things, gives collective bargaining rights to employees in the Veterans Health Administration.\n\nIn all, on the questionnaire, the three Democratic candidates only fully agreed on one thing \u2014 opposing right-to-work laws. Those laws allow union-represented workers to opt out of paying union fees, meaning they can benefit from collective bargaining without paying dues. Sanders, O\u2019Malley, and Clinton all said they would veto a national right-to-work law should Congress pass one.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It wasn't just about Keystone XL.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "It wasn't just about Keystone XL.", "title": "Why The \u2018Most Trusted\u2019 Professionals\u2019 Union In The Nation Endorsed Bernie Sanders", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/08/11/3690105/nurses-for-bernie/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10162701/AP_617276133455.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It wasn't just about Keystone XL.", "creator": "@@emorwee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10162701/AP_617276133455-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why The \u2018Most Trusted\u2019 Professionals\u2019 Union In The Nation Endorsed Bernie Sanders", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10162701/AP_617276133455.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/10162701/AP_617276133455.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-11T08:54:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emorweee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Sanders, O\u2019Malley, and Clinton all said they would veto a national right-to-work law should Congress pass one.\nBut why did Sanders secure union members\u2019 votes over Clinton or O\u2019Malley?\nHowever, NNU spokesperson Martha Wallner said the decision to choose Sanders ran deeper than Keystone XL.\nNNU has thousands of members in early primary states like New Hampshire and Iowa, and Sanders\u2019 two biggest Democratic rivals \u2014 Clinton and Maryland Gov.\nThose laws allow union-represented workers to opt out of paying union fees, meaning they can benefit from collective bargaining without paying dues."}
