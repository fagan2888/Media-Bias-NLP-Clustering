The breast pump may be covered for use in the hospital, and in certain cases, if the physician proves medical necessity, for home use,\u201d he said. At this time TRICARE doesn\u2019t cover electric hospital-grade breast pumps for convenience, basic electric breast pumps, or manual breast pumps.\n\n\u201cUntil this new policy is complete, Tricare beneficiaries should save their receipts for breast pumps, and breast-feeding supplies and services,\u201d he said. \u201cCoverage for these services and supplies will be retroactive to Dec. 19, 2014, the date the 2015 NDAA became law, as long as they were purchased from a Tricare authorized provider.\u201d\n\nAlso available in the meantime, are a variety of free breast-feeding support opportunities through Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.\n\nPrenatal breast feeding classes are offered to expecting mothers free of charge, said Tara Haberl, nurse educator and board certified lactation consultant at Darnall. The hospital and New Parent Support programs also offer a support group that focuses more on postpartum.\n\n\u201cBreast-feeding is kind of a lost art,\u201d Haberl said. \u201cMost people didn\u2019t grow up seeing women breast-feeding. In a support group setting, we\u2019re able to form that network prior to their baby being born and after so they know what they\u2019re going through is normal.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to trouble-shooting while feeding a new baby, Haberl said that network of support can really make a difference.\n\nThe classes teach moms the tools for success, said Capt. Erica Franklin-Wilkerson, officer in charge of Darnall\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Clinic.\n\n\u201cClasses ... teach on how to breast-feed and to get their mind ready for the breast-feeding,\u201d she said. This also includes how to pick up on breast-feeding cues and how to hold babies.\n\nMoms are given information on these resources during doctor appointments. After they give birth, moms are given even more resources that include in-home follow up.\n\n\u201cIf they want to succeed at breast-feeding, Fort Hood is the place to be,\u201d Haberl said.\n\nTricare will notify beneficiaries once the new policy has been approved, Dwyer said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Fort Hood Herald", "description": "Thanks to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, breast-feeding moms using Tricare will get access to the same resources as those parents whose health insurance is mandated by the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Breast-feeding mothers using Tricare gain access to resources", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/fort_hood_herald/homefront/breast-feeding-mothers-using-tricare-gain-access-to-resources/article_0c8323da-abd6-11e4-9796-df8b981c49b0.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/de/0de35634-4e5a-11e4-8633-001a4bcf6878/5434423fac715.image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KDHmilitary"}, "keywords": "breastfeeding,women s health magazine,tricare,mothers,affordable care act,defense health agency,homefront", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/FortHoodHerald", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rosel.thayer"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "news_keywords": "breastfeeding,women s health magazine,tricare,mothers,affordable care act,defense health agency,homefront", "description": "Thanks to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, breast-feeding moms using Tricare will get access to the same resources as those parents whose health insurance is mandated by the Affordable Care Act."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6b9\"", "article_summary": "At this time TRICARE doesn\u2019t cover electric hospital-grade breast pumps for convenience, basic electric breast pumps, or manual breast pumps.\n\u201cUntil this new policy is complete, Tricare beneficiaries should save their receipts for breast pumps, and breast-feeding supplies and services,\u201d he said.\nThe Defense Health Agency and the Tricare Health Plan are actively developing a plan to allow Tricare to cover these important breast-feeding supplies and services for new mothers, said Kevin Dwyer, Defense Health Agency spokesman.\nCurrently, Tricare may cover electric hospital-grade breast pumps for premature infants who meet certain criteria.\nThanks to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, breast-feeding moms using Tricare will get access to the same resources as those parents whose health insurance is mandated by the Affordable Care Act."}
