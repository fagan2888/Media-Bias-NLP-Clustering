According to the announcement, Healthtrust will track supply chain costs and the degree to which Tenet shares supply chain services across the healthcare provider's network of 81 acute care and 19 surgical hospitals.

"Tenet's performance in the supply chain has historically been very strong," Kristy Waters, Tenet's senior vice president of performance management and innovation said in a statement. "Our decision to bring certain supply chain functions back in-house and to consolidate all group purchasing activities within HealthTrust comes after conducting a rigorous evaluation of our alternatives. HealthTrust distinguished itself in two compelling waysâ€•by providing clear evidence of immediate value and demonstrating the breadth and depth of its supply chain expertise."

Recently, New Jersey hospitals operator Barnabas Health also signed a deal to use Healthtrust for supply chain management.
