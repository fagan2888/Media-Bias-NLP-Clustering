He spoke of income inequality, the broken criminal justice system, campaign finance, and healthcare for all.\n\n\u201cWhat this campaign is about is something fairly radical in American politics. And that is, telling the truth,\u201d the self-described socialist Vermont senator told a crowd erupting in cheers.\n\n\u201cSometimes when we talk about the truth, and sometimes when we treat people as intelligent human beings, it means that we have to discuss issues that are not necessarily pleasant, but we have to deal with reality if we want to go forward,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nThe 74-year-old Democratic hopeful is campaigning against unchecked money from corporate donors influencing American politics. Many Americans feel the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Citizens United has diluted their voice in the political process. Citizens United changed campaign finance rules to allow unlimited money from individuals and corporations and the creation of Super PACs\n\n\u201cAmerican democracy today is under assault, in fact right now we have a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining democracy,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nThis is in line with Sanders campaign model of not accepting money from corporate donors or having a Super PAC. His campaign raised a staggering amount of approximately $20 million in January almost entirely from individual online donors averaging $27 per donor.\n\nPhoto Editor John Rothwell is at tonight's @BernieSanders rally at GVSU. #berniesanders #feeltheburn A photo posted by The Collegiate (@thecollegiate) on Mar 4, 2016 at 3:26pm PST\n\nOn the criminal justice system, Sanders told the crowd \u201cevery person in this room, every person in America, should be ashamed that in this country we have more people in jail than any other country on earth.\u201d\n\nThe campaign\u2019s main focus since the beginning is income inequality.\n\n\u201cMany American\u2019s work two or three jobs, and yet all the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Get ready for a radical idea,\u201d he said as the crowd erupted in anticipation. \u201cTogether we are going to create an economy that works for all Americans, not just the 1 percent.\u201d\n\nSanders also supports tuition-free college like many European countries.\n\n\u201cToday in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat our job now is when we talk about public education, is to make sure that public colleges and universities now are tuition-free.\u201d\n\nSanders believes the American healthcare system, even with Obamacare, doesn\u2019t do American citizens justice and advocates expansion of the Medicaid system to cover all Americans.\n\n\u201cDespite the good things of the ACA (Affordable Care Act), 29 million people today have no health insurance,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cMillions of Americans and people in this room are underinsured with high deductibles and co-pays. And we pay by far\u2026 the highest prices for prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nBorrowing a theme from Hillary Clinton\u2019s Super Tuesday speech, Sanders tried to contrast his approach with that of his Republican opponents.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the American people no matter what our race, our religion, where we come from, understand that love trumps hatred.\u201d\n\nGrand Rapids resident Holly Blanchard, 43, is a confirmed Sanders voter in the Michigan Primary this Tuesday. It\u2019s her first time being involved in a political campaign.\n\n\u201cI believe Bernie is the right choice for America,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cI want to see the standard of living raised for every American. I believe this is the right direction for the country. I want to have access to health care. I don\u2019t feel like the (current) system is a sustainable model\u2026 Something needs to change.\u201d\n\nAshton Bart, 21, of Goodrich, Michigan, was one of the young people who filled the arena at GVSU.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s cool for him to come to the small town of Allendale,\u201d Bart said. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s a candidate advocating for the people.\u201d\n\nSanders has been surviving on the youth vote since Iowa, where he topped Hillary Clinton by 70 percent in the younger demographic.\n\nCindy Karston, of Grand Rapids, brought her granddaughter to the rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve attended a political rally,\u201d Karston said. \u201cJust the experience is a great way to introduce our granddaughter to the political process.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet off your butt and go vote because I can\u2019t,\u201d stated their granddaughter.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "The Collegiate Staff", "og": {"site_name": "The Collegiate Live", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addressed a packed house March 4 at the Grand Valley State University Fieldhouse.
