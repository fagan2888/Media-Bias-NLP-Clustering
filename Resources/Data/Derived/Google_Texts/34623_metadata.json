Skip to 3:15 below. To be fair, he never told York categorically that he\u2019d let Obama\u2019s order stand if elected president. What he said was, \u201cI cannot imagine a scenario where a future president is going to take away the status they\u2019re going to get.\u201d If you want to pretend that that\u2019s meaningfully distinct from what Rubio would do as president himself, have at it. The best spin that can be put on this, I think, is that Rubio lied to York at the time because he wanted to put pressure on righties to support the Gang of Eight bill. In other words, he didn\u2019t sincerely believe that O\u2019s order would be irreversible by a GOP successor but he wanted conservatives to believe it so that they\u2019d panic and decide to accept half a loaf on immigration in the form of the Senate immigration bill. That wouldn\u2019t be the first time Rubio used Obama in a sort of good cop/bad cop routine to get amnesty passed. If it makes you feel better to think that he was lying to righties two years ago to try to scare them into supporting comprehensive immigration reform rather than lying to them now about what he\u2019ll do as president, again, have at it.\n\nHere\u2019s a more useful question than babbling about what Rubio really meant: How would a new Republican president, under tremendous pressure from the right to cancel O\u2019s amnesty order and tremendous pressure from center-righties, Democrats, and Latinos to keep it intact, split the baby? The obvious solution, a la ObamaCare, is not merely to repeal but repeal and replace. Odds are very good that whoever ends up as GOP nominee, Ted Cruz included, will roll out an immigration plan early in the general election campaign that demands much stronger enforcement but also contemplates some form of legalization for illegals, including and especially those illegals who\u2019ve already been covered by Obama\u2019s most recent executive order. (The plan probably won\u2019t allow a path to citizenship in the interest of keeping conservatives happy, but that\u2019s a detail. Once legalization happens, citizenship will follow down the road inevitably.) That would allow the nominee to promise, truthfully, that ending Obama\u2019s amnesty is a priority for him when he takes office while also placating amnesty fans by giving them a statutory route to keeping the basics of O\u2019s plan in place. Righties will grumble, but if there\u2019s ever a moment when they\u2019d be willing to forgive some heresy on immigration, it\u2019s as a pander to swing voters in the thick of a presidential race where Hillary Clinton stands to benefit if they revolt. That\u2019s what Rubio\u2019s counting on. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a smart bet.\n\nExit question: Is Jeb Bush really the Bush-iest candidate in the GOP field? The whole reason for Rubio\u2019s candidacy, at least from the donor class\u2019s perspective, is that he offers a Jeb-like policy program without any of the \u201cBush baggage\u201d that\u2019ll hurt Jeb in the general election. On the merits, though, there\u2019s no one in the race, Jeb included, who\u2019s more like Dubya than Rubio is. He backed comprehensive immigration reform, just as Bush 43 did; he\u2019s the most loud-and-proud neoconservative in the field, a fact alluded to in his campaign slogan; and his boldest domestic initiative, his family-friendly tax reform plan, is a throwback to \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201d Rubio said of Dubya in 2012, \u201cGeorge W. Bush, in my opinion, did a fantastic job as president over eight years,\u201d a line you may see featured once or twice in Democratic (and Rand Paul) attack ads over the next year. I keep imagining a debate between Rubio and Hillary where he echoes the \u201cyesterday is over\u201d theme from his campaign launch by warning voters that they shouldn\u2019t want to return to the White House of twenty years ago \u2014 whereupon Hillary retorts that they really shouldn\u2019t want to return to the White House of ten years ago. \u201cA return to Bush\u201d will be the main Democratic line of attack on Republican nominees for years to come, but in Rubio\u2019s case, as new conservative wine in old Republican bottles, it really might have some bite.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do anything on immigration.\u201d", "title": "Rubio reverses: As president, I\u2019d end Obama\u2019s executive amnesty for illegals", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/15/rubio-reverses-as-president-id-end-obamas-executive-amnesty-for-illegals/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-15T15:31:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-15T15:14:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, amnesty, byron york, executive, illegal, immigration, Marco Rubio, Megyn Kelly, Obama, President, republican,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbec4\"", "article_summary": "To be fair, he never told York categorically that he\u2019d let Obama\u2019s order stand if elected president.\nRubio reverses: As president, I\u2019d end Obama\u2019s executive amnesty for illegalsposted at 11:31 am on April 15, 2015 by AllahpunditA follow-up to yesterday\u2019s mini-bombshell from Byron York about what Rubio said in 2013.\nExit question: Is Jeb Bush really the Bush-iest candidate in the GOP field?\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the first time Rubio used Obama in a sort of good cop/bad cop routine to get amnesty passed.\nThat would allow the nominee to promise, truthfully, that ending Obama\u2019s amnesty is a priority for him when he takes office while also placating amnesty fans by giving them a statutory route to keeping the basics of O\u2019s plan in place."}
