In the interview, I express I was raised as a child to have a certain set of beliefs, but my beliefs have evolved significantly as my own personal relationship with Christ has increased.\n\nShepherd told an interviewer that she was brought up in the Christian faith which believes homosexuality is a sin.\n\nThis is something that they teach in churches. So it\u2019s something that I grew up believing,\u201d she told [Fusion host Alicia] Menendez last week\u2026.\u201dI might not agree with your lifestyle, but I love you,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou may not agree with my lifestyle, but you love me \u2026 I don\u2019t say it\u2019s a choice. If you tell me, \u2018Sherri, I was born gay.\u2019 Okay. I\u2019m not gonna argue with you, because I can\u2019t tell you how you feel and what\u2019s going on inside. I\u2019m trying to make it into heaven by the skin of my teeth \u2026 I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m gonna see. So if you tell me you\u2019re born [gay], I\u2019m not gonna argue with you. And I absolutely respect you for that. I just ask that people respect how I feel, [I] respect how you feel and we can have a great dialogue.\n\nRobertson, a Christian, stated that homosexual acts are sinful in an interview with GQ magazine and was briefly suspended from his hit reality show Duck Dynasty as a result. Robertson refused to apologies for his comments, and the suspension was lifted in less than two weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sherri Sheperd, a co-host on the ABC talk show", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sherri Sheperd, a co-host on the ABC talk show", "title": "'View' Co-Host Apologizes for Saying Homosexuality Is a Sin - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/01/24/sheperd/sherri-shepherd.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/01/24/view-host-apologizes-gay-comments/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sherri Sheperd, a co-host on the ABC talk show", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/01/24/sheperd/sherri-shepherd.jpg", "title": "'View' Co-Host Apologizes for Saying Homosexuality Is a Sin - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "published_time": "2014-01-24T15:03:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m trying to make it into heaven by the skin of my teeth \u2026 I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m gonna see.\nI just ask that people respect how I feel, [I] respect how you feel and we can have a great dialogue.\nShepherd told an interviewer that she was brought up in the Christian faith which believes homosexuality is a sin.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe View co-host Sherri Shepherd knows how Phil Robertson feels.\nShepherd served up an apology this week on her syndicated talk show after comments she made about homosexuality offended some people."}
