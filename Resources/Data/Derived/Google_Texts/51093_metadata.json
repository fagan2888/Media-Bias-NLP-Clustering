Kay Hagan and her support of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe ad is the first in a $10-million campaign by the nonprofit Crossroads GPS and its sister \"super PAC\" American Crossroads that will target vulnerable Democrats this summer in four key states: Arkansas, Alaska, North Carolina and Colorado. The spot features Hagan echoing President Obama\u2019s promise that if Americans liked their healthcare plans, they could keep them, and highlights the fact that thousands of North Carolina health insurance plans were canceled because they did not meet the requirements of the new law.\n\n\u201cTypical Washington. Deceiving us. Pushing their agenda,\u201d the narrator in the new Crossroads GPS ad says, \u201cTell Senator Hagan: Keep your word on our health care.\u201d\n\nThe ad is just the latest salvo in what campaign advertising analyst Elizabeth Wilner calls \u201ca four-year avalanche\u201d of ads maligning the Affordable Care Act even though polls show that public opinion has essentially hardened on the law.\n\nFrom its passage in March 2010 through this April, opponents of the Affordable Care Act spent $418 million on negative ads about the law, while proponents spent just $27 million to tout their support, according to an analysis by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group, which Wilner oversees. That means the law\u2019s opponents have spent $15 for every $1 spent by supporters of Obamacare.\n\nVideo VIDEO: Alaska 'super PAC' aired rare pro-Obamacare ad An Alaska 'super PAC' aired a rare pro-Obamacare ad to help Democratic Sen.

AFP, which is largely funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, has far outpaced any other group this cycle with more than $35 million in anti-Obamacare ad spending.\n\n\u201cRepublicans remain convinced this is the way that they are going to win back the Senate, and Democrats are still trying to figure out how to use the issue,\u201d Wilner said. \u201cFor Republicans it\u2019s a bumper sticker: repeal and replace Obamacare. It\u2019s just not that simple for Democrats.\u201d\n\nVideo VIDEO: Pennsylvania's Allyson Schwartz one of few candidates to tout Obamacare Pennsylvania's Allyson Schwartz, who is running for governor in today's primary, was one of few candidates to tout Obamacare in an ad. Pennsylvania's Allyson Schwartz, who is running for governor in today's primary, was one of few candidates to tout Obamacare in an ad. See more videos\n\nAround the time last month that President Obama called on Democrats to \u201cforcefully defend and be proud\u201d of the Affordable Care Act, there were ads that seemed to suggest Democrats and their allies could be moving toward a more public embrace of the law.\n\nPennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Allyson Schwartz aired a spot touting her work with Obama on the law as she appealed to Democrats before Tuesday\u2019s primary in Pennsylvania. (Polls show Schwartz in a distant second place). A super PAC tried to help Alaska Sen. Mark Begich with an ad featuring a cancer survivor who was able to get health insurance under the law despite her preexisting condition. But Democratic operatives quietly say those kinds of ads are likely to be the exception this fall -- in no small part because so much has been spent to shape negative perceptions of the law.\n\n\u201cThis miasma has built up of negative sentiment against the healthcare law that almost no amount of advertising within a couple months' time is going to make go away,\u201d Wilner said. \u201cIt\u2019s like lead paint \u2026 you have to get rid of it, and there are layers, and layers and layers of it.\u201d\n\nThe more effective messaging strategy for Democrats has been a focus on fixing the law, and the fact that were they to repeal it Republicans would strip away some of the most popular protections, such as ensuring coverage for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nA strategist for Crossroads GPS declined to preview the message in the ads to come later this summer. The group plans to spend $3.55 million on ads in North Carolina that will run over four weeks between now and the end of July. It plans to spend $900,000 in Alaska, $875,000 in Arkansas and $2.28 million in Colorado, where the ads will run intermittently through August.\n\nThe allied American Crossroads super PAC will spend an additional $881,000 in Arkansas and $900,000 in Alaska during June, according to a strategist who was not authorized to publicly disclose the plans.\n\nHagan\u2019s campaign said that with the new Crossroads GPS campaign, outside spending against the North Carolina senator is approaching $16 million. Kantar Media\u2019s analysis showed that as of late April, 100% of the Republican general election spots on broadcast TV in North Carolina included an anti-healthcare law message.\n\nDespite the outside spending, Hagan and her opponent, speaker of the state House Thom Tillis, have been essentially tied in the polls since January. Hagan\u2019s spokeswoman, Sadie Weiner, said the North Carolina senator \u201cis focused on common sense fixes to make this law work better, including pushing a bill to let people stay on their plans permanently.\u201d\n\n\u201cThom Tillis has the wrong priorities for North Carolina families and is trying to hide the fact that his only plan would take us back to a time when people could be denied care for a preexisting condition, women were charged more than men and seniors paid more for prescription drugs,\u201d Weiner said.\n\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Justin Barasky mocked the election-year record of American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, the groups co-founded by Republican political strategist Karl Rove.\n\nThe two entities spent more than $176 million in the 2012 federal election cycle, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. But they have not been major players in the 2014 cycle until now. (American Crossroads spent close to $2 million in April on ads in North Carolina and Alaska; Crossroads GPS aired an ad in March targeting Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and the healthcare law).", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "$10-million ad campaign joins 'avalanche' of anti-Obamacare ads", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The big-spending conservative group American Crossroads and its nonprofit arm launched a new offensive Tuesday in the 2014 campaign for control of the U.S. Senate with an ad targeting North Carolina Sen.
