The three major reasons cited by doctors include the difficulty of obtaining coverage information, patient cost-sharing, and network limitations.\n\nTwila Brase, president of the Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom (CCHP), said, \u201cDue to high deductibles or narrow networks\u2014or the physician\u2019s refusal to get paid for doing more with less\u2014some doctors will not be available to these new government enrollees.\u201d\n\nAs to the differences between Medicaid and ACA plans, Brase said, \u201cAnyone on Obamacare is in what we call \u2018Medicaid for the middle class on a sliding fee scale.\u2019 It\u2019s not private insurance.\u2026 Both are government-controlled programs and both use health plans as contractors, except that Medicaid has little to no risk of a two-month coverage gap.\u201d\n\nMultiple Reasons for Declines\n\nDoctors surveyed for the study cited several challenges in treating patients with policies from Obamacare exchanges.\n\nResponses were anonymous, but included: \u201cWe are going to have to hire additional staff just to manage the insurance verification process,\u201d \u201cIdentification of ACA plans has been an administrative nightmare,\u201d and \u201cWe thought we would be able to identify ACA insurance exchange products by their insurance card, but quickly found out this isn\u2019t so.\u201d\n\nHigh levels of patient cost-sharing are another challenge. Seventy-five percent of doctors responding reported patients with Obamacare coverage \u201care very or extremely likely to have high deductibles compared to patients with traditional commercial coverage.\u201d\n\nDoctors involved in the study also described \u201csignificant patient confusion\u201d regarding what their plans cover, and reported patients who learn about their deductible after the fact are more likely to cancel appointments and procedures, affecting preventative measures and doctor visits.\n\nDoctors are also concerned about network limitations, the survey found. Many practices are out of the network of Obamacare plans; 20 percent of respondents said their practice was excluded from a network they would have liked to participate in. Limited networks also make referrals to other doctors a problem.\n\nSally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute, said, \u201cPatients will have a harder time finding doctors to treat them, and waiting times will grow\u201d as a result of doctors declining to accept patients covered under Obamacare. \u201cIf one cannot work because of illness, it reduces one\u2019s contribution to the economy,\u201d Pipes noted.\n\nInsurance, Not Health Care\n\n\n\nDr. Kris Held, an eye surgeon from Texas, is one of many doctors who won\u2019t see patients with Obamacare plans. She said one of the biggest misconceptions people have regarding Obamacare is that insurance coverage equates to health care.\n\n\u201c[Obamacare] fails to provide affordable health insurance and fails to provide access to actual medical care to more people but succeeds at compounding existing healthcare cost and accessibility problems and creating new ones,\u201d Held said, describing the lack of care under Obamacare as a form of \u201crationing.\u201d\n\nDr. Jane Hughes, a surgeon in Texas, shared similar concerns when explaining why she doesn\u2019t accept patients with Obamacare plans. Hughes noted health care accounts for more than one-sixth of the private sector economy and said, \u201call of what is wrong with our current healthcare system is magnified by Obamacare.\u201d Like other doctors, she cited inability to identify coverage, cost-sharing levels, and narrow networks as her primary concerns.\n\nShe added, \u201c2,700 pages of tortuous, deceptive law ... is not fixable. It is like thinking you can cure metastatic cancer by just removing one or two of the biggest tumors.\u201d\n\nAlexander Anton (alexanderanton4@gmail.com) writes from Chicago, Illinois.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8406\"", "article_summary": "Insurance, Not Health CareDr. Kris Held, an eye surgeon from Texas, is one of many doctors who won\u2019t see patients with Obamacare plans.\nSally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute, said, \u201cPatients will have a harder time finding doctors to treat them, and waiting times will grow\u201d as a result of doctors declining to accept patients covered under Obamacare.\nShe said one of the biggest misconceptions people have regarding Obamacare is that insurance coverage equates to health care.\nMany practices are out of the network of Obamacare plans; 20 percent of respondents said their practice was excluded from a network they would have liked to participate in.\nThe three major reasons cited by doctors include the difficulty of obtaining coverage information, patient cost-sharing, and network limitations."}
