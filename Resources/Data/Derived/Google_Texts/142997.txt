Here is today's number in the world of politics:

Today's number is 2.5 million. That's the number of women that Donald Trump and Planned Parenthood agree benefit from the women's healthcare services of the organization.

Donald Trump told NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday that, "They [Planned Parenthood] do some very good work. Cervical cancer, lots of women's issue, women's health issues are taken care of."

In response, Planned Parenthood's CEO Cecile Richards said Wednesday on MSNBC, "This is one thing I agree with Donald Trump on, is [sic] that Planned Parenthood does amazing work for two and a half million patients every single year," reports Politico.

This might be the only thing on which Trump and Planned Parenthood agree. Trump went on to say, "Planned Parenthood does a really good job at a lot of different areas. But not on abortion. So I'm not going to fund it if it's doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it."

Richards told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell, "I think the disturbing thing is that Donald Trump as well as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have said if they were president, they would end women's access to family planning, to cancer screening, to basic affordable healthcare as well as overturning the Affordable Care Act, which is not covering family planning and other preventative care for 55 million women."
