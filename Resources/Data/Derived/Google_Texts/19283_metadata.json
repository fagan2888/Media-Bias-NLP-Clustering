Bush, September 11, War on Terror, Technology News, News, Politics News\n\nWithin an hour or two of the bombings in Brussels Monday, it was plain that there were two stories worth reporting from this latest turn in what has become our global conflict. There was the news story\u2014the boilerplate \u201cwho, what, when, where, why\u201d of it\u2014and then the story of how people all over the world reacted to these stunning events.\n\nIn newsrooms across the planet, these two stories would have been slugged\u2014identified by a simple name during the editorial process\u2014as \u201cBrussels\u201d and \u201cBrussels reax.\u201d We have read and heard volumes of both kinds of stories by now, and there are things to say about both.\n\nNew York, Washington, London, Paris, Moscow, Beirut, maybe San Bernardino, Calif., now Brussels, surely some other places: These are among the reasons we have to recognize we live amid a global crisis now. There is no more sitting comfortably in front of a television in any city or town and watching events unfold in some faraway place, moved for the duration of a cocktail hour.\n\nBrussels tells us, first and conclusively, that there are no such comfortable places left. To me, this is the ultimate reason Tuesday\u2019s events so quickly disturbed so many minds. It was more than the blood and carnage this time. It was the blood and the carnage so graphically in proximity not to some desert village or sun-parched urban slum, but to plate-glass windows fronting fashionable shops and the fa\u00e7ades of staid buildings in the Belgian style.\n\nA lot of stories reported or implied this yesterday, and they are true so far as they went. But that is not far enough. If we want a complete list of the places touched by terror, we have to include a more or less countless number of villages, towns and cities most of us have never heard of: communities\u2014if we can still get away with calling them such\u2014in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, the Gaza Strip, Libya and so on down a long list.\n\nI do not think there is any more ducking the point: The violence, disorder and anxiety that threaten to envelop us is not \u201cterrorism\u201d only when visited on Western societies and arriving by primitive rather than high-technology means\u2014exploding bags of nails as against expensive bombs. Among the victims and perpetrators of terror, it naturally follows, no part of the world is populated by the one but never the other.\n\nLet me try that again: Most of us still try to duck these points, but all such attempts grow ever less plausible. The true meaning of our fondness for \u201cshock and awe\u201d creeps up upon us, to make the point another way.\n\nA friend asked yesterday, \u201cWhy do they target civilian locations filled with innocent people?\u201d Another asked in reply, \u201cAren\u2019t they trying to disrupt our civilization?\u201d\n\nThese are good questions, given what they almost force us to think about. The short answers are, \u201cOn purpose\u201d and \u201cYes,\u201d and these answers derive from a simple understanding most of us tiptoe around but refuse to grasp: These attacks are at bottom replies. There is nothing arbitrary or random about them, it should by now be plain.\n\nReplies to what? Ah, now we stand a chance of getting somewhere. Now we have at least begun.\n\n*\n\nVery few of us recognize the extent to which language defines what we think and how we think what we think. The way we say things, in other words, draws a circumference around our consciousness and conversation. There are things we will thenceforth think and say and things we can neither think nor say. Two words have been especially effective in this connection since 2001. These words are \u201cterror\u201d and all its variants, and \u201cwar.\u201d\n\nThe problem with \u201cterror,\u201d \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d has been well massaged. As noted several times in this space, Richard Perle, the ideologue posing as intellectual, turned this term to purpose during the late 1990s and brought his point to prominence in the post-2001 decade, the Bush II years. He wrote of decontextualization\u2014meaning the isolation of the terror phenomenon from its context. His well-traveled quotation was, \u201cAny attempt to understand terror is an attempt to justify it.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cwar,\u201d as in \u201cthe war on terror,\u201d serves the same purpose without all the scholarly pretension. Dehumanizing the enemy has long been standard practice, of course: It is easier for soldiers to shoot or bomb people when they are reduced to \u201cthe Japs,\u201d \u201cthe Gerrys,\u201d \u201cthe gooks\u201d (a term that dates to the American campaign in the Philippines at the turn of the 20th century) or \u201cthe Argies,\u201d a Falklands War coinage.\n\nWe have made ourselves captives of the two terms at issue for 15 years now. Perle\u2019s assertion that context and understanding are subversive of the most general idea of human values is too idiotic to require reply. Bush II longed to be a \u201cwar president,\u201d O.K., but the press is to blame for accepting his phrase, \u201cthe war on terror,\u201d and then reproducing it. We have disabled ourselves. We are preoccupied with the crisis confronting us but have no clue how or what to think about it.\n\nNothing brings this home more squarely than the news coverage coming out of Brussels. There is a bottomless supply of \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhen\u201d and \u201cwhere,\u201d but reporting of this kind provides information\u2014data and nothing more. We have all the \u201ctick-tock\u201d\u2014moment-to-moment chronologies\u2014one could ever ask for. We have pictures of windows and doorways and police lines and police in masks, people placing flowers in the streets and all the rest. We seem to have infinite appetites for this kind of thing, and it seems to satisfy most of us. We are given to the instrumental, we can say; the most minute details of \u201chow\u201d events took place is more or less all we want.\n\nWe have had not a syllable of \u201cwhy,\u201d have we? \u201cWhy\u201d requires more than data. One must wade into the waters of context, causality, responsibility and motive. One must have some modest grasp of history. One must be prepared to consider whether one is implicated to one or another degree. With these one might eventually achieve some understanding. It is for the sake of understanding that \u201cWhy?\u201d is bedrock in good journalistic practice, however few pay any attention to this principle.\n\nUnderstanding, of course, is Perle\u2019s forbidden fruit. And for this we have lost all appetite.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is no more ducking the point: It's not terror only when it happens to us.
