Luis Lang (GoFundMe)

The 49-year-old South Carolina man who garnered attention — and thousands of dollars in donations — after revealing his medical issues online is now supporting the Affordable Care Act and turning away from the GOP, Think Progress reported.

“Now that I’m looking at what each party represents, my wife and I are both saying, ‘Hey, we’re not Republicans!'” Luis Lang said, adding that he wants to rip his voting registration card up on national television to confirm his change of political affiliation.

As of Tuesday night, Lang had received just over $22,000 in online donations to help him seek treatment for a partially detached retina and bleeding from his eyes.

While Lang initially blamed President Barack Obama for his inability to sign up for a healthcare exchange program, he said he was motivated to learn more about the federal mandate after his case was widely reported online.

He told Think Progress that contrary to previous reports, he never totally opposed the law, commonly known as Obamacare. But he was frustrated with the way the law was written, explaining that it is hard for him to determine his yearly income because he is a self-employed contractor. He was also upset that the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of taking part in the mandate, leaving millions of Americans without the ability to sign up.

“I put the blame on everyone — Republican and Democrat,” he said. “But I do mainly blame Republicans for their pigheadedness. They’re blocking policies that could help everyone. I’m in the situation I’m in because they chose not to expand Medicaid for political reasons. And I know I’m not the only one.”

Lang said that he has read every comment posted on his fundraiser, which drew several donors who identified themselves as progressives. Some of the donors included comments telling him to “turn off Fox News” while wishing him well.

“This whole thing has helped me see more clearly,” he said. “Like they say, hindsight is 20/20.”
