Critics said Clinton didn't smile enough when she gave her victory speech after her "Mega Tuesday" wins. This video says otherwise.

Some political pundits said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton didn't show the right positive emotions after she won the primaries in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Illinois. Specifically, those critics said Clinton didn't smile enough and yelled too much.

So we put together a mashup of Clinton smiling and not yelling. She actually smiled and didn't smile, yelled and didn't yell — just as most presidential candidates have done — during her 16-minute speech.
