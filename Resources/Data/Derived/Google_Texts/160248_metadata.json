That\u2019s what esteemed 18th century French scientist Georges-Louis Leclerc Buffon argued in his opus Histoire Naturelle. Buffon had no real evidence for this, as Charles Cooke\u2014a British transplant to America who now writes for National Review\u2014once pointed out. But it was, to Cooke, a fine illustration of the rest of the world\u2019s frequent failure to understand America.\n\nOf course, Buffon\u2019s France also brought us Alexis De Tocqueville (Democracy in America) and Hector St. John de Cr\u00e8vec\u0153ur (Letters from an American Farmer). With The Conservatarian Manifesto: Libertarians, Conservatives, and the Fight for the Right\u2019s Future, Cooke places himself in this latter tradition of sympathetic, thoughtful foreign observer. Writing with the wit and clarity that have earned him praise at National Review, Cooke takes a strong stand as a defender of American greatness.\n\nHe writes with the pride of an immigrant, or perhaps the zeal of a convert. Responding to Francis Fukuyama\u2019s observation that the popularity of anti-Obamacare rhetoric \u201cmakes non-Americans scratch their heads in disbelief,\u201d for example, Cooke simply says: \u201cLet them scratch.\u201d For him, opposition to Obamacare is evidence not of some defect in American culture but rather the pervasive spirit of liberty that has been its foremost asset.\n\nThis book also makes Cooke a spokesman for what he argues is a growing political trend in the United States: the titular \u201cconservatarians.\u201d This merging of conservatism and libertarianism resists easy definition. Conservatarians are, in Cooke\u2019s telling, both skeptical of certain libertarian positions\u2014on, for example, abortion, and immigration\u2014but also incline toward libertarianism on gay marriage and drugs. They also feel betrayed by the big-government excesses of the George W. Bush years, and detest their Obama-era exacerbation. They show both a \u201cpalpable irritation with the status quo\u201d and an \u201cunwillingness to go fully toward the libertarian side.\u201d\n\nWith the group thus defined, Cooke proposes how this sort of politics could rescue the country from the ravages of liberalism. His basic approach is a return to federalism, or a decentralization of power back down to the lowest possible level of decision-making. \u201cWithin reason, does it matter to you how people who live tens, hundreds, or thousands of miles away choose to live their lives?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf you call yourself a \u2018conservative\u2019 or a \u2018libertarian\u2019\u2014or, now, a \u2018conservatarian\u2019\u2014I\u2019d venture that the answer should be \u2018No.\u2019 And if you routinely rail against Washington, D.C., and its excesses, I\u2019d recommend that it should be \u2018Hell, no!\u2019\u201d\n\nThis vision remains quite distinct from modern liberalism, which, as Cooke notes, wants its preferred social norms universally adopted and thus cannot abide the authentic diversity federalism would invite. When the left senses victory on certain issues, such as gay marriage, it \u201ctends to regard political variation as an ill to be stamped out, not a virtue to be preserved for its own sake.\u201d\n\nCooke\u2019s advice for the right is to take the opposite approach: Don\u2019t enshrine personal morality as federal law. Rather, base your case on liberty\u2019s merits. He cites the right\u2019s gun debate victories as a model for success\u2014\u201cnothing short of remarkable, representing a salutary indication of just how effective the Right can be when it sticks to its principles, when it goes on the offensive, and when it presents a united front\u201d\u2014and gay marriage and drug legalization as examples of failure. Like Kurt Schlicter in Conservative Insurgency, Cooke argues that conservatives do not need to die on every hill.\n\nWhat Cooke ultimately wants is a live-and-let-live framework in which people, and governments, don\u2019t mess with each other\u2019s business, while the federal government performs the basic yet important functions tasked to it that smaller entities cannot: In short, something like the Founding era. This is the straight line running through his support for gun rights, drug legalization, national defense, border security, and gay marriage.\n\nCan it work? Perhaps. Cooke could be right that focus on personal morality hurts conservatives, and that they ought to preach their morals rather than fight for their federal enforcement. But the argument suffers from a problem that Cooke underplays: The hands-off federalism of the Founders was premised on a deep attachment to certain conceptions of virtue by both individuals and civil society that have fundamentally changed\u2014many would argue, declined. Thus, for a \u201cconservatarian\u201d return to a healthy society where the state and society exist within their proper limits, more than political reform would be required. There also must be a pre-political, cultural revival within civil society\u2014a revival that would have to happen, on Cooke\u2019s terms, without government interference.\n\nOne hopes that this is possible. Otherwise, Georges-Louis Leclerc Buffon might end up being right about America after all.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Are American animals\u2014including humans\u2014inherently weaker than their European counterparts?
