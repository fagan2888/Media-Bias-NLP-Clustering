Still, some fans think weather may be a factor.\n\n\u201cIt depends how cold it gets,\u201d said Vols fan Clay Prewitt. \u201cMost people have orange-and-white T-shirts, but jackets? That might change things.\u201d\n\nWhile Barnett recognizes his role in the movement, he says he knows who really made Checker Neyland happen.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything I could say to the fans it\u2019s \u2018thank you for making my little image into what it has become,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for them, it wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nKick-off is at noon Saturday, and football fans around the country will be watching to see if UT fans can successfully \u201cChecker Neyland.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big question is the band,\u201d Prewitt added. \u201cWhat are they going to wear?\u201d?\n\nTim McLeod, one of the web developers responsible for creating checkerneyland.com, expressed his confidence earlier in the week.\n\nMcLeod had a reason to be confident.
