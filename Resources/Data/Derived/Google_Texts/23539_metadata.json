In addition to the Artist Series, the three-production CU Opera season was announced.\n\nJoan McLean Braun, executive director of CU Presents, told the Camera that three widely divergent dance programs will be balanced by three world-class classical events and an unusually audience friendly jazz program with a fresh take on Jackson's popular songs.\n\nThe Artist Series' marquee dates include another pop collaboration for the University Symphony Orchestra with a high-profile guest and a fourth consecutive holiday program with a magnificent ensemble. All Artist Series events begin at 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe series opens Sunday, Sept. 27, with the first visit to Boulder since 1979 of the legendary Twyla Tharp Dance as part of the choreographer's 50th anniversary tour.\n\n\"The dance world owes a tremendous sense of legacy to Twyla Tharp in the evolution of dance style,\" Braun said. Although the performance will include new works, Braun said the program will be retrospective in nature.\n\nOn Friday, Oct. 9, Boulder will experience a unique performance that destroys jazz concert stereotypes. The San Francisco-based SF Jazz Collective plays a set of originals and arrangements celebrating Michael Jackson.\n\nTwyla Tharp celebrates the 50th anniversary of her dance troupe by visiting Boulder for the first time since 1979.

The group, whose 2011 appearance was one of the greatest CU Presents concerts in recent memory, returns by popular demand.\n\nBraun said the group's performance of Beethoven had her on the edge of her seat. The orchestra's appearance has a special Boulder connection, as it will be conducted by founding Tak\u00e1cs String Quartet member G\u00e1bor T\u00e1kacs-Nagy.\n\n\"The current quartet is thrilled about his return,\" Braun said. The orchestra is joined by cellist Istvan Vardai.\n\nThis season's special holiday program, on Friday, Dec. 11, will be given by South Africa's 24-voice Soweto Gospel Choir.\n\n\"The popularity of this event has been a surprise for me,\" Braun said, noting it has not taken audience away from the ever-popular Holiday Festival (which this year is Dec. 4-6). \"For this concert, I'm always looking for something that provides a different experience from typical holiday fare and from the festival. This group fills the heart with respect and awe.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Jan. 21, the Diavolo Dance Co. brings its amazingly physical choreography to Macky.\n\n\"It's got a really gymnastic element, and they use all sorts of apparatus,\" Braun said. \"They like to call it 'architecture in motion.' It's really a 'don't try this at home' sort of thing, like Cirque de Soleil.\"\n\nThe third and final dance program is Sunday, Feb. 14 with Los Angeles-based Bodytraffic.\n\n\"Their West Coast sensibility brings completely new elements,\" Braun said. \"It's like a cultural shift from the east to the west.\"\n\nNoting that Bodytraffic has a female choreographer, Braun said that if the Twyla Tharp program takes a look back, this performance looks into the future.\n\nThe Indigo Girls will be backed by the University Symphony Orchestra on March 31. (Courtesy photo)\n\nOn Tuesday, March 1, in the second classical program, the Metropolitan Opera brings its \"Rising Stars\" program to Macky, presenting opera's future big names at the beginning of their careers.\n\n\"There is a tie-in with our opera program, and they'll be doing some residency work,\" Braun said. The singers will perform arias and ensembles with piano accompaniment.\n\nOn Thursday, March 31, the University Symphony Orchestra will again be joined by a major pop act. Following up on Thursday's sold-out 2014-15 Artist Series finale with Natalie Merchant, the student musicians will back up the Indigo Girls. The duo of Amy Ray and Emily Saliers has been performing for a quarter-century with such hits as \"Closer to Fine\" and \"Land of Canaan.\"\n\n\"It really is a great opportunity for our students to do these pops programs with very little rehearsal time,\" Braun said. \"It's a different kind of playing from their usual classical programs and something they will definitely encounter later in their careers if they join professional orchestras.\"\n\nThe Artist Series closes Friday, April 15, with composer-pianist Pablo Ziegler and classical violinist Lara St. John, who will re-create the famous 1987 Central Park concert by tango master Astor Piazzolla. St. John, who played in Boulder with the Colorado Music Festival in 2013, is an engaging, approachable artist with broad musical tastes.\n\n\"It's bound to be something special when an artist like Lara joins a great tango master like Ziegler,\" Braun said.\n\nCU's Eklund Opera Program season opens Oct. 23-25 with Rossini's \"La Cenerentola.\" Francis Poulenc's \"Dialogues of the Carmelites\" is scheduled for March 11-13. Unlike previous performances of this opera, it will be sung in French instead of English. The chamber opera in the Imig Music Theater on April 22-24 will be Aaron Copland's \"The Tender Land.\"\n\nThe six-concert Tak\u00e1cs Quartet series at Grusin Music Hall includes a guest appearance by the Attacca Quartet.\n\n\"The Tak\u00e1cs loves to introduce young, up-and-coming musicians to their audience,\" Braun said of the guest quartet appearance, which is now a regular feature of the Tak\u00e1cs season.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_27797668/cu-presents-artist-series-eklund-opera-2015-16-season-schedule", "sailthru.author": "By Kelly Dean Hansen \n  Camera Classical Music Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27797668:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-29T09:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Tickets go on sale Monday for diverse 2015-16 schedule that includes Indigo Girls, Twyla Tharp Dance and return of the Irish Chamber Orchestra, as well as the Eklund Opera.", "title": "CU Presents' Artist Series includes jazzy Michael Jackson music", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_27797668/cu-presents-artist-series-eklund-opera-2015-16-season-schedule", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0327/20150327__29DCACUPw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "modificationDate": "2015-03-29T10:14:05-0600", "endDate": "2025-03-27T07:02:08-0600", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado news, Entertainment Boulder news, Entertainment Colorado news, US Entertainment news, world Entertainment news.", "byline": "By Kelly Dean", "pubDate": "2015-03-27T07:52:51-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-03-29T09:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU Presents' Artist Series includes jazzy Michael Jackson music", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0327/20150327__29DCACUPw~3_300.jpg", "description": "Tickets go on sale Monday for diverse 2015-16 schedule that includes Indigo Girls, Twyla Tharp Dance and return of the Irish Chamber Orchestra, as well as the Eklund Opera.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_27797668/cu-presents-artist-series-eklund-opera-2015-16-season-schedule", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Tickets go on sale Monday for diverse 2015-16 schedule that includes Indigo Girls, Twyla Tharp Dance and return of the Irish Chamber Orchestra, as well as the Eklund Opera.", "title": "CU Presents' Artist Series includes jazzy Michael Jackson music"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0327/20150327__29DCACUPw~3.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9651\"", "article_summary": "CU Presents, the performing arts event series affiliated with the University of Colorado's College of Music, is planning a typical diverse Artist Series for 2015-16 that includes a jazz program featuring the music of Michael Jackson.\nThe six-concert Tak\u00e1cs Quartet series at Grusin Music Hall includes a guest appearance by the Attacca Quartet.\nFollowing up on Thursday's sold-out 2014-15 Artist Series finale with Natalie Merchant, the student musicians will back up the Indigo Girls.\nIn addition to the Artist Series, the three-production CU Opera season was announced.\nAll Artist Series events begin at 7:30 p.m."}
