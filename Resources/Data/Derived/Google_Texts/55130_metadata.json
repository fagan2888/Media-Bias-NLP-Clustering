That remaining uninsured population, along with the millions of others looking to enroll or re-enroll in exchange coverage, are the prime targets for this year\u2019s navigators.\n\nWhile some obstacles, like technical glitches, to enrolling the uninsured have been eliminated, navigators don\u2019t necessarily have an easy task. This edition of \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d takes a look at what navigators will have to tackle as open enrollment kicks off.\n\nWhat Navigators Do\n\nFor the last three years, CMS has awarded navigator grants to organizations located in states that rely on HealthCare.gov or operate an exchange in partnership with the federal government. The grants support ACA outreach, as well as navigators who offer in-person, impartial information about health plans, federal subsidies and how to enroll in coverage. States operating their own exchanges also support their own programs to fund navigators. For example, California\u2019s health insurance exchange \u2014 Covered California \u2014 has announced plans to dole out more than $10 million in navigator grants to 68 organizations.\n\nLast month, CMS awarded $67 million in navigator grant awards to 100 organizations in 34 states. However, unlike past navigator grants \u2014 which expired after one year \u2014 the new grants cover a 36-month period, funded in 12-month increments. A CMS spokesperson said the change in funding period aims to improve efficiency, partly by reducing annual startup time, and to provide navigator grant recipients with more consistency each year.\n\nThis Year\u2019s Enrollment Challenges\n\nNavigators face some unique challenges in the ACA\u2019s third open enrollment period.\n\nZach Reat \u2014 director of work supplies initiatives at the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, which has received federal navigator grants for each enrollment period \u2014 said, \u201cMany of the most severe barriers to enrollment that we experienced in the first [open enrollment] period (website failure, lack of coordination between state and federal agencies, inadequate time to prepare navigators and other assisters) have been addressed by this point.\u201d\n\nHowever, he noted, \u201cWe continue to encounter major barriers related to understanding of the law, particularly provisions that help to make coverage affordable.\u201d He added, \u201cPeople are still making decisions about the law based on false or misleading information.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, one of the biggest challenges for navigators this year is the direct result of the past years\u2019 efforts to enroll U.S. residents in coverage: a smaller, harder to reach uninsured population.\n\nAt the national level, the Obama administration in August announced that the uninsured population had dropped by about 33% since 2013.\n\nTia Whitaker, statewide director of outreach and enrollment at the Pennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers, noted that Pennsylvania\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen from about 11% in 2013 to 10.3% in 2014.\n\nIn California, the U.S. Census report showed the uninsured population had fallen from 17.2% in 2013 to 12.4% in 2014. However, the decline makes the uninsured population increasingly harder to reach, according to Camey Christenson \u2014 director of business and partnership development at 2-1-1 San Diego, which is expected to receive a $250,000 grant from Covered California.\n\nAccording to Reat, Ohio\u2019s uninsured population \u201cis smaller, has a higher income due to enrollment in Medicaid expansion, and may still be unaware of financial assistance available to help make health insurance affordable.\u201d\n\nThe New Approaches\n\nTo better address the needs of this year\u2019s uninsured population, navigators are adjusting their strategies and data-tracking efforts.\n\nFor example, Whitaker said her organization will conduct \u201cfocused outreach on special populations,\u201d such as immigrants, seasonal and migrant workers, and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nReat said his organization will continue to focus efforts on \u201cgetting the message about the ACA out in communities with limited English proficiency and rural communities.\u201d He said his organization is going to work with \u201ctrusted messengers\u201d \u2014 agencies or individuals that are trusted within communities \u2014 to share information about available services, particularly in minority communities. In addition, the Ohio Association of Foodbanks manages a multiplatform campaign \u2014 called \u201cAre You Covered?\u201d \u2014 that aims to raise awareness about enrollment and help state residents find local assistance.\n\nIn San Diego, Christenson said that her organization is \u201cusing social media messaging, targeted outreach events and community partnerships to seek the remaining uninsured.\u201d\n\nChristenson also noted that her organization has updated its metrics to gauge success focusing on the number of individuals who renew health plans through Covered California, as opposed to outreach and enrollment numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, Whitaker\u2019s organization \u2014 which has relied on an online, HIPAA-compliant database to track enrollment data \u2014 has expanded the metrics it collects to include breakdowns of language categories and Healthy PA enrollments. Healthy PA is Pennsylvania\u2019s expanded Medicaid program.\n\nThe Future of Navigators\n\nWhile navigators across the country have helped enroll millions of U.S. residents in exchange coverage, some have raised questions about the program\u2019s sustainability.\n\nAustin Bordelon of Leavitt Partners in a blog post wrote that some state-run health insurance exchanges \u2014 including Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Vermont \u2014 have experienced budget deficits or raised concerns about staying on budget in the future.\n\nHHS also has acknowledge some budget issues, noting that premium assessments charged to participating insurers are not sufficiently covering the federal exchange\u2019s operating costs, according to Bordelon.\n\nAlthough he noted that navigator programs will continue because they are required under the ACA, he expects \u201cmarketplaces to prioritize funding for alternative outreach programs that are capable of reaching a broader audience at a lower incremental cost,\u201d adding, \u201cThis could include giving preference to dollars used for marketing and media ad-buys, or even system enhancements that encourage additional involvement from agents and brokers.\u201d\n\nTracy Gnadinger in a Health Affairs policy brief also raised concerns about the sustainability of navigators and the growing role health insurance brokers will play in enrollment. She noted that when funding for navigators decreased for the second open enrollment period, \u201csome states began cultivating a closer relationship with brokers to maximize enrollment.\u201d\n\nGnadinger highlighted the potential conflicts brokers, who typically are paid a commission from insurers, present, as they are not required by law to inform consumers about all available policies.\n\nThe role of navigators in \u201ceducating the public on the [ACA\u2019s] requirement to have insurance, assisting with enrollment, answering difficult eligibility questions, engaging hard-to-reach populations and helping people understand how to use their insurance once they purchase a policy\u201d is \u201cas important as ever,\u201d Gnadinger argued.\n\nAround the Nation\n\nRepeal and replace. Jeb Bush, former Florida governor and current Republican presidential candidate, has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and allow states a greater role in transitioning to a new replacement plan, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHealthCare.gov\u2019s facelift.
