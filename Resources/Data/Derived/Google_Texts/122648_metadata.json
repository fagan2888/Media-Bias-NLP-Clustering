'I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.' | John Shinkle/POLITICO Mikulski on budget: Getting close\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski said Monday she is \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the progress made in talks with the House and believes the two sides are within \u201cstriking distance\u201d of reaching agreement this week on a long-sought omnibus bill to keep the government funded through September.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat conceded that \u201csticking points\u201d remain over President Barack Obama\u2019s health care program and financial reforms, as well as new education initiatives for preschool-age children. But her tone was consistently positive in a short hallway interview, and she seemed confident that there is a path to resolve the final issues.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged. I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress,\u201d Mikulski said. \u201cWe\u2019re within striking distance. I think we\u2019re going to get it.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Budget battle nears finish line)\n\nHundreds of pages long, the $1 trillion-plus measure will literally touch every corner of government and is a crucial second step following on the bipartisan budget agreement reached in December.\n\nMuch as the December deal set new caps for spending by Congress, the bill now spells out where those dollars go. Its very scope and detail invite conflict, which makes the House-Senate talks such a challenge. But the whole endeavor has huge implications for the Appropriations leadership and Congress more broadly after the turmoil of recent years.\n\nSpeed is essential given the deadlines ahead.\n\nThe government remains under a stopgap continuing resolution or CR due to expire on Jan. 15 and Congress leaves soon after for its mid-January recess. As a practical matter, some extension of the CR will be needed \u2014 and should not be controversial if the omnibus is proceeding on course. But the Appropriations leadership wants to keep any extension short so that the pressure is on to complete passage before lawmakers leave Jan. 17.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Hillary Clinton's shadow campaign)\n\nWeather delayed a meeting planned Monday between Mikulski and her House counterpart, Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) \u2014 \u201csnowbound in Louisville,\u201d she said. But the two were expected to talk, and Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate panel, was described as also supportive of getting a bill.\n\nShelby is an important player as the former Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee chairman and an opponent of Obama\u2019s financial reforms. He also stood out last month for his opposition to the December deal, which was strongly backed by Rogers.\n\nBut the senator\u2019s spokesman, Jonathan Graffeo, said Shelby has been working \u201cside by side\u201d with Mikulski \u201cto reach an agreement that they can both support.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are big for the White House and Obama\u2019s Cabinet as well. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, has brought a greater energy to the task, and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has worked the phones with Republicans as well as Democrats in an uphill fight to move ahead with reforms at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Senate seems poised to reject jobless benefits)\n\nBut Lew stands out for his willingness to work both sides of the aisle \u2014 something many in Obama\u2019s Cabinet fail to do. And Obama is paying a price for hasty concessions in the past and his often feckless approach to appropriations generally.\n\nFor example, the administration had requested $4.8 billion in fiscal 2013 for the program management account within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \u2014 the chief source of discretionary funds to implement the president\u2019s health care reforms.\n\nBut the White House then settled for just $3.8 billion last spring \u2014 a number that only got worse with sequestration.\n\nThrough the summer, the administration was able to buy time by tapping into mandatory funds, authorized by the Affordable Care Act and separate from appropriations. But these wells are beginning to run dry.\n\n( PHOTOS: Stars who might jump into politics)\n\nA $1 billion implementation fund created by ACA is largely depleted, for example. And the White House\u2019s own allies were upset when it took more than $450 million out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, a priority for Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nAttention is now focused more on a third, separate innovation fund, which received a lump sum $10 billion appropriation over 10 years under ACA. The money is intended to explore new ways to reduce costs and improve services for Medicare and Medicaid, not to implement health reform per se. But it could be a way to meet CMS needs here, thereby freeing up more discretionary money in the program management account.\n\nIn the case of Obama\u2019s financial reforms, the dollars for regulatory agencies are far less \u2014 even as they affect the conduct of far greater markets.\n\nA case in point is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which was assigned a greater role over derivative markets under the Dodd-Frank law in 2010 but has met strong resistance from conservatives like Shelby who hold the purse strings.\n\nIn the wake of sequestration, the current appropriation for the CFTC is $194.6 million \u2014 more than one-third less than Obama requested. Indeed, it is also less than the agency received in 2011 and 2012, and in terms of personnel, the staff of 652 at the CFTC today is about 50 fewer than what the agency had 15 months ago at the end of fiscal 2012.\n\nMikulski\u2019s reference to Obama\u2019s preschool education initiatives is a measure too of how tight the overall caps remain even with the adjustments allowed in the December budget.\n\nNondefense spending will be restored to $491.8 billion \u2014 roughly the same levels as before the March sequestration cuts. But that\u2019s far less than President George W. Bush enjoyed at the end of his administration in 2008 and it will require Mikulski to cut $14 billion from the domestic spending bills that her committee approved over the summer.\n\nBack then, adding $750 million for preschool development grants in the Education Department was doable. Now it is harder, and even powerhouses like the National Institutes of Health may find it hard to get back to just the level promised last spring.\n\nRogers must worry too about selling a package that will have far less for the Pentagon than the defense appropriations bill that he helped pass in the House in July. But negotiators have helped themselves here by using a higher number for overseas contingency or OCO funds than the administration asked for in its final budget request.\n\nThis is not out of line with the House budget resolution, which also used the higher number. But it does buy some precious leeway for security accounts, since OCO dollars are counted outside the caps. And the December budget agreement was silent on the subject of what number to use.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Maryland Democrat is optimistic but concedes that \u201csticking points\u201d remain over Obamacare.", "title": "Mikulski on budget: Getting close", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/senate-appropriations-chairwoman-barbara-mikulski-budget-congress-101797.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/06/06/130606_barbara_mikulski_shinkle_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Obamacare,Senate,Budget,Barbara Mikulski,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Maryland Democrat is optimistic but concedes that \u201csticking points\u201d remain over Obamacare.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd001d\"", "article_summary": "This is not out of line with the House budget resolution, which also used the higher number.\nThe Maryland Democrat conceded that \u201csticking points\u201d remain over President Barack Obama\u2019s health care program and financial reforms, as well as new education initiatives for preschool-age children.\nAnd the December budget agreement was silent on the subject of what number to use.\n| John Shinkle/POLITICO Mikulski on budget: Getting closeSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski said Monday she is \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the progress made in talks with the House and believes the two sides are within \u201cstriking distance\u201d of reaching agreement this week on a long-sought omnibus bill to keep the government funded through September.\n( PHOTOS: Stars who might jump into politics)A $1 billion implementation fund created by ACA is largely depleted, for example."}
