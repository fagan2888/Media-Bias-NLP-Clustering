Conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer said the “electric moment” at Thursday’s Republican debate was when Marco Rubio repeatedly challenged Donald Trump to share details about his health care plan — something the billionaire businessman struggled to do.

“It was not exactly the subject you would have thought would spark this, but that’s when Rubio used ridicule in going after Trump on his so-called solution or replacement for Obamacare,” Krauthammer said.

The syndicated columnist continued, “And what he did is he tried to show…that there was really nothing there in the Trump proposal.”

Krauthammer added, “And the moment that was most remarkable, and obviously spontaneous, was when Rubio said, ‘Well, you’ve just repeated yourself within the five minutes.’ That I think is going to be the one that is going to be replayed.”
