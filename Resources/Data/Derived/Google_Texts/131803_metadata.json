(USATSI)\n\nMore: O'Bannon news | On CFB: Dennis Dodd | Jeremy Fowler | Jon Solomon\n\nNear the end of a 99-page decision in the Ed O'Bannon lawsuit on Aug. 8, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken reminded everyone she's not the savior of college sports. She's simply a judge who handed down a high-profile, highly-debated opinion in a case that was narrowly defined.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that the challenged restraints, as well as other perceived inequities in college athletics and higher education generally, could be better addressed as a policy matter by reforms other than those available as a remedy for the antitrust violation found here,\u201d Wilken wrote. \u201cSuch reforms and remedies could be undertaken by the NCAA, its member schools and conferences, or Congress.\u201d\n\nYes, Congress -- which may be even more unfavorable to the public than the NCAA -- may play a role in shaping the future of college sports. To what extent Congress could get involved is being debated within college sports, including the possibility of the NCAA seeking an antitrust exemption to protect the association's amateurism principle.\n\nOn the horizon for college sports is the Martin Jenkins antitrust lawsuit brought by attorney Jeffrey Kessler, who seeks a free market for college athletes. Some legal experts believe the O'Bannon ruling, which will be appealed, gave Kessler an easier path toward success by striking down some of the NCAA's antitrust defenses. Still pending is an appeal by Northwestern of a ruling by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board that Northwestern football players are employees who can unionize.\n\nThe NCAA has reached the point on unfavorable legal rulings that retiring University System of Maryland chancellor William Kirwan, co-chair of the reform-minded Knight Commission, said he now views Congress as \u201cour last, best hope for getting anything right with intercollegiate athletics.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported July 30 that NCAA president Mark Emmert \u201cacknowledged the discussions about an exemption and said he could envision winning political support for such a move.\u201d NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn said Emmert's quote was referring to winning political support within the membership.\n\nEmmert, who was not made available for an interview for this article, has made a couple appearances on political TV talks shows in recent months. He testified before a Senate committee hearing last month.\n\nIn April, the NCAA hired outside lobbyists for the first time since 1998, signing up with Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. The Big 12 hired the same firm. The NCAA's lobbyists include Elizabeth Gore, who was chief of staff and legislative director to former Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.); Marc Lampkin, who advertises that he was named one of the Hill's top 50 lobbyists and works closely with House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans; and Elizabeth Maier, who was legislative director for former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Az.).\n\nOpenSecrets.org reported that as of June 30, the NCAA had already spent a yearly record of $240,000 on lobbying expenses in 2014. That's up from $160,000 the NCAA spent on lobbying in 2013.\n\nMarc Edelman, a law professor at Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business, said although he thinks Congress giving the NCAA immunity would be \u201coutrageous,\u201d he believes it's possible. Edelman noted that Congress passed in 2004 the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act, which included parts of the NCAA bylaws related to agents providing anything of value to players.\n\n\u201cBecause the NCAA could convince Congress in 2004 to pass legislation to protect its interest and to the detriment of college athletes, it would not be beyond the realm of possibility the NCAA would be able to do that again,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nRep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a critic of the NCAA's who proposed a bill last year related to college athlete rights, said he cannot imagine Congress granting an exemption to the NCAA.\n\n\u201cGood luck with getting those votes given the NCAA's track record and the performance of Dr. Emmert in front of the Senate,\u201d Dent said. \u201cEverybody knows that big-time college football and basketball are the minor leagues for the NFL and NBA. It's professional sports operating under the umbrella of amateur athletics. I'm not here to endorse that, but that's the reality of what it is even if people don't want to call it that. The NCAA says it's all about amateurism, but they have a professional operation there.\u201d\n\nCongress is watching NCAA\n\nBig 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby said it's too soon to talk about legislative relief given that some of the NCAA's problems can be solved by providing athletes with new benefits through the new Division I model that was passed Aug. 7.\n\n\u201cWe ought to work toward solving our problems with our new prerogatives and opportunities with the new governance model,\u201d Bowlsby said. \u201cIf we get highly unfavorable judicial outcomes in some of these lawsuits and it looks like they might be replicable again in the future, it may be some form of legislative relief may be desirable.\u201d\n\nPac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said he sees no need for outside involvement or \u201cradical changes\u201d by the legal system.\n\n\u201cI think the knock on the NCAA has been historically it's had entrenched positions and is not able to get out of its own way,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThe new model increases the possibility that we can seek significant changes. Now, it's incumbent on the five conferences to pass those changes, and I think you'll see meaningful and impactful changes in the next few months. Everybody would be right to take a watch-and-see approach.\u201d\n\nLarry Scott and others are hoping to keep the government out of the college sports battle. (USATSI)\n\nCongress is watching. Two hearings have been held in recent months. Letters seeking answers from the NCAA have been exchanged back and forth. Two bills have been introduced in the House.\n\nIn July, Senate Commerce Committee chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-W. Va) said that if the Democrats \u201ccontrol Congress next time \u2026 we want to make this a continuing subject of this oversight committee. We have oversight of sports. All sports. We have the ability to subpoena. We have a special investigative unit. We are very into this subject. This is part of a process here.\u201d\n\nOf course, Rockefeller isn't running for re-election in 2014. Not to mention, the track record of Congress reaching across the aisle for solutions about anything in America isn't very good.\n\nAt the Senate hearing in July, Emmert said he believes the NCAA will \u201cwind up in the right place in a couple months\u201d after NCAA governance changes happen. \u201cIf we don't, I'm sure we'll have these conversations again.\u201d\n\nRep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.) and Dent recently created a bipartisan caucus to inform Congressional members about physical, academic and financial issues college athletes face so they are treated fairly.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a lot more important things going on in our country, but the health and well-being of our 18- to 22-year-olds is important as well,\u201d Cardenas said. \u201cThere are over 400,000 athletes on any given day. That's a lot of young, bright people that need to be appreciated and have the kind of protections and balance they deserve.\u201d\n\nEven Cardenas acknowledges there's an uphill battle for Congress to tackle the NCAA. Last November, Cardenas introduced a bill requiring schools with high-resourced sports programs to give athletes a package of benefits, such as continuing to pay for their education when a scholarship is lifted for reasons other than discipline or academic reasons. The bill has not gotten to a hearing. Cardenas said he hopes the legislation can be introduced to other members once the caucus is built up.\n\nAnother bill brought by Dent and Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) last August would restrict Title IV funds to colleges that are a member of an athletic association that fails to establish minimum requirements for health and safety, financial aid and the NCAA infractions process. (Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 covers the administration of federal student financial aid programs.) That bill also has not reached a hearing yet.\n\nInstead of an antitrust exemption, Cardenas said he wants to build laws that provide requirements for the NCAA. But Congress can be influenced by the power of universities and relationships with high-profile coaches, Cardenas said.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of people who have a soft spot in their heart for their alma mater,\u201d Cardenas said. \u201cIf they take that emotion out, hopefully we have Congress putting their foot down and saying this has gone on too long, the dynamics are evolving, and part of that should be better awareness of what these kids are going through. The fact that a kid could be a top-three pick going to college, he gets injured, and before you know it he's out on the street is wrong.\u201d\n\nCardenas acknowledged he's likely in the minority in Congress who's interested in taking on NCAA issues, \u201cbut when you look at the momentum going on in courts, you may have a critical mass of members who say soon this is something we have to address.\u201d\n\nWilken's injunction in O'Bannon would allow universities to give licensing money to players upon leaving college. The NCAA could choose to cap the licensing money at no less than $5,000 per year.\n\nKirwan, the Maryland chancellor, believes the $5,000 figure is ripe to be challenged in court. An antitrust exemption would be a high-risk, high-reward proposition, said Kirwan, who expressed being \u201cvery pleased\u201d that the O'Bannon ruling allows players to be paid for their names, images and likenesses.\n\n\u201cI'm not naive about this,\u201d Kirwan said. \u201cI realize that if Congress does take on this issue and considers an antitrust provision, it's not completely clear where it would all end up. The market forces, particularly the big television and commercialization forces, will have very powerful and well-compensated lobbyists working all of Congress. We could end up with even worse commercialism of intercollegiate athletics. On the other hand, with the right kind of counsel to Congress, we could see some very positive things coming out of Congressional scrutiny.\u201d\n\nNCAA model \u2018is unraveling' like USSR\n\nThe NCAA has debated for many years whether to seek antitrust protection. Back in 1991, then-Congressman Tom McMillen unsuccessfully introduced a bill to restore a limited antitrust exemption allowing the NCAA to regain the right to negotiate all TV contracts. In exchange for that limited exemption, McMillen wanted the NCAA to distribute TV revenue based less on won-loss records and more on educational values, such as academic performance and Title IX compliance.\n\nToday, McMillen says it would be \u201cludicrous\u201d to give the NCAA immunity and questions how the NCAA would get enough votes, given likely opposition from liberal Democrats and organized labor. The United Steelworkers are helping to fund the unionization efforts to make Northwestern football players employees.\n\nBut McMillen, now a board member at the University of Maryland, does see an opportunity for Congress to play a role. He recommends President Barack Obama and Congress form a presidential commission on college athletics, similar to the President's Commission on Olympic Sports created by President Gerald Ford in 1975.\n\nThe Olympic commission came in response to conflicts among the NCAA, Amateur Athletic Union and U.S. Olympic Committee over athletes' rights and the amateur status of participants in games. The issue also got pushed by America's international struggles in the Olympics.\n\nThe commission led to the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act of 1978, which established the USOC as the coordinating Olympic body in the U.S. The act chartered a national governing body for each sport and required that active athletes have a 20 percent share of the voting seats on each of the 39 new U.S. Olympic committees. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee expunged the word \u201camateur\u201d from its bylaws. Media rights for the Olympics have skyrocketed in recent decades, contrary to predictions that the public wouldn't want the Olympics with pro athletes.\n\n\u201cStrangely enough, I think creating a similar commission for intercollegiate athletics is an area Congress and the president could work together on,\u201d McMillen said. \u201cOne thing America cannot afford to do is allow these great universities to have the tail wagging the dog due to sports.\u201d\n\nMichael Hausfeld, an attorney for the O'Bannon plaintiffs, said the NCAA often considers seeking an exemption \u201cbecause they understand their exposure. You seek an exemption when you know you have exposure and you hope Congress can cover it.\u201d\n\nNebraska law professor and faculty athletic representative Jo Potuto said the NCAA should have no rule banning players from using their name and likeness to be paid. She likens it to actress Emma Watson being paid for appearing in movies while a student at Brown and still participating in theater performances at the university.\n\n\u201cThe athletic world is worried that boosters will just bid up to get players,\u201d said Potuto, former chair of the Division I infractions committee. \u201cEvery time the athletics world has worried about a parade of horribles, they've overstated what the parade of horribles might be. I don't discount there will be a bidding war for players, but I don't think people would be paying thousands and thousands of dollars for most players. Maybe the most talented players would get benefits. It seems to me there should be a way for group licenses.\u201d\n\nPotuto predicts mid-level schools will try to keep up with the Power 5 conferences' benefits by cutting some non-revenue sports because they won't want to reduce salaries for coaches in major sports. \u201cIt will be a different group paying the piper on it,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer NCAA vice president Wally Renfro, who for years debated internally whether Congress should help the NCAA, said an exemption would be difficult to get. He sees value in the exemption if it lowers the frequency of litigation -- \"these suits are almost entirely about settlements\" -- but he sees ways around managing costs if there's a cap of on expenses.\n\n\u201cLet's say everybody agrees you should set some sort of cap on coaches' salaries,\u201d Renfro said. \u201cI don't think it takes a lot of imagination for an institution to tell a coach you're paid X, but a whole lot of other people would be willing to publish your book and we'd pay X for that. Pretty soon you have all kinds of ingenious ways that have nothing to do with institutions. In America, you can have a cap on how much a particular employee can get. You can't put a cap on how much a person can earn.\u201d\n\nUnless you're an NCAA athlete.\n\nMcMillen said the O'Bannon ruling shows public sentiment will continue to move against the NCAA regarding the rights of players.\n\n\"You can only put so many fingers in the dikes,\u201d McMillen said. \u201cI think it's clear that the old model is unraveling, it's just a matter of time. It reminds me of the Soviet Union trying to keep the old USSR together, and all of a sudden it just broke apart one day. The model is built out of a very flimsy facade that's falling down.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea that players have no rights and they're student-athletes and they're not supposed to get anything is just so antiquated. When you go down the commercial road so far, you better be prepared for the commercial consequences. We have swung so far down the commercial road that it may be difficult to turn it back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States Congress and its current, single-digit approval rating could get involved in the NCAA's various crises.", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "description": "The United States Congress and its current, single-digit approval rating could get involved in the NCAA's various crises.", "title": "Can Congress (yes, Congress) help NCAA find solutions?", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/jon-solomon/24666147/can-congress-yes-congress-help-ncaa-find-solutions", "image": "http://cbssports.com/images/collegefootball/Mark-Emmert-NCAA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The United States Congress and its current, single-digit approval rating could get involved in the NCAA's various crises.", "title": "Can Congress (yes, Congress) help NCAA find solutions?", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/jon-solomon/24666147/can-congress-yes-congress-help-ncaa-find-solutions", "image": "http://cbssports.com/images/collegefootball/Mark-Emmert-NCAA.jpg", "creator": "@JonSolomonCBS", "site": "@cbssports", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297742330311988, "pages": 25902406772}, "vr": {"content_id": 24666147, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "sports news scores information, NFL football MLB baseball NBA basketball live scores news standings teams players, NCAA college basketball football scores news polls rankings, fantasy football news player rankings advice, fantasy baseball basketball news, CBS fantasy sports, golf tennis soccer autos auto racing tour de france, summer winter Olympics, CBSSports.com Sports Line, CBS SportsLine.com", "googlebot": "NOODP"}, "article_summary": "Instead of an antitrust exemption, Cardenas said he wants to build laws that provide requirements for the NCAA.\nFormer NCAA vice president Wally Renfro, who for years debated internally whether Congress should help the NCAA, said an exemption would be difficult to get.\nTo what extent Congress could get involved is being debated within college sports, including the possibility of the NCAA seeking an antitrust exemption to protect the association's amateurism principle.\nOn the horizon for college sports is the Martin Jenkins antitrust lawsuit brought by attorney Jeffrey Kessler, who seeks a free market for college athletes.\nBack in 1991, then-Congressman Tom McMillen unsuccessfully introduced a bill to restore a limited antitrust exemption allowing the NCAA to regain the right to negotiate all TV contracts."}
