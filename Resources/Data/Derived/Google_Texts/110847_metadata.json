Visual Concepts LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-00724.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Take-Two Interactive Software Inc has been hit with a copyright i", "title": "Video game featuring LeBron James, Kobe Bryant tattoos sparks lawsuit", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/01/Video-game-featuring-LeBron-James-Kobe-Bryant-tattoos-sparks-lawsuit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nba_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/01/Video-game-featuring-LeBron-James-Kobe-Bryant-tattoos-sparks-lawsuit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nba_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Take-Two Interactive Software Inc has been hit with a copyright i", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29d8\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Take-Two Interactive Software Inc has been hit with a copyright infringement lawsuit over its depiction of tattoos belonging to National Basketball Association stars LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in a popular video game.\nDarren Heitner, a lawyer for Solid Oak, declined to elaborate on the complaint.\nThe case is Solid Oak Sketches LLC v.
