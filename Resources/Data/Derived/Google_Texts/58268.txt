The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell, visited Houston as part of a tour of Texas cities. Burwell urged people to shop for health coverage on the federal insurance marketplace, which opens for business Nov. 1.

Burwell toured a Harris Health safety-net clinic in Alief, and tried to reassure people who still think health insurance won’t work within their limited budgets. Depending on income, many people will be eligible for public subsidies to reduce the monthly premium cost.

“About 8 out of 10 folks that are currently enrolled could come in and find a plan with a premium that is $100 or less,” Burwell said. “For about 7 in 10 of those folks, it can be a $75 premium or less, in terms of that affordability issue.”

Texas has the most uninsured people in the country. Only about a quarter of Texans who are eligible have signed up for the plans on healthcare.gov. In 2016, the penalty for not being insured rises to $695, or two percent of income, whichever is higher.

Burwell said the federal government has worked to speed up the insurance website, and this year has included an online “cost estimator” so shoppers can understand the combined cost involved in each coverage option, including monthly premium, deductibles, and co-payments. The deadline to enroll for 2016 coverage is Jan. 31. For coverage that begins January 1, enrollment must be completed by Dec. 15.
