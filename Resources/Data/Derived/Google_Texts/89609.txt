Brookings, SD

A yearly tradition is back on the South Dakota State campus today. The 102nd Hobo Day brings Jackrabbits of past and present to Brookings.

It was a full day of events today in Brookings to celebrate the homecoming tradition that was started way back in 1912.

There was a parade that went through Campus and downtown Brookings this morning. Before the football game kicked-off thousands of people tailgated outside of Coughlin Alumni Stadium. According to the Universities website, Hobo Day is The Biggest One-Day Event in the Dakotas. Senior Daniel Paluch says today is about honoring tradition.

“Hobo Day is 102 years of having fun, enjoying SDSU, and just honoring the Jackrabbits,” Paluch said.

The festivities continue tonight with a Hobo Night Live going on a ballroom at the SDSU campus.

While it's a fun time for the students and alumni, it's also a big money maker for the community. We will talk with a local business about what Hobo Day means for its bottom line coming up tonight on KELOLAND Weekend News at 10.
