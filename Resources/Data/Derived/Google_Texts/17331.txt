Heppner Family Chiropractic & Wellness

Choosing a chiropractor is one of the most important decisions you can make. You want someone who is caring, knowledgeable and accessible. Someone willing to take the time to go over all of your options and treat you as a person, not just a patient. We treat every person as an individual. We recognize that your history is as unique as the condition we are seeing you for. We pledge to take the time to arrive at your diagnosis and deliver care with speed and accuracy. Finally, we will explain and teach each individual about their specific condition as a way to help them in the future. At Heppner Family Chiropractic and Wellness Center, we pride ourselves on quality patient service. Our goal is to listen to your health concerns and design a specialized treatment program with your specific needs in mind. We focus on finding the underlying cause of your health problem, removing this cause, and restoring your optimum health. We offer Massage Therapy Services by Bob DeGregory!
