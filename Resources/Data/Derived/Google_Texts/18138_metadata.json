The judicial panel launched a fresh inquiry last month, after Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane made public a troubling set of Eakin emails and lambasted the conduct board, suggesting it had given him a pass.\n\nLast week, The Inquirer reported that one of the board's members had himself received offensive emails - many containing pornographic content - from another Supreme Court justice and other law enforcement officials.\n\nRobert Graci, the board's lawyer, has declined/ to say whether the member, former Philadelphia police commander Eugene Dooley, now chief of police in East Whiteland township, Chester County, had recused himself from the vote to clear Eakin last year.\n\nThe Philadelphia Daily News reported that Graci, a former Superior Court judge who has been the board's counsel since 2012, had worked on Eakin's 2011 retention campaign and has been described as a \"longtime Eakin friend.\"\n\nGraci does not have a vote on the board, but he does oversee its staff attorneys and investigators.\n\nHe has said he will step aside from any further involvement in the renewed Eakin investigation.\n\nacouloumbis@phillynews.com\n\n717-787-5934\n\n@AngelasInk", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"url": "http://articles.philly.com/2015-11-21/news/68443645_1_judicial-discipline-inquiry-michael-eakin", "type": "article", "site_name": "philly-archives", "description": "HARRISBURG - Confronting criticism that earlier reviews of his offensive emails were too lenient, Supreme Court Justice J.
