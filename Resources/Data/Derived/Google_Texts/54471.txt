Really? What were they thinking?

It’s the question that The Post-Standard’s editorial board is asking some of Liverpool High School’s football fans who made the reckless decisions to wear Native headdress, feathers and T-shirts with “Tribe” on the front of them to their homecoming game.

The paper wrote in their editorial that “High school students with an ounce of schooling in American history are well aware of the ‘cowboys and Indians’' stereotypes they are perpetuating.” And they won’t accept the “kids will be kids” excuse from the school, especially in a district that’s previously been warned about how offensive Native mascots can be.

Thirteen years ago, high schools in the same district as Liverpool’s were urged to back away from using Native American names and mascots, according to the paper. Most recently, a high school in Cooperstown, New York, which is just under two hours away from Liverpool, retired their Redskins mascot. And with the ongoing debate about the R-word in clear focus for this year’s NFL season, it’s unlikely that the “no appropriation” message can be ignored.

The school, which is located in upstate New York, has yet to issue an apology.
