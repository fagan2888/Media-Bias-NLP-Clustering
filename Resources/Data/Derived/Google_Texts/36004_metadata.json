A buzzword in newspaper columns, an image from a fading political campaign \u2014 even a dog whistle depending on where you stand on the political spectrum.\n\nBut here in the North Country, visible reminders of a government run amok cruise our streets daily.\n\nMedicaid taxis.\n\nEssex County spent $2.5 million last year paying for medical transportation for Medicaid recipients \u2014\n\nAll 378 of them.\n\nNow this would be ludicrous enough if these were all legitimate trips by patients in need of medical treatment.\n\nAfter all, for $6,613 per person, you could buy them each a very nice used car for that amount.\n\nBut we\u2019re doubtful considering the horror stories we\u2019ve been hearing since a heroic Essex County whistleblower blew the roof off this crooked scam last summer \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s pretty ingenious:\n\nIncorporate a cab company. Link up to the state\u2019s registry. Drive people to wherever they want to go. Then stick state and federal taxpayers with the bill.\n\nDo it again and again until you turn a tidy profit.\n\nBoom, you\u2019re on cruise control. Just don\u2019t get caught.\n\nNew York State caps county Medicaid costs at $6.9 million annually. As such, local governments generally incorporate that number into their spending plans, thank the heavens that it\u2019s not higher and go on with their daily business.\n\nThat means attention isn\u2019t really focused on this industry until one of the operators raises eyebrows with their misbehavior.\n\nLike getting into a fender bender.\n\nOr violating privacy procedures.\n\nOr, in the case of one Broome County operator, bombing around in an unlicensed vehicle while allegedly defrauding the government of $80,000 within two years.\n\nMore are inevitably out there, haunting the streets.\n\nNo checks, no balances.\n\nBut the state doesn\u2019t seem to be putting the brakes on this mutant industry, which has mushroomed overnight.\n\nIn July 2012, the state health department shifted the responsibility from counties to provide Medicaid transportation to a private company based in Syracuse.\n\nDoing so, they said, would save the state money as it continues to embark on Medicaid reforms.\n\nBut figures are scant because the health department isn\u2019t talking.\n\nWhile oversight mechanisms are said to exist, the health department isn\u2019t dishing on those, either.\n\nThis opacity has even been noted by the state comptroller\u2019s office, who said in a report last year that an unfortunate \u201cside effect\u201d of the state\u2019s move to managed care has been reduced transparency with regard to the use of Medicaid dollars.\n\nEven county officials are skeptical that complaints are being reviewed in an expedient manner.\n\nNow that local officials are getting wise to the issue, discussions about possible regulations have begun to percolate to the surface.\n\nIt\u2019s a noble cause.\n\nBut is the solution of big government more government?\n\nWe\u2019re skeptical.\n\nTo us, this unfairly penalizes law-abiding citizens at the expense of the fraudulent few.\n\nIt really is a microcosm of the bigger problems in our country.\n\nNot only is the state\u2019s Medicaid transport industry warped, but so is the overall entitlement system.\n\nBarron\u2019s recently likened the relationship states have with the federal government\u2019s Medicaid program as a \u201cthree-card monte,\u201d a cozy relationship that relies on an incestuous cycle to keep the dollars flowing \u2014 even more so now that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land.\n\nWe agree.\n\nBut we also acknowledge that health care is an enormously complex issue that can\u2019t be summarized in soundbites.\n\nAnd because Medicaid plays such a large role in our state\u2019s overall health care system, we understand efforts to limit spending could lead to the costs being shifted into the public sector.\n\nAs such, we agree with the comptroller that the state health department should continue to be transparent on each major step in this major overall.\n\nBecause right now, this waste is enough to give anyone a heart attack.\n\nThe good news is, beep beep, folks \u2014 a free ride to the hospital is just a phone call away.\n\nThe Sun Community News Editorial Board is comprised of Dan Alexander, John Gereau, Pete DeMola and Keith Lobdell.
