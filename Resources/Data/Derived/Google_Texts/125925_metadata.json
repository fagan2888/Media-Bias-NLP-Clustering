For a lucky few, 7 a.m. is early enough. For many, an alarm set for 6 a.m. or even 5 a.m. is necessary to shower, dress, eat (sometimes) and get to school by the bell.\n\nA student in bed by 10 p.m. can get eight hours of sleep and still wake by 6 a.m. But don't be fooled \u2014 experts say teens need nine hours of sleep, and left to our own devices most of us can easily sleep 12 hours. Unfortunately even eight hours is a pipe dream. Teen bodies don't start releasing sleep-inducing melatonin, a hormone, until nearly 11 p.m., a bedtime that, coupled with a 6 a.m. wake-up call, would only allow seven hours of sleep. Many kids get by on six hours or less.\n\nThe point is, American teenagers are chronically sleep deprived \u2014 I know, because I'm one \u2014 and a large body of scientific evidence demonstrates that this is bad for their mental and physical health. As a result of early school start times \u2014 most American high schools start before 8 a.m. \u2014 millions of students are about to embark on another school year that they will spend largely entombed in fatigue. Their grades will suffer for it.\n\nActually, not just their grades. Under-rested teens show higher resistance to insulin, which can lead to diabetes. A dearth of sleep in teens has also been linked to depression and auto accidents. In one study, adolescents who got less than seven hours of sleep nightly thought of suicide more \u2014 and tried it more \u2014 compared with those who slept at least nine hours.\n\nIn short, early morning school schedules harm teens. They can even kill.\n\nWhy are we stuck with such early high school start times? Two of the problems are sports and homework. If school started later, it would end later. Then sports would have to occur in the dark, and kids would still be up late because they'd start homework later. But it's OK for us to be awake past 11 p.m. if we don't have to get up until 8 a.m., and by the time the sun is setting early enough to be a problem, outdoor sports seasons end. As for homework, how about if we dispense with the mindless busywork that accounts for such a large chunk of it? Sleeping would be a better use of students' time, and probably do more to improve learning.\n\nI care about my studies, but on some occasions I've slept through half of my favorite classes, and entire periods of others. Darkened rooms are particularly soporific. Rarely have I been chastised; teachers are more reasonable than they get credit for, and understand the rigors of a full high school schedule. The problem is that I miss important stuff. It's hard to approach a teacher, no matter how reasonable, to ask: \"Will you explain the lesson to me? I slept through it.\"\n\nIt's time, at last, to start high school days later, and perhaps start grade school days earlier. Changing high school start times has been discussed for years. The problem is that kids don't vote in school board elections, and don't have much say in school policy. Adult bodies, unlike those of teens, are made for early to bed, early to rise, so teachers and administrators have no problem with the schedule. And in too many minds, an inability to get up early equates with laziness.\n\nThe next time you read some article about the poor academic performance of high school students, ask yourself how well you'd do at physics, chemistry, math, history, literature and foreign language when all you really want to do is get some sleep.\n\nDavid Akst is a rising senior at Red Hook High School.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/opinion/2014/08/16/column-school-education-time/14175171/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "American teenagers are chronically sleep deprived", "og": {"site_name": "The Poughkeepsie Journal", "description": "American teenagers are chronically sleep deprived", "title": "Valley View: Teens aren't made to wake up early", "url": "http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/opinion/2014/08/16/column-school-education-time/14175171/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/poughkeepsiejournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "American teenagers are chronically sleep deprived", "creator": "@pokjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/594f354a119e3389da6718195254eef32b2dbc77/c=0-160-960-1120&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Poughkeepsie/2014/08/16/akst.jpg", "title": "Valley View: Teens aren't made to wake up early", "site": "@pokjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=820459961", "fb": {"app_id": 179935365368749}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Column, school ,education, sleep deprived"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf617\"", "article_summary": "Why are we stuck with such early high school start times?\nAdult bodies, unlike those of teens, are made for early to bed, early to rise, so teachers and administrators have no problem with the schedule.\nIt's time, at last, to start high school days later, and perhaps start grade school days earlier.\nChanging high school start times has been discussed for years.\nA student in bed by 10 p.m. can get eight hours of sleep and still wake by 6 a.m."}
