(Photo: staff photo/Kirk Moore )Buy Photo\n\nWhen Lauren Mae Henry does beach sweeps in her native Seaside Park, she\u2019s seen exactly the same volume of plastic trash wash up on a four-block stretch just 24 hours after she\u2019s cleaned it.\n\nNow Henry\u2019s learned how the threat is global. Scientists have found the high seas are a final destination for millions of pounds of plastics, and this summer Henry, a senior and marine biology major at the University of North Carolina Wilimington, is on an East Coast speaking tour to warn audiences of the threat.\n\nIt goes beyond harming fish and wildlife because plastics breaking down to near microscopic bits \u201cis introduced into our food chain...We\u2019re so exposed to it whether it\u2019s drinking out of plastic bottles or eating fish,\u201d she told a gathering of the Ocean County College Environmental Club.\n\nHenry is an alumna of the Barnegat Bay Student Grant program, the summer science project funded by the local group Save Barnegat Bay and the Sedge Island environmental education center at Island Beach State Park, where she also gave a recent presentation to high school students. It\u2019s part of an East Coast speaking tour she\u2019s doing as an intern for 5 Gyres, a Santa Monica, California-based nonprofit group that mounts high seas expeditions to document huge patches of plastic debris in oceans.\n\nThe group is named for five mid-ocean areas where prevailing winds, currents and the effect of the Earth\u2019s rotation pinwheel in floating trash. They are huge \u2014 the densest part of the best-known North Pacific gyre is twice the size of Texas \u2014 but to the naked eye, they are not floating trash heaps, Henry said. A lot of the plastic is just beneath the surface and yields up in the trawl nets towed by 5 Gyres crews during their 30-day expeditions.\n\nMost plastics do not break down as do organic material such as paper or cardboard.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t biodegrade, they photodegrade\u201d under the sun\u2019s light and ultraviolet rays,\u201d Henry said. It\u2019s still in the water but in smaller pieces.\n\nSo it gets mistaken for food by fish and birds. Sea birds on Midway Island and the western Hawaiian islands are found starved to death and full of plastics, while 5 Gyre researchers \u201chaven\u2019t found a fish without plastics ingested, or plastic chemicals\u201d in tissue samples, Henry said.\n\nSpeaking to summer camp groups, aquarium visitors and other audiences, Henry urges people to cut back on their use of plastics. The problem has been building since the surge of disposable consumer items in the 1950s, and the throwaway culture must be reined in, she said.\n\n\u201cWe use that plastic coffee stirrer for two seconds,\u201d Henry said. \u201cBut that plastic stirrer is going to outlive your great-great-grandchildren.\u201d\n\nKirk Moore: 609-709-5036; kmoore@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1rzvP2i", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Oceans a repository of growing plastics threat, Seaside Park native tells audiences", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Oceans a repository of growing plastics threat, Seaside Park native tells audiences", "title": "Barnegat Bay alum warns of plastics pollution of seas", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/land-environment/2014/07/22/barnegat-bay-pollution-ocean-county/13022295/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oceans a repository of growing plastics threat, Seaside Park native tells audiences", "title": "Barnegat Bay alum warns of plastics pollution of seas", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ae5d16105e673cb4d7dba887aa1a5aae8730997e/c=0-324-1944-2268&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/07/23/img0226.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Barnegat Bay, pollution, Ocean County, New Jersey"}, "article_summary": "Speaking to summer camp groups, aquarium visitors and other audiences, Henry urges people to cut back on their use of plastics.\nBuy Photo Lauren Mae Henry, a marine biology major at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington and a Seaside Park native, is traveling the East Coast this summer giving presentations on plastic pollution of the high seas.\n\u201cBut that plastic stirrer is going to outlive your great-great-grandchildren.\u201dKirk Moore: 609-709-5036; kmoore@app.comRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1rzvP2i\nMost plastics do not break down as do organic material such as paper or cardboard.\nIt\u2019s part of an East Coast speaking tour she\u2019s doing as an intern for 5 Gyres, a Santa Monica, California-based nonprofit group that mounts high seas expeditions to document huge patches of plastic debris in oceans."}
