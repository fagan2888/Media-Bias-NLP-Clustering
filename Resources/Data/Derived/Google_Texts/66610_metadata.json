As the largest known member of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is also the gateway to a new frontier, a scarcely studied collection of primordial icy bodies far from the sun that constitutes the \u201cthird zone\u201d of the solar system after the realms of the inner rocky planets and the outer gas giants.\n\nLike most first glimpses of new frontiers, Pluto held so many surprises for New Horizons that the past eight months have seen a steady stream of discoveries coming from the mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s small radio transmitter beams its gathered data back home. The biggest surprises have been Pluto\u2019s surface and atmosphere, which are restlessly active and diverse despite average temperatures of only tens of degrees above absolute zero. Some scientists expected New Horizons would find Pluto to be little more than an inert, sunlight-starved orb. Instead, the spacecraft encountered a world where nitrogen glaciers flow down into plains of frozen methane from towering mountains of water ice. Sunless half-frozen oceans lurk deep beneath the surface, and multiple moons tumble overhead through hydrocarbon-hazed red skies that tinge to blue at sunrise and sunset.\n\nBut beyond celebrating the visceral thrill of the Pluto flyby itself, or the intellectual frisson of gazing on full-color close-ups of a place so alien and faraway, most of these discoveries from New Horizons have so far found a muted public reception. The story has simply been that we went to Pluto, and witnessed wonders. What those wonders actually mean\u2014for our understanding of Pluto, for planetary evolution, and for the broad history of the solar system\u2014is something that the mission scientists themselves are still working out. They summarize their latest thoughts in this week\u2019s edition of the journal Science, with a quintet of papers that constitute the synthesis of our current understanding of Pluto.\n\nHere are the three big-picture takeaways from our emerging portrait of this strange, frozen world:\n\n1. PLUTO IS YOUNG AT HEART\n\nNew Horizons was only able to closely study one hemisphere of Pluto as it whizzed by, revealing a sprawling heart-shaped plain of mixed nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane ices ringed by mountains and heavily cratered terrain. Dubbed Sputnik Planum, the 1,000-kilometer-wide western lobe of the heart looks almost bubbly, like a churning pot of creamy oatmeal or frothy foam on a pint of Guinness beer.\n\nAn 80-kilometer strip of Pluto\u2019s surface, stretching from the crater-free northwest shoreline of Sputnik Planum on the right, through blocky mountains of water ice, into rugged, pitted icy plains on the left.\n\nCredit: NASA/JHUAPL/SWRI\n\nSputnik Planum has no craters, and is likely less than 10 million years old, probably formed from fresh snow and glaciers sliding down from nearby rugged highlands. Its bubbles are convection cells driven by heat rising through the thick ice from deep below. A small \u201cmountain range\u201d at Sputnik Planum\u2019s northwestern edge is in fact blocks of water ice that seem to be bobbing in the higher-density ices like cubes in a glass. These blocks are perhaps crust fractured and overturned by some tectonic upheaval. To the south, New Horizons scientists have spied what seem to be two young cryovolcanoes, Wright Mons and Piccard Mons, relatively unblemished kilometers-high mounds surrounding central pits at least as deep.\n\nAppearing as a dark pit in the inset, the 150-kilometer wide, 4-kilometer-high mound of Wright Mons is a possible cryovolcano that erupts volatiles such as water, ammonia and methane rather than molten rock.\n\nCredit: NASA/JHUAPL/SWRI\n\nTaken together, these features show that more than four billion years after its formation, Pluto still somehow retains enough internal heat to maintain an active geology and, here and there, a very youthful surface replenished by cryovolcanism and the seasonal sublimation and deposition of volatile ices. Deep within the world, Pluto\u2019s heat could be sufficient to sustain an ocean of ammonia-rich water beneath a thick roof of water-ice bedrock. Long linear striations upon parts of Pluto\u2019s surface hint that any subsurface ocean may be slowly freezing, deforming the ground and releasing additional latent heat as it turns to ice.\n\n2. MOST OF ITS SURFACE IS STILL ANCIENT ANDREALLY WEIRD\n\nSputnik Planum\u2019s smooth-featured youth is exceptional. Most of the rest of Pluto\u2019s exterior is far more craggy and ancient, altered extensively across hundreds of millions or billions of years. Varying mixtures and combinations of nitrogen, water, carbon monoxide and methane that make up Pluto\u2019s crust create different varieties of ice and terrain, similar to how rocks on earth can form cliffs of soft chalk or mountains of hard granite. These varying substrates can then be textured with pits, grooves and channels produced by subliming ice, eroding glaciers and precipitating frost\u2014effects driven by Pluto\u2019s weather, which fluctuates in decades-long seasons.\n\nCentered on Sputnik Planum, this partial geological map of Pluto reveals the diversity of terrain seen by NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission during its flyby.\n\nCredit: NASA/JHUAPL/SWRI", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Horizons fly-by captures dwarf planet's haunting beauty and offers new clues of a possible sub-surface ocean", "title": "The wonders of Pluto revealed: NASA\u2019s latest findings are a sight to behold", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New Horizons fly-by captures dwarf planet's haunting beauty and offers new clues of a possible sub-surface ocean", "title": "The wonders of Pluto revealed: NASA\u2019s latest findings are a sight to behold", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/20/the_wonders_of_pluto_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_26181901.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Horizons fly-by captures dwarf planet's haunting beauty and offers new clues of a possible sub-surface ocean", "title": "The wonders of Pluto revealed: NASA\u2019s latest findings are a sight to behold", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_26181901.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lee Billings", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Milky Way, NASA, Pluto, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The biggest surprises have been Pluto\u2019s surface and atmosphere, which are restlessly active and diverse despite average temperatures of only tens of degrees above absolute zero.\nCentered on Sputnik Planum, this partial geological map of Pluto reveals the diversity of terrain seen by NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission during its flyby.\nInstead, the spacecraft encountered a world where nitrogen glaciers flow down into plains of frozen methane from towering mountains of water ice.\nDubbed Sputnik Planum, the 1,000-kilometer-wide western lobe of the heart looks almost bubbly, like a churning pot of creamy oatmeal or frothy foam on a pint of Guinness beer.\nSome scientists expected New Horizons would find Pluto to be little more than an inert, sunlight-starved orb."}
