A controversial, union-backed measure that would require some employers provide a minimum of 30-hour workweeks won't be voted on as scheduled today.

The ordinance would require employers in buildings larger than 150,000 square feet to provide minimum 30-hour workweeks to property service workers like janitors, security guards and commercial cleaners. The law would also apply to residential buildings with more than 50 units.

City Council President Rolando Lavarro, who has championed the measure, has said it would lead to better jobs for the workers and would qualify them for health care.

The federal Affordable Care Act requires large employers provide health insurance to employees working 30 hours or more a week, or else the companies could be hit with financial penalties.

Some of Lavarro's council colleagues say the proposal has led to a deluge of complaints from business groups and developers who want them to kill the measure. Councilman Rich Boggiano, who is opposed to it, agrees with them.

"The government should stay the hell out of business," he told The Jersey Journal yesterday.

The measure would likely fail if called for a vote at tonight's council meeting. Two councilmen will be absent — Khemraj "Chico" Ramchal is on a vacation until later this month and Daniel Rivera will be attending his daughter's college graduation — while five of the remaining members have expressed misgivings about the ordinance or outright opposition. The measure needs five affirmative votes for adoption.

The final vote on a companion ordinance that would require the same employers give property service workers 90 days' notice if they plan to cancel their contract will also be postponed.

The council meets today at 6 p.m. at City Hall, 280 Grove St.
