The Santa Monica, Calif., therapist often tasks couples with putting together a large piece of furniture at home and reporting back on how it went.\n\nIKEA, the world\u2019s largest furniture retailer with 367 stores in seven countries, can look like a domestic wonderland. Its walkable showrooms offer a path through sleek model bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms and children\u2019s rooms. Shoppers are encouraged to spend time sitting on a sofa and envisioning what their lives could be in these spaces.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where couples\u2019 trouble often starts, says Durvasula, who is also a professor of psychology at California State University Los Angeles. \u201cThe store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,\u201d she says. Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children\u2019s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that\u2019s before you\u2019ve even tried assembling anything.\n\nDurvasula says constructing the small Nornas coffee table is fairly undemanding. But a massive wall unit like the Liatorp? She calls that the Divorcemaker.\n\nIKEA, based in Almhult, Sweden, knows shopping for big items can be stressful and lead to arguments, says Janice Simonsen, design spokeswoman for IKEA U.S.\n\n\u201cWhile IKEA has no set philosophy on couples shopping together, we want everyone to have a good experience,\u201d she says. As for the company\u2019s furniture being used for therapy, she says, \u201cWe\u2019re just happy to be part of the process.\u201d\n\nThough the company doesn\u2019t provide mediators or counselors, she points out that about 85 percent of its U.S. stores offer home-furnishings consultants, available by appointment, who can give design advice.\n\nSimonsen spent five years as a furnishings consultant and compiled a list of guidelines for couples preparing for an IKEA visit, including agreeing on a style from the catalog before ever setting foot in the store.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d says Mary Ann Barroso, a local marketing specialist and former kitchen designer at IKEA\u2019s Burbank, Calif., store. She points out that most of the time, couples come to IKEA because they\u2019re renovating a home or moving, which are already stressful situations. According to a 2013 survey conducted by home design site Houzz, 46 percent of couples doing remodeling projects together found the experience frustrating, and 12 percent of couples surveyed admitted that they considered separation or divorce during the renovation.\n\n\u201cIf I felt a conversation was going to turn into an argument, I wouldn\u2019t take sides,\u201d Barroso says. \u201cI\u2019d just say, \u2018Here\u2019s what you need to consider. I\u2019m going to step away for five to 10 minutes. Discuss amongst yourselves.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that IKEA is Swedish for pissed-off boyfriend,\u201d says Courtney Frappier, a New York City publicist whose recent trip to IKEA with her boyfriend Alex Mele ended in tears.\n\nFear of merging\n\nThe pair, both 26, was furnishing his new one-bedroom apartment with an eye to Frappier moving in later this year. But while they were walking through IKEA picking out items, Mele recalls thinking, \u201d \u2018Oh man, she\u2019s going to take over and I\u2019m going to lose all control of my place.\u2019 \u201c\n\nFrappier says she saw the meltdown coming but couldn\u2019t stop it. \u201cOnce we were in the store, the reality of combining two individual lives started to sink in,\u201d she says.\n\nThat was three months ago. They are still together, and so is the furniture they bought. But instead of calling the pieces by their official names \u2014 the Bjursta sideboard and the Bekant desk \u2014 Mr. Mele just refers to them as Terrible and Misery. \u201cI\u2019m never going back there,\u201d he says.\n\nThis kind of IKEA meltdown appears in YouTube parodies and an episode of the NBC comedy \u201c30 Rock,\u201d where Tina Fey\u2019s character Liz Lemon breaks up with her boyfriend at an IKEA.\n\nWhile couples with existing communications issues are more vulnerable, no relationship is immune, says New York-based marriage counselor and radio host Dr. Jane Greer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had couples go to the mat over a couch that neither of them even liked,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cUnderneath, every discussion is really about, \u2018how important am I to you? How important is my comfort and happiness to you? If I want this couch, and it\u2019s important to me, then why isn\u2019t it important enough to you?\u2019 \u201c\n\nOnce a couple makes it out of the store, they have to get everything home and put it together \u2014 another relationship minefield.\n\nFurniture assembly often causes more friction than the shopping experience, according to March data from consumer research firm CivicScience. It surveyed nearly 7,000 adults and found that among those who assemble furniture together, 17 percent said they always get into arguments, compared with only 6 percent who said they often argue while shopping together.\n\nNightmare bed\n\nRemya Thomas and Jacob Varghese, both 35, learned that lesson from an Oppdal queen-sized bed frame and headboard.\n\nWhen the couple moved into a new apartment in Chicago\u2019s South Loop two years ago, Thomas convinced her husband to use IKEA to furnish the new place.\n\n\u201cI knew it would be a hassle to put together, but I was thinking we are two people, we can do it,\u201d she says. They breezed through the shopping part. But when they finally moved, she was pregnant and couldn\u2019t lift anything.\n\nAll their furniture was in flat IKEA boxes and they had nowhere to sleep. The pressure fell on Varghese, who works in finance and says he\u2019s not particularly handy. \u201cI had never done any of this before, but I thought, how hard can it be?\u201d he says.\n\nHe estimates that it took him, his father and a friend about 10 hours to put the bed together, including two hours of arguing with Thomas. \u201cShe would give directions and then leave the room!\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cI thought he was going to kill me,\u201d Thomas says. She concedes that the bed was probably too complicated for their first project. They\u2019d also bought a Hemnes secretary, two Kullen chests, a Brusali wardrobe and a Borgsjo cabinet.\n\nMore than a year later, Varghese says, \u201cIt feels like a badge of honor.\u201d But he vows he\u2019ll never do it again.\n\nThomas, on the other hand, sees it as a bonding experience and would happily take on another IKEA project.\n\n\u201cWe created something together,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then again, I may be taking more credit than I deserve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Love in the time of Ikea", "title": "Love in the time of Ikea", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/24/love-in-the-time-of-ikea/", "image": {"width": 541, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150424__20150427_C1_FE27SMIKEAp2.jpg", "height": 361}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150424__20150427_C1_FE27SMIKEAp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-24T16:54:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T13:57:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Personal finance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fd0\"", "article_summary": "Furniture assembly often causes more friction than the shopping experience, according to March data from consumer research firm CivicScience.\nIKEA, based in Almhult, Sweden, knows shopping for big items can be stressful and lead to arguments, says Janice Simonsen, design spokeswoman for IKEA U.S.\u201cWhile IKEA has no set philosophy on couples shopping together, we want everyone to have a good experience,\u201d she says.\nThomas, on the other hand, sees it as a bonding experience and would happily take on another IKEA project.\nI\u2019m going to step away for five to 10 minutes.\nIKEA, the world\u2019s largest furniture retailer with 367 stores in seven countries, can look like a domestic wonderland."}
