That means the ability to collect reliable information and data on various reconstruction efforts will undoubtedly be impaired. This will likely lead to yet more cases of taxpayer dollars being wasted or mismanaged.\n\nSopko concluded his prepared remarks with this list of U.S. reconstruction failures, which he said were seen in both Iraq and Afghanistan:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The top watchdog for U.S. spending In Afghanistan recently gave a blunt, though not particularly surprising, assessment of the conditions in the war-torn country.", "title": "7 Ways the US Screwed Up Rebuilding Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/08/7-Ways-US-Screwed-Rebuilding-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-taliban-helmand_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/08/7-Ways-US-Screwed-Rebuilding-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-taliban-helmand_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The top watchdog for U.S. spending In Afghanistan recently gave a blunt, though not particularly surprising, assessment of the conditions in the war-torn country.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The top watchdog for U.S. spending in Afghanistan recently gave a blunt assessment of the conditions in the war-torn country.\nThat means the ability to collect reliable information and data on various reconstruction efforts will undoubtedly be impaired.\nSopko concluded his prepared remarks with this list of U.S. reconstruction failures, which he said were seen in both Iraq and Afghanistan:\n\u201cConditions are not, to put it mildly, what we would hope to see 15 years into a counterinsurgency and nation-building campaign,\u201d John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, said Thursday in a speech at Harvard University.\nThis will likely lead to yet more cases of taxpayer dollars being wasted or mismanaged."}
