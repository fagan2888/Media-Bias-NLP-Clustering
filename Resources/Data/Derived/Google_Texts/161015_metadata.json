That\u2019s the first time in four years that public schools have come out on top.\n\nRelated: The Surprising Reason College Grads Can\u2019t Get a Job\n\nThe Knoxville, Tennessee-based group collected data from 178,717 full-time faculty members at 792 U.S. institutions. That also allowed them to rank the highest- and lowest-paid disciplines, and the results very much reflect the job prospects for recent graduates in each field.\n\nSome of the cellar dwellers include theology, history and English. At the top of the spectrum were engineering, legal studies and business management.\n\nJulia Young, a tenure-track professor of history at The Catholic University of America in Washington, said job options in her field are very limited compared with other areas of expertise.\n\n\u201cFor a history PhD, there isn\u2019t a competing outside market,\u201d she said, noting that many professors with doctorates in engineering or computer programming can use private-sector job offers as leverage. \u201cThere are other opportunities for them, and they also pay better.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Coming Price Increase That Can Break Your Budget\n\nAt best, history majors could become public historians or work for the government. \u201cBut none of those industries actually pay much better,\u201d Young said.\n\nThe average salary of a tenured engineering professor last year was $123,103, compared with $86,636 for history professors, according to the survey. Across all disciplines, the average salary for a professor last year was $97,784.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama administration said its goal is to increase by one million the number of college graduates who receive degrees in science, technology, engineering and math over the next 10 years. The Commerce Department estimated that jobs in those fields will grow 1.7 faster than other occupations by 2018.\n\nOverall, most teachers in higher education saw their salaries increase for a third straight year following back-to-back academic years of stagnant wages, starting in 2009.\n\nThe median salary for all groups \u2013 tenured, associate and assistant professors \u2013 rose at a 2.1 percent annual pace, matching the previous year\u2019s gains. Last year, salaries for professors exceeded the nationwide 1.5 percent cost-of-living increase last year, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe top five average salaries for professors at both public and private institutions are:\n\nLegal studies -- $143,757 Business management -- $123,233 Engineering -- $123,103 Computer and information sciences -- $108,679 Architecture -- $107,143\n\nThe bottom five are:\n\nTheology -- $79,612 Visual and performing arts -- $84,349 Parks, recreation, leisure and fitness studies -- $85,246 English language and literature -- $85,404 Communication technologies and support services -- $86,128\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Private colleges may cost more than public institutions, but they\u2019re not boosting thei", "title": "Public Beats Private Colleges in Professor Pay Increases", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/19/Public-Beats-Private-Colleges-Professor-Pay-Increases", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_college_cost_diaper_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/19/Public-Beats-Private-Colleges-Professor-Pay-Increases", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_college_cost_diaper_article.jpg", "creator": "@timothyrhoman", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Private colleges may cost more than public institutions, but they\u2019re not boosting thei", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Private colleges may cost more than public institutions, but they\u2019re not boosting their professors\u2019 pay more than their state counterparts.\nThe average salary of a tenured engineering professor last year was $123,103, compared with $86,636 for history professors, according to the survey.\nOverall, most teachers in higher education saw their salaries increase for a third straight year following back-to-back academic years of stagnant wages, starting in 2009.\nLast year, salaries for professors exceeded the nationwide 1.5 percent cost-of-living increase last year, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThat\u2019s the first time in four years that public schools have come out on top."}
