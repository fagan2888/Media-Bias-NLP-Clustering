Today\u2019s conservative, he says, is not yesterday\u2019s conservative. What happened?\n\nBasically, the party abandoned traditional conservatism for right-wing radicalism. Republicans came to see themselves as insurgents and revolutionaries, and every revolution tends toward anarchy and ends up devouring its own.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to combat this argument from amnesia for years. As he has done before, Paul Krugman valiantly takes up my critique today in his response to Brooks: \u201cActually existing conservatism is a radical doctrine.\u201d Even so, the notion that contemporary conservatives have betrayed the real conservatives of days gone by keeps popping back up.\n\nSo let\u2019s take Brooks apart, piece by piece. Brooks says the rot set in about 30 years ago \u201cor at least since Rush Limbaugh came on the scene.\u201d That was in 1988, just after Reagan. So that\u2019ll be my cut-off point. Let\u2019s see how today\u2019s wine compares with those loamy vintages of more than a quarter-century ago.\n\nThe bolded passages are from Brooks\u2019 column.\n\nBy traditional definitions, conservatism stands for intellectual humility,\n\n\u201cThe conservative principle has been defended, the past hundred and fifty years, by men of learning and genius.\u201d (Russell Kirk, The Conservative Mind)\n\n\u201cA successful defence of freedom must therefore be dogmatic\u2026.Utopia, like ideology, is a bad word today\u2026But an ideal picture of a society which may not be wholly achievable, or a guiding conception of the overall order to be aimed at, is nevertheless not only the indispensable precondition of any rational policy, but also the chief contribution that science can make to the solution of the problems of practical policy.\u201d (Friedrich von Hayek, Law, Legislation, Liberty, Vol. 1)\n\n\u201cConservatism is in general the intuition of genius, whereas liberalism is the efficiency of talent.\u201d (Elmer More, \u201cDisraeli and Conservatism\u201d)\n\na belief in steady, incremental change,\n\n\u201cEvery little measure is a great errour.\u201d (Edmund Burke, Letters on a Regicide Peace)\n\n\u201cThe American people now want us to act and not in half-measures. They demand and they\u2019ve earned a full and comprehensive effort.\u201d (Ronald Reagan, Address Before a Joint Session of Congress on the Program for Economic Recovery)\n\na preference for reform rather than revolution,\n\n\u201cBecause of the corruption of the term liberalism, the views that formerly went under that name are now often labeled conservatism. But this is not a satisfactory alternative. The nineteenth-century liberal was a radical, both in the etymological sense of going to the root of the matter, and in the political sense of favoring major changes in social institutions. So too must be his modern heir.\u201d (Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom)\n\n\u201cIt is fixed beyond all power of reformation\u2026this body, being totally perverted from the purposes of its institution, is utterly incorrigible; and because they are incorrigible, both in conduct and constitution, power ought to be taken out of their hands; just on the same principles on which have been made all the just changes and revolutions of government that have taken place since the beginning of the world.\u201d (Burke, Speech on Fox\u2019s East India Bill)\n\na respect for hierarchy,\n\nNo argument from me.\n\nprecedence,\n\n\u201cNothing looks more awful and imposing than an ancient fortification. Its lofty embattled walls, its bold, projecting, rounded towers that pierce the sky, strike the imagination and promise inexpugnable strength. But they are the very things that make its weakness. You may as well think of opposing one of those old fortresses to the mass of artillery brought by a French irruption into the field, as to think of resisting by your old laws and your old forms the new destruction which the crops of Jacobin engineers today prepare for all such forms and all such laws.\u201d (Burke, Letters on a Regicide Peace)\n\n\u201cThe conservative peasant, as much as anybody else, owes his way of life to a different type of person, to men who were innovators in their time and who by their innovations forced a new manner of living on people belonging to an earlier state of culture.\u201d (Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty)\n\n\u201cThat [Democratic] measure reflects an echo of the past rather than a benchmark for the future\u2026.More of the same will not cure the hardship, anxiety, and discouragement it has imposed on the American people.\u201d (Ronald Reagan, Address Before a Joint Session of Congress on the Program for Economic Recovery)\n\n\u201cChange is our Ally: A Tory Approach to Industrial Problems.\u201d (Title of 1954 Conservative Party pamphlet)\n\nbalance and order,\n\n\u201cThe madness of the wise\u2026is better than the sobriety of fools.\u201d (Burke, Letters on a Regicide Peace)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brooks is fed up with the right: They're not like golden-day conservatives!
