But he warned that the chamber would look at which candidates to support in the 2014 congressional races with an eye toward those who would work for the long-term economic health of the country.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stress enough what a default on our foreign debt \u2014 not on our private debt and not on the debt to the Federal Reserve or any of that, but a real default \u2014 would put us in a position that changed our position around the world that increased our interest costs,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked by a reporter whether the chamber should tell conservative hero Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of the champions of the failed GOP strategy, to \u201csit down and shut up,\u201d Donohue answered: \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things we can work with him on.\u201d\n\nDavid French, the top lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, has been more blunt, vowing to aggressively challenge the strain of anti-government conservatism that gave rise to the October crises.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at ways to counter the rise of an ideological brand of conservatism that, for lack of a better word, is more anti-establishment than it has been in the past,\u201d he told The New York Times.\n\nJohn Feehery, a former GOP leadership aide and an executive at the lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie and Associates, said the business community would do well to start taking seriously the challenge of changing a dysfunctional Congress.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t do it by sitting on the sidelines, and they can\u2019t by blindly giving money to every Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to be much more aggressive in funding challengers who are going to be pro-business.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, this is a problem of the business lobby\u2019s own making.\n\nThe American Bankers Association, another powerful pro-business lobbying organization, contributed more than $2.1 million in the last two election cycles to members who voted against reopening the government and raising the debt ceiling last week, according to a joint analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics and The Washington Post.\n\nIt followed closely on the heels of the conservative Club for Growth, which gave upwards of $3.2 million to those members. Honeywell International, AT&T, the National Association of Realtors and Deloitte were also top contributors to such members, despite many executives' warnings about the disastrous effects of a debt ceiling breach.\n\nBut if financial firms and business groups are feeling buyer's remorse setting in about the Congress they helped create, it may be more difficult than acknowledged to change course now.\n\nBig business may have once had a monopoly on the high dollar donations flowing to candidates, but in recent years conservative organizations like the Club for Growth, the Senate Conservatives Fund and Heritage Action have grown in stature and are now capable of writing six-figure checks to candidates who meet their test of ideological purity.\n\nHouse conservatives, some of whom are saying they are spoiling for the next budget fight, also have the incumbent advantage now. The re-election rate for those already serving in the House hovers near 90 percent.\n\nAnd despite their current displeasure, all interest groups ultimately want friends on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cBig money generally is conservative, in that it wants to go with the sure thing,\u201d said Kathy Kiely, managing editor of the Sunlight Foundation, an organization that tracks money in politics. \u201cSo unless the business community thinks there is a serious challenge and that somebody really has a chance of upending the incumbent, the tea party candidates will have that advantage.\u201d\n\nMoreover, relatively few credible primary challengers have arisen against conservative members for 2014, as time winds down for candidates to mount serious campaigns against incumbents. When push comes to shove, said Viveca Novak, communications director of the Center for Responsive Politics, the interests of the business community are still inextricably intertwined with the interests of the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThere are reasons \u2014 beyond votes like lifting the debt ceiling \u2014 why the business groups like some of these lawmakers. They tend to be for lower taxes, they tend to be anti-regulation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for business to figure out how to make the party a little bit more business-friendly again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite some buyer's remorse about a Congress it helped create, business lobby's interests are still in line with GOP", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/23/big-business-facestoughbattleinupendingteapartyinterests.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/23/big-business-facestoughbattleinupendingteapartyinterests/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Cruz_teaparty_102313.1382607856411.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Despite some buyer's remorse about a Congress it helped create, business lobby's interests are still in line with GOP", "title": "Big business faces uphill battle against tea party interests"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/23/big-business-facestoughbattleinupendingteapartyinterests/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Cruz_teaparty_102313.1382607856411.jpg", "description": "Despite some buyer's remorse about a Congress it helped create, business lobby's interests are still in line with GOP", "card": "summary", "title": "Big business faces uphill battle against tea party interests"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Politics, Business & Finance, Congress, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere are reasons \u2014 beyond votes like lifting the debt ceiling \u2014 why the business groups like some of these lawmakers.\nBut if financial firms and business groups are feeling buyer's remorse setting in about the Congress they helped create, it may be more difficult than acknowledged to change course now.\nChief executive officers and heads of business groups expressed their alarm with conservative members they helped finance in the previous two congressional elections \u2014 legislators who nevertheless steered the country toward near-default.\nWhen push comes to shove, said Viveca Novak, communications director of the Center for Responsive Politics, the interests of the business community are still inextricably intertwined with the interests of the Republican Party.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for business to figure out how to make the party a little bit more business-friendly again.\u201d"}
