Police often request schools to help offset the costs of being stationed at a school if grants are not available.\n\nAs a result, the school board approved this month purchasing guns to remain locked inside the school and trained six employees to use the weapons in an emergency.\n\nPHOTOS: Concealed carry expansion remains priority for gun group\n\n\u201cI hope we never have to use them,\u201d said Alan Ward, a school board member who has been discussing this option with the school for two years. \u201cBut in the event something did happen, we wanted to be prepared.\u201d\n\nGarden Valley\u2019s actions are just one of many solutions schools across the nation have adopted to protect their campuses. Some have installed metal detectors, others have expanded school resource officers to secure not only high schools but also middle and elementary schools.\n\nBut in Idaho, bringing guns into a school as a safety measure is a much more accepted option where Second Amendment rights are highly protected and libertarian ideals run deep.\n\nSEE ALSO: Vince Vaughn: \u2018Of course\u2019 guns should be allowed in schools\n\nIn 2013, an eastern Idaho school district approved installing gun safes in its high schools and middle schools in order for school resource officers to have easy access to rifles if needed - the same year the Idaho School Board Association rejected a plan to set up gun training for education staff and teachers.\n\nIn 2014, state lawmakers approved allowing guns on college campuses.\n\nAccording to the Idaho Department of Education, school districts statewide reported less than 10 weapon-related incidents over the past two years. This includes reports about guns, knives and explosives to schools.\n\nWhat the department declined to share, however, is how many of each incident was reported, where each one occurred and when they happened. This is due to a recently amended policy where if less than 10 of a specific incident is reported, the information is redacted.\n\nFinding information about Garden Valley\u2019s weapons decision is also limited. The school board declined to release how many firearms were purchased, what type and where they would be stored.\n\nWard said the school isn\u2019t releasing that information to protect safety procedures. He estimated the school has spent roughly $3,500 to purchase ammunition and train six school employees to handle the weapons while the rest of the arsenal was donated by the community.\n\nEven with training, it\u2019s no guarantee teachers and staff will prevent fatalities in a high-stakes situation, said Allison Anderman, a staff attorney with Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit opposed to arming teachers.\n\nShe added that housing guns in schools could create a chilling effect for students who may be less inclined to speak out knowing that the teacher could be armed.\n\n\u201cJust having people armed doesn\u2019t make a school safer,\u201d Anderman said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A tiny school district in Idaho far removed from law enforcement has purchased firearms and trained a handful of staff to use them should the same school shooting rampage that has occurred across the country take place.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A tiny school district in Idaho far removed from law enforcement has purchased firearms and trained a handful of staff to use them should the same school shooting rampage that has occurred across the country take place.", "title": "Idaho school buys guns to enhance safety: \u2018We wanted to be prepared\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/6/remote-idaho-school-buys-guns-to-enhance-safety/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/19/Ruger_SR45_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/19/Ruger_SR45_2.jpg", "description": "A tiny school district in Idaho far removed from law enforcement has purchased firearms and trained a handful of staff to use them should the same school shooting rampage that has occurred across the", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Idaho school buys guns to enhance safety: \u2018We wanted to be prepa"}, "Author": "Kimberlee Kruesi", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Alan Ward, Board Of Education"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb723\"", "article_summary": "The school board declined to release how many firearms were purchased, what type and where they would be stored.\nAs a result, the school board approved this month purchasing guns to remain locked inside the school and trained six employees to use the weapons in an emergency.\nBut in Idaho, bringing guns into a school as a safety measure is a much more accepted option where Second Amendment rights are highly protected and libertarian ideals run deep.\nBOISE, Idaho \u2014 A tiny school district in Idaho far removed from law enforcement has purchased firearms and trained a handful of staff to use them should the same school shooting rampage that has occurred across the country take place.\nPolice often request schools to help offset the costs of being stationed at a school if grants are not available."}
