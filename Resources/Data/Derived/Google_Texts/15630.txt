Dr. Hulon Crayton died Saturday morning after a long battle with Leukemia.

For years Dr. Crayton has run a highly successful Rheumatology practice in Bay County. Dr. Crayton was also known as an avid jazz musician in the community.

Back in January of 2014, Dr. Crayton went back to work at his practice after taking some time off to go through chemotherapy treatments.

A number of bone marrow registry drives were held to raise money for Dr. Crayton's transplant.

Dr. Crayton also played in outdoor jazz festivals and in various venues on the Gulf Coast, but his biggest crowd was at the opening act for Michael Bolton at the Marina Civic Center in January 2011.
