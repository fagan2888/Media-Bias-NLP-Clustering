No, Christa Ann McClure did not go on leave over the chronic problems plaguing the cursed Connect for Health website. She\u2019s on leave because she has been indicted for filching funds from her last employer in Montana.\n\nNo, the guardians of Obamacare didn\u2019t smoke her out on their own. McClure \u2019fessed up only after the local Montana newspaper, the Billings Gazette, reported on the charges against her. She was indicted by a grand jury on January 16. But her current state-government employers did not find out until last week, when McClure finally informed them because the press had published the indictment.\n\nThe Keystone Kops of the Colorado health exchange tell us they conducted \u201cthorough\u201d background checks of McClure. They say they \u201cfully vetted\u201d and investigated her references when they hired her last March for her six-figure job helming the state Obamacare office of \u201cpartner engagement.\u201d Colorado officials say she was \u201cwell-qualified\u201d for the Obamacare job, which involves being a \u201cliaison\u201d with other government agencies.\n\nBut mum\u2019s the word on who recommended her, which references they talked to, and who in Colorado Democratic circles might have known about her history in Montana.\n\nThe twelve-page federal indictment is a blood-boiling document outlining government waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal affordable-housing racket. The feds say McClure siphoned untold amounts of money from the nonprofit group Housing Montana, which received a half-million-dollar federal grant to build homes for poor people.\n\nMcClure allegedly was paying herself \u201csignificant sums\u201d for bogus \u201cconsulting services\u201d while also taking a full-time salary as executive director of the nonprofit. She is accused of raiding the organization\u2019s funds for family expenses, personal travel, and a laptop and of lying to the IRS to obtain false reimbursements. She further defrauded the government by inflating her unused sick- and annual-leave hours. The feds say she also bilked Montana homeowners who participated in the federal affordable-housing program by charging them for a fake $750 warranty and a $1,000 fee for \u201cleasing tools.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s another disturbing fact: In a classic dance of the lemons, McClure had bounced around successfully from government-funded job to job until now. The Montana state auditor\u2019s office disclosed last week that McClure had managed three grants worth more than $2 million to implement Obamacare in that state. McClure worked on the project for three years at an annual salary of $98,000. She was \u201cresponsible for managing a broad range of contracts and making sure they got delivered on time,\u201d according to the Billings Gazette.\n\nTo whom did she deliver them, you ask? State auditors will be trying to find out now. McClure faces trial in June and up to 20 years on each of the eight charges of fraud and embezzlement.\n\nI\u2019d like to be able to tell you that she\u2019ll never work in another Obamacare job again. But take a look at California. Just a few weeks ago, Jillian Kay Melchior reported in National Review Online that \u201cat least 43 convicted criminals are working as Obamacare navigators in California, including three individuals with records of significant financial crimes.\u201d The crimes include forgery, petty theft, shoplifting, welfare fraud, child abuse, and evading an officer. Only the best to handle your private medical data and sensitive financial information!\n\nAnd take a look at Oregon\u2019s disastrous Obamacare exchange, Cover Oregon. While overseeing an over-budget and inoperable website subsidized to the tune of nearly $60 million in federal funds, project managers allegedly \u201cinitiated the design of dummy web pages to convince the federal government the project was further along than it actually was,\u201d according to KATU-TV in Portland. A former Republican state legislator who served on the information-technology oversight committee reported the whistleblowing allegations to the FBI. There is still no estimated completion date for the dysfunctional project, and the woman in charge of implementing the system is now in California, refusing to answer questions about her role.\n\n\u201dWe have to pass the bill so you can find out what\u2019s in it,\u201d Nancy Pelosi infamously brayed in 2010. Ever since, Obamacare has revealed its true and horrifying colors: It\u2019s not salvation. It\u2019s a criminal enterprise rooted in ideological fraud.\n\n\u2014 Michelle Malkin is the author of Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks & Cronies. \u00a9 2014 Creators.com", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Obamacare\u2019s Criminal Enterprise", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Malkin", "description": "Question: If Obamacare officials cannot prevent accused embezzlers from infiltrating their offices, how can they protect enrollees from grifters, con artists, and thieves in the federal health-insurance-exchange system?\n\nHere in my home state, a director of Connect for Health Colorado \u2014 the state-sponsored Obamacare health-insurance exchange \u2014 was just put on administrative leave.
