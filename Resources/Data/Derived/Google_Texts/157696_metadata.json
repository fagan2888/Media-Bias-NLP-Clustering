Home Depot has pointed to aging housing stock in the U.S., noting late last year that nearly two-thirds of American homes are at least 30 years old, a trend it says will buoy home-improvement spending.\n\nFor the solid fourth-quarter results, Chief Executive Craig Menear credited, in part, a continued recovery in the U.S. housing market, and Home Depot lifted its quarterly dividend 17% to 69 cents a share. The company cautioned, though, that the strong U.S. dollar may hurt results this year. The company guided for earnings of $6.12 to $6.18 a share and roughly $93.01 billion to $93.81 billion in sales, bracketing analysts' average estimates.\n\nOver all for the fourth quarter, Home Deport reported a profit of $1.47 billion, up from $1.38 billion a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to $1.17 from $1.05 a year earlier. Revenue grew 9.5% to $20.98 billion. Analysts projected $1.10 in adjusted per-share profit and $20.39 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe company's gross margin held relatively steady at 34.1%.\n\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "Lisa Beilfuss", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-depot-profit-climbs-raises-dividend-17-2016-02-23", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "Home Depot profit climbs, raises dividend 17%"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "Home Depot profit climbs, raises dividend 17%", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-02-23T06:32:00-05:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Lisa Beilfuss", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-depot-profit-climbs-raises-dividend-17-2016-02-23", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "6248894C-F0A3-4C38-BEEA-94ABE917A7A7"}, "article_summary": "On a per-share basis, earnings rose to $1.17 from $1.05 a year earlier.\nHome Depot Inc. logged stronger-than-expected earnings growth in its latest quarter as Americans continued to snap up products for home improvement projects.\nOver all for the fourth quarter, Home Deport reported a profit of $1.47 billion, up from $1.38 billion a year earlier.\nAnalysts projected $1.10 in adjusted per-share profit and $20.39 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters.\nFor the solid fourth-quarter results, Chief Executive Craig Menear credited, in part, a continued recovery in the U.S. housing market, and Home Depot lifted its quarterly dividend 17% to 69 cents a share."}
