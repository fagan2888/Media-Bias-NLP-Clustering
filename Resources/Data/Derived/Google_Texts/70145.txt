A three-year-old stray dog playfully walked alongside a Metro North train for at least a mile-and-a-half from the south Bronx into Manhattan on Tuesday. But the pooch’s joy ride was slightly stressful for Metropolitan Transportation Authority workers.

When the train’s engineer realized he was being tailed by the energetic dog, he called MTA rail traffic controllers who advised him to go slow to avoid hitting it. The engineer also put the word out to other trains to keep a look out. Traffic controllers radioed MTA police who sent officers to the Harlem-125th Street station to bring the dog’s chase to an end, according to the MTA.

MTA Police officers Luis Alvarez and Errold Borges were responsible for coaxing the dog away from the busy railroad tracks and electrified third rail at the elevated station in Harlem.

MTA workers gave the dog, believed to be a shepherd/collie mix, the name ‘Tie.’ With no collar or identifying microchips, she is currently in the custody of Animal Care & Control of New York City and will be put up for adoption if her owner isn’t found.
