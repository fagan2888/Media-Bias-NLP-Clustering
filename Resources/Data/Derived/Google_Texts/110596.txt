LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul, along with Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, Monday urged Californians to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

Paul and Curry took part in an event, sponsored by Kaiser Permanente, with the intention of communicating the message that health insurance and healthy lifestyles are essential.

“We can reach young adults,” Paul said. “We’re with kids all day, every day, and they’re watching our games, and we have an influence, so we have an opportunity to use our voice.”

While California’s Affordable Care Act site is producing smooth results, the federal government’s healthcare website remains riddled with breakdowns and malfunctions.

“Nobody is madder than me about the fact that the website isn’t working as well as it should, which means it’s going to get fixed,” President Obama said in Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile, in California, some consumers report that they have received notices from their health insurance providers, stating that, due to the Affordable Care Act, their new policies will run hundreds of dollars more per month than what they are paying now.

“I felt duped, because the President kept saying, ‘If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, your premiums will be going down,'” one California resident said. “And my premium is going up by 40 percent.”
