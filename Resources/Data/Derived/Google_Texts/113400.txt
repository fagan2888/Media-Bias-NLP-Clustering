If you repeat something often enough, people start believing it. That's why I take words and language seriously.

Call me old-fashioned (or an ink-stained wretch), but I believe terms used to describe and label things should be accurate. So here are some off-base words that have been making me cringe lately.

•Ridesharing. Uber and Lyft have been in the news a lot over the summer, and besides running roughshod over local regulations and politicians, they've also perpetrated fraud on the lexicon with their self-description as "ridesharing services." I hear the term everywhere, including from TV and radio hosts when I'm on panel discussions.

Sorry, but this isn't ridesharing. Ridesharing is when I carpool with my neighbor to a Heat game and he pays for parking, and I buy the hot dogs and beer. What Uber does is arrange paid rides between passengers and drivers using smartphone technology. It's a commercial transaction between strangers, and Uber takes a cut. Sharing connotes a free or bartered exchange, like school kids swapping cookies at lunch. Other Sun Sentinel reporters use the term "ride-hailing service" for Uber and Lyft. I prefer the term ride-brokering service.

•Affordable Care Act. While many people refer to it as Obamacare, the official name of the bill passed by Congress regarding health insurance is quite regrettable because it's so wildly off-base. The ACA hasn't curbed overall health care costs or made things more affordable, although the hope was it eventually would. Insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and prescription drug costs keep rising.

This week, Florida released preliminary figures showing 2016 premiums for Obamacare plans would rise an average 9.6 percent. Employer-based plans also keep getting more expensive, just as they did under previous administrations. The main thing the ACA did was open up health insurance to more people, as insurers could no longer deny coverage based on past conditions or illness. For this reason, the best name would be the Accessible Care Act.

•Minimal hurricane. We've been obsessing over Erika the past week (and it might be lashing South Florida Sunday and Monday, perhaps as a tropical storm) and there was much uncertainty over its path and intensity. I was surprised to see the term "minimal hurricane" in some stories on Erika. Minimal denotes negligible, and hurricanes should never be deemed minimal, negligible or weak, even if they have just evolved from tropical storm to the lowest intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale. I'd go with Category One Hurricane.

•Gaming. With a portion of the Seminole Tribe's casino revenue-sharing agreement with the state expiring, there's been a lot of talk here and in Tallahassee about gambling policy. Note I said gambling policy, and not "gaming," the term preferred by casino outfits. Let's make this clear: If you're talking about stuff kids play on an Xbox, that's gaming. If you're talking about blackjack, roulette or slots, that's gambling. (I'll refrain from joking about stocks or Wall Street for now, although lately it's hard to tell the difference).

•Anchor baby. This term become a hot topic on the Republican campaign trail, meant to describe children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants, supposedly as a way for those parents to get benefits. Unless we're talking about the love child of Megyn Kelly and Scott Pelley, "anchor baby" seems off-base and insensitive. Depending on your political views, these infants could also be called "opportunity babies" or "loophole babies." I prefer the term human beings.

•Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Some people are using the phrase "Republican frontrunner" to decribe Donald Tr...uh, wait. Hard to believe, but this is 100 percent accurate. This is not an abuse of language, just an assault on the senses. And unlike Tropical Storm Erika, there's no letup in sight.
