You might want to take a lesson in health and happiness from the invincible Carol Burnett, who has traveled a long and wittily winding road to her success today, reported NPR on November 15.\n\nGetty Images\n\nCarol says that her mother and grandmother formed the foundation for her humor. And although she opens up about her sometimes difficult childhood in her memoir \"This Time Together: Laughter and Reflection,\" Carol contends that she thrived.\n\n\"They had great senses of humor. And people who read the memoir and have read it, they think, oh, my gosh, that was a real tough upbringing. But I never felt that,\u201d Carol said. \u201cWe were poor, and both my parents died, eventually, of alcoholism, but I was kind of in the same boat with a lot of the kids in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cEverybody was poor, and a lot of their folks had drinking problems. But we found a way to survive and to play and to laugh and thrive in a funny way.\u201d\n\nAnd at 80, Carol is still laughing and thriving, thanks to her healthy lifestyle. She's passionate about Pilates for keeping her fit.\n\n\"I do Pilates, and they do help, for the bones and general flexibility. You have to have a trainer, and I have a wonderful gal who helps me. I'm not too thrilled as I'm doing them, but afterward I feel great,\" she told the Huffington Post.\n\nIn addition, she swims and uses portion control, Carol told Glamour magazine.\n\nAnd her best quote about dieting:\n\n\"My interesting diet tips are eat early and don't nosh between meals. I mean, I can pack it away.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you envision life at 80, do you figure that you might as well toss in the towel and eat brownies all day on the couch?", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Examiner.com", "description": "Comedy Legend Carol Burnett offers advice to the next generation.", "title": "Witty and warm Carol Burnett reveals how she stays healthy and happy at 80", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/5e/e4/5ee497746d0070d9fcda012e87905eeb.jpg?itok=6p0BSqxJ", "video": {"width": 480, "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 401}, "type": "movie"}, "twitter": {"description": "When you envision life at 80, do you figure that you might as well toss in the towel and eat brownies all day on the couch?", "creator": "@trendclues", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/5e/e4/5ee497746d0070d9fcda012e87905eeb.jpg?itok=6p0BSqxJ", "title": "Witty and warm Carol Burnett reveals how she stays healthy and happy at 80", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2013-11-17T11:00:33-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "General Health, Carol Burnett, Celebrity Weight Loss, diets, Health & Fitness, Celebrity News", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-17T11:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe08d2\"", "article_summary": "In addition, she swims and uses portion control, Carol told Glamour magazine.\nAnd people who read the memoir and have read it, they think, oh, my gosh, that was a real tough upbringing.\nI'm not too thrilled as I'm doing them, but afterward I feel great,\" she told the Huffington Post.\nAnd although she opens up about her sometimes difficult childhood in her memoir \"This Time Together: Laughter and Reflection,\" Carol contends that she thrived.\nWhen you envision life at 80, do you figure that you might as well toss in the towel and eat brownies all day on the couch?"}
