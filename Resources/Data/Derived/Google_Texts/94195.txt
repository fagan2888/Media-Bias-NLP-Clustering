As the old adage goes, “Nothing is certain except death and taxes.” And with tax season upon us, it’s time to face the fact that many investors should be expecting larger and nastier taxes.

From lower phase-out rates for deductions to new tax charges related to Obamacare, most of us will be sending a bigger check to the IRS every year. And it seems like that fact is only going to get worse — regardless of who’s in office.

But there are ways to investors to reduce the bite of taxes, especially those looking for income from their portfolios today.

The best, perhaps, is still in municipal bonds.

Municipal bonds — or munis as they are commonly called — are issued by local and state government and agencies in order to help fund their daily activities or a special project. They’re awesome investments for higher earners because they offer investors tax-free income at the federal and sometimes state level. In fact, in some cases a boring muni bond can be worth more than other exotic and higher-yield bonds when taxes are taken into effect.

And exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain the best way to get munis into your portfolio. Here are four municipal bond ETFs to buy today to start working reducing your 2015 taxes.
