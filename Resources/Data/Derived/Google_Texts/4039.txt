Sioux Falls fitness centers were full as many hit the gym to burn off a few extra calories before carving the turkey.

"We were packed solid, 8:15 to 8:30 there was a wait for the cardio. The weight room wasn't as busy but the cardio isn't busy now but my weight room is pretty busy," Fitness 19 operator Brandy Sivesind said.

Fitness 19 was open until noon today as the pre-Thanksgiving meal workout becomes more popular.

"A ton of people have come in. One of our busier holidays. This one and Christmas Eve is actually pretty busy as well," Sivesind said.

It's estimated that more than a million Americans will take part in a Thanksgiving Day road race today, and even more are hitting the gym just to squeeze in a few sets - including Lorn Te Slaa.

"I think everybody has a tendency to eat a big Thanksgiving dinner so they may feel a little guilty so they work out," Te Slaa said.

Officials at Fitness 19 say people come in to work out on Thanksgiving to not only have a guilt-free holiday meal later in the day but also because many simply have more time to work out.

"A lot of men come in during Thanksgiving because the wives say I need to get out of the house. I need to get to cooking so you're in my way so they kick them out," Sivesind said.

And that's why they often hit the treadmill and kick it into high gear.
