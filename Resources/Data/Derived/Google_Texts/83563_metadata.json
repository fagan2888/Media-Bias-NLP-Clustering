On November 21st, the president\u2019s solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, asked the Supremes for another favour. Mr Verrilli urges the justices to step in to save Mr Obama\u2019s immigration plan before the president bids farewell to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on January 20th 2017.\n\nThe president announced the policy changes a year ago via a series of executive orders. Since Congress had failed to pass an immigration package, Mr Obama explained, he would do what he could within the boundaries of existing law to ease the plight of some of America\u2019s 11m undocumented migrants. But Republicans cried foul. By unilaterally delaying the deportation of some 4.4m illegal immigrants, then-House Speaker John Boehner charged at the time, Mr Obama \u201ccemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left\u201d. A conservative commentator said the executive actions\u2014which would grant temporary relief to illegals who came to America as children and to parents whose children are American citizens and who have lived in the country since 2010\u2014constituted an \u201cimpeachable offence\u201d.\n\nMr Obama\u2019s promise of leniency never got off the ground. Texas and 25 other Republican states immediately sued the administration for violating, among other things, the Administrative Procedure Act, a law the requires notice and public comment on policy changes before they are implemented. The district court ruled that Texas and the other states had \u201cstanding\u201d, the legal right to sue the federal government, and that they were likely to prevail on their claims in a full trial. Earlier this month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.\n\nIn his 35-page brief asking the justices to review the Fifth Circuit ruling, Mr Verrilli writes that the secretary of homeland security has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to decide who gets deported and when. While \u201c[m]ore than 11m removable aliens are estimated to live in the United States\u201d, the brief reads, \u201cCongress has appropriated the funds to remove only a fraction of that population in any given year.\u201d In fact, the government \u201chas not been able to remove more than 4% of the estimated removable population in any year\u201d.\n\nGiven these constraints, violent criminals have been at the top of the removal list while law-abiding people have been spared deportation. Mr Obama\u2019s executive orders instruct the Department of Homeland Security to permit child immigrants and parents of American citizens to remain in the country legally and to breathe a bit more freely. The policy is meant as a humanitarian gesture to \u201chard-working people who have become integrated members of American society\u201d. It is, the administration insists, in line with \u201cthis nation\u2019s security and economic interests and make[s] common sense, because [it] encourage[s] these people to come out of the shadows, submit to background checks, pay fees, apply for work authorisation...and be counted.\u201d Mr Obama\u2019s actions do not, however, grant citizenship to anyone, and the deferred removal may be \u201crevoke[d] at any time\u201d.\n\nTexas and the other states complain that these changes put them on the spot to provide driving licences, work permits and the like to millions of legalised illegals. By requiring states to issue these new benefits, they say, the administration imposes new burdens on states and violates principles of federalism. Mr Verrilli\u2019s rejoinder is persuasive. While temporary legal status confers automatic federal benefits on these individuals, the states are under no obligation to provide any particular benefits of their own. Mr Obama\u2019s orders do \u201cnot bar a state from eliminating [a] subsidy if it believes that federal policy choices no longer align with its interests\u201d.\n\nTime is of the essence: the administration must persuade the Supreme Court to hear the case by the end of January to get the case on the docket for the term ending next June. Otherwise, Mr Obama will leave office before the case is resolved. Lawyers in the Solicitor General\u2019s office worked around the clock to submit the polished appeal a mere 11 days after the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling on November 9th. \u201cThe decision warrants immediate review\u201d, Mr Verrilli pleads. Without quick action, the lower court rulings \u201cwill force millions of people...to continue to work off the books, without the option of lawful employment to provide for their families. And it will place a cloud over the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who came to the United States as children [and] have lived here for years\u201d. The Supreme Court should step in to avert a \u201cfar-reaching and irreparable humanitarian impact\u201d.\n\nUnder court procedures, the states have 30 days to submit their response brief. But on Monday, Scott Keller, the solicitor general of Texas, wrote a note to the justices citing a litany of other work swamping the attorneys and requesting a 30-day extension. Mr Verrilli hopes the justices will not permit Texas and its red-state allies to tarry. \u201cThis court\u2019s review,\u201d he emphasises, \u201cis warranted now\".", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2015/11/blogs/democracy-america/20151128_usp502.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Undocumented migrants", "description": "FIVE months ago, the Supreme Court turned back a challenge to the Affordable Care Act that would have scuttled Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement.
