Rick Perry (R) is telling the story behind his much-talked-about eyewear, saying his wife, Anita, selected the frames and that he\u2019s \u201cpretty comfortable\u201d with the thick, black-rimmed specs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201d\n\nPerry opened up to The Atlantic\u2019s Michelle Cottle about his eyewear in a story published Tuesday , saying, \u201cFrom time to time, someone says, \u2018You need to get rid of the glasses.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a certain amount of people out there who say, \u2018He got the glasses to change his appearance.\u2019 I don\u2019t know whether it changed my appearance or not, but I\u2019m pretty comfortable. I like being able to see,\u201d Perry explains.\n\nThe 2012 GOP presidential candidate got the glasses about a year ago, and says they\u2019re a must-have after a decades-old eye injury came back to haunt him.\n\nPerry, 64, says he \u201clost complete vision\u201d in his left eye in 1967 after being hit \u201cwith a rock thrown across a football field by my best friend.\u201d The governor says although he didn\u2019t have access to an ophthalmologist after the injury, \u201cmy eye miraculously was healed\u201d and he went on to fly planes in the Air Force.\n\nAfter the 2012 White House race, Perry says a specialist diagnosed him with \u201cpre-retinal fibrosis,\u201d which he describes as an abnormally shaped retina. The Lone Star state politician was given a choice of surgery or glasses. His doctor advised him he\u2019d be \u201cmore comfortable\u201d going the glasses route.\n\n\u201cSo anyway, there's the story of how it came for me to make the decision to wear glasses,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Texas Gov.
