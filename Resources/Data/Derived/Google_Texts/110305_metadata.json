Obviously, this was a concerning statistic--if it were actually true.\n\nIt turns out it wasn't, and even figures on the left agree. There's been nowhere near 355 mass shootings in 2015, and according to Mother Jones editor Mark Folman, there have been exactly four.\n\nAt Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four \u201cmass shootings\u201d this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982. What explains the vastly different count? The answer is that there is no official definition for \u201cmass shooting.\u201d Almost all of the gun crimes behind the much larger statistic are less lethal and bear little relevance to the type of public mass murder we have just witnessed again. Including them in the same breath suggests that a 1 a.m. gang fight in a Sacramento restaurant, in which two were killed and two injured, is the same kind of event as a deranged man walking into a community college classroom and massacring nine and injuring nine others. Or that a late-night shooting on a street in Savannah, Ga., yesterday that injured three and killed one is in the same category as the madness that just played out in Southern California. While all the victims are important, conflating those many other crimes with indiscriminate slaughter in public venues obscures our understanding of this complicated and growing problem. Everyone is desperate to know why these attacks happen and how we might stop them \u2014 and we can\u2019t know, unless we collect and focus on useful data that filter out the noise.\n\nAs it turns out, the \"355\" number comes from an anti-gun subreddit and includes a far broader definition of \"mass shooting\" than the one used by either the FBI or groups like Mother Jones.\n\nThe statistics now being highlighted in the news come primarily fromshootingtracker.com, a website built by members of a Reddit forum supporting gun control called GunsAreCool. That site aggregates news stories about shooting incidents \u2014 of any kind \u2014 in which four or more people are reported to have been either injured or killed. It\u2019s not clear why the Redditors use this much broader criteria. The founder of the \u201cshooting tracker\u201d project, who currently goes by the handle \u201cBilly Speed,\u201d told me it was his choice: \u201cThree years ago I decided, all by myself, to change the United States\u2019 definition of mass shooting.\u201d It\u2019s also not clear how many of those stories \u2014 many of them from local outlets, including scant detail \u2014 are accurate.\n\nEvents like the attack in San Bernardino on Wednesday or the shooting at Umpqua Community College in October are thankfully very rare. It's important to remember this and it's also important to ensure that statistics are accurate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not correct..05/26/2016 10:59:58AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not correct.", "title": "No, there haven't been 355 'mass shootings' this year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/12/05/mother-jones-editor-that-355-mass-shootings-statistic-is-really-wrong-n2089407", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/337/16a7c8a2-581e-4d81-9325-14a0380b8afa.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not correct.", "title": "No, there haven't been 355 'mass shootings' this year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/12/05/mother-jones-editor-that-355-mass-shootings-statistic-is-really-wrong-n2089407", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/337/16a7c8a2-581e-4d81-9325-14a0380b8afa.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Mother Jones Editor: That '355 Mass Shootings' Statistic Is Really Wrong, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00bd\"", "article_summary": "There's been nowhere near 355 mass shootings in 2015, and according to Mother Jones editor Mark Folman, there have been exactly four.\nAt Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings.\nBy our measure, there have been four \u201cmass shootings\u201d this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.\nAs it turns out, the \"355\" number comes from an anti-gun subreddit and includes a far broader definition of \"mass shooting\" than the one used by either the FBI or groups like Mother Jones.\nThe answer is that there is no official definition for \u201cmass shooting.\u201d Almost all of the gun crimes behind the much larger statistic are less lethal and bear little relevance to the type of public mass murder we have just witnessed again."}
