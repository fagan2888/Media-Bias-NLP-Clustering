You know that old theory, trickle-down economics. That has been tried; that has failed. It has failed rather spectacularly.\u201d\n\nThree days later, realizing that she had both jumped the shark and gone overboard, she tried for a Clintonian rhetorical \u201cmulligan\u201d at another campaign rally:\n\n\"Let me be absolutely clear about what I've been saying for a couple of decades: Our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs here in an America where workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out\u2014not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas.\"\n\nIt is absolutely clear why Mrs. Clinton is seesawing between condemning and giving left-handed compliments to businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nShe wants to bash them to keep collecting campaign contributions from the left. But to have it both ways, she also wants to reassure businesses and entrepreneurs that she\u2019s (wink, wink) only practicing temporary political pandering to appease the left until she\u2019s elected president, so please keep the campaign contributions flowing.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton remains wet about \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d and wild and wacky in her mode swings.\n\nDefying all economic logic and reality, Mrs. Clinton commits the ultimate economic on-the-one-hand-other hand chicanery.\n\nShe claims that American businesses and entrepreneurs can easily create jobs at home if only government stops handing them tax breaks that enable them to \u201coutsource\u201d jobs and \u201cstash their profits overseas.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s break down Mrs. Clinton\u2019s breakdown in economic understanding.\n\nIn an American Thinker blog called \u201cHillary Clinton: Trickle-Down Ignorance,\u201d C.M. Phillips writes that, \u201cOf course it is businesses and corporations that create jobs. The tired old trickle-down economics meme should be relegated to the dustbin of history.\u201d Phillips says that \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d is just trash talk but that the real economic concept of a \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d clarifies how \u201ccorporations and businesses create jobs.\u201d\n\nPhillips explains the multiplier effect by citing a study in the book \"The New Geography of Jobs\" by University of California, Berkeley economics professor Enrico Moretti that shows that, \u201ceach high-tech job eventually creates five new jobs. Two of these five new jobs will be professional (e.g., doctors, accountants, lawyers) and three will be non-professional (e.g., waiters, clerks).\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s economic illiteracy about the jobs multiplier effect (from businesses of all kinds) is mirrored by her ideological soul mates, Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Barack Obama.\n\nAll three rant about \u201ctrickle-down economics,\u201d \u201ctax breaks\u201d for businesses and \u201coutsourcing\u201d jobs. But what they are really creating with their policies is \u201chose-down economics.\u201d\n\n\u201cHose-down economics\u201d means that Mrs. Clinton, Senator Warren and President Obama (and their political allies) hose down businesses and entrepreneurs and drown domestic job creation because they support America having the highest corporate taxes in the developed world and some of the most job-destructive, job-outsourcing regulations in developed economies.\n\nFor example, ObamaCare is a gusher when it comes to hosing down businesses and entrepreneurs with job-killing costs and regulations. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated (its estimates keep varying) that because of ObamaCare, \u201cVirtually as many Americans will lack health coverage in 10 years as before the law was passed\u2014but 2 million fewer will be working than if the law hadn\u2019t passed.\u201d\n\nIndeed, hose-down economics via ObamaCare also affects the very middle class Americans that Mrs. Clinton, Senator Warren and President Obama claim to care so much about.\n\nListen to one of the legends of job creation in America, who also is renowned for providing high quality, low cost products of special appeal to middle class/working class Americans.\n\nHe is Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, also founder of Job Creators Alliance and Job Creators Network. Mr. Marcus told Fox Business anchor Neil Cavuto that in 2015, after this year\u2019s midterm elections, when certain provisions of ObamaCare kick in, up to 150 million Americans will be \u201cvery, very hurt\u201d by ObamaCare\u2019s cutbacks in health care coverage and will suffer from \u201cvery, very high co-pays.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton is truly on a wet, wild and wacky tear\u2014tearing up her credibility on job creation and economic growth. Those are two of the most important areas where a would-be president of the United States cannot, in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s words, be seen to have \u201cfailed rather spectacularly.\u201d\n\nCommunications consultant Jon Kraushar is at www.jonkraushar.net.
