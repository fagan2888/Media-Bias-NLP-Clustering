CVC Invests in Fraud Detector Kount, as Cybersecurity Attract Buyers

The deal follows the acquisitions of L-3, Novetta and Trustev

Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners is making an $80 million growth equity investment in mobile fraud detection company Kount Inc.

Kount, located in Boise, Idaho, provides cloud-based fraud detection software to the retail, gaming and financial services sectors. Its products are designed to reduce fraud transactions that are made online and through mobile devices, allowing retailers to accept more valid orders. Kount’s technology is used by payment processors such as Chase Paymenttech and Paypal Holdings Inc.’s (Nasdaq: PYPL) Braintree.

“The payments fraud and security industry is one that we have been actively targeting for a while,” says CVC managing director Jason Glass. CVC is making the investment through CVC Growth Fund, which focuses on the middle-market technology sector by investing up to $200 million in equity.

Cybersecurity and fraud detection companies have been receiving buyer interest. Caci International Inc. (NYSE: CACI) is buying L-3 National Security Solutions; Carlyle Group (Nasdaq: CG) is adding Novetta; and TransUnion (NYSE: TRU) has acquired Trustev.
