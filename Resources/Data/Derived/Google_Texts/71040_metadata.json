Even after it\u2019s over, a central question will remain. Why did they do it? Why did congressional Republicans trigger a shutdown for which they would predictably be blamed and from which they could win few Democratic concessions? The conventional answer blames stupidity, craziness and fanaticism. This is too glib and partisan. It misses a deeper cause that, I believe, helps explain why politics has become more dysfunctional.\n\nBy dysfunctional, I mean that it\u2019s less able to mediate differences and conflicts. This is, after all, a central purpose of politics. Broadly speaking, conflicts originate from interest groups and ideologies. The curse of U.S. politics is that it\u2019s become less about interests and more about ideologies \u2014 and ideologies breed moral absolutes, rigid agendas and strong emotions.\n\nTo be sure, interest-group politics can involve huge stakes and fierce disputes: farmers seeking subsidies, multinational companies plugging tax breaks, Social Security recipients protecting benefits. Sometimes compromises satisfy everyone, but even when they don\u2019t, spillovers are usually modest. Although adversaries may detest each other, their ill will tends to focus on narrow disagreements.\n\nBy contrast, ideological differences are expansive and explosive. To me, \u201cideology\u201d extends beyond an explicit political philosophy. It includes broad differences in lifestyles and basic assumptions about America\u2019s best interests. In recent decades, ideological issues have occupied more of the political stage for both left and right. The argument over the size of government is a proxy for a deep divide. The left sees bigger government as a tool for social justice; the right fears it\u2019s a threat to freedom. Moral crusades abound. \u201cSaving the planet\u201d (global warming) is one. Preventing \u201cmurder\u201d is another: that\u2019s gun control for the left and outlawing abortion for the right. The left\u2019s campaign for \u201cgay rights\u201d is the right\u2019s quest to save the \u201ctraditional family.\u201d\n\nJust why partisan differences have widened is controversial, but they clearly have. \u201c[B]asic beliefs are more polarized along partisan lines than at any point in the past 25 years,\u201d said a 2012 Pew opinion study. One question asked about the need for \u201cstricter laws and regulations to protect the environment.\u201d Among Democrats, 93 percent agreed, the same as in 1992; for Republicans, agreement was 47 percent, down from 86 percent in 1992. Large gaps have also opened on the social safety net, minority preferences and immigration. Some centrists are alienated; more count themselves as \u201cindependents.\u201d\n\nA crucial difference between interest-group and ideological politics is what motivates people to join. For interest-group politics, the reason is simple \u2014 self-interest. People enjoy directly the fruits of their political involvement. Farmers get subsidies; Social Security recipients, checks. By contrast, the foot soldiers of ideological causes don\u2019t usually enlist for tangible benefits for themselves but for a sense that they\u2019re making the world a better place. Their reward is feeling good about themselves.\n\nI\u2019ve called this \u201cthe politics of self-esteem\u201d \u2014 and it profoundly alters politics. For starters, it suggests that you don\u2019t just disagree with your adversaries; you also look down on them as morally inferior. It\u2019s harder to compromise when differences involve powerful moral convictions. Indeed, if politics\u2019 subconscious payoff is higher self-esteem, it makes sense not to cooperate at all. Consorting with the devil will make you feel worse, not better. What\u2019s more satisfying is to prove your superiority by depicting your opponents as dangerous, thoughtless and morally bankrupt. Cable TV and the Internet feast on such outbursts.\n\nAll this relates to the present. Why do House Republicans persist when the self-inflicted damage is so great? In a CBS poll this past week, 44 percent blamed Republicans for the shutdown while 35 percent blamed the Democrats. One answer is that \u201cstanding on principle\u201d bolsters their self-esteem. Tea party types can feel they\u2019ve affirmed their moral courage.\n\nSimilarly, the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) \u2014 the cause of so much conflict \u2014 exemplifies the politics of self-esteem. Its main advocates, starting with the president, all have health insurance; they won\u2019t benefit directly. But the ACA serves as a platform for them to assert their moral superiority. They care about people, while their opponents are heartless. (Ignored is the fact that improvements in people\u2019s health will, at best, be modest. Many uninsured are healthy; others already receive care.)\n\nThe triumph of ideology is one of the great political upheavals of recent decades. It is, of course, partial; it coexists with interest-group politics and always will. It\u2019s also full of paradoxes. On both the left and right, many activists are intelligent, sincere and hardworking. But the addition of so many high-minded people \u2014 usually \u201ctrue believers\u201d in some cause \u2014 to the political system has made it work worse. It increasingly fails to conciliate or, on many major issues, to decide.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Robert Samuelson, ideology, government shutdown, democrats, republicans, obamacare, tea party", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The politics of self-esteem is paralyzing America.", "title": "Robert Samuelson: The shutdown is a triumph of ideology", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-the-shutdown-is-a-triumph-of-ideology/2013/10/06/1bc17054-2d4c-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/30/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Budget_Battle-0c082-1609.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-the-shutdown-is-a-triumph-of-ideology/2013/10/06/1bc17054-2d4c-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Robert Samuelson, ideology, government shutdown, democrats, republicans, obamacare, tea party", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1bc17054-2d4c-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The politics of self-esteem is paralyzing America."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded08\"", "article_summary": "It is, of course, partial; it coexists with interest-group politics and always will.\nFor interest-group politics, the reason is simple \u2014 self-interest.\nTo be sure, interest-group politics can involve huge stakes and fierce disputes: farmers seeking subsidies, multinational companies plugging tax breaks, Social Security recipients protecting benefits.\nThe triumph of ideology is one of the great political upheavals of recent decades.\nIn a CBS poll this past week, 44 percent blamed Republicans for the shutdown while 35 percent blamed the Democrats."}
