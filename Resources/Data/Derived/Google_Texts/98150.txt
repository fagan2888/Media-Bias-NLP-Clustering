After catching three touchdowns against Indianapolis on Sunday, Broncos tight end Julius Thomas was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday.

Thomas caught seven passes for 104 yards and three scores to help the Broncos win 31-24 in their season opener. The three touchdowns tied Denverâ€™s single-game record for a tight end, a mark Shannon Sharpe achieved three times.



It is the first time Thomas has earned the AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.

Thomas has 15 receiving touchdowns since the beginning of last season, which is the best among all AFC players during that span, and second only to New Orleans TE Jimmy Graham in the NFL.
