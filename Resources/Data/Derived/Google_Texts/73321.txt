Six people were injured in a crash that closed the eastbound lanes of Interstate 30 in Fort Worth Saturday morning.

A Ford SUV rolled over about 11:20 a.m. near Bridgewood Drive after the driver swerved to avoid crashing into the vehicle in front of her, Fort Worth Police Sgt. Steve Enright said in an email.

The SUV rolled over, injuring the people inside.

At least one child was ejected from the car, Enright said.

A five-year-old was airlifted to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, Enright said.

The other three children and the driver, who was their mother, were taken by ambulance to area hospitals with non-life threatening injuries. Another woman declined transport and was treated at the scene.

The children were not in car seats, Enright said.
