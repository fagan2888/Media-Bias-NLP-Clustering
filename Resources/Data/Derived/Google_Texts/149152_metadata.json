Scott Walker should have just said, \"Who am I to judge?\"\n\nIn a way, it appears that this may have been what he was trying to say, or at least that's one reading of his problematic remarks to The Washington Post.\n\nOr perhaps he should have just said, \"Of course Barack Obama is a Christian. The Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Jr., confirmed that Obama was baptized in Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago sometime during the early 1990s, although it doesn't appear that the church recorded the date. Some people think that it was in 1988, but no one is sure.\"\n\nRepublicans who are asked this gotcha question in the future will know that -- while the doctrinal specifics of Obama's faith remain a mystery, and he has never joined a church inside the DC Beltway -- this is a man who has testified, as follows:\n\nSo one Sunday, I put on one of the few clean jackets I had, and went over to Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street on the South Side of Chicago. And I heard Reverend Jeremiah A. Wright deliver a sermon called \"The Audacity of Hope.\" And during the course of that sermon, he introduced me to someone named Jesus Christ. I learned that my sins could be redeemed. I learned that those things I was too weak to accomplish myself, He would accomplish with me if I placed my trust in Him. And in time, I came to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world and in my own life.\n\nIt was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity one day and affirm my Christian faith. It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church, as folks sometimes do. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. The skeptical bent of my mind didn't suddenly vanish. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth and carrying out His works.\n\nAs David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network candidly put it: \"That, ladies and gentlemen, is called a conversion experience.\"\n\nSo, as I have stressed many times, there is no reason not to believe that Obama considers himself a member of the United Church of Christ, for decades the flock that has defined the left edge of free church, congregational Protestantism.\n\nSo what happened in The Washington Post story that is creating such an online buzz?\n\nThe key question, frankly, is the headline. Does it express what Walker was actually saying? That headline, of course, proclaims:\n\nGov. Scott Walker: \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 whether Obama is a Christian\n\nNow, read the top of this report and try to figure out what happened in this exchange.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott K. Walker, a prospective Republican presidential contender, said Saturday he does not know whether President Obama is a Christian.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Walker said in an interview at the JW Marriott hotel in Washington, where he was attending the winter meeting of the National Governors Association.\n\n\n\nTold that Obama has frequently spoken publicly about his Christian faith, Walker maintained that he was not aware of the president\u2019s religion.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually never talked about it or I haven\u2019t read about that,\u201d Walker said, his voice calm and firm. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked him that,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked me to make statements about people that I haven\u2019t had a conversation with about that.
