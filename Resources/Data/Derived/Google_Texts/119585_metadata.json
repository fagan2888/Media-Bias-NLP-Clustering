GOW AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TALK ABOUT IT. UNHAPPINESS REFLECTED IN THE NUMBERS. \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" FOUND 7% OF VOTERS ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. ONE BIG EXAMPLE IS IN THE MILWAUKEE AREA AS KEVIN TIBBLES FOUND THIS WEEK IN MEETING AMERICA. >> ON A GORGEOUS SUMMER EVENING, THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLERS MAY BE DANCING IN THE STREETS. BUT THE POLITICS HERE ARE ANYTHING BUT A WALK IN THE PARK. >> EVERYBODY IS UNITED IN SUPPORT OF THE GREEN BAY PACKERS. SITS WHEN WE GET TO PARTISAN POLITICS THAT THESE DIVISIONS BECOME DEEP. >> WHEN CHARLES FRANKLIN CONDUCTED A POLL FOR THE MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL, HE FOUND A STATE SO POLITICALLY ENTRENCHED, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS DON'T EVEN LIVE IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS ANYMORE. >> IT CHANCE DRAMATICALLY FROM DEEP BLUE TO DEEP RED RIGHT AT THE COUNTY LINES AND IT JUST LEAPS OUT AT YOU. >> HERE IN MILWAUKEE, THERE'S A DIVIDING LINE. ONE SIDE OF THE STREET REPUBLICAN, THE OTHER DEMOCRAT. WITHIN THE CITY, 63% GIVE PRESIDENT OBAMA THE THUMBS-UP. IN THE SUBURBS IT'S 64% THUMB'S DOWN. AND THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER ENJOYS 63% APPROVAL IN THE SUBURBS AND 61% DISAPPROVAL IN THE CITY. NEIGHBORS WORLDS APART. IN THE CITY AT GLORIOUS MALONE'S SPECIALTY MEAT COMPANY STARTED BY HER MOTHER IN THE KITCHEN. >> THREE AT A TIME. >> DAPHNE MALONE JONES WATCHED A BUSINESS GROW BY WORD OF MOUTH. >> IT'S SO DELICIOUS. >> WHEN PARTISAN DIVISIONS WITHIN THE BELTWAY SPREAD, SHE SAID IT'S BAD FOR THE BUSINESS OF NATION BUILDING. >> HOW DO WE COME TOGETHER FROM BOTH SIDES. SO WE MEET IN THE MIDDLE AND ACCOMPLISH THE TASK. >> BACK AT SUBURBAN FALLS, A.J.'S OWNER HAS A RULE BEHIND THE BAR. >> DON'T TALK ABOUT RELIGION, DON'T TALK ABOUT POLITICS. >> PATRONS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL DISCUSS THE POLITICAL DEEP FREEZE. >> IT SEEMS TO ME YEARS AGO YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT POLITICS WITH SOMEBODY THAT WAS DIFFERENT THAN YOU AND TODAY YOU CAN'T. EVERYBODY IS SO HARD CORE IN WHAT THEY BELIEVE. THEY ARE SO SET IN THEIR WAYS. I'M THAT WAY, ALSO. I HAD TO PUT UP WITH OBAMA TWO TERMS NOW. I'M NOT A FAN OF THE HEALTH CARE ACT. >> WHILE SOME IN THE SUBURBS SUPPORT SUING THE PRESIDENT OVER HIS HANDLING OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. CITY LEADER CLARENCE MONTGOMERY CALLS IT AN UNHEALTHY DISTRACTION. >> GOOD GOVERNANCE AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING AS FAR AS THIS LAWSUIT IS CONCERNED IS AN OXYMORON. IT'S EASIER TO SAY NO THAN SIT DOWN AND SAY HOW CAN WE FIND A YES. >> WHAT WOULD IT TAKE? >> THIS WON'T CHANGE UNTIL IT BECOMES ELECTORALLY DESTRUCTIVE TO ONE PARTY OR PERHAPS BOTH. >> Reporter: UNTIL THEN THE POLITICAL PEAKS AND VALLEYS WILL LIKELY KEEP THE TWO NEIGHBORHOODS APART. FOR \"MEET THE PRESS,\" KEVIN TIBBLES. >> AT LEAST THEY ARE STILL DANCING IN MILWAUKEE. CHUCK, I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY -- IT TOTALLY BECOMES ELECTORALLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR BOTH SIDES. >> THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE. WE DON'T HAVE AN ELECTORAL SYSTEM WHERE SWING VOTERS MATTER. THEY DON'T MATTER. WE KNOW WHAT THE MIDDLE WANTS. UNTIL YOU HAVE CANDIDATES THAT FEEL AS IF THEY HAVE TO MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR BASE IN A GENERAL ELECTION MORE OFTEN OR THEY WILL LOSE. IF THAT'S GONE, THAT INTENT IS NOT THERE, YOU GET THIS. IN THE FRIEDMAN INTERVIEW, TALK ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY, PRESIDENT SAYING OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IN SOME WAYS IS WORSE THAN SOME OF THE STUFF HE'S SEEING. THAT QUITE THE SHOT AT HIS OPPOSITION. >> A TURNAROUND, THERE COULD BE A REVULSION, REACTION AGAINST DO NOTHING CONGRESS, WITH ALL APOLOGIES. BUT THE DO NOTHING CONGRESS, THE INEFFECTIVE WHITE HOUSE LEADERSHIP, TO SORT OF WASHINGTON AT LARGE, I THINK THESE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE STAYING HOME IN MASSES, WHICH IS REALLY UPSETTING TO ANYONE THAT CARES ABOUT DEMOCRACY OR AN OUTPOURING OF THROW THE BUMS OUT. >> THE IDEA THAT WE FACE BIG CHALLENGES AND THAT OUR SYSTEM, ENTIRE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT UP TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. THAT'S DAUNTING, FRUSTRATING AND BEYOND. DEMORALIZING. >> OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS MEANT, DESIGNED TO MAKE IT HARD TO DO BIG THINGS. YOU ONLY DO BIG THINGS IF THERE'S A NATIONAL CONSENSUS OR ONE PARTY CONTROLS LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE. THAT'S RELATIVELY RARE. IF YOU THINK THINGS ARE POISONOUS AND DIVIDED NOW. WAIT UNTIL PRESIDENT OBAMA DOES UNILATERAL AMNESTY HE'S TALKING ABOUT. MUCH, MUCH WORSE AFTER THAT. A STARK HIJACKING OF THE LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION WITH MALICE AFOR THOUGHT. >> THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION. LOOK, I THINK PEOPLE OUT THERE VOTE FOR CANDIDATES WHO SPEAK TO THEIR NEEDS, MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES. I THINK ANY CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR OFFICE NOW WHO IS AUTHENTIC, WHO SAYS I'M ON YOUR SIDE. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO TO HELP YOU OUT, THOSE CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO WIN. THOSE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO THEN REFLECT -- >> I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE.
