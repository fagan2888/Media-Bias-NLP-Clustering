Davis, who will help select independent firms to review the sheriff\u2019s department and search for a new sheriff, said the problem with the department\u2019s internal affairs bureau may be its process rather than the people.\n\n\u201cObviously, something needs to be fixed,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis and Mayor Michael Hancock met with the media Thursday to discuss their plans for the troubled sheriff\u2019s department. They said a definitive plan has not been formed but pledged that everything is on the table when it comes to reforming the management, policies and organization.\n\nHancock asked for patience as the city tries to reform the department.\n\n\u201cThese problems did not develop overnight and they\u2019re not going to be solved overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve uncovered a complex web, a deep culture we\u2019ve got to pull apart here.\u201d\n\nLater Hancock said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how it got this far. I think it\u2019s decades of a lack of attention, a lack of leadership.\u201d\n\nMultiple reviews of the Denver Sheriff Department are in the works after a series of embarrassing videos surfaced that showed deputies abusing inmates. The most serious case has led to a $3.25 million settlement with former inmate Jamal Hunter, who was choked by Deputy Edward Keller and beaten and scalded by other inmates.\n\nIn that case, a federal judge called for a federal investigation into the agency.\n\nDOCUMENT: Read Keller\u2019s disciplinary letter. Note the letter contains graphic language that might be offensive.\n\nHancock offered more clarity on the reviews and how they would be used. Multiple internal investigations, including four task forces organized by former Sheriff Gary Wilson, will be given to the outside firm that eventually will perform a top-to-bottom assessment of the department.\n\nThat assessment will be in tandem with the national search for a new sheriff, said Amber Miller, the mayor\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nThe settlement with Hunter requires outside reviews of the city\u2019s legal staff and the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nAlready, the law firm Lewis Roca Rothgerber has been chosen to review the city\u2019s legal protocols, policies and attorney training. The firm also will look into the conduct of assistant city attorney Stuart Shapiro, who was accused of interfering in an investigation during the Hunter case. He has been placed on leave.\n\nDavis is a former special-agent-in-charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver Division and the former executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety and Homeland Security director.\n\nDavis said he expects the external review to be much like an FBI internal inspection. That process includes interviews with top executives and command staff to develop profiles of them. And outsiders would be interviewed as well.\n\nAmong the issues that could be examined are the sheriff department\u2019s use-of-force policy and whether the deputies should remain under the city\u2019s Career Service System.\n\nThe police and fire departments are overseen by the Civil Service Commission. It would take a public vote to change the city\u2019s charter before the move could happen, Hancock said.\n\nHancock said he had been talking to Davis about problems within the Denver jails before Wilson stepped down in July. It was unclear how much Davis will be paid for his work.\n\nHancock said he does not know how much the city will spend on the multiple reviews and on a search firm. But it will be less expensive to spend money on changes rather than to continue paying costly settlements, he said.\n\nHancock pledged the audits, reviews and evaluations would be as open as possible.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to work here and how we\u2019re going to instill and gain the trust of the public is to be as open as possible and share as much as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former FBI agent says \u201cdeep dive\u201d review needed at Denver jails", "title": "Former FBI agent says \u201cdeep dive\u201d review needed at Denver jails", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/07/former-fbi-agent-says-deep-dive-review-needed-at-denver-jails/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140807_070311_James-Davis.jpg", "height": 478}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140807_070311_James-Davis.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-07T18:54:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:31:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver Jail"}, "article_summary": "The former FBI agent who will guide Denver through its review of the sheriff\u2019s department said the agency needs a \u201cdeep dive\u201d review, and the internal affairs bureau especially needs attention.\nDavis and Mayor Michael Hancock met with the media Thursday to discuss their plans for the troubled sheriff\u2019s department.\nThe settlement with Hunter requires outside reviews of the city\u2019s legal staff and the sheriff\u2019s department.\nAlready, the law firm Lewis Roca Rothgerber has been chosen to review the city\u2019s legal protocols, policies and attorney training.\nHancock said he had been talking to Davis about problems within the Denver jails before Wilson stepped down in July."}
