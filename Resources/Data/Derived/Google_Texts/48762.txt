Ben Arthur Davis Park in Meridian was filled with old fashioned soul food Saturday.

The Meridian Holiness Deliverance Church held its second annual Old Fashioned Food Festival. Members of the community could come and purchase plates of food as part of a fundraising effort for the church.

"Our church is just one of several churches in our ministry and this fundraiser's proceeds go to non-profit organizations throughout the southeastern part of the United States," Meridian Holiness Deliverance Church Associate Pastor Joseph Denson says.

A plate of food came with a main dish, three sides, and a desert.
