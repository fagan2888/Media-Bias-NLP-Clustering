(REUTERS/Joe Skipper)\n\n4244381\n\nDoctors are now using your credit card data to track your lifestyle habits so they can determine how likely you are to get sick. Their motivation comes from Obamacare, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cUnder Obamacare, they (doctors) really want to keep you healthy,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Shannon Pettypiece said in an interview. \u201cNow they don\u2019t get paid for how many tests or services they provide, they get paid by keeping you healthy, that\u2019s part of the reason why they\u2019re so interested in this consumer data.\u201d\n\nPettypiece describes how businesses like Target and Amazon already use credit card data as an advertising tool. Doctors are going to use the data to try and tell you how to live if they think you\u2019re indulging in unhealthy habits, like eating pizza or going skydiving.\n\nFor doctors, this is just good business. Keeping track of their patients and preventing them from health catastrophes supplies doctors with their paycheck.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has begun levying fines on hospitals that have too many patients readmitted within a month and rewarding hospitals that fare well against clinical benchmarks and on patient surveys,\u201d Bloomberg reported.\n\nIdealists might say Obamacare forces doctors to take the Hippocratic Oath seriously and make their patients\u2019 health an absolute priority instead of making checklists of things to do \u2013 like screenings and annual checkups \u2013 in order to get paid.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation espouses a different view. If the government is in charge of financing health care and not the patients, then it will have a hard time keeping the patients\u2019 best interests in mind.\n\n\u201cA key goal of health care reform should be the restoration of the traditional doctor\u2013patient relationship,\u201d Alyene Senger wrote on Heritage\u2019s website. \u201cIn such a relationship, physicians would be the key decision makers in the delivery of care, and patients would be the key decision makers in the financing of care. This cannot be achieved unless and until patients, not the government, control health care dollars and decisions, and third-party insurance executives are directly accountable to individuals and families, who really pay the health care bills.\u201d\n\nAs a result of new health care regulations introduced by Obamacare, doctors must find new ways to do their job, even if it means snooping around in their patients\u2019 business.\n\nBut the fact remains: doctors are now joining the NSA in a noble mission to \u201ckeep you safe.\u201d\n\nFollow Kate on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kate Patrick", "description": "Just add 'em to the list of people not to trust, right after the NSA and Google", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Doctors are now using your credit card data to track your lifestyle habits so they can determine how likely you are to get sick.
