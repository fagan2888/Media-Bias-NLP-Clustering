His last job was with the New York Islanders in 2007-08. During his five-year departure, Nolan coached Latvia\u2019s national team, and will continue in that post at the Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\nRELATED Ted Nolan Comes Home: Named Interim Coach of Buffalo Sabres\n\nGeorge Armstrong broke that barrier for First Nations coaches in the NHL when he stepped behind the Toronto Maple Leafs\u2019 bench for 47 games during the 1988-89 seasons.\n\nThis season also marks the 60th anniversary of forward Fred Sasakamoose becoming the first Native to play in the NHL. He made his debut with the Chicago Blackhawks against the Toronto Maple Leafs in February 1954 and went on to appear in 10 more games that season before finishing his career in the minors.\n\nCurrently, there are 10 players in the league who have acknowledged Native heritage: Arron Asham, Rene Bourque, Kyle Chipchura, Vernon Fiddler, D.J. King, Dwight King, Cody McCormick, Carey Price, T. J. Oshie and Jordin Tootoo.\n\n*Some reporting from SI.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Historic NHL Matchup.
