Over the prior decades, the US innovation and growth engine led the world, in many aspects, through \u201cboom years\u201d of growing public and private investment in R&D in biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, imaging and diagnostics, protocols and procedures, and clinical practices. Government research sponsorships \u2013 NSF, NIH, CDC, DARPA, even DoD \u2013 drove early stage discoveries in academia, industry and at the medical research centers; development and the \u201cback end\u201d of innovation was carried on largely by industry to address unmet medical needs in the market place.\n\nToday\u2019s situation is vastly different. The US Affordable Care Act aims to assure healthcare for the previously uninsured 50 million (check #) \u2013 for whom routine treatments at the Emergency Room was unsustainable. The ACA mandates for improving the quality care to evidence based outcome standards while substantially lowering the cost of care are spurring waves of cost reductions and rethinking, redesign and \u201cnew thinking\u201d about clinical pathways, practices, work flows, purchases and virtually all aspects of healthcare.\n\nThis means that \u201cimprovements\u201d are occurring through more traditional tactics (e.g., restructuring and staff reductions) and also through more innovative \u201cnew thinking\u201d about how patients progress along the continuum of care. This means innovation in new services and treatments, new packaging and channels for delivery, shifting the responsibility to more patient-driven care, and new business models. There are exciting new innovations across the continuum of care not only treating a diagnosed disease or condition but in wellness, nutrition, exercise, with access provided through mobile / m-health solutions and more distributed \u201coutlets\u201d closer to where people live. Engaging patients and their family caregivers from pre-birth through end-of life-care is transforming healthcare. New disruptive ideas and innovations are leapfrogging the conventional wisdom. These are being driven and achieved by all types of players \u2013 some larger, many smaller that are fast growth and fast moving/acting, companies, social enterprises, community organizations \u2013 and in all regions of the world, with some of the most exiting leaps-of-frog occurring in developing market communities.\n\nSetting practical standards of care and performance, measuring results, communicating them transparently and holding stakeholders accountable are demonstrating which innovations deliver on their promises, with real impact and improving outcomes. Whereas medical professionals once focused primarily on safety and health outcome, today, there are driven to achieve high and higher quality outcomes while achieving patient satisfaction, and more cost effective and efficient delivery. Tracking, analyzing, sharing and making meaning out of these metrics are also critical to today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s healthcare and to driving innovation.\n\nThese are just a few of the reasons, in short, \u201cIt\u2019s the best of times in (and\u2026) the worst of times in healthcare, with thousands of exciting new innovations popping up in both traditional and nontraditional places.!\u201d\n\nIX: Why did IXL create Healthovate ? Where do these frameworks come from?\n\nPam: Healthovate is the third and latest, in IXL\u2019s series of innovation best practices books. Through its 40-plus years of experience with hundreds of leading global companies across industries, fast moving start ups, and research institutions, IXL\u2019s innovation management frameworks, processes, methodologies and tools have been utilized to inspire, enable, and support successes, best practices and lessons by entrepreneurs and stakeholders in these companies. Healthovate\u2019s case studies and lessons spark, provoke ideas and create excitement transforming healthcare across the globe.\n\nIX: How can this be a resource for you and your teams and companies?\n\nFor starters, Healthovate\u2019s case studies can ignite fresh and provocative thinking and action by you and your teams. They can inspire new ways along the entire value chain \u2013 beyond simply innovative products \u2014 new services, new solutions new channels, new partnerships, new business models. They provide users with the ability to envision what success looks like.\n\nWe invite and encourage you and your teams to use these case studies with open minds, and bring back to IXL and the Global Innovation Management Institute your experiences and the excellence you achieve in innovation to share with others.\n\nThrough open systems, sharing and transparency, we will grow innovation opportunities bigger, better, bolder, faster and with greater impact on patients the medical community and the population at large!\n\nIX: Can you share an example?\n\nSure!
