Wynne is a Maryland tax law that requires state residents to pay county income taxes on 100 percent of their personal income. Unlike most other states, however, Maryland takes no notice of the fact that many residents earn income\u2014and pay taxes on it\u2014outside of the state. Most other states offer a tax credit in this situation so that state residents don\u2019t end up paying twice. Maryland just makes its residents pay twice.\n\nOr at least it did until today. Because Maryland \u201ccreates an incentive for taxpayers to opt for intrastate rather than interstate economic activity,\u201d declared the majority opinion of Justice Samuel Alito, \u201cits law has the same economic effect as a state tariff, the quintessential evil targeted by the dormant Commerce Clause.\u201d\n\nThe dormant Commerce Clause refers to the idea that the Commerce Clause, in addition to granting Congress a limited power to regulate interstate commerce, also provides a check on the regulatory and taxing authority of the states. That check, Alito explained, forbids the states \u201cfrom discriminating against or imposing excessive burdens on interstate commerce,\u201d such as Maryland\u2019s now-defunct double-taxation scheme. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor all joined Alito\u2019s opinion.\n\nAlito\u2019s sharpest critics proved to be two of his most conservative colleagues, Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Scalia and Thomas each filed separate dissenting opinions, as did Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose dissent was joined by Justice Elena Kagan. According to Scalia, the dormant Commerce Clause is a \u201cjudicial fraud\u201d that allows federal judges to rewrite state laws according to their own preferences. Thomas, meanwhile, argued that Alito\u2019s take was totally at odds with constitutional history. \u201cIt seems highly implausible that those who ratified the Commerce Clause understood it to conflict with the income tax laws of their States and nonetheless adopted it without a word of concern,\u201d Thomas wrote.\n\nAlito\u2019s majority opinion tackled those two dissents head on. \u201cThis supposedly fraudulent doctrine has been applied in dozens of our opinions, joined by dozens of Justices,\u201d Alito shot back at Scalia. As for Thomas, Alito described his arguments as \u201cplainly unsound.\u201d The ratifiers of the Constitution appear unconcerned with this kind of out-of-state tax grab, Alito countered, because so few people back then lived in one state and earned income in another. \u201cWe are unaware of records showing, for example, that it was common in 1787 for workers to commute to Manhattan from New Jersey by rowboat or from Connecticut by stagecoach,\u201d Alito quipped.\n\nIn sum, Alito held, \u201cour existing dormant Commerce Clause cases all but dictate the result reached in this case.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne is available here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The conservative justices divide in Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v.
