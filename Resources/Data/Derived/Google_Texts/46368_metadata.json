Earlier this year, Bill O\u2019Brien, a New Hampshire Republican then running for Congress, described the Affordable Care Act as \u201ca law as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,\u201d while the rocker-provocateur Ted Nugent claimed that President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d programs of the 1960s were \u201cresponsible for more destruction to black America than the evils of slavery and the KKK combined.\u201d Not to be outdone, the Florida Democrat Alan Grayson compared the Tea Party to the KKK by sending constituents a fund-raising email containing an image of a burning cross. When challenged, Grayson replied, \u201cIf the hood fits, wear it.\u201d\n\nSuch metaphors offend many, but they are hardly unusual. Each passing news cycle brings fresh reports of the demonization, poisonous analogies, and historical slanders that characterize contemporary discourse. Whether comparing President Obama to Stalin, or Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin to Hitler, public argument is rage-driven, dysfunctional, and ethically questionable.\n\nI often talk with students about how argument is more than an instrument for persuasion, that it is equally and perhaps essentially an ethical activity. By this I mean that in making arguments about such topics as health care or government surveillance we can choose between language that expresses such virtues as honesty, accountability, and generosity, and utterances that rehearse the spleen and intolerance currently passing for normal discourse.\n\nYet such discussions can be frustratingly inconclusive, responding less to shared ethical standards than to the ideologies of the participants. Moreover, aren\u2019t provocative metaphors functioning exactly as they should? Metaphors are meant to unsettle. They are instances, according to George Lakoff, of \u201cnovel poetic language\u201d in which comparisons are made \u201cacross conceptual domains\u201d to stimulate new insights. We think in metaphors, and metaphorical language has structured our conceptions of reality since the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh. To seek to regulate metaphor is perhaps to limit our ways of seeing.\n\nAnd yet some metaphors we know\u2014we just know, as Justice Potter Stewart just knew about pornography\u2014are misleading, malicious, or worse. How do we decide? How do we determine what counts as an ethical metaphor? What criteria apply?\n\nI offer what I call the Four Tests, or criteria for evaluating the ethical standards of figurative language in public discourse.\n\n1. The History Test. How closely does the metaphor correspond to the facts of the case, as best we understand them? When the Arizona congressman Trent Franks compares abortion to genocide, for example, we can begin by asking what is meant by genocide, what forms does it take, what are its legal definitions. Where has it historically occurred, and under what conditions? Who has sponsored and who has suffered it? In short, we attempt to understand the term in all its legal, cultural, and historical contexts. And this means we have to know what such terms mean before using them.\n\n2. The Resonance Test. Certain metaphors and similes have a unique cultural power to incite. Such language goes beyond literal meanings to invoke longer histories of associations and images. \u201cHitler\u201d is one such term. When we think of Hitler, we think of more than an individual, no matter how invidious. We recall the Warsaw ghetto, the death camps, and the gas chambers. \u201cHitler\u201d is not simply the name of a person; it is a vessel brimming with historical memories. It is a bell that, when you ring it, the room is filled with other sounds, other echoes. There are many such terms: \u201clynching,\u201d \u201cblood libel,\u201d \u201capartheid.\u201d If we are to use such terms, we need to attend to their place in our collective cultural consciousness.\n\n3. The Proportionality Test. Is the seriousness of the metaphor proportional to that which it is applied? Some years ago, I read a story in The Boston Globe in which a sportswriter described the walls of Fenway Park as closing in on the visiting pitcher the way Russian tanks surrounded Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring. The metaphor failed, quite horribly, the proportionality test. When sensationalism overcomes judgment, we may be entering the realm of unethical discourse.\n\n4. The Quiet Room Test. I use \u201cQuiet Room\u201d here to indicate a place for writers\u2019 self-examination. The final test of the ethical metaphor, in other words, is the one we administer to ourselves. Deep down, we know\u2014do we not?\u2014when we are arguing to incite or to enlighten, to inflame or to understand. The last test, then, is the one we take in our own Quiet Rooms, evaluating the intentions and effects of our words.\n\nI do not imagine that those modest tests can be applied universally, or that they will resolve disputes between parties of fundamentally different values. Some divides cannot be breached. Yet the very act of reflection may serve as a starting point: an acknowledgment that the language of public argument inevitably engages us, students and teachers, in questions of ethics, values, and virtues. Such understanding, should it come, may be the first step toward a better, healthier, and ultimately more constructive practice of public discourse.\n\nJohn Duffy is an associate professor of English at the University of Notre Dame and director of the university writing program.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.6.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb932\"", "article_summary": "The final test of the ethical metaphor, in other words, is the one we administer to ourselves.\nHow do we determine what counts as an ethical metaphor?\nScott Walker of Wisconsin to Hitler, public argument is rage-driven, dysfunctional, and ethically questionable.\nHow closely does the metaphor correspond to the facts of the case, as best we understand them?\nWhen we think of Hitler, we think of more than an individual, no matter how invidious."}
