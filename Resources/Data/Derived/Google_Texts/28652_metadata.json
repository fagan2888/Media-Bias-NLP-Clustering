Companies and people alike frequently evoke the mental disorder with lighthearted puns or references just like that one. Misuse of the term \u201cOCD\u201d has become popular, leading to misunderstandings revolving around the disorder itself.\n\n\u201cWhen people have this common usage or knowledge of the term; it creates what we call a 'cultural script,' a commonly used way that identifies what something is, what kind of steps are involved, or if it is harmful or not,\u201d says Yulia Chentsova-Dutton, a cultural psychologist and a professor at Georgetown University.\n\nFor many, \u201cOCD\u201d has become synonymous with words like \u201cclean\u201d or \u201corganized\u201d\u2014qualities most would say are good.\n\nFor many, \u201cOCD\u201d has become synonymous with words like \u201cclean\u201d or \u201corganized\u201d\u2014qualities most would say are good. When OCD is seen as something \u201cgood\u201d rather than as a devastating illness, it\u2019s stripped of its reality.\n\n\u201cWhenever it\u2019s kind of a \u2018positive\u2019 thing, like with OCD, it means we are encouraging these symptoms, overlooking them, or encouraging people and their family members to overlook them, potentially,\u201d Chentsova-Dutton continued.\n\nPeople may just be trying to relate. When someone first comes into contact with the term, maybe she focuses on a perceived commonality. The \u201cobsessive\u201d part sticks in her memory and the \u201ccompulsive\u201d part and the \u201cdisorder\u201d part lose their meaning. So anything that she can remotely obsess over becomes equated with OCD.\n\n\u201c\u2018Obsessive\u2019 is a personality trait. It doesn\u2019t get in the way of your functioning, it\u2019s something you prefer. What people are meaning to say is, \u2018I am obsessive rather than OCD,\u2019 \u201d says Jeff Szymanski, executive director of the International OCD Foundation. \u201cYou\u2019re now mixing a distressing psychological disorder with a personality preference, and when you mix them, you lose the severity of the disorder.\u201d\n\nNearly one in 100 people suffer from OCD in the United States. Approximately 51 percent of those cases are severe.\n\n\"Your life becomes consumed with a fear and your preoccupation with getting rid of the fear \u2026 it becomes a vicious cycle,\" Alison Dotson, author of Being Me With OCD, told me in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to feel like you can\u2019t even control your own thoughts.\u201d\n\nAlison\u2019s experience with OCD is also one that stresses the effects of misguided portrayals of the disorder: \u201cI started obsessing when I was a child, and I wasn't diagnosed with OCD until I was two months shy of my 27th birthday. I suffered in silence for years and years because all I knew about OCD was that people wash their hands too much and always check to make sure the stove is off.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though I knew that I was a good person, it certainly didn't feel that way when I couldn't stop obsessing.\u201d\n\nWith OCD, there are obsessions (unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that repeat in a person\u2019s mind) and compulsions (acts that a person repeats in order to \u201cget rid\u201d of these obsessions). These compulsions are often done in a desperate attempt to protect oneself from the wave of anxiety the obsessions bring, not because the person actually wants engage in the compulsion. The cleaning and checking that Alison mentioned are just two examples of the many kinds of OCD compulsions people can have.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The term \"obsessive-compulsive\" has become a jokey shorthand, to the detriment of people who actually suffer.", "author": "Fatima Tipu", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The term \"obsessive-compulsive\" has become a jokey shorthand, to the detriment of people who actually suffer.", "title": "No, Your Quirks Aren't 'OCD'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/02/2446660754_292d673497_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/ocd-is-a-disorder-not-a-quirk/385562/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9edd\"", "article_summary": "The cleaning and checking that Alison mentioned are just two examples of the many kinds of OCD compulsions people can have.\nWhat people are meaning to say is, \u2018I am obsessive rather than OCD,\u2019 \u201d says Jeff Szymanski, executive director of the International OCD Foundation.\nMisuse of the term \u201cOCD\u201d has become popular, leading to misunderstandings revolving around the disorder itself.\nFor many, \u201cOCD\u201d has become synonymous with words like \u201cclean\u201d or \u201corganized\u201d\u2014qualities most would say are good.\nWhen OCD is seen as something \u201cgood\u201d rather than as a devastating illness, it\u2019s stripped of its reality."}
