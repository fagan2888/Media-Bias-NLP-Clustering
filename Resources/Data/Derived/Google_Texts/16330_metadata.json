Lebanon has been an arena for that struggle for the last decade during which Saudi Arabia's Lebanese allies have struggled to confront the growing power of Iran-backed Hezbollah.\n\nSaudi Arabia and other Gulf states have urged citizens against travel to Beirut. Many in Lebanon fear repercussions for the hundreds of thousands of Lebanese employed in the Gulf, while the crisis is also exacerbating Sunni-Shi'ite tensions.\n\n\"What happened in the last week from Saudi requires Saudi to apologize to Lebanon, because it insulted Lebanese,\" Sheikh Naim Qassem, the Hezbollah deputy leader, said in a speech during a religious occasion in Beirut. \"Lebanon will not be a Saudi emirate, or an emirate for anyone else,\" he said.\n\nHezbollah is part of a Lebanese unity government that includes Saudi-allied politicians but is hamstrung by divisions. The government this week issued a statement that fell short of condemning last month's attacks on Saudi missions by Iranians who were angered by the execution of a Shi'ite cleric.\n\nSaudi Arabia is demanding an apology from the government.\n\nSunni politician Saad al-Hariri on Monday urged King Salman not to abandon Lebanon, reflecting unease among Saudi allies who seem to have been caught off guard by the decision.\n\nInterior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a member of Hariri's Future Movement, said on Thursday he thought it was necessary to suspend \"for a time\" regular Future-Hezbollah meetings that have been credited with containing Sunni-Shi'ite tensions in Lebanon.\n\nThe Future-Hezbollah meetings are a rare example of Sunni-Shi'ite dialogue in the Middle East as rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran fuels wars in Syria and Yemen.\n\nEven with regional upheaval, Lebanon has so far avoided the kind of all-out war underway in Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting on the side of President Bashar al-Assad against Saudi-backed rebels.\n\nHariri accused Hezbollah on Thursday of \"acting freely in all Arab countries\", saying this risked \"an unprecedented catastrophe for the country and the Lebanese\".\n\nCENTRAL BANK WANTS GOVT TO FIX TIES\n\n\"The Saudi offensive pressure against positions of Iranian influence in the region has reached Lebanon,\" said Nabil Bou Monsef, a commentator at Lebanon's An-Nahar newspaper.\n\nThe central bank governor said he hoped the government would get \"its act together to reestablish good relations with Saudi Arabia, as Lebanon has always been an economic partner with the kingdom\".\n\nRiad Salameh told Reuters he had not been informed of any measures by Saudi Arabia targeting the Lebanese financial sector or expatriates in Saudi Arabia, saying he thought Saudi statements were \"not aggressive to the Lebanese people\".\n\nMedia reports about the size of Saudi deposits at the central bank were inflated, he said, and neither Saudi Arabia nor other Gulf Arab states had been in touch about them.\n\n\"I think the market has been misinformed, figures have been largely inflated,\" Salameh said.\n\n\"Besides all these stories circulating that are not substantiated by Saudi official positions ... I have not been informed officially, of any measure - coming or happening - concerning the financial sector,\" Salameh said.\n\n\"There is no risk on the Lebanese pound\" and the central bank and Lebanese commercial banks had \"the means ... to secure the stability of the Lebanese pound\", he said. The pound is pegged near 1,507.5 to the U.S. dollar.\n\nSaudi Arabia said on Friday it had blacklisted four companies and three Lebanese men for having links to Hezbollah.\n\nYemen's Gulf-backed government also this week accused Hezbollah of training Houthi forces, fighting alongside them, and planning attacks in Saudi Arabia. Iran and Hezbollah reject accusations they have provided military aid to the Houthis.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Perry/Laila Bassam; Editing by Dominic Evans)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah indicated there would be no apology to Saudi Arabia over", "title": "Hezbollah signals no end to Saudi crisis; central bank reassures on currency", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/26/Lebanons-central-bank-governor-sees-no-risk-pound", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/lebanon-cenbank_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/26/Lebanons-central-bank-governor-sees-no-risk-pound", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/lebanon-cenbank_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah indicated there would be no apology to Saudi Arabia over", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have urged citizens against travel to Beirut.\nRiad Salameh told Reuters he had not been informed of any measures by Saudi Arabia targeting the Lebanese financial sector or expatriates in Saudi Arabia, saying he thought Saudi statements were \"not aggressive to the Lebanese people\".\nYemen's Gulf-backed government also this week accused Hezbollah of training Houthi forces, fighting alongside them, and planning attacks in Saudi Arabia.\nMedia reports about the size of Saudi deposits at the central bank were inflated, he said, and neither Saudi Arabia nor other Gulf Arab states had been in touch about them.\nSaudi Arabia said on Friday it had blacklisted four companies and three Lebanese men for having links to Hezbollah."}
