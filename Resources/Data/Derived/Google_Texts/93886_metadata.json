Spencer Green/AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nJob growth last month exceeded expectations as the domestic economy added 280,000 positions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Friday Employment Situation report. The larger-than-expected gains made May the best month for employment growth so far this year.\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 5.5 percent, but the civilian labor force expanded by nearly 400,000 people. The number of individuals not in the labor force contracted by 208,000, and the overall labor force participation rate ticked up to 62.9 percent.\n\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\n\n\"Today's report shows the U.S. labor market still has tremendous momentum,\" Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at employment site Glassdoor, said in a research note Friday. \"With 280,000 new jobs and unemployment essentially unchanged at 5.5 percent, all signs both from BLS and data from Glassdoor point to the strongest job market in 15 years \u2013 one that job seekers today should be making the most of while it lasts.\"\n\n\n\nThe economic watchdogs over at the Federal Reserve won't have much to complain about this month, either, though one solid employment report may not be enough to push the Fed to implement the country's much-anticipated interest rate hike in the near term.\n\n\n\n\"From the Fed's perspective, a modest but positive trend in employment reinforces the chairman's assessment that the labor market has made vast improvement since the end of the Great Recession, but there remains much improvement still to be made,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at investment firm Sterne Agee, wrote in a research note Friday. \"In other words, surpassing a low bar of expectations is not synonymous with an economy strong enough to withstand a rising rate environment.\" Average Income Continues Slow but Steady Rise\n\nAverage Income Continues Slow but Steady Rise iStock What Happened:\n\n\n\nWage indicators ticked up modestly this week, suggesting American employees are slowly but surely gaining ground in terms of compensation.\n\n\n\nAn income report out of the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Monday showed disposable personal income rose 0.4 percent month over month in April following a flat March.\n\n\n\nAnd the Labor Department on Friday released data showing average hourly earnings jumped 8 cents in May to $24.96. Average hourly earnings are up 2.3 percent year over year.\n\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\n\nSteady earnings increases are a welcome sign. And while it would be ideal for consumers if wages picked up a little faster, they're at least consistently heading in the right direction.\n\n\n\nOn a more alarming note, worker productivity dropped 3.1 percent in the first quarter, with a 1.6 percent drop in output coupled with a 1.6 percent increase in hours worked. That signals U.S. employees are working longer hours, but \u2013 at least in the first quarter \u2013 they've been doing less with that extra time.\n\n\n\nThat, in turn, means a larger wage hike may be a ways off, as positive productivity would give employers more incentive to boost pay.\n\n\n\n\"Without productivity gains, Americans' standard of living will continue to be eroded with waning support for future income growth,\" Piegza wrote in a research note Thursday. Greece Bundles Loan Payments\n\nGreece Bundles Loan Payments Costas Baltas/InTime News via AP What Happened:\n\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund on Thursday announced plans by Greece to delay a series of four loan repayments due to the IMF this month.\n\n\n\nGreece's first deadline would have been Friday, but the embattled Mediterranean country instead has until the end of June to transfer $1.7 billion to its creditors in the IMF.\n\n\n\nNegotiations between Greek and IMF officials are ongoing, as Greece attempts to unlock bailout funds that its creditors are withholding until Greece agrees to certain spending and policy restrictions.\n\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\n\nIMF bylaws allow a country with outstanding loans to bundle them into one monthly payment, so the delayed deadline gives Greece more time to negotiate the release of more bailout funds. The cash-strapped country's at the point where it needs to take out more loans to pay back existing debt.\n\n\n\nBut the delay is also a smart move if Greece ends up defaulting on its payments (and potentially leaving the eurozone).\n\n\n\n\"If they\u2019re going to default, and it seems to me they\u2019re prepping for it, they\u2019re better off doing it when they have some money in the bank. Why give the IMF all the money and then default?\u201d says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. \u201cThis to me says they\u2019re doing what they say they were and they\u2019re actually starting to prep for a default.\u201d America's Trade Gap Shrinks\n\nAmerica's Trade Gap Shrinks (AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton, File) What Happened:\n\n\n\nAmerica's trade deficit shrunk in April after climbing to a six-year high in March, according to a report released Wednesday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. exported $189.9 billion worth of goods and services in April, $1.9 billion more than in March. Imports were valued at $230.8 billion, $7.8 billion lower than the month prior.\n\n\n\nThe total April deficit clocked in at $40.9 billion, down nearly $10 billion from March.\n\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\n\n\"New exports hammered the economy in the last two quarters, cutting fourth- and first-quarter growth by 1.0 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively,\" Patrick Newport, director of long-term forecasting at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a research note Wednesday. \"It's not clear that imports have steadied. They may drop again in May, but after that, they will climb on the heels of a strong dollar and relatively stronger U.S. growth.\"\n\n\n\nDespite last month's uptick, America's strong dollar has weighed on exports in recent months, as unfavorable foreign exchange rates make trade with the U.S. less desirable. April exports were ultimately down more than $5.1 billion from a year prior.\n\n\n\nImports, meanwhile, become more affordable with a strong currency, widening the deficit and ultimately dragging down gross domestic product.\n\n\n\nAlthough the dollar appears to be far from weakening, export activity is expected to pick up slightly in the second quarter, especially as America's West Coast port strike moves further into the rearview mirror.\n\n\n\n\"A larger-than-expected reduction in the trade balance suggests at least some of the outsized volatility at the end of [the first quarter] was the result of disruptions caused by the West Coast port closures,\" Piegza wrote Wednesday. \"Trade may not be the large net drag on growth as it was across the first three months of the year, but will unlikely be a significant positive or driver of economic activity in [the second quarter].\"\n\nIMF Downgrades U.S. Economic Outlook", "article_metadata": {"zone": "slideshows", "keyword": "employment", "title": "5 Things to Know About the Economy This Week: 6/5/2015", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "U.S. News spells out the week's most notable economic news.", "title": "5 Things to Know About the Economy This Week", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/slideshows/5-things-to-know-about-the-economy-this-week-6-5-2015", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/6f/d483f2c76dc83785f5d993da9e5ad8/media:e7aed51a5d1b4dc78735fd8d0ed27e99EconomyJobs.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. News spells out the week's most notable economic news.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "5 Things to Know About the Economy This Week: 6/5/2015"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 5, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "slideshow", "keywords": "Andrew Soergel,Pulse,picks,economy,Yellen, Janet,Federal Reserve,interest rates,IMF,Bureau of Labor Statistics,Department of Labor,employment", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "U.S. News spells out the week's most notable economic news."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5822\"", "article_summary": "An income report out of the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Monday showed disposable personal income rose 0.4 percent month over month in April following a flat March.\n\"Without productivity gains, Americans' standard of living will continue to be eroded with waning support for future income growth,\" Piegza wrote in a research note Thursday.\n\"In other words, surpassing a low bar of expectations is not synonymous with an economy strong enough to withstand a rising rate environment.\"\nImports were valued at $230.8 billion, $7.8 billion lower than the month prior.\nThe unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 5.5 percent, but the civilian labor force expanded by nearly 400,000 people."}
