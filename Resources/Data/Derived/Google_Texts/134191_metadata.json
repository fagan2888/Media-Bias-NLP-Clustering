We should support the president, because that was better than inaction. The lack of action now creates chaos.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rubio's vote against military action \"turned out to be a bad decision,\" Bush said.", "description": "Rubio's vote against military action \"turned out to be a bad decision,\" Bush said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Rubio's vote against military action \"turned out to be a bad decision,\" Bush said.", "title": "Bush rips Rubio for 2013 Syria vote", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/256468-bush-rips-rubio-for-2013-syria-vote", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/rubiobush.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-09T11:13:33-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/256468-bush-rips-rubio-for-2013-syria-vote", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Rubio's vote against military action \"turned out to be a bad decision,\" Bush said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bush rips Rubio for 2013 Syria vote"}, "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-09T11:13-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/256468-bush-rips-rubio-for-2013-syria-vote", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-08T19:48-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "author": "Jesse Byrnes", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-08T19:48:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T11:13:33-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Bush rips Rubio for 2013 Syria vote"}, "article_summary": "\"I agree with Sen.
