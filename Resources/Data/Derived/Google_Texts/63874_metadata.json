Union leaders are concerned that the law\u2019s high costs will lead employers to ditch health insurance for employees or cut hours to prevent workers from achieving full-time status.\n\nA Reuters analysis of the law\u2019s impact found that employee hours are at a six-month low and Obamacare is directly responsible for the decline.\n\nBig Labor\u2019s discontent with the White House stretches beyond Obamacare.\n\nThe administration\u2019s aggressive Environmental Protection Agency regulations have drawn fierce opposition from labor groups that represent energy workers. The United Mine Workers (UMW) blasted Obama in June for his anti-coal climate plan. UMW president Cecil E. Roberts said that the president catered to environmentalist backers, while ignoring union concerns.\n\n\u201cIt was disappointing that, as this initiative was being developed over the past several months, no one from the White House reached out to the representatives of the workers who will face the worst of the impacts of these proposals to get our input,\u201d the union said in a release.\n\nObama\u2019s EPA has forced more than 200 coal-fired plants to shut down, according to a 2012 analysis by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE).\n\nThe ACCCE found that America has lost between 13,000 and 17,000 coal jobs due to EPA regulations. Those numbers are expected to spike in 2015 when the EPA implements new emissions rules regarding mercury and other coal byproducts.\n\nRaymond Ventrone, the head of Boilermakers Union Local 154, said Obama\u2019s emissions regulations forced a Pennsylvania coal-fire plant to shut down, despite investing $500 million in clean emission technology. He predicted that the regulations would leave 300 to 400 union members out of work.\n\n\u201cThey want to do away with coal completely,\u201d Ventrone told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cWhat it seems like the president wants to do is put it on the EPA to stop building all coal-fired power plants.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania lost an estimated 3,000 coal-related jobs in Obama\u2019s first term, tied with Ohio for the highest in the nation, according to the ACCCE.\n\nA potential airline merger is also causing headaches for the industry. Transportation workers accused the White House of waging a \u201cwar on workers\u201d after the administration blocked a prospective US Airways-American Airlines merger in August, claiming that it violated antitrust laws.\n\nThe AFL-CIO condemned the Justice Department for interfering in the deal two years after the White House approved the merger of Delta and Chicago-based United Airlines.\n\n\u201cYour actions run counter to the interests of employees at these two air carriers represented by TTD unions and are inconsistent with the DOJ\u2019s recent treatment of transactions involving airline consolidation,\u201d the union said in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nUnion groups spent more than $1.7 billion on political activities during the 2012 election\u2014the most of any interest group, according to the National Institute for Labor Relations Research.\n\nDr. Steve Allen, a labor expert with the Capital Research Center, said that reliable union support for Obama has actually hurt Big Labor\u2019s standing with the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cIf an interest group can be counted on 100 percent of the time, they don\u2019t have a strong bargaining position\u2014the same as a group that is 100 percent against you,\u201d he said.\n\nAllen said that if the Democratic Party continues to ignore union concerns, union members might ignore Big Labor\u2019s call to support the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThe unions stopped their people from engaging in a full scale revolt against Obama, but the Democratic Party, as its being reconstituted, is not a party where working-class can be comfortable\u2014there\u2019s not a cultural connection between elite groups like environmentalists and unions,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Health care reform and a flurry of Obama administration regulations have caused internal divisions within the labor movement and led one of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest supporters to publicly rebu", "title": "Labor Unions Turning on Democrats", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/labor-unions-turning-on-democrats/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ObamaAFLCIO-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health care reform and a flurry of Obama administration regulations have caused internal divisions w", "creator": "@FBillMcMorris", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ObamaAFLCIO-150x150.jpg", "title": "Labor Unions Turning on Democrats", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The implementation of Obamacare, which received major union support when it was passed in 2010, has soured relations between labor groups and the White House and splintered labor coalitions.\n\u201cPresident Obama ran on a platform that he would not tax medical plans.\nThe AFL-CIO condemned the Justice Department for interfering in the deal two years after the White House approved the merger of Delta and Chicago-based United Airlines.\nBig Labor\u2019s discontent with the White House stretches beyond Obamacare.\nThe administration\u2019s aggressive Environmental Protection Agency regulations have drawn fierce opposition from labor groups that represent energy workers."}
