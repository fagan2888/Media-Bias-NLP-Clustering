And those who\u2019ll need long-term care can expect to incur costs of $138,000, on average, estimate Melissa Favreault of the Urban Institute and Judith Dey of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nYet people age 55 to 64 with retirement savings accounts have a median balance of $104,000 in them, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security, a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C.\n\nSee the problem?\n\nAmerica\u2019s Broken Long-Term Care System\n\nSad to say, America\u2019s system for financing long-term care is badly broken. If we take a few ideas from Japan, though, we could help avoid a long-term care catastrophe.\n\nMoreHow Government Could Cut Long-Term Care Costs\n\nA 1994 survey said one in two family caregivers in Japan had abusively treated their frail older relatives.\n\nJapan has the highest proportion of people 65+ in the world. And 20 years ago, its long-term care approach looked much like the current failed U.S. system. But Japan took a few key initiatives in 2000 that are widely admired among long-term care policy experts.\n\nBefore I explain what they did, first let me offer a brief look at the U.S. situation.\n\nLong-Term Care Financing in the U.S.\n\nAmerica\u2019s private long-term care insurance market is contracting and its policies are expensive. Only about a dozen companies now sell coverage, compared with about 100 more than a decade ago, according to Marc Cohen, chief research and development officer at LifePlans, a firm that helps health- and long-term care insurers manage risk.\n\nTom McInerney, chief executive officer at Genworth, the nation\u2019s largest long-term care insurer, estimates that between half and two-thirds of Americans can\u2019t afford to buy in the traditional long-term care insurance market. A 60-year-old married couple would pay $3,930 per year, on average, for a typical long-term care policy (daily benefit of $150-a-day for three years and inflation protection), according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance.\n\nMoreWhy People Don\u2019t Buy Long-Term Care Insurance\n\nMedicaid, the joint federal and state safety net, is the main public program for meeting long-term care expenses. But it\u2019s geared toward the poor. And Medicare offers little help with long-term care expenses. So families provide the bulk of care at home.\n\nWhat Happened in Japan\n\nIn Japan, policymakers traditionally expected the country\u2019s younger generation to respectfully care for their aging parents in multi-generational households. Public long-term care programs were mostly restricted to low-income elders without family support.\n\nAs the 21st century was approaching, however, Japan\u2019s family-centered approach foundered, due to demographic and economic changes. Daughters and daughters-in-law \u2014 the primary caregivers \u2014 grew overwhelmed by the task, especially with the trend toward fewer children and more women joining the workforce.\n\nThe emotional and financial stress of taking care of frail older people in homes took a steep toll and might surprise you based on the way you think the Japanese treat their elders. A 1994 survey said one in two family caregivers in Japan had abusively treated their frail older relatives; one in three reported feelings of \u201chatred.\u201d Elders were shunted into hospitals (called \u201csocial hospitalization\u201d) since Japan offered free hospital care to frail elderly \u2014 an expensive government policy.\n\nPublic pressure propelled reform and Japan came up with a public, mandatory long-term care insurance system in 2000. The universal elder program is funded half by general tax revenues and half by a combination of payroll taxes and additional insurance premiums paid by everyone 40+. The family remains the key source of caregiving, but the system supports the adult children with subsidized services whose fees and co-pays are relatively moderate. Among the most popular services: adult day care, home help, respite care and visiting nurses.\n\nThe emphasis is on home and community-based services. Families choose the services and providers they want, introducing a measure of competition into the market.\n\nMajor Japanese employers are also starting to help families manage caregiving duties and ease their burden. The clothes retailer Uniqlo has begun experimenting with a four-day, 10-hours-per-day workweek in Japan, for instance.\n\nThe Prospects for Americans\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Japan is hardly long-term care nirvana. For instance, the new system\u2019s expenses have been higher than anticipated, which has led to various control measures aimed at reining in costs.\n\nStill, it supports Japanese caregivers, especially in the home and in the community, something many American families caring for aging parents would love to see here.\n\n\u201cEvery major developed country in the world has adopted some measure of long-term care social insurance,\u201d says Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C. \u201cExcept the U.S., and maybe Britain.\u201d (Britain has passed, but not implemented, a public universal catastrophic long-term care policy.)\n\nUnfortunately, these days, U.S. policymakers won\u2019t come close to discussing, let alone adopting, a comprehensive Japanese-type system. The term \u201cmandatory\u201d is toxic on Capitol Hill following the partisan fights over the Affordable Care Act. So far, the many candidates running for the White House aren\u2019t saying much on the topic either. Even the official bipartisan Commission on Long-Term Care of 2013 couldn\u2019t reach agreement on what to do to address Americans\u2019 growing long-term care expenses.\n\nThere may be some hope in the future, however.\n\nBeneath the political radar, experts at places like the Urban Institute, the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Long-Term Care Financing Collaborative have been working on some ideas. They\u2019re drawn from the ranks of health care providers, the insurance industry, the government and elder care organizations. And they\u2019re well aware of what has worked in Japan and other countries.\n\nThey\u2019re asking questions such as:\n\nCould Medicaid be redesigned to support a greater number of older, disabled adults?\n\nWhat about more public/private partnerships? Could the federal government backstop the private long-term care industry and reduce its risks enough to encourage firms to get back into the market and offer consumers affordable policies?\n\nWhat would it take to integrate Medicare into long-term care?\n\nCould local regulations be changed to break down barriers to new forms of community \u2014 such as zoning laws that limit the number of unrelated people who may share a home?\n\nYou can find a good summary of these and other ideas at the website of the Long-Term Care Financing Collaborative.\n\nWith a bit of political will, imagination and, yes, money, it isn\u2019t difficult to think that we\u2019ll stumble toward ways of better supporting long-term caregivers through a mix of broader public coverage, a healthier private insurance market and an improved safety net for low-income elders.\n\nMaybe the result won\u2019t be as ambitious as in Japan. But it would be an improvement and welcome relief for families.\n\nWinston Churchill famously quipped: \u201cYou can always count on Americans to do the right thing \u2014 after they\u2019ve tried everything else.\u201d\n\nWonder if he was thinking of long-term care?\n\n\u00a9 Twin Cities Public Television - 2016.
