It’s a girl!

Congressman Jared Polis and his partner Marlon Reis announced Friday morning a baby girl has joined their family.

“I am delighted that our nation’s birthday is also Cora’s. This will be my first Fourth of July in years that I won’t be out flipping pancakes in Superior or marching in a parade in Fort Collins. I think I’m going to miss the fireworks for the first time in my life, but my first daughter is far more thrilling,” Polis said in a statement.

The couple already has a son, Caspian Julius, who is 2½ years old and is nicknamed “CJ.”

As with CJ’s birth, Polis is revealing few details, saying the birth would remain a private family matter.

Polis, a Boulder Democrat, was first elected to Congress in 2008. He has been in the news plenty lately because of his support for proposed measures on the November ballot that would restrict fracking and oil-and-gas regulations.
