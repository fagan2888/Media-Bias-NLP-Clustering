Hoping to ignite progressive voters and to differentiate himself from the two leading democratic candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, O\u2019Malley is emphasizing marijuana law reform as a key plank of his campaign.\n\nO\u2019Malley met in Denver with leading marijuana law reform activists, and cannabis industry leaders, acknowledging, \u201cIf you talk to young Americans under 30 there is a growing consensus that marijuana should be treated more akin to alcohol than to other substances.\u201d He pledged, if elected President, to use his executive authority to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.\n\n\u201cWhile O\u2019Malley\u2019s pledge is a step in the right direction, NORML believes in descheduling cannabis, not rescheduling cannabis. Cocaine, for instance, is a Schedule II controlled substance under federal law, as is methamphetamine. NORML is not of the belief that an ideal public policy is to cease treating marijuana like heroin (Schedule I) but rather to treat it like cocaine (Schedule II).\u201d As NORML\u2019s Deputy Director Paul Armentano recently told the Associated Press, \u201cRather, we would prefer to see cannabis classified and regulated in a manner that more closely resembles alcohol or tobacco, neither substance of which is classified in any category under the CSA.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s announcement yesterday came on the heels of recent, marijuana-specific comments by Clinton and Sanders.\n\nOn Monday, at a campaign stop in Luther College, Clinton responded to a question on whether or not she would support marijuana legalization as President. She answered, \u201cI would support states and localities that are experimenting with this.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Little Village, a public affairs program on PATV in Iowa City, Sanders also pledged non-governmental interference in state marijuana laws, commenting, \u201cWhat the federal government can do is say to the state of Colorado that if you choose to vote to legalize marijuana, we will allow you to do that without restrictions.\u201d\n\nSanders also pledged to amend federal banking laws to permit state-licensed business to operate like any other legal entity, \u201cIn Colorado people who run marijuana shops can\u2019t put their money in banks,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a violation of federal law. So I think there are things that the federal government can do that would make it easier for states that want to go in that direction to be able to do so.\u201d In addition, he reiterated his position in favor of medical marijuana and decriminalization, a policy he supported in his home state of Vermont.\n\nHowever, when asked about full legalization, Sanders continues to be noncommittal, responding, \u201cWe\u2019re exploring the pluses and minuses \u2014 of which there are both \u2014 of moving more aggressively on that issue. It is a very important issue. We\u2019re watching what Colorado is doing, and we\u2019ll have more to say about that in the coming weeks and months.\u201d\n\nThe comments made by all three Democratic candidates for president, coupled with the marijuana related question aimed at the Republican candidates in the most recent Republican primary debate, highlight the new, elevated role marijuana law reform is playing in the election of our next President of the United States. In previous years, candidates\u2019 largely ignored or belittled the issue. But this election that won\u2019t suffice. Voters are demanding clear answers from candidates on what the federal government should do in relation to marijuana policy and they are demanding a change from business as usual.\n\nSource: NORML - make a donation", "article_metadata": {"description": "The comments made by all three Democratic candidates for president, coupled with the marijuana related question aimed at the Republican candidates in the most recent Republican primary debate, highlight the new, elevated role marijuana law reform is playing in the election of our next President of the United States.", "generator": "TWB", "og": {"site_name": "The Weed Blog | Marijuana News And Information", "description": "By Danielle Keane, NORML Political Director Former Maryland Governor and current democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley yesterday held a marijuana legalization listening session in Denver, Colorado.
