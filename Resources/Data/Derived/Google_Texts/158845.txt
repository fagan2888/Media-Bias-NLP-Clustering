Major demolition is underway in Journal Square, where several buildings, including two large, five-story, brick buildings are being devoured by demolition machines to make way for a $666 million residential towers project.

The buildings being leveled will transform Pavonia Avenueâ€™s south side from Summit Avenue to McLaughlin Funeral Home into a swath of empty lots.

Traffic continues to flow in both directions on Pavonia and only the sidewalk on the south side of the street has been closed to pedestrian traffic.

Yesterday afternoon buses and cars were passing some 15 feet from the five-story buildings that were partially torn down. Traffic was flowing freely in both directions on Summit Avenue.

The project calls for 54-story tower with 540 units, a 70-story tower with 700 units and a 60-story tower with 600 units. The developer is KRE Group, headed by Murray Kushner. Construction of the first tower is to take three years to complete. The final tower is expected to be complete in 2029.

The project received a 30-year tax break, as well as $10 million in bonds floated by a city agency, thanks to nearly unanimous votes by the City Council. Officials say the project, which will include ground-floor retail space, will bring an economic jolt to Journal Square.

The demolition work will continue today and will include the destruction of the largest building to come down. It was formerly the home to a phone company.
