And even in these days of Obamacare, finding good health insurance can be a challenge for them.\n\nSo the San Francisco health insurance marketplace Stride Health has announced a new partnership with the on-demand delivery service Postmates to help Postmates couriers quickly find affordable health insurance.\n\n\u201cOur recommendation engine is built from the ground up for freelancers,\u201d Stride Health CEO Noah Lang said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mobile-first web app that swiftly guides you to the intelligent coverage investment best suited to your life.\u201d\n\nLang said Stride instantly predicts the insurance buyer\u2019s total spend on health care for the next year, and matches plans with the buyer\u2019s existing doctors. \u201cWe can get you covered in 10 minutes or less,\u201d Lang said. Sixty percent of Stride Health\u2019s sign-ups now happen on mobile devices, he adds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stitched into the Postmates daily experience so they can log on to get covered on the go, or revisit Stride for guidance on using their plan at their doctor\u2019s office, at the pharmacy, or even in an emergency,\u201d Lang said.\n\nStride has already launched similar programs with TaskRabbit and Uber. Uber drivers, for instance, can go right to the Stride recommendation engine from their Uber driver app to buy insurance.\n\nStride says it\u2019s also launching a referral program in which it will reimburse the insurance premiums of Stride members who refer friends to the service. Lang told me his company will pay for a month of insurance coverage for members who refer three new members, or for a whole year of coverage for those who refer 10 new customers.\n\nWhen people buy health insurance through Stride Health, they input information through a web interface and the system quickly builds a health profile for them. Once it has the information it needs, an algorithm forecasts their health costs for the next year. The service finds the best plan for the buyer, and gives them advice throughout the year on the best way to use the benefits.\n\nStride acts as a reseller of health plans from many carriers and earns a commission when it sells a plan. Stride can also match users with appropriate government benefits.\n\n\u201cDespite the Affordable Care Act\u2019s improvements to the freelance economy, finding affordable health insurance is still incredibly difficult,\u201d Lang says. \u201cEven worse, it\u2019s hard to pick a plan effectively; a recent Stride study found that 40 percent of Americans likely pay for too much coverage.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cThis is why our partnerships with Postmates, Uber, and TaskRabbit are so important; We empower freelancers with smart investments and enable them to pursue more independent careers without risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWIth 60 million independent contractors in the workforce by 2020, it\u2019s a need that can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d\n\nStride Heath was announced as part of Rock Health\u2019s sixth class of startups in May 2014.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2015-02-04T08:50:44+00:00", "author": "mark-sullivan", "modDate": "2015-02-04T08:50:44+00:00", "keywords": "health-insurance,health-insurance-marketplaces,rock-health,stride-health", "type": "news", "id": 1655219}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Stride already provides insurance-buying websites for Uber and TaskRabbit.", "title": "Stride Health extends freelancer health insurance program to Postmates\u00a0couriers", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2015/02/04/stride-health-extends-freelancer-health-insurance-program-to-postmates-couriers/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Noahlang.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Stride already provides insurance-buying websites for Uber and\u00a0TaskRabbit.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebb4\"", "article_summary": "So the San Francisco health insurance marketplace Stride Health has announced a new partnership with the on-demand delivery service Postmates to help Postmates couriers quickly find affordable health insurance.\nWhen people buy health insurance through Stride Health, they input information through a web interface and the system quickly builds a health profile for them.\nAnd even in these days of Obamacare, finding good health insurance can be a challenge for them.\n\u201cOur recommendation engine is built from the ground up for freelancers,\u201d Stride Health CEO Noah Lang said.\n\u201cDespite the Affordable Care Act\u2019s improvements to the freelance economy, finding affordable health insurance is still incredibly difficult,\u201d Lang says."}
