And its leader says she's not getting enough help from the health care industry.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some of these organizations have so redacted documents \u2014 even after being subpoenaed \u2014 that it is impossible for us to get the complete picture of what is actually going on,\u201d Chair Marsha Blackburn said after the panel issued eight more subpoenas this week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Critics say the panel is intimidating, not investigating. The Association of Academic Medical Colleges says it's worried \u2014 especially because the House's latest subpoenas may involve names of graduate students, administrative and support staff and other people who may not have much or anything to do with the work.\n\n\"[The] panel has provided neither compelling reasons for the need to collect this information, nor any assurances that it would be adequately safeguarded,\" the association writes in a letter to Blackburn and the panel's ranking member, Rep. Jan Schakowsky. \"AAMC-member medical schools and teaching hospitals remain very concerned for the safety of their scientists, physicians, staff, students, and patients, particularly in light of the heated debate surrounding the issue of fetal tissue research.\"\n\nSee the letter: http://bit.ly/1UXhzi8\n\n\u2014 Why researchers are so concerned. Being publicly linked to fetal tissue studies puts people at risk of personal attacks, such as being compared to Nazis \u2014 or worse.\n\n\"This really isn\u2019t about science,\u201d Edward Halperin, chancellor and CEO of New York Medical College, told POLITICO's Brett Norman last year. \u201cThis is really people making a point about abortion and it's outrageous.\u201d Read the story: http://politi.co/235T9oi\n\nMEDICARE BUNDLED PAYMENT PROGRAM STARTS TODAY \u2014 It\u2019s unclear how many providers are ready for the move, as Pro Health Care\u2019s Erin Mershon points out, but there\u2019s little doubt it will test the abilities of hospitals, doctors and rehab centers to share patient information and coordinate care. Medicare\u2019s Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement program hopes to save about $153 million, or 1.2 percent of the $12.3 billion the agency is expected to spend on knee and hip replacements over the next five years.

A prank. There's no \"Mission to Mars\" initiative \u2026 and thankfully the editors let me have this measly pun. Send groans and tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nWHAT CMS FOUND OUT ABOUT THERANOS \u2014 The agency's inspection report \u2014 which the Wall Street Journal obtained in full \u2014 found that quality-control checks on Theranos' blood-testing devices routinely failed the company's own standards. For instance, 29 percent of quality-control checks failed in October 2014, and 24 percent failed in February 2015.\n\nMore bad news: Theranos also employed unqualified personnel and failed to follow proper quality-control procedures, CMS concluded. And many patient test results were inaccurate.\n\n\"This is the first time that we\u2019ve actually seen data from the Theranos instrument, and it\u2019s as bad as one would have worried it would be,\u201d Weill Cornell Medical College pathologist Stephen Master told the Journal. \u201cBased on this data, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that they went live with this instrument and tested patient specimens on it.\" http://on.wsj.com/1UXFj5Z\n\nICYMI: ONLY ONE-THIRD OF HEALTHCARE.GOV ENROLLEES KEPT THEIR PLAN \u2014 That's according to a new analysis of 2016 enrollment from Avalere Health, which notes that it's the second straight year in which only one-third of exchange customers kept their plan.\n\nThere are different ways to think about this: Two-thirds of exchange customers every year are likely to shop around. That puts pressure on insurers to offer competitively priced premiums, but also complicates efforts for ongoing chronic care management.\n\nWHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT OPIOIDS YESTERDAY \u2014 POLITICO Pro's Health Care Briefing on the U.S. opioid epidemic focused on the culture of prescribing \u2014 specifically how doctors approach pain treatment \u2014 and moderator Joanne Kenen summarized some of the key takeaways from the panel of experts:\n\n\u00b7 The opioid conversation is focused on chronic misuse \u2014 but the problem really begins with the first prescription\n\n\u00b7 Physicians don't want strict limits on what they can and can't prescribe\n\n\u00b7 Payers are willing to partner with physicians to help change how they practice\n\n\u00b7 Prescription drug monitoring databases can play a key role in helping disseminate information, but the databases need improvement\n\n\u00b7 The national interest in opioids has changed rapidly \u2014 much faster than the experts expected\n\nWatch an archived video of the briefing: http://politi.co/1UvYLGR\n\nSee the working group report: http://politi.co/1VTlBaWw\n\nCDC SAYS PEDIATRIC AUTISM LEVEL IS HIGH \u2014 BUT IT ISN'T GETTING HIGHER \u2014 That's according to a CDC report published yesterday in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Surveillance Summary. The report shows that about 1 in 68 school-aged children have been identified with autism spectrum disorder, which is essentially no change in ASD prevalence from the previous report released in 2014. See the report: http://1.usa.gov/1ZOIBI4\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

(That number has gone up by about 400,000 jobs in the past 11 months.) Registered nurses alone accounted for more than 2.7 million jobs last year. http://1.usa.gov/1UG4w58\n\nMean hourly wages\n\n\u00b7 Surgeon: $119.00\n\n\u00b7 Family and general practitioners: $92.36\n\n\u00b7 Registered nurse: $34.14\n\n\u00b7 Home health aide: $11.00\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE LOOKS LIKELY TO KEEP MEDICAID EXPANSION \u2014 The state Senate yesterday voted to continue Medicaid expansion through 2018, easily overcoming opposition from Republicans in the upper chamber, Pro's Rachana Pradhan reports. The bill, which passed on a 16-8 vote, now goes to Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, who made reauthorization a major priority this year.\n\n\u2014 But what happens after that? New Hampshire is seeking a waiver to continue the program beyond this year, and part of the state's request is for a work requirement - something the Obama administration has never approved - and copays if enrollees visit the emergency room for non-emergency purposes. However, the legislation includes a clause to ensure that the program won't end if CMS rejects a work requirement, a provision that some Republicans criticized heavily.\n\nMEDICAL MILESTONE: JOHNS HOPKINS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSPLANTS ORGANS BETWEEN HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS \u2014 Surgeons at the Baltimore health system yesterday performed the nation's first liver and kidney transplants between an HIV-positive donor and recipients. The groundbreaking surgery is expected to help expand the pool of potential organ donors and speed transplants to HIV-positive patients. http://bsun.md/1pOTtck\n\nTHE STORY OF THE WEEK \u2026 is Bloomberg's deep dive into whether Johnson & Johnson hid evidence that using its baby powder is a cancer risk: http://bloom.bg/1UXsqZt\n\nTHE PODCAST OF THE WEEK \u2026 is Slate's Amicus podcast on Zubik v. Burwell, where host Dahlia Lithwick spends 30 minutes breaking down the case with special guest Paul Clement \u2014 who was fresh off arguing on behalf of the plaintiff \u2014 and Walter Dellinger, acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration. It's very much worth a listen: http://slate.me/1VcMyG0\n\n\u2014 Dellinger was unimpressed with the Supreme Court's performance. \"What came clear to me at the argument is that they did not understand women\u2019s reproductive health,\" Dellinger said. \"They did not understand Obamacare. They did not understand how health insurance works. And I\u2019m not sure which of those was worse.\"\n\nON TAP TODAY \u2014 CDC hosts its one-day Zika Action Plan Summit to discuss how local, state, federal, and non-government officials can coordinate a response to Zika. \u2026 The Center for Medicare Advocacy hosts the 2016 National Voices of Medicare Summit and Senator Jay Rockefeller Lecture at the Kaiser Family Foundation Building. \u2026 Universities Allied for Essential Medicines will hold a rally outside of PhRMA's office\n\nON TAP NEXT WEEK \u2014 The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget on Monday morning holds its 2016 Mortimer Caplin Conference on fiscal issues facing the next president. The Senate HELP Committee on Tuesday will convene to mark up five pieces of legislation related to research and medicine.\n\nHOW TWO HEDGE FUND 'QUANTS' WERE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE HEART DISEASE \u2014 They built an algorithm that's proved as effective as a cardiologist when analyzing MRI images of the heart. http://on.ft.com/1Y2QOqO\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nJonathan Cohn details how big pharma is making big dollars off the business of sleep: http://huff.to/1M4WVKs\n\nOnly one country offers health care to migrants, regardless of their immigration status: Thailand. http://n.pr/1RBb4Mo\n\nThe Blue Cross Blue Shield report that got a lot of ink this week wasn't especially shocking, Margot Sanger-Katz writes: Of course enrollees under the ACA exchanges were sicker and more expensive than their counterparts: http://nyti.ms/1ZPmEIZ\n\nThe Advisory Board's Rob Lazerow explains how hospitals have prepared for today's launch of mandatory bundled payments: http://bit.ly/1RB9OZw\n\nMore on the shocking allegations that the CEO of a for-profit hospice company was telling nurses to kill patients: http://thebea.st/1M51Lra\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
