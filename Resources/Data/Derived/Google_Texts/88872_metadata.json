Angeline was the youngest rider in the competition.\n\n\u201cI like how you bond with a horse and how you\u2019re like one with a horse,\u201d the youngster said of her love for riding horses.\n\nAngeline began taking English riding lessons about three years ago with a trainer near Virginia Beach, Va., where her father, Jose (Tony) Saliceti, was stationed with the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n\u201cI first rode One-Eyed Jack and did hunter jumper riding,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t competing then.\u201d\n\nAbout 1 1/2 years ago, her father was transferred to the Coast Guard office in Topeka. Angeline was hoping to find an instructor who offered English riding lessons. When that didn\u2019t pan out, she starting taking western riding lessons from Cindy Branham, a certified horse trainer and clinician, at the Rockin\u2019 RC in southeast Topeka.\n\nKristina Saliceti, Angeline\u2019s mother, said she saw a Bureau of Land Management flier advertising a wild mustang and burro adoption event in the summer of 2012 in Lawrence and decided to take her children to see the wild horses.\n\nThe mustangs are halter- or saddle-trained by inmates at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility. Branham, a longtime volunteer with the program, helps with the horses\u2019 gentling process.\n\n\u201cThe girls were enamored with a horse named Andy,\u201d Saliceti said, describing how she and Branham later drove to the Hutchinson Correctional Facility so she could adopt Andy and bring him home. However, once home, Andy bonded most with her husband.\n\n\u201cCindy told us later about another horse in Hutchinson,\u201d she said.\n\nSo Saliceti made another drive to Hutchinson to look at a mustang pony named Samson. She was told the horse had been adopted previously but had been returned to the facility when the new owners couldn\u2019t ride him. Still, Saliceti and Branham thought Samson would be a good match for Angeline.\n\n\u201cSamson is nice, friendly and sweet,\u201d Angeline said, adding the mustang also has a mischievous streak. \u201cWhen we ride, he\u2019ll take a chance to gallop off with you.\u201d\n\nSamson and Angeline quickly bonded and began training with Branham, earning enough points to qualify for the world championship in late November. During the competition, they had to maneuver through an obstacle course and were judged on speed, horsemanship and technique.\n\nAngeline said she and Samson continue to work on their competition skills, such as riding with a large, brightly colored flag.\n\n\u201cSamson really trusts her, so he may not like (what he is doing), but he knows she won\u2019t put him in a bad situation,\u201d Saliceti said. \u201cHe\u2019ll go over bridges and do jumps with her.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Angeline, four other riders from the Topeka area qualified for the Extreme Cowboy Association\u2019s world championship. Madison Branham placed 10th in the Young Guns division; Justin Branham and Alaina Rohnke competed in the youth division for ages 12-18 but didn\u2019t make it into the finals. Branham competed in the professional division.\n\nBranham said she is working on establishing a Bureau of Land Management wild mustang and burro adoption program similar to the one at the Hutchinson Correction Facility at the Topeka Correctional Facility for women.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local, Jan Biles", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "A 7-year-old Topeka girl and a mustang once considered difficult to ride are turning heads in the world of competitive riding and horsemanship.", "title": "Topeka girl's training pays off at horse riding competition", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/local/2014-01-11/topeka-girls-training-pays-horse-riding-competition", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/12970650.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "A 7-year-old Topeka girl and a mustang once considered difficult to ride are turning heads in the world of competitive riding and horsemanship.Angeline Saliceti, a student at North Fairview Elementary in Seaman Unified School District 345, recently placed sixth in the Young Guns division for ages 7-11 at the Extreme Cowboy Association\u2019s world championships in Hamilton, Texas.
