Pixabay Public Domain\n\nThe world\u2019s two largest beer manufacturers have agreed in principle to merge, and the move may have a huge impact on the world\u2019s health.\n\nAccording to global health experts, the merge \u201crepresents a major threat to global health, to which researchers, funders and regulators must respond more effectively.\u201d\n\nIt was announced last month that Belgian-based Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) and London-based SABMiller have agreed to merge at around $106 billion, making this the third largest deal in corporate history. Completion of the deal relies on the navigation of regulatory demands and competition policy through multiple jurisdictions. The new company will produce about one-third of all beer sold worldwide, explained Professor Jeff Collin and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nA Global Impact On Health\n\nThe part of the deal with potentially significant impacts for global health is that the merger is driven by prospects for expansion in developing countries. There is an emphasis on Africa in particular as \u201ca critical driver of growth for the combined company.\u201d\n\nExperts say that the growth anticipated by the company would be based on exploiting Africa\u2019s currently low per capita beer consumption and would target low income areas to drive up sales. This trajectory echoes the plans of transnational tobacco companies, which researchers say share considerable strategic similarities with the alcohol industry. Tobacco and alcohol have comparable health effects, but alcohol manages to slide by without the \u201cpariah status\u201d of tobacco.\n\nThere have been global efforts to control transnational tobacco companies, but the alcohol industry, according to the authors, \u201ccontinues to occupy ambiguous space in which an indirect acknowledgement of serious health effects coexists with the prospect of partnerships and shared objectives.\u201d\n\nOne example of this is the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) \u201cemerging framework for engagement with non-state actors\u2026precludes partnership with the tobacco and arms industries but makes no specific reference to alcohol.\u201d\n\nThe research team believes that an opportunity to respond to this threat lies with new sustainable development goals. They urge public health actors to \u201cdo more to ensure that conflict of interest with alcohol companies is recognized and addressed.\u201d\n\nSource: Collin J, Hill S, Smith K.
