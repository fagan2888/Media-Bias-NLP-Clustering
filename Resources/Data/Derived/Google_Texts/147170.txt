A Centreville, Maryland, man is accused of entering a University of Maryland dorm room and inappropriately touching a woman, according to the University of Maryland Police Department.

Colby Dean, 21, was arrested and charged with a fourth-degree sex offense, second-degree assault, first-degree burglar and two counts of fourth-degree burglary. All charges stem from an incident that occurred in Anne Arundel Hall, a campus resident hall, early Friday morning.

Police said Dean was granted access to the dorm by residents of the building. He allegedly went to the fourth floor and entered three rooms where the doors were closed but not locked.

Investigators said in one of the rooms, a female resident reported that while she was sleeping, she woke up to a hand touching her body inappropriately. The resident yelled, and the suspect left the room.

Police were able to identify Dean as the suspect and arrested him on Friday.
