We're gonna see more and more of this.\u201d\n\nBarr has heard anecdotally that Midstate employers are trimming workers or trimming their hours as fallout of the ACA.\n\n\u201cGovernment has decided that you as a business will pay this if you meet a certain size,\u201d Barr explained. \u201cThey've put these conditions on and of course companies will have to work around and with those conditions in order to make sure they can stay as a successful business. Businesses have to take the steps they can to keep themselves profitable and keep the people that are now employed employed.\u201d\n\nBarr's explanation sounds perfectly reasonable and capitalistic. But John Hanger, Democratic candidate for governor, isn't buying it \u2013 especially in the case of Hollywood Casino.\n\n\u201cThe least they can do with all the money they make because of a state casino license is give health insurance to their good workers,\u201d Hanger said. \u201cIt's a terrible message that they're sending to Pennsylvanians and I'm insulted by that.\u201d\n\nHanger, who's wife is a physician, said he wholeheartedly supports health insurance for all.\n\n\u201cWe do need everybody in society to try to put the good of Pennsylvania, and the good of the country first and stop being so darn selfish about every last penny,\u201d he said.\n\nBut shareholders demand penny pinching. So do taxpayers.\n\nExperts say this very issue is coming to a school district near you. Schools have many part-time bus drivers and cafeteria workers who don't get health insurance.\n\n\u201cSchool districts are wrestling with what to do with this situation,\u201d said attorney Eric Athey of the Harrisburg firm McNees, Wallace and Nurick. \u201cAre they going to somewhere find the funds to offer coverage? Are they going to reduce hours? Or are they going to outsource these services?\n\nPart-time employees who don't get insurance from their employers are required, under the ACA, to purchase it for themselves or face a $95 penalty the first year. That mandate begins January 1, but as Hollywood Casino shows, the effects are already being felt.\n\n\u201cObamacare has been a drag on hiring in this commonwealth and this nation,\u201d Barr said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lots of employers are focusing on 30 as the nation inches closer to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=394896224", "og": {"site_name": "ABC27", "description": "Lots of employers are focusing on 30 as the nation inches closer to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Employers keep workers under 30 hours to avoid Obamacare penalty", "url": "http://abc27.com/2013/09/20/employers-keep-workers-under-30-hours-to-avoid-obamacare-penalty/", "image": {"width": 320, "identifier": "https://mgtvwhtm.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/23489491_bg1.jpg", "height": 240}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "ABC27.com", "description": "Lots of employers are focusing on 30 as the nation inches closer to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Employers keep workers under 30 hours to avoid Obamacare penalty", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwhtm.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/23489491_bg1.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@abc27News", "site": "abc27news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, weather, traffic and sports for Harrisburg, Pa.
