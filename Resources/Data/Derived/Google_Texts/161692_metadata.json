Kunjo Tashi, president of the Tibetan Association of Northern California, told the local ABC affiliate that the Chinese flag \u201crepresents blood, blood of the Tibetans, Uighurs and the Chinese people who\u2019ve been killed and massacred by the Chinese government.\u201d\n\n\u201cSan Leandro does not fly the flags of other nations at our City Hall,\u201d Mayor Stephen Cassidy said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe need to call a \u2018time out\u2019 and allow the community to weigh in on whether or not we should raise the flags of other governments.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, ABC affiliate KGO-TV reported that the Chinese flag flies over some areas of San Francisco on a regular basis and that San Francisco has raised the flag on Oct. 1, as have Oakland and Alameda.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "At the request of a Chinese-American councilman, the San Leandro, Calif., City Council voted 4-3 Monday to fly the flag of the People\u2019s Republic of China over City Hall on Oct. 1.
