That\u2019s an all-time high mark since the group launched the annual report seven years ago.\n\nBut against the backdrop of brimming post-recession optimism, the worker shortage looming for years is beginning to sting as baby boomers retire and the pipeline of new workers undershoots demand.\n\nThe shortage is the clearest barometer for the sector\u2019s future prospects, kneecapping the industry even as it continues to pick up steam post-recession, Enterprise Minnesota President and CEO Bob Kill said in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt would be growing faster if we had the workforce,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOne-third of the 400 Minnesota-based manufacturing executives surveyed identified attracting and retaining qualified workers as a \u201cserious concern.\u201d Seventy-one percent said it is \u201cdifficult\u201d to attract new workers \u2014 the highest rate since the survey started, marking an especially steep uptick over the past half-decade.\n\nA plurality of the executives surveyed said they need workers with technical training and experience. Machine operators and assemblers are in the highest demand, according to the report.\n\nThe trend, overall, is nothing new. But in one notable deviation, the issue is becoming more pressing for manufacturers in the seven-county metro area. This year, for the first time, 70 percent of Twin Cities executives surveyed expressed concerns, bridging the gap with their outstate counterparts who have hovered around that mark for years.\n\nBy extension, the marketplace for manufacturing workers \u2013 particularly ones with deep industry experience \u2013 is sizzling, and increasingly cutthroat. Wages are going up, according to the survey, and employees are reluctant to leave their posts unless a new job is an obvious upgrade.\n\n\u201cLuring a really experienced person from one firm to another is becoming really difficult and very costly,\u201d Kill said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a shift there, and I think that\u2019s just the reality of trying to recruit and find enough workers.\u201d\n\nTo plug those personnel holes, more companies than ever have cozied up to partnerships with state agencies, and especially schools, to flesh out the pool of available workers and provide training to expanding existing employees\u2019 skill sets.\n\nThere are tens of millions of dollars from federal grants and state institutions to support those programs, said Joe Mulford, system director for education industry partnerships for the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system \u2013 a primary player in the manufacturing education landscape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about filling the pipeline and \u2018upskilling\u2019 those incumbent workers that you\u2019ve got,\u201d he told manufacturing executives at an Enterprise Minnesota event on Wednesday evening.\n\nSuch efforts have picked up steam over the last half-decade or so, the survey showed, in tandem with a slow-but-steady push to reshape the industry\u2019s reputation to draw in young people and convince their parents that manufacturing isn\u2019t what it used to be.\n\nNow, the sector is approaching a tipping point in its push to make that case, Kill said, primarily by touting today\u2019s advanced manufacturing jobs as well-paying upgrades over the kind of gritty work that dominated the sector, and shaped its reputation, decades ago.\n\nStill, just 36 percent of manufacturing executives reported that their companies had collaborative relationships with a higher education institution. But increasingly, Kill said, school-sponsored job-training initiatives yield visible gains for employers and communities.\n\nEarlier this week, St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis singled out a pair of local higher education institutions \u2013 St. Cloud Technical & Community College and St. Cloud State University \u2013 as reasons Arctic Cat announced an expansion to its manufacturing plant there.\n\nLarger companies like Plymouth-based Arctic Cat, classified in the survey as ones that generate $5 million or more in annual revenue, are significantly more likely to cash in on partnerships and other higher education programming.\n\nThose companies are also the ones facing the greatest retirement drain, according to the survey.\n\nBut workforce isn\u2019t the only thing on executives\u2019 minds.\n\nHealth insurance costs remain a top concern among 56 percent of them, though that\u2019s a sharp drop from the 71 percent that flagged the issue in 2011, before the federal Affordable Care Act passed.\n\nIn addition, the survey showed worries about ambiguous government rules and oversight was the second-most prominent concern, pinpointed by 46 percent of survey takers. But that\u2019s also down from previous years \u2013 similar worries plagued 55 percent of manufacturing executives last year and 58 percent the year before that.\n\nStill, employee retention is the standout issue \u2013 and will be for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cAttracting and retaining qualified workers is the elephant in the room that\u2019s going to be with us,\u201d Kill said. \u201cThat\u2019s the topic du jour for companies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Against the backdrop of brimming post-recession optimism, the worker shortage looming for years is beginning to sting as baby boomers retire and the pipeline of new workers undershoots demand.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Karlee Weinmann", "og": {"site_name": "Finance & Commerce", "description": "Against the backdrop of brimming post-recession optimism, the worker shortage looming for years is beginning to sting as baby boomers retire and the pipeline of new workers undershoots demand.", "title": "Workers in short supply as manufacturers try to grow", "url": "http://finance-commerce.com/2015/05/workers-in-short-supply-as-manufacturers-try-to-grow/", "image": "http://finance-commerce.com/files/2015/05/Dakota2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Workers in short supply as manufacturers try to growFinance & Commerce", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "keywords": "affordable care act,arctic cat,baby boomers,employment,enterprise minnesota,manufacturing,minnesota state colleges and universities,mnscu,st. cloud state university,st. cloud technical & community college,workforce", "google-site-verification": "fsxlPNyjZwLPAj0KJhrcPjWL_3CXdi71oKBTOnATRU8", "thumbnail": "http://finance-commerce.com/files/2015/05/Dakota2-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By extension, the marketplace for manufacturing workers \u2013 particularly ones with deep industry experience \u2013 is sizzling, and increasingly cutthroat.\nBut that\u2019s also down from previous years \u2013 similar worries plagued 55 percent of manufacturing executives last year and 58 percent the year before that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about filling the pipeline and \u2018upskilling\u2019 those incumbent workers that you\u2019ve got,\u201d he told manufacturing executives at an Enterprise Minnesota event on Wednesday evening.\nStill, just 36 percent of manufacturing executives reported that their companies had collaborative relationships with a higher education institution.\n\u201cAttracting and retaining qualified workers is the elephant in the room that\u2019s going to be with us,\u201d Kill said."}
