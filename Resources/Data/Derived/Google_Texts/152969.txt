Missing: Greg Hutchings, 35, and his daughter Eeva Dorendahl, 4.

The mother of a girl who went missing with her father on the far north NSW coast is distraught, police say.

A large-scale search for Greg Hutchings, 35, and his four-year-old daughter Eeva Dorendahl is now entering its third day.

The father and daughter were last seen on Pottsville Road at Pottsville about 12.30pm on Saturday.

Police say the pair were due to meet family in the area about midday but never arrived.

An extensive search of the surrounding area was conducted but nothing was found.

Police say the two do not have access to a car.

The ABC reports Eeva had been staying at her father’s house at Pottsville but was due to return home to her mother at Kin Kin on the Sunshine Coast, and they sent a text to say they were on their way.

‘‘Obviously the mother is distraught at this time and his family are also concerned, but we’re making every effort to contact anybody he knows in the area and we need the assistance of the public to help locate the father and his four-year-old daughter,’’ acting Inspector Warwick Rhodes told the ABC.

Serious concerns are held for their welfare and anyone with information is asked to come forward.

Mr Hutchings is described as being of Caucasian appearance with short brown curly hair, about 175 centimetres tall and of a thin build. He was wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, grey trousers and was carrying a black backpack when he was last seen.

Eeva is described as being of Caucasian appearance with long blonde hair, blue eyes and a thin build. She was last seen wearing an oversized blue and white shirt and multicoloured board shorts.
