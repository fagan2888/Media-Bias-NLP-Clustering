Some were aimed at each other, but many were aimed at their presumptive Democratic opponent for the White House. Here are some of the best lines of the night, from both the primetime debate on Fox News and the earlier one involving the seven candidates who didn\u2019t make the cut for the prime time stage.\n\nOn Hillary Clinton\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina: \"Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lied about emails, she is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.\"\n\nRelated: Why Marco Rubio Might Just Beat Hillary Clinton\n\nDr. Ben Carson: \u201cIf Hillary is the [Democratic] candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true\u2026.If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And that's what she's doing.\u201d\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio: \u201cI would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.\u201d\n\nOn Money in Politics\n\nDonald Trump: \u201cI will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give.\u201d\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul: \u201cHey, look, look! [Trump is] already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK? So if he doesn\u2019t run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent. But I\u2019d say that he\u2019s already hedging his bets because he\u2019s used to buying politicians.\u201d\n\nFiorina: \u201cI didn\u2019t get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race. Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Cinton? I didn\u2019t. Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the [Clinton] foundation or donated to his wife's senate campaign.\u201d\n\nOn Planned Parenthood\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee: \u201cIt\u2019s time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they\u2019re parts to a Buick.\u201d\n\nRubio: \u201cI think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave a chance to live.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stop the Presses! Donald Trump Just Took a Policy Decision on Planned Parenthood\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: \u201cPlanned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nOn the LGBT in the Military and Fighting Terrorism\n\nHuckabee: \u201cThe military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is to kill people and break things.\u201d\n\nPaul: \u201cI've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. It's a disgrace. We've got to stop \u2014 we shouldn't fund our enemies, for goodness sakes.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie responding to Paul\u2019s comments on NSA surveillance: \u201cListen, senator, you know, when you\u2019re sitting in a subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that. When you\u2019re responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure you use the system the way it\u2019s supposed to work.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s response to Christie: \u201cI don\u2019t trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.\u201d\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz: \u201cWe need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism as long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, \u2018radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham: \u201cIf you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need to have more ground troops in Iraq ... then you're not ready to be commander in chief and you're not serious.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The 10 Republicans squaring off in Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate served up plen", "title": "The Best Jabs at Hillary Clinton from the Republicans\u2019 Fox News Debates", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/07/Best-Jabs-Hillary-Clinton-Republicans-Fox-News-Debates-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09162013_Hillary_Clinton_05.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/07/Best-Jabs-Hillary-Clinton-Republicans-Fox-News-Debates-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09162013_Hillary_Clinton_05.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The 10 Republicans squaring off in Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate served up plen", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce442\"", "article_summary": "On Hillary ClintonWisconsin Gov.\nMaybe it's because I hadn't given money to the [Clinton] foundation or donated to his wife's senate campaign.\u201dOn Planned ParenthoodFormer Arkansas Gov.\nThe purpose of the military is to kill people and break things.\u201dPaul: \u201cI've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS.\nSo if he doesn\u2019t run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent.\nAnd that's what she's doing.\u201dFlorida Sen.
