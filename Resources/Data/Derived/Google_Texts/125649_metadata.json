At Cleveland Clinic, Chief Experience Officer Andrea Boissy, MD, supplements patient satisfaction scores with other information, including complaints and compliments that come through the health system\u2019s ombudsman office.\n\n\n\nBoissy and her colleagues are beginning to analyze other data, including caregiver engagement and patient safety scores, in conjunction with patient satisfaction scores. One early finding: high caregiver engagement scores correlate with high scores on some domains of patient satisfaction surveys, but not all.\n\n\n\nIntegris Health, a 16-hospital system in Oklahoma, also uses multiple data sources.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a two-prong tact \u2014 we use HCAHPS to measure satisfaction with our clinical efforts and Press Ganey to measure satisfaction with our front-end, including pre-registration and registration,\u201d says Greg Meyers, system vice president-revenue integrity. When patients use Integris\u2019 online bill-pay technology, they are asked to complete an online survey about their experience with paying their healthcare bill.\n\n\n\nMeyers encourages healthcare organizations to adopt a simple metric\u2014primarily used outside of healthcare\u2014to gauge whether they are moving in the right direction. The net predictor score uses responses to a single question: Would you recommend this to your friends and family. The number of \u201cno\u201d responses is subtracted from the number of \u201cyes\u201d responses to calculate the score.\n\n\n\nHealth systems and hospitals typically use a mixed bag of data sources to track their progress in improving patient experience.\n\n\n\nThe HCAHPS survey is required by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to assess inpatient satisfaction. Each hospital\u2019s score is posted on the Hospital Compare website and figures into CMS\u2019 calculation of the value-based purchasing modifier that determines hospital payment.\n\n\n\nThe HCAHPS survey includes 22 questions about the hospital, its staff and its reputation. Patients are asked to assess:\n\nHow often nurses treated them with courtesy and respect\n\nHow often the room and bathroom were kept clean\n\nWhether they would recommend the hospital to friends and family\n\n\n\nSurveys conducted by vendors that assess various aspects of patients\u2019 healthcare interactions. For example, a survey to collect physician ratings and comments and that are posted on the organization\u2019s website. Patients are asked to take a 20-question survey in which they use a five-point scale to rate their visit on measures such as:\n\nFriendliness/courtesy of the care provider\n\nAmount of time the care provider spent with you\n\nYour confidence in this care provider\n\nLikelihood of your recommending this care provider to others\n\nRead our feature story on patient satisfaction for more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most health care leaders consider patient satisfaction surveys to be essential \u2014 and inadequate.
