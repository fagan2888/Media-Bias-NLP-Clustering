NEDA reported a \u201cdisorder can include extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors surrounding weight and food issues.\u201d Yet, despite this, only one in 10 men and women with a disorder will receive treatment. Of those men and women, only 35 percent receive treatment at a specialized facility.\n\nThe rise of social media has aggravated the situation with studies that found Facebook use may trigger eating disorders and lead to poorer body image. As it stands, up to 57 percent of adolescent girls \u2014 those between the ages of 9 and 11 \u2014 experiment with crash dieting, fasting, self-induced vomiting, diet pills, or laxatives.\n\nOf course, men are also subject to disordered eating. Separate studies have found nearly one in five boys is obsessive about their weight, suffering mainly in silence. UK researchers found that not only are disorders increasingly common in men, but they\u2019re also slower to recognize their symptoms, let alone seek help.\n\nBy putting the focus on these unknown realities, NEDA will advance the relevant and life-saving information, education resources, and avenues both men and women need to get help. It\u2019s a complex disorder, yes, but the single best thing friends and family can do for those they suspect are suffering is to intervene \u2014 the earlier, the better.\n\nThe Power Of Prevention\n\nSigns of disordered eating aren\u2019t always obvious, Health reported. Subtle insecurities, excessive exercise, and feeling shy or self-conscious about eating in public are all warning signs a loved one may have a problem.\n\nThere are physical symptoms, too, apart from dramatic weight loss. According to Health, \u201cpeople who have been depriving their bodies of nutrition for extended periods of time often develop soft, downy body hair \u2014 almost a thin film of fur \u2014 on their arms and other parts of the body.\u201d It's a symptom of starvation and the body's attempt at keeping itself warm, Dr. Cynthia M. Bulik, author of The Woman in the Mirror: How to Stop Confusing What You Look Like with Who You Are, told the magazine.\n\nThat said, feeling cold is another result of decreased nutrition and body fat. Though there\u2019s no clear-cut way to spot a developing eating disorder. Similarly, there\u2019s no right or wrong way to talk to someone experiencing one or more of these symptoms.\n\nAll you can do, as outlined by Australia\u2019s National Eating Disorders Collaboration, is prepare yourself with relevant news and information. Then you want to initiate a calm, open conversation in a comfortable and safe place. Using \u201cI\u201d statements, such as \u201cI care about you\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d can convey how much you want to help, and support, them through a potential problem. NEDA offers a few toolkits to make this conversation even easier; each toolkit is tailored to who is conducting the intervention, be it a parent, educator, coach, or trainer.\n\nEarly intervention can significantly reduce the risk of certain behaviors developing into a full-blown eating disorder, NEDA reported.\n\nA Little Help From Your Friends\n\nRecovering from an eating disorder is possible with the right support and resources, which usually means finding a therapist. Surprisingly, eating disorder specialists aren\u2019t immune to weight bias. One survey found 42 percent of professionals believed their obese patients weren\u2019t motivated to fix their diet, while 64 percent doubted whether patients stuck to their recommended treatment. What\u2019s worse is therapists were not above being condescending, judgmental, and plain unhelpful.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s best to probe your friends and family for recommendations. This is a sure-fire way to ensure the kind of environment you'll be subjected to. And as mentioned earlier, there are specialized facilities across the country dedicated to recovering eating disorder patients.\n\nOne such example is The Johns Hopkins Eating Disorders Program, a nationally recognized treatment center located in Baltimore. Whether friends or family who escort loved ones to a private or facility consultation, one thing is clear: the time is now.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "national, eating, disorders, awareness, week, 2015, importance, early, intervention", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "During the week of Feb. 22, the National Eating Disorders Association aims to educate people on the ways early intervention significantly increases recovery from disordered eating.", "title": "National Eating Disorders Awareness Week: Why An Early Intervention Is Crucial", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-eating-disorders-awareness-week-2015-importance-early-intervention-323090", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/eating-disorder-awareness.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "During the week of Feb. 22, the National Eating Disorders Association aims to educate people on the ways early intervention significantly increases recovery from disordered eating.", "title": "National Eating Disorders Awareness Week: Why An Early Intervention Is Crucial", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/national-eating-disorders-awareness-week-2015-importance-early-intervention-323090", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/eating-disorder-awareness.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/eating-disorder-awareness.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-22T10:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-23T10:36:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "During the week of Feb. 22, the National Eating Disorders Association aims to educate people on the ways early intervention significantly increases recovery from disordered eating."}, "article_summary": "That eating disorders aren\u2019t just a phase is one of the points the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) hopes to drive home during its annual week of awareness, Feb. 22 to Feb. 28.\nDuring the week of Feb. 22, the National Eating Disorders Association aims to educate people on the ways early intervention significantly increases recovery from disordered eating.\nAll you can do, as outlined by Australia\u2019s National Eating Disorders Collaboration, is prepare yourself with relevant news and information.\nEarly intervention can significantly reduce the risk of certain behaviors developing into a full-blown eating disorder, NEDA reported.\nOne such example is The Johns Hopkins Eating Disorders Program, a nationally recognized treatment center located in Baltimore."}
