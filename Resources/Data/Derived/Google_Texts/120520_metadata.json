Trump\u2019s alleged deal-making acumen is among his chief selling points on the campaign trail \u2013 we\u2019re all getting suckered on trade deals with Mexico and nuclear deals with Iran, but President Trump will come in, renegotiate everything, and extract every concession while giving up nothing in return. The famously gregarious Trump will also get along with everyone, even Vladimir Putin. There\u2019s going to be so much bonhomie, you won\u2019t believe it.\n\nThis prospect terrifies the GOP, Kilgore notes, because they don\u2019t want a dealmaker in the Oval Office. They want someone who will administer cleansing fire to the Obama administration\u2019s legacy. They want a president who will reflexively sign every experiment in trickle-down public policy that Paul Ryan can dream up. But Trump\u2019s campaign keeps talking about \u201cbipartisan\u201d solutions and the candidate himself keeps deviating from accepted conservative orthodoxy on critical issue areas \u2013 recall that he\u2019s the only Republican candidate who says he supports some form of government-assisted healthcare for the sick and the poor. Trump\u2019s politics are difficult to scrutinize, but he has little grounding in conservative thought and zero loyalty to the Republican establishment, which makes it likely that he\u2019d be open to straying from Republican orthodoxy.\n\nAnother interesting scenario to contemplate is how the Republicans might fare under the presidency of Trump\u2019s only viable Republican challenger: Ted Cruz. When it comes to cutting deals and making compromises, the Texas senator is Trump\u2019s opposite. Cruz will make no deals, he will accept no compromises, and he will make no effort to ingratiate himself to powerbrokers. This philosophy of his applies equally to both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 Cruz has spent healthy chunks of his time in the Senate blasting GOP leaders for being cowards who refuse to stand up for conservative principles. If he maintains this hardline stance as president, things could get a bit tricky for the GOP on domestic policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans worry that Donald Trump is too much of a dealmaker, but anti-compromise Ted Cruz could also be trouble", "title": "Pick your poison, GOP: Both President Trump or President Cruz could frustrate the hell out of Republicans", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans worry that Donald Trump is too much of a dealmaker, but anti-compromise Ted Cruz could also be trouble", "title": "Pick your poison, GOP: Both President Trump or President Cruz could frustrate the hell out of Republicans", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/11/pick_your_poison_gop_both_president_trump_or_president_cruz_could_frustrate_republicans/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/trump_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans worry that Donald Trump is too much of a dealmaker, but anti-compromise Ted Cruz could also be trouble", "title": "Pick your poison, GOP: Both President Trump or President Cruz could frustrate the hell out of Republicans", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/trump_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Affordable Care Act, Conservatives, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, healthcare, Healthcare Reform, Obamacare, Republicans, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If he maintains this hardline stance as president, things could get a bit tricky for the GOP on domestic policy.\nAnother interesting scenario to contemplate is how the Republicans might fare under the presidency of Trump\u2019s only viable Republican challenger: Ted Cruz.\nCruz will make no deals, he will accept no compromises, and he will make no effort to ingratiate himself to powerbrokers.\nThis philosophy of his applies equally to both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 Cruz has spent healthy chunks of his time in the Senate blasting GOP leaders for being cowards who refuse to stand up for conservative principles.\nThey want a president who will reflexively sign every experiment in trickle-down public policy that Paul Ryan can dream up."}
