WARSAW, IND. (WSAU) -- A former Wausau woman just may end up being elected to public office in two different states. Republican Pam Galloway was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 2010, but surprised many by resigning just 14 months later. The Senator and medical doctor left office to tend to family members with health issues right at the height of the Act 10 recall elections. Both her brother and her father-in-law needed her attention at that time. She was succeeded by current State Senator Jerry Petrowski.

Now Galloway is living in Warsaw, Indiana, in the northeastern part of the state. Galloway announced she will run for the state's 3rd District House of Representatives seat now held by Republican Marlin Stutzman. Stutzman announced Wednesday he will leave the House seat and run for U.S. Senate instead.

Galloway told the media this week she plans to work towards repealing Obamacare and protecting American's 2nd Amendment rights.
