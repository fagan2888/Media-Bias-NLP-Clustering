LITTLE ROCK — The state Insurance Department has approved rate changes for the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace for 2016 that range from a 7.15 percent increase to an 8.2 percent decrease, state Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Tuesday.

“I am proud to report that rate increases for health insurance have been held below 10 percent, unlike many other states which are looking at double-digit percentage price hikes,” Kerr said in a news release. “I thank the insurance providers who, working with the professional men and women of the Arkansas Insurance Department, were able to submit rate requests grounded in reality and fair for our citizens.”

The approved rate changes for 2016 are:

• Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield individual plans, an increase of 7.15 percent.

• Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield group plan, an increase of 3.01 percent.

• Celtic Insurance Company, or Ambetter, individual plans, an increase of 0.08 percent.

• QualChoice/QCA Health Plan individual plans, a decrease of 8.2 percent.

UnitedHealthcare will participate for the first time in the marketplace in 2016, so it has no previous rate.

Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Celtic, and QualChoice/QCA will offer products in all 75 Arkansas counties, but UnitedHealthcare will operate only in central Arkansas in 2016 before expanding to other areas the following year.

Because the rate changes for next year are below a 10 percent increase, and because Arkansas is deemed an “Effective Rate Review” state, the rate changes are locked in for 2016 under the federal Affordable Care Act, Kerr said.

The marketplace’s next open-enrollment period will be Nov. 1-Jan. 31. More information is available at insurance.arkansas.gov.
