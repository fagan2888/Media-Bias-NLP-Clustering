For most of us, news and reports of this national tragedy unfolded not on our familiar streets but on our TV screens, our cell phones, and the pages of social media.\n\nAnd so we watched, either on a large screen TV or a laptop, video footage of crowds throwing bricks at police and setting patrol cars on fire in the battle-weary St. Louis suburb. In shock, we observed reporters being hit by hurled stones and running from smoke during what should have been a peaceful demonstration to protest the decision of a grand jury which had chosen not to indict a white police officer, Darren Wilson, for the Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man. As police fired rounds of tear gas and bean bags directly into the crowd, we perused the reactions of our friends on Facebook and gleaned more information on Twitter about locals burning down buildings and looting stores.\n\nWhether today we feel upset, excited, angry, horrified, or anguished \u2014 whether or not issues of justice are foremost in our minds \u2014 many of us wonder about the influence of the media. Did the media play a role in inciting this riot?\n\nSince the media have long encouraged violence, destruction, some might say, is its natural consequence.\n\nPolice officers look over the site of a building that was burned in riots the previous night in Ferguson, November 25, 2014.

Strasburger, an expert on children and media at University of New Mexico School of Medicine. He believes media, which \u201chave become kind of electronic parents,\u201d are \u201cone of the most powerful influences on children and teens that we know of\u2026 and unfortunately underappreciated\u201d by most everyone. (In fact, most of us overestimate the effects of mass communication on everyone else while underestimating its possible effect on ourselves.)\n\nMore to the point, Strasburger supports the idea that the media creates \u201ca mean and scary world.\u201d Here, he is referring to an idea of George Gerbner, who coined the term \u201cmean world syndrome\u201d to describe how people who watch large amounts of TV are more likely to believe the world is a dangerous and frightening place. \u201cPeople over-estimate their risk of being mugged and killed,\u201d Strasburger explained. \u201cAnd people think violence is an acceptable solution\u201d for resolving conflicts. The mean world syndrome, then, would certainly help to explain the tendency to turn a demonstration into the mob violence seen in Ferguson.\n\n\u201cThere are media effects here \u2014 clearly we\u2019ve become a more violent society,\u201d Strasburger says to Medical Daily. \u201cAnd I think police are scared out of their wits that someone will pull a gun on them.\u201d\n\nWhat the Studies Say\n\nIn a recently published paper, he demonstrates the ways media can instil violence. He and his co-authors noted how \u201cthe average adolescent will have seen an estimated 200,000 acts of violence on television alone,\u201d by age 18. Meanwhile antisocial beliefs and behavior also are encouraged by interactive media like video games because of the violence they contain. In particular, professionals worry about games featuring first-person shooters. Chillingly, Strasburger and his co-authors evoke Michael Carneal, who shot eight teenagers during their morning prayer circle meeting in 1997.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the West Paducah, Ky., school shooting, it was discovered that the shooter had never fired a real gun in his life before that day, yet his marksmanship was both accurate and lethal,\u201d the co-authors wrote. Further, exposure to media violence can lead to anxiety, fear, and desensitization, resulting in increases of aggression and decreases of altruism. Meanwhile, how many teens play games or watch hours of violent TV alone in their bedrooms?\n\nToday we face the additional effects of the customized media we\u2019ve begun to create. Though media can never tell us what to think, it tells us what to think about... all the time. And now, not only do we interact with so-called mass media, but we also tailor our interactions with and information about the world through social media and other selective channels.\n\n\u201cYou can get a very skewed view [of the world],\u201d Strasburger tells Medical Daily. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know a lot about how people process the content they see on the Internet.\u201d While he supposes people might only \u201csearch for and like the content they agree with,\u201d it also might be possible that they learn from alternative points of view. The point is, nobody knows really what effects new media are having.\n\nProtesters run from a cloud of tear gas after a grand jury returned no indictment in the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, November 24, 2014. REUTERS\n\nMedia Dependency\n\n\u201cWe have a handful of studies on new media and they\u2019re mostly on cyberbullying and sexting,\u201d said Strasburger, who noted that the last time the National Institute of Mental Health issued a report on the impact of media on children and adolescents was in 1982, \u201cbefore the Internet and cell phones. We desperately need money on how newer media affect people, not just older media.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, he recommends parents not allow little children to watch the news, while teens might co-view the news with their parents who can use Ferguson \u2014 or any of the upcoming planned demonstrations \u2014 as an opportunity to discuss violence and racism and justice. In short, media can provide parents with valuable teachable moments.\n\nIn such a manner, Strasburger believes, some good can come of this national tragedy. However, his point remains: If a Super Bowl ad costs $4 million for 30 seconds, then wealthy advertisers believe even a small splash of media time is capable of swaying behavior. Why, then, would we vastly underestimate the long-term effects of a dependency \u2014 don't forget your electronic parent, especially when you're feeling confused \u2014 that began in our earliest childhood? It is simply \u201cunbelieveable,\u201d according to Strasburger, \u201cthat people don\u2019t appreciate how powerful the media can be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ferguson unrest, media, mass media", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "No matter how we feel about the violent aftermath following the Ferguson decision, it would be hard to argue against the influence of the media and its encouragement of a more violent society.", "title": "When It Comes To Violent Ferguson Protests, Media May Actually Be To Blame", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ferguson-unrest-how-media-consumption-may-have-influenced-violence-after-officer-312176", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/ferguson-unrest.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No matter how we feel about the violent aftermath following the Ferguson decision, it would be hard to argue against the influence of the media and its encouragement of a more violent society.", "title": "When It Comes To Violent Ferguson Protests, Media May Actually Be To Blame", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ferguson-unrest-how-media-consumption-may-have-influenced-violence-after-officer-312176", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/ferguson-unrest.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/ferguson-unrest.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-11-25T17:06:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-25T17:33:09-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "No matter how we feel about the violent aftermath following the Ferguson decision, it would be hard to argue against the influence of the media and its encouragement of a more violent society."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2de2\"", "article_summary": "Further, exposure to media violence can lead to anxiety, fear, and desensitization, resulting in increases of aggression and decreases of altruism.\n\u201cAnd people think violence is an acceptable solution\u201d for resolving conflicts.\n\u201cThere are media effects here \u2014 clearly we\u2019ve become a more violent society,\u201d Strasburger says to Medical Daily.\n\u201cYou can get a very skewed view [of the world],\u201d Strasburger tells Medical Daily.\nMeanwhile antisocial beliefs and behavior also are encouraged by interactive media like video games because of the violence they contain."}
