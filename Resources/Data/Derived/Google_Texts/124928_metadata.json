Behind the goal line. In the offensive zone.\n\n\u201cEvery time on the (sides), that belongs to the D,\u201d Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cThat\u2019s their responsibility. If the D goes down, the forward\u2019s going to come up, and that\u2019s exactly what happened on that play.\u201d\n\nBeauchemin threw the puck toward the net, and in the crease it caromed off the skate of the Islanders\u2019 Mikhail Grabovski and in for Beauchemin\u2019s second goal of the night \u2014 and it stood up as the game-winner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be there every game, but if I read that I can be first on the puck and make a play, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Beauchemin said Friday, looking back. \u201cEven though I\u2019m a defensive-minded defenseman, I still have the offense in me that I can read plays and make something happen.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hockey sense. When you know you can get there and do something, you just go. \u2026 We talk about getting our D\u2019s involved in the offensive zone too. That\u2019s one thing we practice every day, with our forwards backing us up.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche could have been, and should have been, more aggressive in bolstering its defense in free agency the past couple of offseasons. But the major signing there \u2014 of Beauchemin to a three-year contract worth $13.5 million \u2014 so far is working out.\n\nThere are a few asterisks: He\u2019s no gazelle, he\u2019s 35, and it\u2019s not out of line to argue that he would be more effective in a second pairing than in a first entrusted to be out against opposing top lines. But in this situation, the Avalanche doesn\u2019t have much choice, and he has been solid in developing a chemistry with Johnson.\n\nBeauchemin is averaging 24 minutes of ice time, which would be his highest figure since the 25 minutes he played per night for Anaheim in the 2011-12 season.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more I play, the better I feel.\u201d\n\nThe risk in signing unrestricted free agents in their mid-30s is that the winner at times has offered that \u201cextra\u201d or \u201cclinching\u201d year, extending the risk beyond money to commitment in a hard-cap sport. That\u2019s starting to be a concern for the Avs with Jarome Iginla, who has another season left on his three-year deal, and could with Beauchemin down the road. Understandably, Beauchemin doesn\u2019t think it will be an issue with him.\n\n\u201cBeing 35, I know that because of the way I play and my health, I have at least three more years,\u201d Beauchemin said. \u201cI keep telling E.J., \u2018It\u2019s up to you whether I play after that.\u2019 \u201c\n\nFootnote. Avalanche radio play-by-play man Marc Moser and game-night anthem singer Jake Schroeder do praiseworthy work helping escort World War II veterans to the sites of their service in Europe. Last week they were visited in Denver by Ralph Peeters, a remarkable Dutchman they have met in their travels. Peeters discovers, adopts and tells the stories of U.S. World War II casualties who are buried in the Netherlands. His website is storiesbeyondthegraves.com. I met Peeters when he came to an Avalanche skate at the Pepsi Center with Moser, but I couldn\u2019t get him to comment on the power play.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\n\u201c.500 hockey\u201d\n\nWhen: Whenever an NHL team, including the Avalanche, wins a game and gets back to having the same number in the first two columns of the standings \u2014 wins and losses \u2014 we\u2019re told the team has scratched and clawed back to \u201c.500.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s up: For about 18 reasons, that\u2019s ridiculous at worst and misleading at best, and anyone who goes along with it representing some kind of \u201cbreak-even\u201d point, or middle ground, has bought into one of the great myths of professional sports.\n\nBackground: Whether deliberately or inadvertently, the NHL and commissioner Gary Bettman came up with a standings system that makes everyone look as if they\u2019re doing better than they are. That\u2019s because some games are worth three points, some two, and a win in overtime or a shootout counts as a win and a loss in overtime or a shootout still is worth a point to the loser \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t show up in the \u201cL\u201d column. Percentages don\u2019t show up in the points-based standings at all, so going along with the \u201c.500\u201d myth requires gullibility in accepting the NHL propaganda.\n\nFrei\u2019s take: You think 37-37-8 is \u201c.500\u201d? Something to crow about because a team has attained half its maximum points possible? If that\u2019s .500, 24 of the 30 teams in the NHL were above \u201c.500\u201d last season because they had more wins than losses. For heaven\u2019s sake, the Avalanche had an awful season, but its record was 39-31-12 \u2014 well above, ahem, \u201c.500.\u201d The point is, because of those three-point games, the NHL average, or the true break-even point, is about 92 points in a season \u2014 or a little more than 1.1 points per game. The solution is to just scoff at all references to \u201c.500 hockey,\u201d until nobody is insulting enough to try to foist them on us.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Francois Beauchemin likes being on the move", "title": "Frei: Francois Beauchemin likes being on the move", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/19/frei-francois-beauchemin-likes-being-on-the-move/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-19T19:16:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "If that\u2019s .500, 24 of the 30 teams in the NHL were above \u201c.500\u201d last season because they had more wins than losses.\nColorado defenseman Francois Beauchemin, charged with being the responsible stay-at-home blueliner when partner Erik Johnson joins or even leads the rush, chased down the puck.\nBut the major signing there \u2014 of Beauchemin to a three-year contract worth $13.5 million \u2014 so far is working out.\nLast week they were visited in Denver by Ralph Peeters, a remarkable Dutchman they have met in their travels.\n\u201cBeing 35, I know that because of the way I play and my health, I have at least three more years,\u201d Beauchemin said."}
